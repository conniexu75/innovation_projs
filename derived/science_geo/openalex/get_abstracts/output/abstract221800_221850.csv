Here we report that DJ-1 is a dimeric protein that exhibits protease activity but no chaperone activity. The protease activity was abolished by mutation of Cys-106 to Ala, suggesting that DJ-1 functions as a cysteine protease. Our studies revealed that the Parkinson's disease-linked L166P mutation impaired the intrinsic folding propensity of DJ-1 protein, resulting in a spontaneously unfolded structure that was incapable of forming a homodimer with itself or a heterodimer with wild-type DJ-1. Correlating with the disruption of DJ-1 structure, the L166P mutation abolished the catalytic function of DJ-1. Furthermore, as a result of protein misfolding, the L166P mutant DJ-1 was selectively polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Together these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism by which loss-of-function mutations in DJ-1 lead to Parkinson's disease.

Med. 1998; 339: 1130-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Although PD has been known for nearly 2 centuries, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD is not understood, and currently there is no treatment to stop the progression of this devastating disease. Recent evidence indicates that at least 10 distinct genetic loci, PARK1-PARK10, are linked to familial forms of PD (3Gwinn-Hardy K. Mov. Disord. 2002; 17: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The responsible genes for three of these loci, PARK1, PARK2, and PARK5, were found to encode α-synuclein (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6111) Google Scholar), parkin (6Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (7Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J.

Studies of these familial PD gene products have generated valuable insights into PD pathogenesis and led to the hypothesis that dysfunction in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be a common mechanism leading to neurodegeneration in PD (8McNaught K.S.

Recently it was reported that mutations in DJ-1 underlie the PARK7 loci for an autosomal recessive, early onset form of familial PD (10Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). To date, three PD-linked DJ-1 mutations have been identified: a homozygous 14-kb deletion (10Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar) and a compound heterozygous mutation (11Hague S. Rogaeva E. Hernandez D. Gulick C. Singleton A. Hanson M. Johnson J. Weiser R. Gallardo M. Ravina B. Gwinn-Hardy K. Crawley A. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Lang A.E. Heutink P. Bonifati V. Hardy J. Wilson M.A. Collins J.L. Hod Y. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), both of which result in the loss of DJ-1 protein, and a homozygous missense mutation (L166P) that replaces Leu-166 with a proline in the DJ-1 protein (10Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). The complete cosegregation of these mutations with the PD allele suggests that loss of the normal function of DJ-1 causes this recessively transmitted PD (10Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). DJ-1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein initially identified as an oncogene with transforming activity (12Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). A connection to cancer is also suggested by the identification of DJ-1 as a circulating tumor antigen in breast cancer (13Le Naour F. Misek D.E. Krause M.C. Deneux L. Giordano T.J. Scholl S. Hanash S.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3328-3335PubMed Google Scholar). Human DJ-1 was independently described as RS, a regulatory subunit of a ∼400-kDa RNA-binding protein complex (14Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 72: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Rat DJ-1, also known as CAP-1 (15Wagenfeld A. Gromoll J. Cooper T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and SP22 (16Welch J.E. Barbee R.R. Roberts N.L. Suarez J.D. Klinefelter G.R. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 385-393PubMed Google Scholar), has been linked to male infertility induced by exposure to sperm toxicants (17Klinefelter G.R. Laskey J.W. Ferrell J. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 139-150PubMed Google Scholar, 18Klinefelter G.R. Welch J.E. Perreault S.D. Moore H.D. Zucker R.M. Suarez J.D. Roberts N.L. Bobseine K. Jeffay S. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DJ-1 appears to regulate androgen receptor-mediated gene transcription via its interaction with PIASxα (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) and DJ-1-binding protein (19Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Niki T. Takahashi-Niki K. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 247-261PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DJ-1 has been proposed to participate in the cellular defense against oxidative stress since it undergoes a pI shift from 6.2 to 5.8 upon treatment of cells with H2O2 or paraquat (21Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Despite these observations implicating DJ-1 in multiple cellular processes, the precise biochemical function of DJ-1 remains unknown. DJ-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, 189-amino acid protein that exhibits significant sequence homology with the PfpI family of intracellular proteases (23Halio S.B. Blumentals I.I. Short S.A. Merrill B.M. Kelly R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with the ThiJ family of bacterial proteins involved in thiamin synthesis (24Mizote T. Tsuda M. Smith D.D. Nakayama H. Nakazawa T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We and other groups have recently solved the crystal structure of human DJ-1, which shows that DJ-1 adopts a helix-strand-helix sandwich structure similar to the bacterial protease PH1704 and Escherichia coli chaperone protein Hsp31 (25Huai Q. Sun Y. Wang H. Chin L.S. Li L. Robinson H. Ke H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Tao X. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31372-31379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Wilson M.A. Collins J.L. Hod Y. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9256-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 28Honbou K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Niki T. Taira T. Ariga H. Inagaki F. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44552-44559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether DJ-1 has a protease or chaperone function because the Cys-His-(Glu/Asp) catalytic triad and the quaternary structure of PH1704 and Hsp31 are not conserved in DJ-1. Furthermore the structural and functional consequences of the PD-associated L166P mutation remain to be defined. In the present study, we undertook the characterization of the molecular and biochemical properties of DJ-1 and investigated how the structure and function of DJ-1 are altered by the disease-linked L166P mutation. DJ-1 Expression Constructs—The DJ-1 cDNA corresponding to the entire coding region of human DJ-1 (12Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR. The L166P and C106A single and double mutant cDNAs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR overlap extension method (30Li L. Schuchard M. Palma A. Pradier L. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1990; 29: 5428-5436Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were analyzed on both strands by DNA sequencing to ensure there were no unwanted changes in the codons. The wild-type and mutant DJ-1 cDNAs were then used to make the following expression vectors: pCHA-DJ-1, pMyc-DJ-1, pGFP-DJ-1, and the corresponding L166P and C106A mutant forms, which allow the expression of amino-terminally HA-, Myc-, or GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant DJ-1 proteins in mammalian cells. All expression constructs were sequenced to confirm that the fusion was in the correct reading frame. Antibodies—Two distinct rabbit polyclonal anti-DJ-1 antibodies, P7F and P7C, were generated against purified full-length recombinant human DJ-1 protein and a synthetic human DJ-1 carboxyl-terminal peptide ALNGKEVAAQVKAPLVLKD, respectively, using the same procedures as described previously (31Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study include the following: anti-HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science; HA.11, Covance), anti-Myc (9E10.3, Neomarkers), anti-actin (C4, Chemicon); and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Immunohistochemistry—Rats were perfused transcardially with 3% paraformaldehyde, and brain sections were cut at 50-μm thickness and stored in cryoprotectant until use. Sections were rinsed in phosphate buffer and pretreated for 1 h in a solution containing 8% goat serum, 10 μg/ml avidin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.9% NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Sections were then incubated for 48 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-DJ1 antibody P7F or P7C at 1:2000 followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was visualized using the standard avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex method (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). For controls, sections were processed in parallel with primary antibody omitted or with excess amount of immunogens. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant DJ-1 were expressed in BL21 E. coli cells as untagged proteins (25Huai Q. Sun Y. Wang H. Chin L.S. Li L. Robinson H. Ke H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Li Y. Chin L.S. Weigel C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40824-40833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sepharose Q XL ion exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration chromatography. Fractions containing DJ-1 were identified with SDS-PAGE and pooled for further studies. Protein concentration was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified wild-type or L166P mutant DJ-1 protein (1 ml at 10 mg/ml) was loaded on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 high-resolution column and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography using an ΔKTAprime chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted at 4 °C using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated under identical running conditions with protein standards (Sigma), including blue dextran (2000 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). CD Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV model 62DS CD spectrometer and a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 or 1 cm. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 250 to 200 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and an average of 10 scans was obtained. CD measurements were performed with purified, untagged wild-type or mutant DJ-1 proteins at a final concentration of 2-35 μm in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl. Mean residue ellipticity is defined as the observed ellipticity normalized by the molar concentration of amino acid residues in the indicated protein. Thermal denaturation was studied by measuring far UV CD in 1-cm cuvette at 222 nm while the temperature was increased from 5 °C to 90 °C with a step size of 2 °C. Melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which 50% of the α-helical structure (measured by ellipticity at 222 nm) is denatured. Reversibility of thermal denaturation was assessed in the same cuvette at 222 nm while the temperature was cooled from 90 °C to 5 °C with a step decrease of 2 °C. Chaperone Activity Assay—The potential chaperone function of DJ-1 was investigated by using a well established chaperone assay that measures the ability of a molecular chaperone to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase (33Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To induce aggregation, 45 μm porcine heart citrate synthase (Sigma) was diluted 1:300 in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 at 43 °C in the presence and absence of wild-type or mutant DJ-1. To monitor the kinetics of thermal aggregation, light scattering was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 luminescence spectrometer in a stirred and thermostatted quartz cell. Both the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 500 nm with a slit width of 2.5 nm. Recombinant murine heat shock protein Hsp25 (Stressgen) was used as a positive control for the chaperone assay. Protease Activity Assays—Protease activity of DJ-1 and its mutants was measured by an in-gel protease assay and a continuous fluorescence-based protease assay. The in-gel protease assay was carried out as described previously for determining the protease activity of the PfpI family of proteases (34Blumentals I.I. Robinson A.S. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Du X. Choi I.G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type or mutant DJ-1 protein (1-100 μg) was electrophoresed onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% co-polymerized gelatin under non-reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.7% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize zones of gelatin hydrolysis. The fluorescence-based protease assays were performed as described previously (36Jones L.J. Upson R.H. Haugland R.P. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Zhou M. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by using the EnzCheck protease assay kit (Molecular Probes). Purified wild-type or mutant DJ-1 (1-50 μm) was incubated with BODIPY FL-labeled casein (10 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. An increase in fluorescence upon protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of BODIPY FL-casein was monitored continuously in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 luminescence spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 505 nm and emission wavelength of 513 nm. Kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were obtained as described previously (37Batra R. Khayat R. Tong L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by fitting the data to the following equation: v = kcat [S]0/(1 + Km[E]-1). Trypsin (Athena Environmental Sciences, Inc.) was used as a positive control for both in-gel and fluorescence-based protease assays. Cell Transfections and Immunoprecipitations—HeLa or SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants were isolated in selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and ∼300 colonies were pooled for further studies. Cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (38Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) using anti-HA antibody (3F10). The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). After extensive washes, the immunocomplexes were dissociated by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteolysis Inhibitor Treatment of Cells—HeLa or SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild-type or L166P mutant DJ-1 were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm, Calbiochem), the lysosomal protease inhibitor chloroquine (100 μm, Sigma), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); final concentration, 0.1%). Cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of proteins from each lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting for HA-tagged DJ-1 and actin. The relative level of wild-type or mutant DJ-1 was quantified by using the NIH Image program and normalized against the level of actin. Statistical analyses were performed by the unpaired Student's t test. Ubiquitination Assays—In vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (39Wheeler T.C. Chin L.S. Li Y. Roudabush F.L. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10273-10282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 40Chin L.-S. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35071-35079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-myc-ubiquitin in combination with pCHA-DJ-1 or pCHA-L166P. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 8 h with vehicle control (0.1% Me2SO) or proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm in Me2SO). The cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of proteins from each lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody to detect Myc-ubiquitin conjugated to wild-type or L166P mutant DJ-1. [35S]Methionine Pulse-Chase Experiments—Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (39Wheeler T.C. Chin L.S. Li Y. Roudabush F.L. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10273-10282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 40Chin L.-S. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35071-35079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with pCHA-DJ-1 or pCHA-L166P were labeled by incubation for 1 h with Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (1000 Ci/mmol) express protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After extensive washes, cells were incubated for the indicated chase time in non-radioactive Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 times the normal concentration of methionine and cysteine. Cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of proteins from each lysate was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Anti-DJ-1 Antibodies and Characterization of DJ-1 Protein Expression—The expression and localization of DJ-1 protein are poorly characterized, and virtually nothing is presently known about the distribution of DJ-1 protein in the nervous system. For characterization of DJ-1 at the protein level, we generated two distinct rabbit polyclonal anti-DJ-1 antibodies, P7F and P7C, against purified full-length recombinant protein and a carboxyl-terminal peptide of human DJ-1, respectively. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both anti-DJ-1 antibodies, but not their corresponding preimmune controls, recognized the 20-kDa endogenous DJ-1 protein as well as recombinant DJ-1 protein expressed in bacteria and mammalian cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Preabsorption of the P7F and P7C antibodies with purified recombinant DJ-1 protein completely eliminated their immunoreactivity to the recombinant as well as endogenous DJ-1 protein (data not shown), confirming the specificity of these antibodies. The lower molecular weight bands in the recombinant DJ-1 lanes are likely to be the proteolytic products of DJ-1 because they varied from blot to blot, and none of these bands were detected when the blots were analyzed with anti-DJ-1 antibodies preabsorbed with DJ-1 immunogens. Using these anti-DJ-1 antibodies, we demonstrated that DJ-1 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested with high expression levels in brain, testis, and kidney (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the expression of DJ-1 in brain, various brain regions were dissected from adult rats and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-DJ-1 antibodies. For comparison, we also analyzed the same samples with antibodies against parkin and α-synuclein. The result shows that these three PD-associated proteins are widely expressed throughout the brain with distinct distribution patterns (Fig. 1C). DJ-1 exhibits relatively higher protein expression levels in brain regions that are affected in Parkinson's disease, such as the substantia nigra or ventral midbrain area, compared with the levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortical regions. Immunolocalization of DJ-1 Protein in Rat Brain—We then used these anti-DJ-1 antibodies to determine the cellular distribution of DJ-1 protein in rat brain by immunohistochemistry. Consistent with the results of Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C), intense DJ-1 immunostaining was observed in the substantia nigra (Fig. 2E). Nearly all neurons, including dopaminergic neurons, in the pars compacta and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra contained DJ-1 immunoreactivity in their nuclei, perikarya, and processes. In the striatum, large interneurons were intensely stained for DJ-1, whereas the medium spiny neurons were moderately well stained (Fig. 2D). In addition to the nigral-striatal system, DJ-1 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in many neurons throughout the brain. In the cerebral cortex, layer V pyramidal cells were prominently stained in addition to moderately stained neurons in all lamina and in all cortical regions (Fig. 2, A and B). Intense DJ-1 immunostaining was present in the islands of Calleja, the diagonal band of Broca, piriform cortex, and septum. In the hippocampus, immunoreactivity was much greater in interneurons than in dentate gyrus granule cells (Fig. 2F). Neuronal labeling was also prominent in the entopeduncular and subthalamic nuclei, globus pallidus, and the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei (Fig. 2C); throughout the thalamus (Fig. 2C); in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (Fig. 2G); and in magnocellular neurons of the red nucleus (Fig. 2H). In the cerebellum, there was strong immunoreactivity in Purkinje cells but not in granule cells (Fig. 2I). In brain stem, the motor nuclei of the oculomotor, trigeminal, and facial nerves and the nucleus ambiguus were intensely stained. Within labeled neurons, DJ-1 immunostaining was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm, including neuronal processes and neuropil. Prominent immunoreactive axons and dendrites were often seen extending over distances greater than 1 mm from the soma. In addition to neurons, DJ-1 immunostaining was also present in oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and cells of the pia mater, ventricular ependyma, and vascular endothelium, although these non-neuronal cells were weakly labeled. Similar staining patterns were obtained with two different anti-DJ-1 antibodies, P7F and P7C, indicating that the observed DJ-1 immunostaining is specific. The specificity of DJ-1 immunoreactivity was further confirmed by preabsorption experiments and in controls where anti-DJ-1 primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). L166P Mutation Causes DJ-1 Protein to Unfold into a “Random Coil” Structure—To investigate structural consequences of PD-linked L166P mutation, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to study the secondary structure of DJ-1 and its mutant proteins (Fig. 3A). At physiological pH, wild-type DJ-1 protein showed a CD spectrum with maximal negative ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm, indicating a substantial amount of α-helical content in the solution structure of DJ-1. Since the crystal structure of DJ-1 suggests that the highly conserved cysteine residue at position 106 may play a key role in DJ-1 catalytic function (25Huai Q. Sun Y. Wang H. Chin L.S. Li L.

The CD spectrum of the C106A mutant was virtually indistinguishable from that of wild-type DJ-1, indicating that the C106A mutation has no effect on the DJ-1 structure. In contrast, the L166P mutant DJ-1 protein exhibited a very different CD spectrum, showing large negative ellipticity at ∼200 nm and small negative values in the 210-230-nm region. This CD spectrum indicates that the L166P mutant contains high content of random coil or unfolded structure and relatively little α-helical structure. To assess the structural stability of DJ-1 and its mutants, we performed thermal denaturation experiments"

In bacteria and archaea the Amt structural genes (amtB) are invariably linked to glnK, which encodes a member of the PII signal transduction protein family, proteins that regulate many facets of nitrogen metabolism. We have now shown that Escherichia coli AmtB is inactivated by formation of a membrane-bound complex with GlnK. Complex formation is reversible and occurs within seconds in response to micromolar changes in the extracellular ammonium concentration. Regulation is mediated by the uridylylation/deuridylylation of GlnK in direct response to fluctuations in the intracellular glutamine pool. Furthermore under physiological conditions AmtB activity is required for GlnK deuridylylation. Hence the transporter is an integral part of the signal transduction cascade, and AmtB can be formally considered to act as an ammonium sensor. This system provides an exquisitely sensitive mechanism to control ammonium flux into the cell, and the conservation of glnK linkage to amtB suggests that this regulatory mechanism may occur throughout prokaryotes.

The movement of ammonium across biological membranes is an important process in nearly all organisms from bacteria to man, and it is effected by a family of integral membrane proteins that is conserved throughout all domains of life (1van Dommelen A. de Mot R.

The ammonium transporter (Amt) 1The abbreviations used are: Amt, ammonium transporter; GS, glutamine synthetase; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Ntr, nitrogen regulation. protein family comprises the Amt/Mep proteins, found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants, and the Rhesus proteins, which are found in animals from nematodes to man. The Amt/Mep proteins have a conserved core of 11 transmembrane helices with the C terminus always being intracellular (3Thomas G.H. Mullins J.G. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Marini A.-M. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 552-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They are typically 400–450 amino acids in length, although in some cases the C-terminal region is considerably extended, increasing their length to well over 500 residues, e.g. Caenorhabditis elegans Amt3 and Synechocystsis Amt3. Purified Escherichia coli AmtB protein is a trimer, but the precise oligomeric status of Amt proteins from fungi and plants is not yet established (4Marini A.-M. Andre B. Mol.

Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Almost all bacteria and archaea encode at least one Amt protein, and with very few exceptions, the structural gene (amtB) is linked genetically to a second gene (glnK) that encodes a small signal transduction protein (10Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). GlnK is a member of the PII protein family, a group of trimeric proteins that act as sensors of the cellular nitrogen status in prokaryotes and that have also been identified in plants (11Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). They form a compact barrel around 50 Å in diameter and 30 Å high with a relatively unstructured loop (the T-loop) protruding from the upper surface (12Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Residue Tyr-51, at the apex of the T-loop, is covalently modified by uridylylation in cells that are subject to nitrogen starvation, and the process is reversed in nitrogen sufficiency (13Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The PII proteins have been shown to regulate the activities of a variety of other cytoplasmic proteins, both enzymes and transcription factors, by protein-protein interaction (11Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). E. coli encodes two PII proteins, GlnK and GlnB. In those cases where it has been analyzed the glnK and amtB genes have been shown to form an operon. This transcriptional linkage led us to propose that the GlnK and AmtB proteins might physically interact to effect regulation of AmtB activity (10Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that in E. coli and Azotobacter vinelandii GlnK is sequestered to the membrane in an AmtB-dependent fashion and that membrane binding of GlnK is modulated according to the cellular nitrogen status, being greatest in nitrogen-sufficient conditions (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data suggested that GlnK bound to AmtB when the cellular nitrogen status reached a certain level, so as to inhibit further ammonium transport. In this paper we now demonstrate that the two proteins do indeed form a complex. To be of physiological significance the model required that GlnK binding to AmtB should be sensitive, rapid, and reversible. We now report experiments that confirm all three of these properties. We also show that AmtB plays an active part in this process such that at physiologically relevant levels of ammonium sufficiency (around 50 μm) the transporter must be active to elicit GlnK deuridylylation and consequent sequestration. Hence the transporter is an integral part of the signal transduction cascade, and AmtB can be formally considered to act as an ammonium sensor. The GlnK/AmtB system constitutes an exquisitely sensitive mechanism that allows the cell to regulate ammonium transport activity in precise accord with the metabolic need for ammonium. This report is the first demonstration of post-translational regulation of the activity of an Amt protein. We suggest that the need to regulate Amt protein activity is likely to apply in all organisms, and hence it is possible that eukaryotic Amt or Rhesus proteins may also be regulated by interaction with intracellular signal proteins. Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I. E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria medium, and for nitrogen-limited growth an M9 medium (M9Gln) was used in which ammonium was replaced by 200 μg/ml glutamine. The carbon source was 0.2% glucose or 0.4% glycerol plus 0.05% arabinose when working with pBAD plasmids (15Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). Ammonium shock was achieved by the addition of NH4Cl or [15N]NH4Cl (98 + % atom 15N, Sigma-Aldrich) at the times and concentrations indicated. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin 100 μg/ml, chloramphenicol 30 μg/ml.Table IE. coli strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain/plasmidGenotype or phenotypeRef./sourceE. coli strainsET8000rbs lacZ::IS gyrA hutCk(42Jayakumar A.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pAJ1002 was derived in two steps. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding glnKamtB1 from pGC2 was cloned into pUC9 to give pAJ1001, and the EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pAJ1001 was then cloned into EcoRI/HindIII-cut pBAD18 (15Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) to give pAJ1002. To construct pAJ1004 the EcoRV-BstEII fragment carrying glnKY51F (glnK11) from pTA43 was cloned into EcoRV/BstEII-cut pAJ1001 giving pAJ1003, and the SphI-BstXI fragment from pAJ1003 was cloned into SphI/BstXI-cut pAJ1002 to give pAJ1004. pGT104 contains the complete glnKamtB7 operon cloned in pUC19. The amtB7 allele is a derivative of amtB3 from pMM285 in which the centrally encoded NdeI site has been removed by site-directed mutagenesis. pJT1 contains only glnK and the glnK-amtB intergenic region with a new NdeI restriction site encompassing the intiation codon of amtB. PCR was performed with pGC1 as template and using two oligonucleotides: 5′-CTATGAAGCTGGTGACCGTGAT-3′ (BstEII site underlined) and 5′-GCGGATCCTATCTTCATATGTCGTTCC-3′ (BamHI and NdeI sites underlined). The PCR fragment was cloned into BstEII-BamHI-cut pGC1 to give pJT1. To construct pJT5, first the NdeI-BamHI from pJT1 was replaced by the NdeI-BamHI fragment from pGT104 to give pJT3. Second, the linker sequence (HindIII, EcoRV, EcoRI, PstI), which originates from pGT11 (5Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is located upstream of the glnK promoter in pJT3, was removed and replaced by a shorter linker (HindIII, SnaBI) to give pJT5. The linker was produced by annealing 5′-AGCTTTACGTAGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CTACGTA-3′. pJT6 was derived from pJT5 by adding a PstI site located over the codon for Ala25 of AmtB. This was performed by “overlap PCR,” generating two overlapping mutated fragments and in a second PCR reaction the full-length mutated sequence. The two “cloning” oligonucleotides were 5′-CAGGAACGACATATGAAGATAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCGCCAGCGAGCTGGCGGCAAAAATCC-3′ (NdeI and BstXI sites underlined). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-GTAATGGCTGCACCTGCAGTGGCCGATAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATCGGCCACTGCAGGTGCAGCCATTAC-3′ (mutagenic bases in bold, PstI site underlined). The template was pJT5, and after digestion with NdeI and BstXI, the mutated fragment was cloned into NdeI–BstXI-cut pJT5 to give pJT6. To construct pESV2, first the DraI fragment from pSU18 (16Bartolome B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. de la Cruz F. Gene. 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) replaced the equivalent fragment in pACYC184 to obtain an “EcoRI-free” version of the vector, designated pESV0. Second, the glnKamtB8 HindIII-BamHI fragment from pJT5 was subcloned into pESV0 to give pESV1. Third, glnK was removed from pESV1 by replacing the EcoRI-NdeI fragment with a 16 bp linker containing the amtB Shine Dalgarno sequence. The linker was produced by annealing 5′-AATTCTGACCGGAGGGGACA-3′ and 5′-TATGTCCCCTCCGGTCAG-3′. Mutagenesis of AmtB was performed by overlap PCR using pJT6 as template. The cloning oligonucleotides were (forward) 5′-GCGCTGCAGTGGCCGATAAAGCC GACAATGCGT-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGCGCCAGCGAGCTGGCGGCAAAAATCC-3′ (PstI and BstXI sites underlined). For D182E the mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-TCACACGGTGCGCTGGAATTCGCGGGTGTACC-3′ (mutagenic bases in bold, DraIII site underlined) and 5′-GGTACCACCCGCGAATTCCAGCGCACCGTGTGA-3′ (KpnI site underlined). The DraIII and KpnI sites allowed rapid preliminary screening for the new point mutation. The new restriction sites introduce silent mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence. After digestion with PstI and BstXI, the mutated fragment was cloned into pJT6 to give pAJ2004 carrying amtB10. The His6 tag was removed by replacing the PvuI-BamHI from pAJ2004 by the PvuI-BamHI fragment from pAJ1001 to give pAJ2006 carrying amtB11. The D182A mutant was constructed using the forward “cloning” and the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CACGGTACCACCCGCGAAAGCCAGCGCACCGTGTGA-3′ (KpnI site underlined). After digestion with PstI and KpnI, the mutated fragment was cloned into pAJ2006 to give pAJ2008 carrying amtB12. In vivo [14C]Methylamine Transport Assays—These were performed as described previously using cells grown in M9Gln medium (3Thomas G.H. Mullins J.G. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Jack R. de Zamaroczy M. Merrick M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]methylamine hydrochloride (2.15 Gbq/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Fractionation—Cells were fractionated according to the procedures described previously (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and membrane fractions were always subjected to two high salt (600 mm NaCl) washes prior to analysis. In Vivo Interaction between AmtB and GlnK—A 1-ml aliquot of membrane extract was prepared from 250 ml of culture grown in M9Gln and subjected to an ammonium shock by the addition of NH4Cl to a final concentration of 30 mm for 15 min. AmtB6H and GlnK were co-purified from the membrane extract using His Mag™ Agarose Beads (Novagen). The binding buffer used was 60 mm CaCl2, 40 mm K2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8. The imidazole concentration was 15 mm in the wash buffer and 500 mm in the elution buffer. Protein Purification—GlnK from E. coli was purified as described previously (18van Heeswijk W.C. Hoving S. Molenaar D. Stegeman B. Kahn D. Westerhoff H.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50% v/v glycerol, pH 7.6. E. coli AmtB was purified as described previously (5Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and used to raise polyclonal anti-rabbit antibodies. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Proteins were reacted with an appropriate antibody: anti-PII antibody, raised against purified E. coli GlnB protein but also cross-reactive against E. coli GlnK (18van Heeswijk W.C. Hoving S. Molenaar D. Stegeman B. Kahn D. Westerhoff H.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); anti-E. coli GlnK and anti-E. coli GlnB antibodies (19Forchhammer K.

Amino Acid Extraction and Analysis—Amino acids were extracted twice from 2 ml of overnight culture using cold methanol, which prevents metabolic depletion of the glutamine pools (21Maharjan R.P. Ferenci T. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 313: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The GC/MS analysis was performed as described previously (22Javelle A. Morel M. Rodriguez-Pastrana B.R. Botton B. Andre B. Marini A.M. Brun A. Chalot M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 411-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The data quoted for each extraction are the means of four independent analyses. Evidence for in Vivo Complex Formation between GlnK and AmtB—The highly conserved genetic linkage between the glnK and amtB genes in both eubacteria and archaea (10Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the demonstration of AmtB-dependent membrane sequestration of GlnK after an “ammonium shock” led us to propose that GlnK interacts physically with AmtB to regulate the activity of the transporter (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To investigate the proposed interaction, membrane fractions were prepared from cells grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions and then subjected to an ammonium shock with 30 mm NH4Cl for 15 min (subsequently referred to as “high” ammonium shock). The strains used were ET8000 (wild type), GT1001 (glnK+ ΔamtB), GT1000 (ΔglnKΔamtB), and GT1000 carrying pESV2 (amtB8) or pJT6 (glnK amtB9). Both amtB8 and amtB9 encode C-terminally His6-tagged AmtB (AmtB6H). The extracts were incubated with His-Mag™ agarose beads and washed extensively, and then the bound proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole buffer. The protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting using specific anti-GlnK and anti-His antibodies. No signals were detected in the 15 mm imidazole wash using either antibody (data not shown). As expected AmtB6H was detected only in extracts from strains carrying amtB8 or amtB9 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). As previously shown (5Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) AmtB is predominantly detected as a trimer with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa; the monomer (30 kDa) is a minor species. GlnK was detected only in the eluate when AmtB6H was co-expressed (Fig. 1B, lane 6) and no GlnK was found in eluates from wild type or glnK+ΔamtB cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3) indicating that GlnK itself has no ability to interact with the beads. This result was also confirmed using purified GlnK (data not shown). Co-purification of AmtB6H and GlnK from GT1000(pJT6) extracts was also demonstrated using Ni2+ affinity chromatography (data not shown). These results confirm that AmtB interacts with GlnK in vivo. Western blot analysis of the ΔglnK strain GT1000(pESV2) using anti-PII instead of anti-GlnK antibodies showed that GlnB can interact with AmtB when GlnK is absent. However, using protein-specific antibodies to estimate the relative amounts of GlnK and GlnB, we have shown that in nitrogen-limited cells the intracellular levels of GlnK are at least 500-fold greater than those of GlnB. 2A. Javelle and M. Merrick, unpublished data. Consequently we consider that in wild type cells GlnB will show little, if any, interaction with AmtB. Sequestration of GlnK by AmtB Is Rapid and Responds to μm Ammonium Concentrations—We have demonstrated that GlnK interacts with AmtB in response to elevation of the extracellular ammonium concentration to 30 mm for a period of 15 min. However, given that the Km of AmtB for ammonium is around 10 μm (23Kleiner D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 32: 87-100Crossref Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the role of GlnK is to regulate AmtB such that it is only active when the extracellular ammonium concentration is in the low μm range. In this case we would expect that GlnK sequestration by AmtB should occur in response to a relatively “low” ammonium shock. To provide the necessary fine-tuning of AmtB activity the response should also be rapid. We therefore used the wild type strain ET8000 to examine the speed and sensitivity of the process. Cells were grown in M9Gln and then subjected to ammonium shock at a range of concentrations. Samples were taken prior to the addition of ammonium and after just 30 s of exposure to ammonium; all were frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen. We monitored whole cells, cytoplasm, and membrane fractions for the presence of GlnK by Western blots. There was a very significant increase in the amount of GlnK associated with the membrane after a 50 μm NH4+ shock, in contrast to a 5 μm NH4+ shock (Fig. 2). These experiments confirm that GlnK sequestration by AmtB is extremely rapid and is sensitive to μm concentrations of ammonium. Sequestration of GlnK by AmtB Is Reversible—The PII family of signal transduction proteins are characterized by their ability to regulate the activities of other proteins by protein-protein interaction in a reversible manner (11Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Consequently we wished to determine whether binding of GlnK to AmtB was also reversible. As previously described, wild type (ET8000) cells were grown in M9Gln and then subjected to a high ammonium shock; they were washed and then resuspended in a medium without any nitrogen source. In parallel, to confirm that the washing step itself had no effect on GlnK-AmtB association, a control was used in which the cells were washed and resuspended in a medium without any nitrogen source before the high ammonium shock. After each treatment cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and the sequestration of GlnK by AmtB was again examined by Western blotting. When the ammonium shock was followed by a washing step to remove the nitrogen source rapidly, there was a very significant decrease in the amount of GlnK associated with the membrane, and GlnK was relocalized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Controls showed that the wash itself had no effect and that after a second ammonium shock GlnK was relocalized to the membrane (Fig. 3). Consequently it is clear that the process is rapidly reversible and responds to the nitrogen source. Binding of GlnK to AmtB Is Dependent on Its Uridylylation State—As GlnK is a trimer, the protein can exist in four states depending upon the number of subunits that are uridylylated. Ammonium shock causes deuridylylation of GlnK, and the uridylylation states of GlnK trimers can be assessed on native polyacrylamide gels (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We previously reported that membrane association of GlnK reflects the uridylylation state of the protein (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that the uridylylation state of GlnK should govern its binding to AmtB. We therefore examined localization of GlnK in cells expressing a variant of the protein, which cannot be uridylylated. GlnK is uridylylated on residue Tyr-51 at the apex of the T-loop (24Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 431-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and we therefore constructed a Y51F variant of GlnK (encoded by glnK11) and expressed both a glnK11amtB (on pAJ1004) and a glnKamtB (on pAJ1002) operon in the ΔglnKΔamtB strain (GT1000) under control of the PBAD promoter. We used this inducible promoter to avoid any potential effects of GlnKY51F on glnKamtB expression. The uridylylation state of GlnK in whole cell lysates was investigated by native PAGE (Fig. 4A). In GT1000(pAJ1002) grown under nitrogen limitation, one major band was detected corresponding to the fully uridylylated form of GlnK (GlnK-UMP3); following ammonium shock four bands were revealed, the major one being the non-uridylylated form of GlnK (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, GT1000(pAJ1004) cells showed only non-uridylylated GlnK both pre- and post-ammonium shock (Fig. 4A). The ability of GlnKY51F to bind to AmtB was examined by running cellular fractions on SDS-PAGE, and contrary to wild type GlnK, GlnKY51F was found to be bound to AmtB both pre- and post-ammonium shock (Fig. 4A). Taken together these results show that the uridylylation state of GlnK does indeed govern its binding to AmtB. Binding of GlnK to AmtB Regulates the Activity of the Transporter—It has been suggested previously that the interaction between GlnK and AmtB negatively regulates the transport activity of AmtB (14Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However in those experiments, the transported substrate was [14C]methylammonium, an analogue of ammonium. The transport of methylammonium by AmtB is competitively inhibited by μm concentrations of ammonium. Therefore it was not previously possible to assess the effects of GlnK on methylammonium transport under conditions in which its interaction with AmtB is maximal, i.e. after ammonium shock. Having shown that the GlnKY51F protein behaves as if it is permanently locked in the AmtB-bound state, it was possible to measure [14C]methylammonium transport in cells that simulate ammonium shock conditions. We carried out a series of experiments comparing the transport activity of AmtB in the ΔglnKΔamtB background (GT1000) expressing either GlnK and AmtB or GlnKY51F and AmtB. We used Western blots to compare the levels of AmtB in whole cell extracts of GT1000 carrying pAJ1002 (glnK+) and pAJ1004 (glnK11) and found no significant differences (data not shown). However, when compared with wild type GlnK the presence of GlnKY51F completely inhibited AmtB activity, which was reduced to the background level observed in the ΔglnKΔamtB strain (GT1000) (Fig. 4B). Hence, AmtB is inactive in the presence of GlnKY51F, demonstrating that deuridylylated GlnK inhibits the ammonium flux through the transporter by protein-protein interaction. Ammonium Transport through AmtB Is Required for GlnK Deuridylylation—The demonstration that the uridylylation state of GlnK governs its binding to AmtB raises the question of whether ammonium binding to and/or trans"

Androgen-induced cell proliferation is associated with the expression of an array of androgen-regulated genes (5Nelson P.S. Clegg N. Arnold H. Ferguson C. Bonham M. White J. Hood L. Lin B. Proc.

Most prostate cancers regress in response to androgen deprivation therapy or anti-androgen treatment, reflecting their dependence on androgens for growth. Androgen deprivation results initially in reduced AR levels and reduced expression of androgen-regulated genes (7Isaacs J.T. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 433-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, prostate cancers recur after a period of remission (8Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 9Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that prostate cancer recurrence occurs under selective pressure of androgen withdrawal or anti-androgen treatment and results from the clonal expansion of a subpopulation of cells that is independent of androgen for growth (10Craft N. Chhor C. Tran C. Belldegrun A. DeKernion J. Witte O.N. Said J. Reiter R.E. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5030-5036PubMed Google Scholar). The recurrence of prostate cancer after androgen deprivation is a major clinical challenge for improving disease outcome.An abundance of evidence suggests that the AR is critical to recurrent prostate cancer growth despite reduced circulating androgen levels. AR is expressed in most recurrent prostate cancers (11van der Kwast T.H. Schalken J. Ruizeveld de Winter J.A. van Vroonhover C.C. Mulder E. Boersma W. Trapman J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and is implicated in cancer growth by a cadre of androgen-regulated genes that continue to be expressed in the absence of testicular androgen (11van der Kwast T.H.

Kranc D.M. Puy L.A. Takeda H. Johnson K. Chang C. J. Urol. 1992; 147: 798-803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies show that selective AR inactivation using a ribozyme inhibits proliferation of LNCaP cells in culture (16Zegarra-Moro O.L. Schmidt L.J. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1008-1013PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP prostate tumor growth and PSA secretion were inhibited in vivo using antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit AR expression (17Eder I.E. Hoffmann J. Rogatsh H. Schafer G. Zopf D. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).To account for the functional importance of AR in recurrent prostate cancer, a number of adaptive mechanisms have been proposed (18Lara Jr., P.N. Kung H.J. Gumerlock P.H. Meyers F.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1999; 32: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each involves alternative pathways for increased AR activation. One compelling observation is that the AR gene is amplified in ∼30% of prostate cancers, and AR levels are increased (9Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 19Koivisto P. Kononen J. Palmberg C. Tammela T. Hyytinen E. Isola J. Trapman J. Cleutjens K. Noordzij A. Visakorpi T.

Higher AR expression would be expected to increase the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to low androgen levels, as reported recently (22Gregory C.W. Johnson R.T. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2892-2898PubMed Google Scholar).Mutation of the AR coding sequence is another mechanism for increased AR activation in late stage prostate cancer growth. Unlike mutations that cause androgen insensitivity by inactivating AR (23Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr.

The p160 coactivators include steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) (38Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) (39Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Some of the p160 coactivators have histone acetyltransferase activity that modifies histones to increase chromatin accessibility during gene activation (45Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L.

Heregulin-α and ErbB3 were overexpressed in prostate cancer in association with less favorable prognosis in advanced disease (61Leung H.Y. Weston J. Gullick W.J. Williams G. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 79: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).In this report, we investigated the mechanisms involved in an EGF-induced increase in AR transcriptional activity in recurrent prostate cancer cells. We present evidence that an EGF-induced increase in TIF2/GRIP1 phosphorylation is mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway and increases the functional activity of the androgen-activated AR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCWR22 Tumor Propagation—Androgen-dependent and recurrent CWR22 tumors were originally provided by Thomas G. Pretlow (Case Western Reserve University) and were maintained as xenograft implants in nude mice (13Gregory C.W. Hamil K.G. Kim D. Hall S.H. Pretlow T.G. Mohler J.L. French F.S.

Cell suspensions (106 cells/site) were injected subcutaneously with 100 μl of Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences) into nu/nu athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) that were previously implanted with 12.5 mg of sustained release testosterone pellets to normalize circulating levels to ∼4 ng/ml testosterone (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL). For analysis of the androgen-dependent CWR22 tumor, tumors were grown to ∼0.75 g over ∼30 days until the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tumors were resected. Testosterone propionate (25 mg/kg/day) in sesame oil (Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc., Port Washington, NY) was injected intraperitoneally, or 150 μg/kg/day EGF in sterile water (BD Biosciences) was injected subcutaneously. For recurrent CWR22 tumors, tumor cell-Matrigel suspensions were injected into castrated athymic mice and grown to ∼0.75 g before resection after ∼30 days. Tumors were frozen in liquid N2 and used to prepare protein lysates for immunoblot analysis. Animals were maintained in accordance with National Institutes of Health and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill animal use guidelines.Plasmids—Expression vectors were described previously for full-length human AR pCMVhAR (63Lubahn D.B.

Johnson R.T. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2892-2898PubMed Google Scholar). To study transcriptional activity of endogenous AR, CWR-R1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/6-cm dish MMTV-Luc reporter vector in the absence and presence of 0.1 μg of pSG5 empty vector, pSG5-GRIP1, or pSG5-GRIP1-S736A. To study transcriptional activity of transiently expressed wild-type pCMVhAR and pCMVAR 1-660 or pCMVAR-FXXAA/AXXAA, AR expression vector DNA (10 ng) was transfected with 0.5 μg of MMTV-Luc or 1 μg of PSA-Luc reporter vector as indicated. DNA was transfected into ∼75% confluent CWR-R1 cells plated the day before at 106 cells/6-cm dish using prostate growth medium without exogenous EGF, containing Richter's improved minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10 mm nicotinamide, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2% fetal bovine serum. The Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used according to the manufacturer. 1 ml of a DNA reaction mix containing 150 μl of EC buffer (Qiagen), 4 μl of enhancer, 4 μl of Effectene reagent (Qiagen), and 1 ml of 2% serum containing prostate growth medium lacking EGF was added to cell cultures containing 3 ml/dish fresh medium with 2% fetal calf serum without added EGF. The next day, the prostate growth medium was replaced with phenol red-free, serum-free medium (Improved MEM Zinc Option; Invitrogen) with or without the addition of EGF or DHT as indicated, and incubations were continued for 24 h. Cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (67He B. Bowen N.T. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Luciferase activity was measured using an automated LumiStar Galaxy (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC) multiwell plate reader luminometer.For two-hybrid interaction assays, CWR-R1 cells (1 × 106 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected using Effectene as described above with 10 ng of VPTIF2.1 (VP16 activation residues 411-456 fused to TIF2 residues 624-1287) or the serine to alanine mutant VPTIF2.1-S736A, 100 ng of GAL-AR 624-919, and 0.1 μg of 5×GAL4Luc-3 containing five tandem GAL-4 binding sites and the luciferase coding sequence. Cells were treated with hormone as indicated and analyzed for luciferase activity as described above.Immunoblot, Immunoprecipitation, and Stability Assays—Monkey kidney COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. COS cells were plated at ∼50% confluence (1.2 × 106 COS cells/10-cm dish) and transfected the next day using Effectene reagent. To each plate containing 8 ml of fresh serum-containing medium was added 1 ml of a reaction mix prepared according to the manufacturer to contain, per plate, 2 μg of pCMVhAR, pCMVhAR 1-660, pSG5-GRIP1, or pSG5-GRIP1-S736A as indicated, 300 μl of EC buffer (Qiagen), 16 μl of enhancer, 10 μl of Effectene reagent (Qiagen), and 1 ml of serum-containing medium. After an overnight incubation in 10% serum-containing medium, the medium was exchanged with serum-free, phenol red-free medium. CWR-R1 cells in log phase growth were plated in prostate growth medium lacking EGF as described. For experiments without transfection, the CWR-R1 cell culture medium was replaced for 24 h with serum-free medium lacking phenol red and containing 0.2% lipid-rich bovine serum albumin (AlbuMax I; Invitrogen). Hormones and growth factors were added as indicated, and cells were incubated for ∼20 h with DHT in the absence and presence of EGF. CWR-R1 and COS cells with or without transient DNA transfection were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed on ice. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of buffered saline on ice, transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The buffer was aspirated, and 50 or 100 μl of RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors was added (RIPA: 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and phosphate-buffered saline containing the protease inhibitors 0.02 mg/ml pancreas extract, 0.005 mg/ml Pronase, 0.0005 mg/ml thermolysin, 0.003 mg/ml chymotrypsin, and 0.33 mg/ml papain (Roche Applied Science)). Cell pellets were disrupted by vortexing for 15 s, and lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates from CWR22 tumors were prepared as described (72Gregory C.W. Johnson R.T. Presnell S.C. Mohler J.L. French F.S. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 537-548PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1992294030,"The SNARE proteins syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin play a central role during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis at the nerve terminal. Whereas syntaxin and SNAP-25 are located in the plasma membrane, synaptobrevin resides in the membrane of synaptic vesicles. It is thought that gradual assembly of these proteins into a membrane-bridging ternary SNARE complex ultimately leads to membrane fusion. According to this model, syntaxin and SNAP-25 constitute an acceptor complex for synaptobrevin. In vitro, however, syntaxin and SNAP-25 form a stable complex that contains two syntaxin molecules, one of which is occupying and possibly obstructing the binding site of synaptobrevin. To elucidate the assembly pathway of the synaptic SNAREs, we have now applied a combination of fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. We found that SNARE assembly begins with the slow and rate-limiting interaction of syntaxin and SNAP-25. Their interaction was prevented by N-terminal but not by C-terminal truncations, suggesting that for productive assembly all three participating helices must come together simultaneously. This suggests a complicated nucleation process that might be the reason for the observed slow assembly rate. N-terminal truncations of SNAP-25 and syntaxin also prevented the formation of the ternary complex, whereas neither N- nor C-terminal shortened synaptobrevin helices lost their ability to interact. This suggests that binding of synaptobrevin occurs after the establishment of the syntaxin-SNAP-25 interaction. Moreover, binding of synaptobrevin was inhibited by an excess of syntaxin, suggesting that a 1:1 interaction of syntaxin and SNAP-25 serves as the on-pathway SNARE assembly intermediate.

Following a Ca2+ influx into the synaptic terminal, neurotransmitter is rapidly released from synaptic vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane. The synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin 2 (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, or VAMP 2) and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP-25, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein of 25 kDa; SNARE, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; OG, Oregon Green; TR, Texas Red; IAANS, anilinonaphthalenesulfonate iodoacetamide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Syb, synaptobrevin 2; BONT/A and BONT/E, botulinum neurotoxin A and E, respectively; Syx, syntaxin. play a central role during this process. They belong to the family of so-called soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, which are essential for all vesicular trafficking steps. It is believed that SNAREs generally initiate the process of membrane fusion by the sequential formation of a stable heteromeric “trans” complex between the vesicular and the target membranes. This basic SNARE machinery is thought to be tightly controlled by a complex protein network (for a review, see Refs. 1Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Syntaxin and synaptobrevin each contain a single SNARE complex-forming coiled-coil region, termed the SNARE motif, directly adjacent to their C-terminal transmembrane domain. Syntaxin 1a contains an additional regulatory N-terminal region, called the Habc domain. SNAP-25 is composed of two SNARE motifs connected by a long linker and is attached to the membrane by palmitoyl modifications in this region. Upon SNARE complex formation, major conformational changes occur, with mostly unstructured proteins forming a stable α-helical complex (6Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol.

The mechanical force of assembly could potentially be used to overcome the repulsive forces between membranes (7Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The assembled core complex consists of an elongated four-helix bundle with synaptobrevin and syntaxin each contributing one helix and SNAP-25 contributing two helices (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). In the interior, 16 layers of mostly hydrophobic amino acids are formed; however, an unusual hydrophilic layer of three glutamine residues and one arginine residue is located in the center of the bundle. Each helix can be assigned to a different SNARE subfamily. Accordingly, the SNARE helices contributing a glutamine to the zero-layer are named Qa- (syntaxin), Qb- (first half of SNAP-25; SN1), and Qc-SNARE (second half of SNAP-25; SN2), whereas synaptobrevin is the R-SNARE (12Fasshauer D.

Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). A very similar structure was found in the late endosomal SNARE complex, which is only distantly related to the synaptic complex (14Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In both complexes, the SNARE helices are aligned in parallel, suggesting that assembly between vesicle and target membrane originates at the membrane-distal N-terminal ends of the respective SNARE motifs and proceeds in a zipper-like fashion toward the membrane anchors (15Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 16Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). That SNARE proteins indeed constitute a minimal membrane fusion machinery was inferred from experiments in which SNAREs were shown to slowly catalyze fusion between liposomes (17Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Since the two Q-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 mainly reside in the plasma membrane, they are presumed to cooperate in providing the binding site for the vesicular R-SNARE synaptobrevin. This concept was substantiated by the fact that both Q-SNAREs form a stable complex in vitro. A closer inspection of the syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex, however, revealed that it already consists of a similar four-helix bundle, in which the binding site for synaptobrevin is taken by a second syntaxin molecule (7Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R.

Although one cannot exclude the possibility that the second syntaxin is necessary to stabilize the Q-SNARE interaction, it seems likely that a 1:1 syntaxin-SNAP-25 interaction would provide a more straightforward synaptobrevin binding site in vivo. The latter scenario is corroborated by studies on a homologous Q-SNARE complex involved in exocytosis in yeast, for which a 1:1 interaction of Ssop (syntaxin homologue) and Sec9p (SNAP-25 homologue) is believed to provide the binding site for Sncp (synaptobrevin homologue) (20Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct.

The core region of the yeast Q-SNARE complex assembles with a relatively slow rate of ∼6000 m–1 s–1 (21Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This rate of Q-SNARE assembly was found to be rate-limiting for the assembly of the ternary complex. Assembly of the synaptic SNAREs is similarly slow. Furthermore, the two synaptic Q-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 have to interact to allow for subsequent synaptobrevin binding (23Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These slow SNARE assembly rates probably allow for a tight control of complex formation in vivo, but to catalyze fast membrane fusion the reaction obviously needs accelerating factors. Strikingly, there are no obvious obstacles such as proline residues or disulfide bonds in the relatively simple four-helix bundle structure that could account for the slow assembly rates. Nevertheless, experiments at elevated temperatures revealed that assembly could not take place in the harsh conditions in which the complex falls apart (23Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It seems possible that this marked hysteresis is caused by a rather delicate nucleation reaction, which might render SNARE assembly slow. But what is the structural reason for the delicacy of SNARE nucleation? An answer to this question requires deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic SNARE assembly. Therefore, we now have designed fluorescence assays to follow the assembly steps of the core four-helix bundle of the synaptic SNARE complex. Our results suggest that a 1:1 interaction of the Q-SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 precedes binding of synaptobrevin. The assembly of the Q-SNAREs is rather complex, since it requires the precise N-terminal nucleation of three helices.

The following shortened constructs were generated: SNAP-25A, BoNT/A fragment (residues 1–197), SN25ΔC (residues 1–180), ΔNSN25, (residues 39–206), SN1short (residues 7–83), ΔNSN1 (residues 39–83), SN1ΔC (residues 7–66), SN2short (residues 141–204), ΔNSN2 (residues 159–206), and SN1ΔC (residues 141–188); SyxH3, ΔNSyxH3 (residues 212–262) and SyxH3ΔC (residues 183–240); Syb, Syb 1–81 (residues 1–81), SybΔC (residues 1–70), and ΔNSyb (residues 42–96). In addition, we utilized a variety of single cysteine variants of all three SNARE proteins that had been previously characterized by EPR spectroscopy (10Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The following single cysteine variants of SyxH3 (residues 183–262) were used: Cys225, Cys240, and Cys248. Synaptobrevin 2 (residues 1–96) Cys79 and full-length SNAP-25A Cys84 were also used. Protein Purification—The different synaptic SNARE protein fragments were isolated from E. coli and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography on an Äkta system (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described (8Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The purity was greater than 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. All ternary SNARE complexes were assembled overnight from purified individual proteins and purified using a Mono Q-column. Protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nm in the presence of guanidine HCl or for the individual SNAP-25 helices and the C-terminally truncated synaptobrevin constructs, which do not posses aromatic residues, using the Bradford assay. Labeling—The sulfhydryl-reactive fluorescent probes anilinonaphthalenesulfonate iodoacetamide (IAANS) Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide and Texas Red C5 bromoacetamide were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Before labeling, SNARE proteins (∼1–4 mg/ml) containing a single cysteine were dialyzed against degassed PBS buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). About a 10–20-fold molar excess of the respective fluorescence probe in N,N-dimethylformamide was added and incubated for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol. After 1 h, excess dye was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column. Afterward, the labeled protein was dialyzed against PBS buffer. The concentration of the labeled protein was determined from its absorption at 327 nm (IAANS), 488 nm (Oregon Green), or 595 nm (Texas Red) using the molar extinction coefficients of the dyes. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All measurements were carried out in a Fluoromax 2 spectrometer equipped with autopolarizers (Jobin Yvon) in PBS buffer at 25 °C in 1-cm quartz cuvettes. For measurements of IAANS-labeled molecules, the excitation wavelength was 327 nm, and the emission spectrum was measured from 370 to 600 nm. The slit width of the excitation light was set at 2 nm, and that of the emission was set from 2.5 to 4 nm. Initially, the spectrum of the labeled molecule was measured and compared with the spectrum after the addition of unlabeled, interacting protein(s). Kinetic measurements were then performed using the emission wavelength at which the maximum change had been observed. Changes of anisotropy upon complex formation using proteins labeled with Oregon Green were measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. The slit widths were set to 2–4 nm, and the integration time was set at 1 s. At first, the G factor was determined according to G = IHV/IHH, where I is the fluorescence intensity, and the first subscript letter indicates the direction of the exciting light and second subscript letter is the direction of emitted light. Then the intensities of the vertically and horizontally polarized emission light after excitation by vertically polarized light were measured. The anisotropy (r) was calculated automatically according to r = (IVV – G × IVH)/(IVV + 2 × G × IVH). At the beginning of the reaction, data points were recorded using the smallest interval possible (∼5 s). Later, the intervals were extended accordingly. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, the emission spectrum was recorded from 500 to 700 nm at an excitation of 488 nm. For kinetic measurements, the change of the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor was recorded. CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed using a Jasco model J-720 instrument. For spectral measurements, different protein combinations at a concentration of about 5–10 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl (for details, see the appropriate figure legend) were incubated overnight. Hellma quartz cuvettes with a path length of 0.1 cm were used. The spectra were obtained by averaging over 5–50 scans using steps of 0.2 nm with a scan rate of 50 nm/min essentially as described (8Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Kinetic measurements were carried out in PBS buffer using 1-cm quartz cuvettes at 25 °C. Proteins were mixed, and the change in the CD signal was followed at 220 nm. For thermal denaturation experiments, the purified ternary SNARE complexes were dialyzed against PBS buffer. The ellipticity at 220 nm was recorded between 25 and 95 °C at a temperature increment of 30 °C/h. During SNARE assembly, major structural rearrangements occur, with mostly unstructured monomers forming complexes with high α-helical content. This allows us to monitor the assembly reaction using CD spectroscopy (6Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 7: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This approach alone, however, does not provide the spatial information necessary for a detailed analysis of the assembly pathway, since intermediate products already exhibit similar changes in the secondary structure (8Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brünger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To overcome these shortcomings, we have now introduced fluorescence probes into each of the three SNARE complex constituents. Using the crystal structure (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) as a guide, several positions in each SNARE protein were chosen for fluorescence labeling. Throughout the study, only the soluble regions of the three synaptic SNAREs that form the core complex were used. An overview of the different labeling positions is given in Fig. 1. A Second Syntaxin Competes with Synaptobrevin for Binding to a 1:1 SyxH3-SNAP-25 Intermediate—In our experiment, we mainly utilized the fluorophore IAANS, which exhibits environmentally sensitive fluorescence properties. Only a few positions of those tested exhibited a pronounced change in the fluorescence intensity that allowed us to follow SNARE assembly. As an example, SNAP-25 labeled at position 84 (SNAP-2584IAANS) showed a strong increase in fluorescence intensity upon binding to syntaxin (Fig. 2B). At pseudo-first-order conditions, the rate of assembly was ∼6000 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 2D). Comparable rates were obtained when the SNARE motif of syntaxin (SyxH3) was labeled with IAANS at position 225, 240, or 248 and mixed with SNAP-25 (∼7600, ∼6800, and ∼7400 m–1 s–1, respectively) (Fig. 2C). Upon titration, saturation of fluorescence was reached at a molar ratio of about two SyxH3 and one SNAP-25 molecule, whereas in the presence of Syb, a molar ratio of 1:1 between SyxH3 and SNAP-25 was observed (data not shown). However, in all experiments in which the reaction between SyxH3 and SNAP-25 was monitored, no clear indication for a two-step assembly process was observable. A possible explanation might be that a transient 1:1 intermediate of SyxH3 and SNAP-25 creates a new binding site with increased affinity for the second SyxH3. In the presence of Syb, the entire reaction appeared to be slower (Fig. 2, A and B) and to consist of at least two phases as we had previously observed using CD spectroscopy (23Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As a different read-out for ternary complex formation, we then used Syb labeled at position 79 (Syb79IAANS), which exhibited a clear rise in fluorescence intensity only upon the addition of both SyxH3 and SNAP-25. Interestingly, complex formation was faster when increasing amounts of SNAP-25 were added and SyxH3 was kept at a constant concentration (Fig. 3A), whereas increasing amounts of SyxH3 rather slowed down assembly (Fig. 3B). Thus, it appears that an excess of SyxH3 inhibits Syb binding, most likely because both molecules compete for the same binding site offered by a transient 1:1 SyxH3-SN25 intermediate. Nevertheless, ternary complex formation was only slightly faster when SyxH3 and SNAP-25 were allowed to assemble beforehand (data not shown). This accelerating effect was most obvious when more SNAP-25 than SyxH3 was used. This probably suggests that only a small portion of premixed Q-SNAREs reside as transient 1:1 complexes, whereas the majority appears to exist as stable 2:1 complexes, which do not appear to serve as the primary binding site for synaptobrevin. In another set of experiments, we added SNAP-25 to a mix of SyxH3225OG and SyxH3225TR (i.e. syntaxins labeled at position 225 with the fluorescence dyes Oregon Green or Texas Red, respectively). Although this approach allowed only for a random integration of the differently labeled syntaxins, assembly gave rise to clear FRET, confirming that the Q-SNARE assembly contained two syntaxin molecules (Fig. 4, inset). At pseudo-first-order conditions, a Q-SNARE assembly rate of ∼5900 m–1 s–1 was observed (data not shown), which is similar to the ones assessed with IAANS-labeled Q-SNAREs (see above). Upon the addition of an excess of Syb to the preassembled Q-SNARE complex, the FRET signal disappeared (Fig. 4), suggesting that one of the syntaxin molecules of the preformed 2:1 complex had been exchanged for Syb. The addition of an excess of unlabeled SyxH3 to the preformed Q-SNARE complex led to a comparable disappearance of the FRET signal (Fig. 4), which probably reflects the dissociation of the second syntaxin. Since Syb binding was not faster than the off-rate of the second syntaxin, it is likely that Syb does not actively replace one of the two syntaxins from the 2:1 Q-SNARE assembly. The Syntaxin-SNAP-25 Interaction Nucleates N-terminally—To assess which regions of the SNAREs are sufficient for assembly, N- or C-terminal parts of the SNARE motifs were removed (see Fig. 1). Remarkably, N-terminally truncated SNAP-25 (residues 39–206; ΔNSN25) as well as N-terminally truncated SyxH3 (residues 212–262; ΔNSyxH3) appeared to have lost their ability to undergo Q-SNARE interaction (Fig. 5, A and B). A similar result was obtained by CD spectroscopy, where no increase in α-helical content was observed for a mix of each of the constructs with the respective intact Q-SNARE binding partner (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, these constructs almost completely lost their ability to form a ternary complex containing Syb; only at high concentrations (>5 μm), a stable ternary complex slowly formed (>24 h) (Fig. 5C). This indicates that when the Q-SNARE interaction is perturbed, assembly occurs slowly due to a high energy barrier. In contrast, a C-terminally truncated SyxH3 (residues 183–240; SyxH3ΔC) was still able to interact with SNAP-25 (Fig. 5A). Likewise, a C-terminally truncated SNAP-25 (residues 1–197), which resembles the botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) cleavage product, formed a complex with SyxH3 (data not shown). However, further shortened SNAP-25 construct (residues 1–180; SN25ΔC, which resembles the BoNT/E cleavage product) only slowly interacted with SyxH3 (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, upon the addition of Syb, SN25ΔC readily formed a ternary SNARE complex (Fig. 5B). The molecular mass of the purified SyxH3-SN25ΔC complex determined by multiangle laser light scattering indicated a 2:2 stoichiometry (data not shown). An equivalent 2:2 complex has been described for the isolated first helix of SNAP-25 (SN1) and SyxH3 (24Misura K.M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. May A.P. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41301-41309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Syb, the much shortened second helix of the SN25ΔC construct may not suffice to prevent the competing but slow process of dimerization (for illustration, see Fig. 6). To test whether Syb truncations affected SNARE assembly, we utilized the increase in fluorescence anisotropy of SyxH3225OG upon complex formation. Upon assembly with SNAP-25, anisotropy of SyxH3225OG exhibited only a small increase, which might be caused by the proximity of two OG fluorophores in the SyxH32-SNAP-251 complex. A much more pronounced rise, however, was observed upon ternary SNARE complex formation. Interestingly, N- or C-terminal truncations of Syb had no significant effect on SNARE assembly (Fig. 5D). Similar results were obtained by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results substantiate the view that Syb binding occurs after Q-SNARE nucleation. Although all of the above SNARE truncations removed a substantial part of the core complex-forming region, about three hydrophobic coiled-coil layers (see Fig. 1), their core complexes remained highly stable (Table I). Consequently, the pronounced effect of the truncations on assembly cannot simply be explained by the fact that the resulting core complex is less stable. Rather, the stability of the Q-SNARE intermediate is likely to be mostly affected. The SNARE complex containing ΔNSyxH3 did not refold during the time period tested, confirming our results that assembly of this fragment is extremely slow (data not shown). Remarkably, complexes containing either N- or C-terminally truncated Syb still exhibited a strong hysteresis (data not shown), suggesting that fragments of the Syb helix are sufficient to produce an “irreversible” SNARE interaction.Table IMelting temperatures of core SNARE complexes containing truncated fragments measured by CD spectroscopyComplexesTemperaturesSx 183-24078 °CSx 212-26272 °CSb 1-7079 °CSb 42-9672 °CSN25ΔC65 °CCore synaptic SNARE complex82 °C (23Fasshauer D.

However, the mechanism by which EGF induced Src activation was largely undefined. Src tyrosine kinase is basally inactive due to auto-inhibition by intramolecular interactions between its Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain and a phosphotyrosine (Tyr-527 in chicken, Tyr-530 in human) in the C-terminal region and/or between its SH3 domain and a Pro-rich sequence in the linker region (10Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have shown that disrupting SH2 domain phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-527 interaction is sufficient to activate Src tyrosine kinase activity (11Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 12Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M Smith A.E. Cheng S.H.

Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In fact a mutated human c-Src that loses interaction between the SH2 domain and Tyr(P)-530 has been identified as a human oncogene (14Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Src Tyr-530 is catalyzed by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). Csk is a cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase that is regulated by binding to its docking proteins for co-localization with Src to exert its inhibitory effect. Paxillin and Cbp/PAG are two known Csk-docking proteins (15Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 13: 4139-4140Google Scholar, 17Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagal K.

Paxillin is an adapter protein located primarily at sites of cell adhesions to the extracellular matrix in the proximity of plasma membrane (19Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Besides its four LD motifs and five LIM domains that interact with actin-associated proteins, integrins, and other proteins, paxillin contains a proline-rich SH3 domain binding sequence and at least four tyrosine phosphorylation sites that could bind SH2 domains (16Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 13: 4139-4140Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin has been identified as a major binding protein of Csk (15Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Src also binds to paxillin through its SH3 domain (16Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 13: 4139-4140Google Scholar, 20Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation may negatively regulate Src activity by bringing Src and Csk to close proximity (16Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 13: 4139-4140Google Scholar). In addition to Src and Csk, members of focal adhesion kinase (Fak) also interact with paxillin. Interaction between focal adhesion kinase and paxillin appears to involve both LD and phosphotyrosine-based motifs (19Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that EGF, heregulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 induce tyrosine dephosphorylation of paxillin in human carcinoma A431, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and DU145 cells (21Lu Z.

The growth factor-induced paxillin dephosphorylation is inhibited by protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) inhibitors. In MCF-7 and A14 cells, it has been found that expression of a PTPase-inactive SHP2 mutant can block paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation induced by heregulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and insulin (23Manes S Mira E.

These data suggest that SHP2 or an SHP2-regulated PTPase is responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of paxillin in growth factor-stimulated cells. However, it was unclear how the activation signal from a growth factor receptor, such as the EGF receptor, is relayed to SHP2 for paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation and whether paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation leads to Src activation. SHP2 is a cytoplasmic PTPase with narrow substrate specificity (26Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem.

SHP2 contains two SH2 domains at its N-terminal region and is regulated by binding to its SH2 domain docking proteins, which activate the SHP2 PTPase and tether the activated enzyme to appropriate cellular location (27Neel B.G.

However, it was unclear whether Gab1-SHP2 interaction is involved in EGF-induced paxillin dephosphorylation or Src activation. We provide evidence here that paxillin is a substrate of the SHP2 PTPase and that Gab1 is responsible for recruiting SHP2 to paxillin for tyrosine dephosphorylation and for activation of Src tyrosine kinase in EGF-stimulated cells. Furthermore, our data show that Src kinase activity is involved in EGF-stimulated Erk activation and cell migration. Primary Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to paxillin, SHP2, Csk, Src, EGF receptor, total Erk1/2, and FLAG tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to paxillin and phosphotyrosine (RC20H) were from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies to Gab1 were either from Upstate biotechnology (rabbit) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat). The mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 327) to Src was from Oncogene Sciences.

SHP2DN that contains double mutations of the active site Cys residue (Cys-459) to Ser and the general acid Asp residue (Asp-425) to Ala of SHP2 were made by sequential PCR using primers that confer these mutations. The sequence of SHP2DN was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Coding sequences for FLAG-tagged Gab1FF and SHP2DN, respectively, were subcloned into the pSTAR vector to generate pSTAR-Gab1FF and pSTAR-SHP2DN. pGEX-GST-Gab1CT was made by cloning the coding sequence for the C-terminal region of human Gab1 (amino acids 592-694) into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2T. Cell Culture and Establishment of Dox-inducible Cell Lines—MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C/5% CO2. To establish Dox-inducible cell lines for expression of Gab1FF and SHP2DN, MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with pSTAR-Gab1FF, pSTAR-SHP2DN, or the pSTAR vector that had been linearized by PvuI digestion. Transfected cells were cultured in tetracycline free DMEM, 10%FCS (Clontech) in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant cell colonies from empty pSTAR vector transfected cells were pooled (MpSTAR) and used as the control. Individual G418-resistant cell colonies/lines from pSTAR-Gab1FF- or pSTAR-SHP2DN-transfected cells (24-36 lines/each) were screened for Dox-inducible expression of the FLAG-tagged Gab1FF or SHP2DN by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Near-confluent cells were serum-starved in DMEM, 0.1% BSA for 18 h and then stimulated with EGF or mock-treated as indicated in figure legends. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% Triton X-100). For experiments involving in Src Tyr-530 phosphorylation analysis, 0.5 μm Csk tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD180970 (43Dorsey J.F. Cunnick J.M. Lanehart R. Huang M. Kraker A.J. Bhalla K. Jove R. Wu J. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was also included in the lysis buffer. Precleared supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies indicated in figure legends. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-agarose or protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (44Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Standley T. Turkson J. Kraker A.J. Fry D.W. Jove R. Wu J. J. Biol.

Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12254-12262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose. The PTPase activity was measured by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 80-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and various amounts of the enzyme at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 1 m NaOH. The absorbance of the mixtures at 405 nm (A405) was determined in 96-well plates. One unit of PTPase was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 A405 unit in this PTPase assay. For the paxillin dephosphorylation assay, paxillin was immunoprecipitated from confluent MDA-MB-468 cells that had been serum-starved in DMEM, 0.1% BSA for 18 h. The paxillin immunoprecipitates were incubated with different amounts of SHP2-PTPase in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in an 80-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 20 min. After the reaction, paxillin immunoprecipitates were washed with 1 ml of Buffer A 3 times and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation was then examined by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H). Src Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4). Src was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate supernatants using anti-Src monoclonal antibody 327. Src immune complex kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 15 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of GST-Gab1CT, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-gel loading buffer and heat denaturation. After resolving on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and processed for autoradiography. After the decay of radioactivity, the membrane was then used for analysis of Src protein presented on the membrane by immunoblotting. Cell Migration Assay—Transwell cell migration assay was performed as described (46Krueger J.S. Keshamouni V.G. Atanaskova N. Reddy K.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4209-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 47Ren Y. Wu J. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3231-3236PubMed Google Scholar). Transwell cell culture insert polycarbonate membrane was coated overnight with rat tail type I collagen (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C and then air-dried. MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured with or without 2 μg/ml Dox for 48 h and serum-starved for 18 h. Cells were detached from plates by trypsin digestion, and cell number was determined. DMEM, 10% FCS (0.6 ml) was placed into the lower chamber in 24-well plates. Cells (5 × 104) in 0.2 ml DMEM, 0.1% BSA were placed in the upper chamber in triplicate with or without 5 ng/ml EGF in the presence or absence of PP1 (10 μm), PD180970 (0.5 μm), or U0126 (10 μm). After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 8 h, cells on the upper member surface were mechanically removed with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the lower side of membrane were fixed and stained using the HEMA3 reagents (Fisher) and enumerated under a microscope in three randomly chosen 1.2 × 0.8-mm fields. EGF Stimulates Tyrosine Dephosphorylation of Paxillin—To verify that EGF induces paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation as reported by others (21Lu Z. Jiang G. Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4016-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we immunoprecipitated paxillin from MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells at various times after EGF stimulation. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was then examined by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 1 shows that high levels of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in serum-starved MDA-MB-468 and A431 cells. EGF-induced paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells was detectable within 2.5 min. The maximal dephosphorylation (90%) occurred at 10 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A). A lesser (40%) and more transient, but consistent, decrease in paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in A431 cells after EGF treatment (Fig. 1B). Control immunoblots (Fig 1, A and B, bottom panels) show that equal amounts of paxillin were present in the samples. Tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin is a major binding protein of Csk (15Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine whether the change in paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells affects paxillin-Csk association, we analyzed co-immunoprecipitation of Csk with paxillin from MDA-MB-468 cells before and after EGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 1C, a high level of paxillin-Csk complex was observed in serum-starved cells. EGF stimulation decreased the paxillin-Csk complex (Fig. 1C). These data confirm that EGF induces paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation in these carcinoma cells and raises the question about how the EGF receptor activation signal is transmitted to paxillin. Gab1 Binds Paxillin, and SHP2 Is Recruited to Gab1 and Paxillin after EGF Stimulation—During our study of Gab1-interacting proteins we identified paxillin as a novel Gab1-binding protein in various cell lines (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 2A (also in Fig. 4C), the Gab1-paxillin complex was observed in resting MDA-MB-468 cells. EGF stimulation further increased the amount of paxillin detected in Gab1 immunoprecipitates.Fig. 4Gab1-SHP2 interaction is necessary for EGF-induced SHP2-paxillin complex formation and paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation.A, MDA-MB-468 were transfected with pSTAR-Gab1FF. Individual G418-resistant cell colonies/lines were screened for Dox-inducible expression of the FLAG-tagged Gab1FF. Among 24 G418-resistant cell lines analyzed, 2 cell lines, MG12 and MG24, showed Dox-inducible expression of Gab1FF. B, pSTAR-transfected cells (a pool of G418-resistant cell colonies, MpSTAR), MG12, and MG24 were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Dox (2 μg/ml) for 2 days, serum-starved for 20 h, and then treated with or without EGF (50 ng/ml, 10 min). Paxillin immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies to SHP2, phosphotyrosine (pY), Csk, Src, or paxillin as indicated. α-, anti-. C, cell lysates were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate Gab1FF. Immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to FLAG (top panel), SHP2 (middle panel), or paxillin (bottom panel). The arrowhead in the middle panel indicates the position corresponding to where SHP2 would had been located if it was present on the membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A minimal residual level of phosphotyrosine was detected in Gab1 in serum-starved cells. As reported previously (37Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), EGF markedly stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the formation of the Gab1-SHP2 complex (Fig. 2A). This correlates with the recruitment of SHP2 to paxillin after EGF stimulation (Fig. 2B). These results raise the possibility that Gab1 may recruit SHP2 to dephosphorylate paxillin in EGF-stimulated cells. SHP2 Dephosphorylates Paxillin in Vitro—To evaluate whether SHP2 could be responsible for paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells, we tested whether SHP2 can dephosphorylate paxillin. Paxillin was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells and incubated with various amounts of a GST fusion protein of the SHP2 catalytic domain (SHP2-PTPase). Fig. 3A shows that incubation of paxillin with the GST-SHP2 fusion protein resulted in tyrosine dephosphorylation of paxillin in a PTPase concentration-dependent manner. The GST control protein had no apparent effect on paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 3A, inset). This result demonstrates that paxillin is a substrate of the SHP2 PTPase. We next examined whether paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation by SHP2 in vitro resulted in loss of paxillin-associated Csk and Src. Paxillin immune complex from serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells was incubated with SHP2-PTPase or with GST as a control. After incubation, the immune complex was washed to remove proteins that had been dissociated from the immune complex. The immune complex was then analyzed by immunoblotting for Csk, c-Src, or paxillin (control). As shown in Fig. 3B, incubation of paxillin with SHP2-PTPase in vitro resulted in dissociation of Csk from paxillin, suggesting that binding of Csk to paxillin is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the SHP2-PTPase treatment did not affect Src binding to paxillin. This result demonstrates that Src can bind paxillin independent of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation by SHP2 could lead to separation of Csk, the negative regulator of Src tyrosine kinase, from the paxillin-Src complex. Gab1-SHP2 Interaction Is Necessary for Recruitment of SHP2 to Paxillin and for Tyrosine Dephosphorylation of Paxillin in Response to EGF—Data presented in Fig. 2 suggest but do not prove that formation of the paxillin-SHP2 complex in EGF-stimulated cells is mediated by Gab1. We previously showed that a Gab1 mutant (Gab1FF), in which Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 have been mutated to Phe, is defective in SHP2 binding (37Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gab1-SHP2 interaction is necessary for the formation of paxillin-SHP2 complex and tyrosine dephosphorylation of paxillin in EGF-stimulated cells, we used the pSTAR vector (39Zeng Q.

Among twenty-four independent G418-resistant cell lines derived from pSTAR-Gab1FF-transfected MDA-MB-468 cells, two cell lines (MG12 and MG24) show Dox-inducible expression of Gab1FF (Fig. 4A). MG12 and MG24 cells were cultured in medium with or without Dox to control Gab1FF expression. The empty pSTAR vector-transfected cells (a pool of G418-resistant colonies, MpSTAR) were used a control. These cells were then serum-starved, stimulated with EGF or mock-treated, and analyzed for for"

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of signaling molecules, are involved in numerous developmental processes. BMP signaling is crucial in the regulation of Nkx2-5 expression and specification of the cardiac lineage. Constitutively active BMP type I receptor or the downstream pathway components and DNA-binding transcription factors, Smad1/4 directly activated Nkx2-5 gene transcription. We identified and characterized a novel upstream Nkx2-5 enhancer, composed of clustered repeats of Smad and GATA DNA binding sites. This composite Nkx2-5 enhancer was a direct target of BMP signaling via cooperative interactions between the downstream transducers Smad1/4 and GATA-4. In mammalian two hybrid assays, Smad factors recruited the hybrid gene GATA4-VP16 to strongly drive transcription of a reporter gene containing multimerized Smad binding sites These cofactors interacted through the second zinc finger and adjacent basic domain of GATA-4 and the N-terminal domain of Smads. Smad4 and GATA4 were also found to bind in vivo with the Nkx2-5 composite enhancer, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of differentiated P19 cells. Finally, transgenic mice containing the Smad/GATA composite enhancer recapitulated early murine Nkx2-5 cardiac expression and deletion of this enhancer within a 10-kb transgene pBS-Nkx2-5 LacZ significantly reduced expression in the cardiac crescent. Thus, integration of GATA transcription factors with BMP signaling, through co-association with Smads factors, may initiate early Nkx2-5 expression; suggesting a vital role for the combination of these factors in the specification of cardiac progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2012828199,"Endo-β-1,4-xylanases (xylanases), which cleave β-1,4 glycosidic bonds in the xylan backbone, are important components of the repertoire of enzymes that catalyze plant cell wall degradation. The mechanism by which these enzymes are able to hydrolyze a range of decorated xylans remains unclear. Here we reveal the three-dimensional structure, determined by x-ray crystallography, and the catalytic properties of the Cellvibrio mixtus enzyme Xyn10B (CmXyn10B), the most active GH10 xylanase described to date. The crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with xylopentaose reveals that at the +1 subsite the xylose moiety is sandwiched between hydrophobic residues, which is likely to mediate tighter binding than in other GH10 xylanases. The crystal structure of the xylanase in complex with a range of decorated xylooligosaccharides reveals how this enzyme is able to hydrolyze substituted xylan. Solvent exposure of the O-2 groups of xylose at the +4, +3, +1, and -3 subsites may allow accommodation of the α-1,2-linked 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid side chain in glucuronoxylan at these locations. Furthermore, the uronic acid makes hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme at the +1 subsite, indicating that the sugar decorations in glucuronoxylan are targeted to this proximal aglycone binding site. Accommodation of 3′-linked l-arabinofuranoside decorations is observed in the -2 subsite and could, most likely, be tolerated when bound to xylosides in -3 and +4. A notable feature of the binding mode of decorated substrates is the way in which the subsite specificities are tailored both to prevent the formation of “dead-end” reaction products and to facilitate synergy with the xylan degradation-accessory enzymes such as α-glucuronidase. The data described in this report and in the accompanying paper (Fujimoto, Z., Kaneko, S., Kuno, A., Kobayashi, H., Kusakabe, I., and Mizuno, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9606-9614) indicate that the complementarity in the binding of decorated substrates between the glycone and aglycone regions appears to be a conserved feature of GH10 xylanases.

The microbial hydrolysis of the plant cell wall into its constituent sugars is one of the major mechanisms by which organic carbon is utilized in the biosphere. The enzymes that catalyze this process are thus of considerable biological and industrial importance. Endo-β-1,4-xylanases (xylanases), which are one of the key components of the repertoire of enzymes that catalyze plant cell wall degradation, hydrolyze the β-1,4 glycosidic bonds linking the xyloside units that comprise the backbone of the polysaccharide xylan (1Brett C.T.

Furthermore, the O-2 and/or O-3 of xylosides within the xylan backbone may be decorated with acetyl and arabinofuranosyl units, whereas 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (4-O-MeGlcA) 1The abbreviations used are: 4-O-MeGlcA, 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid; GH, glycoside hydrolase family; AX2, arabinoxylobiose; AX3, arabinoxylotriose; OX, oat spelt xylan; RAX, rye arabinoxylan; MX3, aldotetraouronic acid; Xyn10, xylanase from GH10; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PEG, polyethylene glycol. is exclusively α-1,2-linked (1Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Topics in Plant Functional Biology. Vol. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). The extent and nature of such decoration varies between plant species. For complete degradation the arabinofuranosyl and acetyl side chains are removed from the polysaccharide by arabinofuranosidases and acetyl xylan esterases, respectively (1Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Topics in Plant Functional Biology. Vol. 1. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar), whereas the α-glucuronidases, which release 4-O-MeGlcA, act only on xylooligosaccharides in which the xylose at the nonreducing end is decorated with the uronic acid (2Nurizzo D. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Nagy T. Nurizzo D. Davies G.J. Biely P. Lakey J.H. Bolam D.N.

Xylanases, which are generally located in glycoside hydrolase families (GH) 10 and 11 (CAZy website 2CAZy website: afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/. and Ref. 4Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar), hydrolyze glycosidic bonds by acid base-assisted catalysis via a double displacement mechanism leading to retention of anomeric configuration at the site of cleavage (5Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of xylanases show that GH10 enzymes fold into a (β/α)8-barrel (6Lo Leggio L. Kalogiannis S. Bhat M.K. Pickersgill R.W. Proteins. 1999; 36: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas family 11 enzymes are β-jelly roll proteins (8Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with their “endo” mode of action, the substrate binding cleft of xylanases extends along the length of the proteins and can accommodate from four to seven xylose residues (9Biely P. Kratky Z. Vrsanska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Charnock S.J. Spurway T.D. Xie H. Beylot M.H. Virden R. Warren R.A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32187-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each region that accommodates xylose moieties are known as subsites, which are given a negative or positive number dependent on whether they bind the glycone or aglycone region of the substrate, respectively, with glycosidic bond cleavage occurring between the -1 and +1 subsites (11Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The structures of xylanases in complex with oligosaccharides and inhibitors have revealed detailed information on the interactions of these enzymes with their substrates in the proximal, -2 and -1 glycone subsites (12White A. Tull D. Johns K.W.S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Notenboom V. Williams S.J. Hoos R. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The data show that at the -1 subsite the O-3 of xylose makes a hydrogen bond with a highly conserved lysine and histidine, whereas O-2 interacts with an asparagine and a glutamate (which acts as the catalytic nucleophile) that are invariant in GH10 xylanases. At the -2 subsite the xylose interacts with residues that are also highly conserved in family 10 xylanases with the O-2 of the sugar hydrogen bonding to a glutamate and tryptophan, the O-3 to an asparagine, and the endocyclic oxygen to a lysine. There is a paucity of information, however, on the mechanism by which the aglycone region of the substrate binding cleft of these enzymes interacts with the xylan backbone, although the three-dimensional structure of Cellvibrio japonicus xylanase 10A (CjXyn10A) in complex with xylopentaose bound to subsites -1 to +4 has been described (7Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Leggio L.L. Jenkins J. Harris G.W. Pickersgill R.W. Proteins. 2000; 41: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies showed that a highly conserved aromatic residue stacks against the xylose at the +1 subsite, and although hydrophobic stacking interactions at the +3 and +4 subsites were the primary mechanism of protein-substrate recognition, these amino acids are not invariant in GH10 glycoside hydrolases, suggesting that xylan binding in the distal aglycone region of this enzyme family is variable. One of the fundamental differences between the two major families of xylanases is that the GH11 enzymes hydrolyze unsubstituted regions of xylan, whereas the corresponding family 10 glycoside hydrolases are able to attack decorated forms of the polysaccharide (16Biely P. Vrsanska M. Tenkanen M. Kluepfel D. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the side chains of decorated xylans are accommodated in the active site of GH10 xylanases is largely unknown. Schmidt et al. (17Schmidt A. Gubitz G.M. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) solved the structure of a non-natural decorated xylooligosaccharide comprising 1,2-(4-deoxy-β-l-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-β-1,4-d-xylotriose. Although the backbone xylose residues were evident at subsites -1 to -3, the side chain was not observed, presumably because it was highly disordered. To probe the structural basis for the capacity of GH10 xylanases to hydrolyze decorated substrates, we have analyzed the biochemical properties of a family 10 enzyme from Cellvibrio mixtus (CmXyn10B) and determined its crystal structure in complex with unsubstituted and decorated substrates at resolutions from 1.7 to 1.4 Å. CmXyn10B comprises an N-terminal signal peptide and a 360-residue GH10 catalytic module; the enzyme does not contain noncatalytic accessory modules typical of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (18Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Clarke J.H. Prates J.A. McKie V.A. Nagy T. Fernandes T.H. Ferreira L.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is shown to be the most active GH10 xylanase described to date. Its capacity to bind decorated substrates is conferred partly by the exposure of O-2 and O-3 groups at selected glycone and aglycone subsites and partly through productive interactions with the 4-O-MeGlcA side chains. The data provided here and in the accompanying paper by Fujimoto et al. (19Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Kuno A. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9606-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) focus on a GH10 xylanase that contains an N-terminal lectin domain (19Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Kuno A. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9606-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), reveal complementarity in the binding of decorated substrates between the glycone and aglycone regions of the active site, and demonstrate how these binding modes mediate synergy with the xylan accessory enzyme, α-glucuronidase. Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli strain TUNER:pLysS (Novagen) was used in this study. The bacterium was cultured in Luria broth (LB) at 37 °C with aeration unless otherwise stated. The plasmid pCF1 is a recombinant of pET21b, which encodes the mature form of CmXyn10B corresponding to residues 11-379. The xylanase gene xyn10B (GenBank™ accession number AF049493) was inserted into the pET vector at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites such that the translation stop codon was removed and the gene was in-frame with the His6 tag encoding sequence supplied by the vector (18Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Clarke J.H. Prates J.A. McKie V.A. Nagy T. Fernandes T.H. Ferreira L.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus recombinant CmXyn10B contains a C-terminal His6 tag. Generation of CmXyn10B Mutants—Derivatives of CmXyn10B were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using pCF1 as template DNA and the appropriate primers. The complete sequences of the DNA encoding the xylanase mutants were determined using an ABI 377 DNA Sequenator employing T7 forward and reverse primers and the custom sequencing primers 5′-AACGGCGCGCGATGTACAAGTCG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGGTGAAAGAAGTAGCGC-3′ to confirm that only the desired mutations had been introduced. During the course of this study errors in the original manual sequencing of xyn10B, which resulted in 12 amino acid changes in the encoded enzyme, were detected and a corrected version of this gene has now been submitted to GenBank™. Expression and Purification of CmXyn10B—E. coli strain TUNER:pLysS harboring pCF1 was cultured in LB supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin (1000 ml in 2-liter conical baffle flasks) at 37 °C and 180 rpm to mid-exponential phase (A600 nm 0.6). The culture was cooled and incubated at 30 °C before expression of CmXyn10B was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The culture was incubated for a further 5 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1/40th volume 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged (25,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C to produce cell-free extract. CmXyn10B was purified from cell-free extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described previously (20Xie H. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabo L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using Talon™ resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The protein eluted from the matrix was dialyzed against 3 × 500 volumes of 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (Buffer A) and was then applied to a 3-ml DEAE Tris-Acryl column (15 × 50 mm). CmXyn10B was eluted with a linear 0-500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. The recovered protein was concentrated to ∼1 ml using a Vivaspin 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal concentrator (VIVASCIENCE, Hannover, Germany) and then applied to a High Load™ Superdex™ 75 column (16 × 600 mm; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The columns were run at 1 ml min-1 using the Bio-Rad Biologic system. The purity of the protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficient of the enzyme at 280 nm (67,850 m-1 cm-1). Preparation of Oligosaccharides—Unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides were purchased from Megazyme International (Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland) and arabinoxylotriose (AX3) in which arabinofuranose is α-1,3-linked to the internal xylose moiety in xylotriose was a kind gift from Satoshi Kaneko. Aldotetraouronic acid (MX3) in which 4-O-MeGlcA acid is α-1,2-linked to the nonreducing sugar of xylotriose was prepared as follows. Glucuronoxylan (1 g; Megazyme Int.) was digested to completion with 1 mg CmXyn10B in a 5-ml reaction in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 18 h. MX3 was purified by Dowex X-100 (Sigma) chromatography in which the bound decorated oligosaccharide was eluted with a 0-500 mm sodium chloride gradient in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The MX3 was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Bio-gel P2 column (2.5 × 100 cm) in which the oligosaccharide was eluted in distilled water at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1. The identity of the product as MX3 was verified by digestion with the α-glucuronidase GlcA67A from C. japonicus (21Nagy T. Emami K. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Humphry D.R. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) followed by Dionex-HPLC analysis, which revealed xylotriose and 4-O-MeGlcA as the reaction products. Arabinoxylobiose (AX2), in which the arabinofuranose is α-1,3-linked to the nonreducing xylose unit in xylobiose, was prepared as follows. Wheat arabinoxylan (1 g; Megazyme Int.) was digested to completion with 1 mg of CmXyn10B in a 5-ml reaction in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 18 h. AX2 was purified by size exclusion chromatography as described above. The identity of the product as AX2 was verified by digestion with the arabinofuranosidase Abf51A from C. japonicus (22Beylot M.H. McKie V.A. Voragen A.G. Doeswijk-Voragen C.H. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Dionex-HPLC analysis, which revealed xylobiose and arabinose as the reaction products. Enzyme Assays—The activity of the GH10 xylanases against aryl β-glycosides was determined as described previously (23Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazle- wood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Xylanase activity was performed essentially as described by Charnock et al. (23Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazle- wood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) except that the release of reducing sugar was determined using the Somogyi-Nelson reagent (24Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate. To evaluate the activity of the two xylanases against xylooligosaccharides, progress curves were carried out as described previously, and the data were used to determine kcat/Km following the equation of Matsui et al. (25Matsui I. Ishikawa K. Matsui E. Miyairi S. Fukui S. Honda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The bond cleavage frequency and kcat/Km data obtained from these experiments were used to calculate the ΔG of xylose binding at each of the subsites following the method of Suganuma et al. (26Suganuma T. Matsuno R. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Pure proteins, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were washed into water by repeated dilution (40 volumes of water) and concentrated in a Vivaspin 10-kDa concentrator. The E262S nucleophile mutant of CmXyn10B was screened by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using the PEG/Ion and Crystal screens (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Crystallization conditions were optimized independently for each xylooligosaccharide complex. Crystals grew in ∼2-4 days at 18 °C. Drops contained 1 or 2 μl of protein (25 mg ml-1), 0.5 or 1 μl of xylooligosaccharide (10 mm), and 1 μl of mother liquor. Crystallization conditions for each xylooligosaccharide complex were as follows: xylopentaose, 0.20 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 30% PEG 4000; AX2, 0.35 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.5, 30% PEG 4000, and 5% PEG 400; AX3, 0.20 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 30% PEG 4000, and 5% PEG 400; MX3, 0.10 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.5, 30% PEG 4000, and 5% isopropanol. Crystals in the form of plates were harvested in rayon fiber loops and cryoprotected in 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 85% mother liquor prior to flash freezing in liquid N2. All data were collected from single crystals at 120 K, over an oscillation range of 135° with a Δϕ of 0.5°. Data for CmXyn10B E262S in complex with xylopentaose were collected in the home laboratory using a MarResearch image plate detector on a Rigaku rotating anode RU-200 x-ray generator with a Cu target operating at 50 kV and 100 mA and focusing x-ray optics (Osmics). Data for CmXyn10B E262S in complex with AX3 were collected at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) on beamline PX-14.2. Data for CmXyn10B E262S in complex with AX2 and MX3 were collected on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID-29. SRS and ESRF data were collected using ADSC Quantum-4 and Quantum-210 charge-coupled device detectors, respectively. Structure Solution and Refinement—All data were processed and scaled with the HKL suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All other computing used the CCP4 suite (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. All crystals belonged to space group P212121 with approximate unit cell dimensions a = 47 Å, b = 68 Å, and c = 105 Å. The structure of CmXyn10B E262S in complex with xylopentaose was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe and with data in the resolution range 20-3.0 Å and an outer radius of Patterson integration of 25 Å. The protein atoms from the catalytic core domain of the C. japonicus Xyn10A (protein data bank 1clx) was used as the search model. AMoRe generated one solution corresponding to one molecule in the asymmetric unit. This gives a VM of 2.0 A3 D-1 and a solvent content of 36.6%. Prior to refinement and model building, 5% of the observations were set aside for cross-validation analysis (29Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) and were used to monitor various refinement strategies such as the weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraints as well as the insertion of solvent water during maximum likelihood refinement. REFMAC and ARP/wARP (CCP4 suite) were used to build the correct sequence into electron density automatically. Manual corrections of the model using the X-FIT routines of the program QUANTA (Accelrys) were interspersed with cycles of maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC. Solvent molecules were added automatically using ARP/wARP and inspected manually prior to deposition. The refined structure of the CmXyn10B E262S complexed with xylopentaose was used as the starting model for the refinement of the decorated oligosaccharide complexes. The same 5% of observations was maintained as the Rfree set in each case. Ideal coordinates for stereochemical dictionaries for the substituted xylooligosaccharides were generated using the energy minimization CHARMm function in QUANTA. Structures were validated using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Biochemical Properties of CmXyn10B—CmXyn10B was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, and its biochemical properties were determined (Tables II and III). The enzyme displays catalytic properties typical of a GH10 xylanase. The activity of CmXyn10B against xylooligosaccharides increases with the degree of polymerization (d.p.) of the substrate, although the difference in the hydrolysis rate between xylohexaose and xylopentaose is modest, implying that the sixth binding site (+4 subsite) interacts only weakly with the oligosaccharide substrate. The hydrolysis of xylotetraose exclusively into xylobiose demonstrates that the enzyme contains two subsites on either side of the point of cleavage, but as no xylotriose was generated, the xylanase does not contain a significant -3 subsite (Fig. 1). The catalytic efficiency of CmXyn10B and its mode of action against different xylooligosaccharides and aryl-β-xylosides (Table IV) shows that the -2 and +2 subsites have binding energies of 9.0 and 3.7 kcal mol-1, respectively. The maximum binding energy at the +3 is 1.1 kcal mol-1, assuming that the increased activity of CmXyn10B against xylopentaose, compared with xylotetraose, is due entirely to binding at this location.Table IIBiochemical properties of CjXyn10A and CjXyn10CEnzymekcat/Kmakcat/Km was determined by measuring progress curves at a substrate concentration below Km.Specific activitybSpecific activity is expressed as mol of product produced/mol of enzyme/min.X3X4X5X6PNPX2PNPXPNPG2OXRAXWAXGXmin−1 M−1min−1CmXyn10B6.0 × 1043.2 × 1072.0 × 1082.7 × 1088.2 × 1072.1 × 1022.4 × 104114205882799617782F340A1.3 × 1037.1 × 105—6.2 × 1061.5 × 107—1.7 × 104————Y200F—2.8 × 107—2.3 × 1082.7 × 1061.0 × 1021.3 × 1048823262736526347E262S———NDND—NDNDNDNDNDCjXyn10A9.2 × 1037.3 × 1051.3 × 1071.2 × 1085.1 × 1062.9 × 1013.2 × 1039887948331226CjXyn10CcThe biochemical properties of CjXyn10C and CfXyn10A have been reported elsewhere by Pell et al.3 and in Ref. 10, respectively.7.3 × 1028.5 × 1042.9 × 1061.0 × 1072.3 × 1063.4 × 1011.2 × 1011159122314971359CfXyn10AcThe biochemical properties of CjXyn10C and CfXyn10A have been reported elsewhere by Pell et al.3 and in Ref. 10, respectively.2.5 × 1041.8 × 1071.1 × 1081.9 × 1081.5 × 1085.2 × 1026.2 × 105615———a kcat/Km was determined by measuring progress curves at a substrate concentration below Km.b Specific activity is expressed as mol of product produced/mol of enzyme/min.c The biochemical properties of CjXyn10C and CfXyn10A have been reported elsewhere by Pell et al.3 and in Ref. 10Charnock S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2086400515,"Androgens are known to modulate many cellular processes such as cell growth and survival by binding to the androgen receptor (AR) and activating the transcription of target genes. Recent data suggested that AR can also mediate non-transcriptional actions outside the nucleus in addition to its ligand-inducible transcription factor function. Here, we describe a transcription-independent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3-K) signaling pathway by androgens. Using non-transformed androgen-sensitive epithelial cells, we show that androgens enhance the PI3-K activity by promoting accumulation of phosphoinositide-3-P phospholipids in vitro. This activation is found in conjunction with an increased time-dependent phosphorylation of the downstream kinase AKT/protein kinase B on both Ser473 and Thr308 residues. Hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT requires AR since incubation with the anti-androgen bicalutamide completely abolishes the androgen-stimulated AKT phosphorylation. Accordingly, we show that androgens increase AKT phosphorylation level in prostatic carcinoma PC3 cells only once they have been transfected with AR. Downstream, androgens enhance phosphorylation of transcription factor FKHR (Forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma)-L1 and proapoptotic Bad protein and promote cell survival as they can counteract an apoptotic process. We also report that non-genomic effects of androgens are based on direct interaction between AR and the p85α regulatory subunit of class I(A) PI3-K. Together, these novel findings point out an important and physiologically relevant link between androgens and the PI3-K/AKT signaling pathway in governing cell survival.

Steroid hormones exert most of their effects by binding to specific nuclear receptors, which act as transcription factors (1Evans R.M.

The relationship between steroid target genes and steroid physiological actions suggest that mechanisms, different from those controlling the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors, may be involved.

Moreover, such association of either AR with ERβ in LNCaP cells or AR with ERα in MCF-7 and T47-D cell lines was described to trigger cell proliferation through the same pathway (16Migliaccio A.

In PC3 cells stably expressing AR, androgens are able to increase the enzymatic activities of several cytoplasmic kinases such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the protein kinase C, and the PI3-K (15Peterziel H. Mink S. Schonert A. Becker M. Klocker H. Cato A.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although non-genomic steroid receptor activities mediated by the PI3-K pathway are now well documented for ER and PR, they remain poorly investigated concerning AR. Three classes of PI3-K have been described depending on their primary structure and substrate specificity (18MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr.

Of these, three are encoded by the p85α gene, generating p85α, p55α, and p50α by alternative splicing. These regulatory subunits regulate catalytic subunits p110α, -β, and -δ, which enhance phosphorylation of phosphoinositides (PtdIns-P) in D3 position of the inositol ring (20Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar).

In vivo, the main phosphorylated lipids generated by PI3-K class I(A) are the PtdIns-3,4-P3 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which in turn recruit signaling kinases such as the AKT/protein kinase B (25Franke T.F.

This control involves the phosphorylation of many proteins, including the transcription factor of the Forkhead family (FKHR) (27Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

The PI3-K activation results in the phosphorylation of the downstream AKT/protein kinase B, FKHR-L1, and Bad protein and is supported by direct interactions between AR and p85α, involving the N-terminal SH3 and C-terminal SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit. Finally, we demonstrate that androgenic activation of the PI3-K/AKT pathway by AR acts as a anti-apoptotic stimulus in epithelial cells. Reagents—R1881, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and Wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. LY294002 was purchased from Biomol, and Bicalutamide (Casodex®) was purchased from Astra-Zeneca. Antibodies against PI3-K subunit p85α (catalog number 06-195) and AR (catalog number PG21) were from Upstate Biotechnology; AKT (catalog number 9272), phospho-AKT Ser473 (catalog number 9271), phospho-AKT Thr308 (catalog number 9275), phospho-Bad Ser112 (catalog number 9296), and phospho-FKHR-L1 Ser256 (catalog number 9461) were from Cell Signaling; poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase (PARP) (catalog number C2-10) was from Trevigen Inc.; and β-actin (catalog number A2066) was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfections—Mouse vas deferens epithelial cells (VDEC) were cultured as already described (30Manin M. Baron S. Goossens K. Beaudoin C. Jean C. Veyssiere G. Verhoeven G. Morel L. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 729-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham F12, gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and then stimulated with or without R1881 or IGF-I. When used, LY294002 or Wortmannin were added 30 min before hormone inductions and were maintained through the experimental procedure. PC3 cells were grown in Glutamax-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using the PEI Exgen 500 procedure (Euromedex). Plasmids and Constructions—The pSG5-hAR and pGEX4T1-p85α plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. C. Sultan (Montpellier, France) and Dr. B. Payrastre (Toulouse, France), respectively. The p85α expression vector was constructed into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pTRAK by subcloning the full-length p85α PCR fragment amplified from pGEX4T1-p85α using the upstream 5′-CATGCCATGGTTGCTGAGGGGTACCAGT-3′ and the downstream 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCATCGCCTCTGCTGTG-3′ primers. The SH3, BCR, N-SH2, and C-SH2 domains of p85α were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR and then subcloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega). BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragments were further ligated into the pGEX-4T1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the open reading frame of GST using the following primer pairs: 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGAGTGCTGAGGGGTAC-3′, 5′-AGGGGGCCCCCTTTTCCTTCCAATATATTCTACGTAAGTTC-3′; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGAAAATCTCGCCTCCCACACCAAAG-3′, 5′-AGGGGGCCCCCTGTTGTTGGCTACAGTAGTAGGTTTTGG-3′; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGGGTATGAATAACAATATGTCCTTACA-3′, 5′-AGGGGGCCCCCTATATTCTTCATATAATCTATCATATTCTCG-3′; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGACGAGAGACCAATACTTGATGTGG-3′, 5′-AGGGGGCCCCCTTCGCCTCTGCTGTGCATATACT-3′. The GST-hAR expression vectors were constructed by ligating the full-length hAR and its N-terminal, C-terminal, and DNA binding domain-hinge domains into the pGEX-3X or pGEX-4T1 expression vectors using the BamHI/EcoRI- or BamHI/XhoI-digested fragments generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGC-3′, 5′-GATCCTCGAGTCCAATGCTTCACTGGGTGTG-3′; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGC-3′, 5′-GATCCTCGAGCATGTCCCCGTAAGGTCCGGA-3′; 5′-AGCGGATCCGGACCTTACGGGGACATG-3′, 5′-AGCGAATTCAGAAAGATGGGCTGACA-3′; 5′-GATCGGATCCTGTCAGCCCATCTTTCTGAATGTC3′, 5′-GATCCTCGAGTCCAATGCTTCACTGGGTGTG-3′. PI3-K Assay—Cells were starved 16 h in minimum medium before the addition of hormones and/or pharmacological inhibitors. After the indicated periods, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-p85α antibodies-(06–195) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with buffer A (PBS 1×, Nonidet P-40 0.1%), twice with buffer B (Tris 100 mm, LiCl 100 mm), and twice with buffer C (Tris 10 mm, NaCl 100 mm, EDTA 1 mm). Beads were resuspended in reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4), and phosphorylation assays were performed in the presence of 200 μg of phosphatidylinositol, 5 mm Hepes, 250 μm ATP, 50 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [λ-32P]ATP for 15 min at room temperature. The reactions were blocked by the addition of 4 n HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). Lower phases were dried and resuspended in CHCl3 and analyzed by TLC using CHCl3:CH3OH:NH4:H2O (90:70:6:14). The phosphorylated lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS buffer, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Total proteins (40 μg) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) followed by blocking in Tris-buffered saline 1×, 10% powdered milk, and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated 1 h with either anti-rabbit (P.A.R.I.S) or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Detection was performed using ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST Pull-down Experiments—Fresh overnight cultures of BL21 pLysS Escherichia coli strain transformed with GST-fused constructs were diluted 1:10 in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added in growing exponential bacterial culture to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). After 10,000 × g centrifugation during 10 min at 4 °C, pellets were frozen during 5 min, resuspended in STE buffer containing 1 m dithiothreitol and 10% sarcosyl. Lysates were sonicated for 1 min and clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacterial supernatant was rocked overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and beads were washed three times with PBS containing Triton X-100 (0.1%) and PMSF (1 mm). 35S-labeled AR and p85α proteins were generated in vitro using the TnT T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with the beads in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) by rocking 2 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were then washed six times in PBS buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, released from beads by boiling for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractionated proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation—VDEC were washed with PBS and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and 500 μg of total protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-p85α antibodies-(06–195) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. After five washes with PBS buffer, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl, the immunocomplexes were eluted in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Apoptosis—Following treatment, the VDEC monolayer was fixed with Clarke buffer (CH2OH/CH3COOH 3:1) at 4 °C for 10 min, and nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342 (Sigma) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were analyzed for the appearance of pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic body formation using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were recovered and washed in PBS. Pellets were resuspended in an RNase A (500 μg/ml), propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) solution and kept 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Cell suspensions were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by evaluating sub-G1 nuclei accumulation. At less 15,000 events were measured for each sample. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher t test. Values of p < 0.01 were considered significant and are presented under “Results.” Androgens Stimulate the PI3-K/AKT Pathway in Androgen-sensitive Epithelial Cells—The ability of androgens to enhance the PI3-K activity in non-tumoral VDEC that express endogenous AR was tested using R1881. The PI3-K p85α regulatory subunit was immunoprecipitated, and the phosphorylation status of the PI3-K substrates (PtdIns-3-P versus PtdIns) was assessed by thin layer chromatography. A 10–20-min exposure of VDEC with R1881 was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in the PI-3-P production in vitro (Fig. 1A). This lipid kinase activity is dependent on the PI3-K as it was inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of the PI3-K (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). The activation of the lipid kinase activity in response to this short androgenic stimulation was unlikely to be related to modifications in the steady-state levels of p85α and AR as they remained unchanged during the treatment (data not shown). PI3-K catalyzes the formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on the intracellular membrane surface and leads to the recruitment of pleckstrin homology-containing domain proteins within the cell. Among these is the Ser/Thr kinase AKT, which mediates a large range of the PI3-K cellular effects. To determine whether androgens can activate AKT, we monitored its phosphorylation status on the Ser473 residue, known to be regulated in a PI3-K-dependent manner by growth factors. A 20-min incubation with R1881 resulted in a 4.6-phosphorylation fold increase, similar to that obtained under IGF-I exposure (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, full AKT activation is dependent on the phosphorylation of two specific sites, Ser473 in the COOH regulatory region but also Thr308 in the kinase domain. We thus tested the capacity of androgens to change the phosphorylation status of Thr308, in addition to that of Ser473. In the presence of R1881, Thr308 phosphorylation was up-regulated and reached the highest level within 10 min (Fig. 1C). The phosphorylation on the Ser473 residue in response to androgens was time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1, C and D). Maximum phosphorylation is observed upon 10 min and significant for 10 nm R1881. To determine whether PI3-K is required or not for AKT phosphorylation in response to androgens, the Ser473 phosphorylation status was analyzed in the presence of increasing concentrations of LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of VDEC with LY294002 and R1881 dramatically decreased AKT phosphorylation, even with an inhibitor concentration as low as 5 μm (Fig. 1E). Previously, we have demonstrated that AR level is dependent on the PI3-K/AKT pathway and that 50 μm LY294002 could abolish AR expression after long exposure (30Manin M. Baron S. Goossens K. Beaudoin C. Jean C. Veyssiere G. Verhoeven G. Morel L. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 729-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, the use of the PI3-K inhibitor did not affect AR accumulation over a short incubation. It was then investigated whether intracellular effectors downstream to AKT, such as the transcription factor FKHR-L1 or the pro-apoptotic factor Bad, could be phosphorylated following androgenic stimulation. These two proteins are known to be inhibited by AKT through phosphorylation of Ser256 and Ser112, respectively. FKHR-L1 phosphorylation was significantly increased following a 20-min R1881 stimulation and reached its maximal level after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). The Bad protein was highly and rapidly phosphorylated. Unlike FKHR-L1, the high phosphorylation level of Bad in response to androgens was transient, reaching a maximum between 10 and 20 min of treatment (Fig. 2B). Present data suggest that different mechanisms could be involved in the control of FKHR-L1 and Bad phosphorylation, even if they are a substrate of the same kinase. These observations demonstrate that androgen stimulation of AKT leads to phosphorylation of cognate substrates. AR Is Required for the Androgen-dependent PI3-K/AKT Pathway Stimulation—To demonstrate whether AR is involved in the androgenic activation of the PI3-K, AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 was analyzed in the presence of both R1881 and bicalutamide, a synthetic anti-androgen hormone. Bicalutamide blocked R1881-induced AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that AR is required for activation of the PI3-K/AKT pathway. This effect did not rely on changes in AR accumulation since it remained at steady-state levels in the different experimental conditions. We also analyzed AKT Ser473 phosphorylation in PC3 prostate carcinoma cells, which do not express endogenous AR. These cells were transfected with increasing amounts of either an AR-expressing construct or the corresponding empty vector. As shown in Fig. 3B, the increase in the phosphorylation level on the Ser473 residue was dependent on the presence of the AR. In this transient transfection assay, although AR was able to mediate a partial AKT phosphorylation in untreated cells (Fig. 3C), this 3.0-fold stimulation was further enhanced when AR was activated by R1881. These results clearly indicate that androgen receptor is a central mediator for androgen action on PI3-K pathway since PC3 cells devoid of endogenous AR are unable to enhance AKT phosphorylation in response of R1881. The Androgen Activation of the PI3-K/AKT Pathway Is Supported by a Physical Interaction between AR and p85α—Prior investigations demonstrated that some steroid receptors, such as glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors, could interact with the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3-K. To determine whether such interactions can occur between p85α and AR, we performed p85α immunoprecipitation in VDEC. As suspected, AR was detected in the p85α immune complex, and interaction is enhanced by R1881 stimulation upon 10 min (Fig. 4A). The interaction features were then investigated using GST pull-down assays. We monitored the binding of 35S-p85α produced in vitro to the full-length, N-terminal domain, DNA binding domain, or ligand binding domain of AR fused to GST. All the AR truncated constructs tested bound p85α protein, but the DNA binding domain-hinge and C-terminal domain exhibits slight interactions regarding N-terminal domain (Fig. 4B). We next investigated the interaction abilities of the different p85α domains to radiolabeled 35S-AR; only the SH3 and C-SH2 domains showed consistent binding (Fig. 4C). The binding of androgen receptor to p85α in vitro was independent of the ligand (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that AR/p85α interaction occurs throughout direct interaction involving SH3 and C-SH2 motifs of the regulatory subunit. Androgens Protect VDEC against Cycloheximide-induced apoptosis through PI3-K pathway—As R1881 can stimulate the PI3-K pathway, we investigated whether this androgen-dependent non-genomic mechanism could be able to control cell survival. To prove this hypothesis, we first determined whether the apoptotic inducer cycloheximide (CHX) triggers apoptosis in VDEC following a 24-h treatment. It resulted in monolayer injury by cells cutting off, changes in nuclei morphology with the appearance of pyknotic nuclei, and apoptotic bodies as attested by DNA staining experiments (Fig. 5A). To ensure that these observations arose from an apoptotic process, we performed Western blot analysis to monitor PARP cleavage, which is specific to the apoptotic process. As expected, CHX induced accumulation of the cleaved PARP form at 85 kDa (Fig. 5A). We then investigated androgen effects on cycloheximide-induced apoptosis and determined the percentage of apoptotic cell population by flow cytometry by measuring hypoploid nuclei accumulation. VDEC were pretreated for 48 h with R1881 (10 nm) to increase AR expression (30Manin M. Baron S. Goossens K. Beaudoin C. Jean C. Veyssiere G. Verhoeven G. Morel L. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 729-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with LY294002 to prevent any non-genomic action of androgens and to ensure that the treatment could not interfere with the PI3-K cell survival pathway. Cells were then starved for 16 h in minimum medium, a treatment that did not decrease AR level but reset growth factor-dependent signaling pathways. At this point, VDEC were incubated for 1 h with R1881 in the presence or in the absence of LY294002 prior to the addition of cycloheximide to analyze the non-genomic action of androgens on apoptosis. Such an R1881 incubation was able to prevent cell death, reducing apoptotic cell population from 81 to 51% (Fig. 5B). In contrast, LY294002 co-incubation with R1881 blocked the androgen protective effects in a dose-dependent manner, when LY294002 alone had no effect. Taken together, these results indicate that R1881 supports an important role in epithelial cell survival through the non-genomic activation of PI3-K. We show here that the androgen receptor is able to activate the PI3-K/AKT pathway through direct interaction with the p85α regulatory subunit in response to synthetic but also to natural androgens (not shown). Such androgenic activation of the PI3-K leads to the phosphorylation of AKT and the down-stream targets Bad and FKHR-L1. Since androgen withdrawal has the potential to inhibit epithelial cell growth and to induce epithelial apoptosis in the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, and prostate, many efforts have been devoted to decipher the mechanisms by which they are able to act in these organs. Although androgens were demonstrated to act on proliferation processes through the ras/MAPK signaling cascade, their effect on the PI3-K/AKT pathway has remained little investigated until now. The PI3-K pathway is a central signaling crossroad that integrates a variety of extracellular signals and controls several cellular functions, including cytoskeletal organization, cell division, and survival maintenance (32Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 33Wennstrom S. Hawkins P.

Using differentiated androgen-sensitive epithelial cells (VDEC) (35Manin M. Lecher P. Martinez A. Tournadre S. Jean C. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Manin M. Martinez A. Van Der Schueren B. Reynaert I. Jean C. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrate that androgens are able to stimulate the PI3-K, leading within minutes to the phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream targets Bad and FKHR-L1. Furthermore, such an activation of the PI3-K survival pathway is associated with a clear protection against apoptosis by androgens in differentiated VDEC. The present data allow us to depict a new mechanism for androgen action on male genital epithelia, which is different from that proposed during fetal and early postnatal development where androgens are described as indirect regulators of epithelial cell physiology via mesenchymal paracrineacting factors such as IGF-I and epidermal growth factor (37Cunha G.R. Prostate Suppl. 1996; 6: 22-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kurita T. Wang Y.Z. Donjacour A.A. Zhao C. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Isaacs J.T. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here, we show that androgens act directly on differentiated epithelial cells and trigger survival signaling by mobilizing the PI3-K, the primary effector of the IGF-I transduction cascade. Interestingly, Li et al. (39Li P. Lee H. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Jenster G. Bai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated a link between androgen and growth factor signaling pathways in DU145 cells in which AR can directly activate the FKHR transcription factor, but in an AKT-independent manner. Nonetheless, such a mechanism is likely to be specific to this tumoral cell line as we observed a rapid increase in the PI3-K-dependent phosphorylation of AKT in response to androgens in non-transformed differentiated epithelial cells. One important issue of this work is to further determine the molecular targets and subsequent mechanisms involved in the androgen-dependent repression of cell death processes in VDEC. Studies of non-genomic mechanisms have shown that steroids could alternatively act through classical steroid receptors or through atypical membrane receptors (40Brann D.W. Hendry L.B. Mahesh V.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that the classical androgen receptor (AR) is required for PI3-K pathway activation. Indeed, in the presence of the anti-androgen bicalutamide, which antagonizes AR, R1881 cannot stimulate AKT Ser473 phosphorylation. Accordingly, in PC3 cells that lack endogenous AR expression, AKT phosphorylation is insensitive to androgens but is enhanced when AR is transiently overexpressed in these cells. This non-genomic stimulation is supported by an interaction of AR with the PI3-K regulatory subunit p85α as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation in VDEC. Our In vitro analyses clearly indicate that two main domains of p85α are involved in the interaction with AR, the SH3 motif and the C-terminal SH2 domain. These domains are known to bind proline-rich regions and phospho-Tyr respectively, and AR has multiple tyrosine residues and a proline stretch in its N-terminal sequence (41Brinkmann A.O. Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C. Kuiper G.G. Ris C. Klaassen P. van der Korput J.A. Voorhorst M.M. van Laar J.H. Mulder E. et al.J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These data strengthened the central role of this AR region in the non-genomic transduction signal. Indeed, the AR proline stretch is known to interact with the SH3 motif of the Src kinase and allows the formation of an active AR-Src kinase complex in a ligand-dependent manner in some breast and prostate cell lines (16Migliaccio A. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. de Falco A. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Barone M.V. Ametrano D. Zannini M.S. Abbondanza C. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5406-5417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we did not observe a ligand-dependent interaction between AR and p85α in pull-down experiments. Such a lack of hormone sensitivity can be explained by the cell-free system context, in which interacting domains are unmasked and available for binding. This hormone-independent interaction between AR and p85α can be linked with AR overexpression in PC3 cells that leads to an increase in AKT phosphorylation in the absence of ligand. We hypothesize that AR overexpression results in the titration of HSP chaperone known to block AR activity in absence of hormone. Such a mechanism could result in constitutive AR/p85α interaction leading to an increase in AKT phosphorylation level in PC3 cells. Another hypothesis is that AR overexpression increases its availability at the plasma membrane, leading to furthered PI3-K stimulation. Taken together, these results clearly points out that the androgenic activation of PI3-K represents an alternative pathway by which androgens could protect the epithelial cells against apoptosis. Further investigations are necessary to determine the extent of the non-genomic androgen actions during genital tract development and/or early prostate carcinogenesis stages. We thank Dr. C. White for advice and critical review of the manuscript and D. Cheyvialle and J.P. Saru for technical assistance."

The biological role of NaChBac, however, is still unknown. In this report, another 11 structurally related bacterial proteins are described.

Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In contrast, the function of prokaryotic voltage-gated ion-selective channels is relatively unknown. Na+ channels may drive Na+-dependent flagellar motors in certain marine and alkaliphilic species (2Asai Y. Yakushi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol.

In marine vibrio, PomAB and MotXY have been proposed to form a functional Na+ channel (5McCarter L.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In alkaliphilic bacteria, the prokaryotic ion channel responsible has not been identified. A bacterial 6-α-helical transmembrane (6TM) channel subunit NaChBac was expressed in CHO cells as a functional voltage-gated Na+ channel (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), but its role in bacteria is still being elucidated. The pore-forming subunits (α1) of mammalian NaV and CaV are composed of four similar repeats of 6TM domains (8Catterall W.A.

Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 10Catterall W.A. Science. 2001; 294: 2306-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The first bacterial voltage-gated Na+ channel (NaChBac) functionally expressed in mammalian cells was cloned from Bacillus halodurans (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It contains a single 6TM domain of 274 amino acids but almost certainly forms a tetramer (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). NaChBac voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics are 10-100 times slower than that of NaV (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). NaChBac inactivation may result from pore inactivation (C-type inactivation), since it does not contain an obvious cytoplasmic inactivation gate (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Because single 6TM Na+-selective ion channels do not appear to be present in vertebrates, the 24 TM structure of NaVs may have arisen under evolutionary selective pressure. It has been proposed that highly Na+-selective NaV channels require pore asymmetry, which is achieved by the concatenated 4 × 6TM structure (11Sun Y.M. Favre I. Schild L. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Yamagishi T. Li R.A. Hsu K. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, tetramers of identical 6TM NaChBac are equally Na+-selective as NaVs (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems more likely that the concatenated 4 × 6TM structure of vertebrate NaVs provided an evolutionary advantage by increasing the speed of activation, inactivation, or recovery from inactivation. To begin to address these questions, we searched for other bacterial ion channel subunits that might reveal the range of the gating speeds provided by the simplest tetrameric Na+-selective channels. This information will also lay the groundwork for understanding their function in prokaryotes. Cloning of NaVPZ—NaChBac protein sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP_242367) was used for a BLASTP search. The nucleotide sequence of NaVPZ was obtained from the published genomic sequence of CcaA protein of Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens (CAD24429).

After mixing 1 μm each of 2F, 3F, 1R, and 2R as a template, the first PCR was conducted using 1F and 3R as primers (10 μm each). Similarly, 4R, 5F, 5R, and 6F were mixed, and PCR was conducted using 4F and 6R as primers. These PCR products were excised from agarose gels. Purified fragments were mixed and used as templates for further PCR, using 1F and 6R as primers. The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and XhoI and purified from an agarose gel. The PCR product was then cloned into pTrcHis2B (Invitrogen). This synthesized DNA contained additional methionine and valine codons prior to the first methionine as required by the cloning strategy. We also intentionally introduced 10 silent mutations (45G→ T, 321G→ T, 330G→ T, 564C→ G, 606C→ G, 624A→ C, 775A→ C, 777G→ T, and 783G→ T) into the synthetic DNA. An additional silent mutation (495T→ C) occurred during the PCR process. Finally, this plasmid DNA was digested with SalI and XhoI and then self-ligated after the linker sequence was deleted. The resultant expression clone was used to transform Escherichia coli BL-21 (Stratagene). NaVPZ was cloned into a modified pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen) containing enhanced green fluorescent protein for expression in mammalian cells.

The genomic sequence homologous to NaChBac was identified, and the preliminary sequence data was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) site on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org. NaVSP was cloned into a pTrcHis2A (Invitrogen) for expression in E. coli. Briefly, DNA was amplified by PCR from a S. pomeroyi genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-AATCCATGGTAATGCAAAGAATGCAGGCCTTT-3′ (containing an NcoI site) and 5′-ATTCTCGAGAGAACCGCGTGGCACCAGCTTTTTGGTTTCACCAAG-3′ (containing a thrombin recognition site and an XhoI site). The PCR product was cloned into the pTrcHis2A plasmid using NcoI and XhoI sites.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—100-300 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was inoculated from glycerol stocks and grown overnight at 30 °C. 40 ml of culture medium was inoculated into 2 liters of Terrific Broth medium (Invitrogen) containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 1.2. Cells were induced with 1 mm 1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 37 °C for 3h. Cells were then suspended in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Sigma) and lysed by sonication. The carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged protein was extracted by homogenization and solubilization in 15 mmn-undecyl-β-d-thiomaltopyranoside (Anatrace). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Talon Co2+ affinity column (Clontech). Resin was washed with 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was then eluted in the presence of 400 mm imidazole. Purified protein was resolved by 4-12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular weight marker was purchased from Invitrogen (BenchMark™ Prestained Protein Ladder). Mammalian Electrophysiology—NaVPZ and NaVSP as well as other NaChBac homologues were subcloned into an enhanced green fluorescence protein-containing pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen) for expression into CHO-K1 and HEK293T cells. CHO-K1 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DNA was transfected using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) and plated onto coverslips, and recordings were made after 12 h (NaVPZ) or 48h (NaVSP), respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the pipette solution contained 147 mm Cs+, 120 mm methane sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 mm glucose. All experiments were conducted at 22 ± 2 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were dissolved in water. Nifedipine (dissolved in Me2SO) was purchased from Sigma. As reported previously (7Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 294: 2372-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), unknown agents, presumably leached from the perfusion tubing, caused fast inactivation, and these perfusion systems were subsequently avoided. Using the whole or partial sequence of NaChBac as the query, we performed standard BLASTP or TBLASTX searches on the GenBank™ data bases from various prokaryotic genomic sequencing projects. Several open reading frames with significant sequence homology (22-54%) to NaChBac were identified in the following species (Fig. 1A): Vibrio vulnificus (22%), Microbulbifer degradans (two genes, 32 and 33%, respectively), Colwellia psychrerythraea (two genes, 35 and 38%, respectively), Magnetococcus sp. (32%), S. pomeroyi (39%), P. zeaxanthinifaciens (39%), Hyphomonas neptunium (33%), Thermobifida fusca (30%), and Oceanobacillus iheyensis (54%). Among these species, V. vulnificus (14Strom M.S. Paranjpye R.N. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), M. degradans (15Gonzalez J.M. Weiner R.M. Int. J. Syst. Evol.

Vancanneyt M. Bretzel W. Mayer A.F. Lopez-Ulibarri R. Shanmugam B. Swings J. Pasamontes L. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and H. neptunium (20Moore R.L. Weiner R.M. Gebers R. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1984; 34: 71-73Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were isolated from sea water or water. T. fusca (21McCarthy A.J. Cross T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 5-25Google Scholar), a thermophilic Gram-positive bacteria, was isolated from soil but grows optimally in alkaliphilic conditions. O. iheyensis (22Lu J. Nogi Y. Takami H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 291-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and B. halodurans (23Takami H. Horikoshi K. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are alkaliphilic Gram-positive bacteria isolated from deep sea water. Based on the degree of sequence homology, we consider these proteins to be NaChBac homologs (rather than orthologs). Hydrophobicity analysis of these proteins predicted that all have the 6TM architecture. Importantly, threonine, glutamate, and tryptophan residues are conserved in the pore region in all proteins (Fig. 1B). These residues have been shown to be critical for the cationic selectivity of NaChBac (24Yue L. Navarro B. Ren D. Ramos A. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As is characteristic for voltage-gated channels (25Yellen G. Nature. 2002; 419: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), positively charged amino acids (Arg) are interspersed every 3 amino acids in the fourth putative transmembrane region (S4) (Fig. 1C). In V. vulnificus M06, however, the third arginine was not conserved. Based on the sequence homology and the structural similarity to NaChBac, it is likely that these proteins function as voltage-gated channels. We cloned all 11 sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”) and studied them by expression in mammalian cell lines. As shown below, we were able to measure currents produced by two NaChBac homologs, NaVPZ (Fig. 2A) from P. zeaxanthinifaciens (a zeaxanthin-producing marine bacteria (19Berry A. Janssens D. Humbelin M. Jore J.P. Hoste B. Cleenwerck I. Vancanneyt M. Bretzel W. Mayer A.F. Lopez-Ulibarri R. Shanmugam B. Swings J. Pasamontes L. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) and NaVSP (Fig. 2A) from S. pomeroyi (a dimethylsulfoniopropionate-degrading marine bacteria (18Gonzalez J.M. Covert J.S. Whitman W.B. Henriksen J.R. Mayer F. Scharf B. Schmitt R. Buchan A. Fuhrman J.A. Kiene R.P. Moran M.A. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)). Isolation and sequencing of the gene encoding NaVPZ revealed an open reading frame of 262 amino acids with a predicted molecular size of 29 kDa. Similarly, the NaVSP gene encoded an open reading frame of 258 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa. NaVPZ and NaVSP share 39% identity (60% similarity) and 39% identity (59% similarity) with NaChBac, respectively (Fig. 2B). Notably, NaVPZ is 65% identical (77% similar) to NaVSP. Upon electrophoresis, both NaVPZ and NaVSP proteins migrated as a single band (∼31 kDa; Fig. 2C), almost identical to the predicted molecular sizes of the His-tagged constructs. CHO-K1 or HEK293T cell lines were transfected with NaChBac homologs (in pTracer), and whole-cell currents were recorded 12-48 h after transfection (see “Experimental Procedures”). Among 11 NaChBac homologs, only two (NaVPZ and NaVSP) produced detectable currents. Similar current are not present in nontransfected or mock-transfected cells (data not shown). NaVPZ-transfected cells exhibited large (up to 10,000 pA; 10 nA) voltage-activated inward currents (Fig. 3, A-C). NaVPZ-mediated current (INaVPZ) activated with a time constant (τactivation) of 21.5 ± 1.3 ms at +10 mV (n = 19), significantly slower than both mammalian NaV channels (τactivation < 2 ms) and INaChBac (τactivation < 13 ms). Inactivation of INaVPZ was slow (τinactivation = 102 ± 4.2 ms at +10 mV, n = 19) compared with the typically fast inactivating NaV currents (τinactivation < 10 ms) but faster than INaChBac (τinactivation > 160 ms). Cation replacement by N-methyl-d-glucamine NMDG (bath) resulted in complete removal of voltage-dependent INaVPZ inward current (Fig. 3C). Similarly, no significant inward current was seen in isotonic [Ca2+]o (monovalent cations replaced with 105 mm Ca2+) (Fig. 3, B and C). INaVPZ reversed at +75 mV (Fig. 3C), close to the Nernst potential of Na+ under our recording conditions (ENa = +72 mV). These results, together with the large leftward shift of the reversal by external Na+ removal (N-methyl-d-glucamine+ and isotonic Ca2+ solution substitution), suggested that NaVPZ, like NaChBac, is a Na+-selective channel. We assumed that the outward currents in 0 mm [Na+]o (Fig. 3B) were carried by internal Na+ (8 mm [Na+]i). Due to the very negative Erev (Fig. 3C), sizable outward currents were observed at most voltages tested (Fig. 3, B and C). We evaluated the voltage-dependent activation of INaVPZ by measuring deactivation tail currents (Fig. 4A). A Boltzmann fit of the averaged activation curve yielded a V1/2 of -9.5 ± 0.8 mV (n = 9) and slope factor (κ) of 10.7 ± 0.7 mV per e-fold change in current (Fig. 4C). Steady-state inactivation of the channel was determined by sequential depolarization to test voltages followed by voltage clamp to the peak of activation at +10 mV (Fig. 4B). Steady-state inactivation was a steep function of voltage, with 50% inactivation at -35 ± 0.4 mV (n = 10) and slope factor (κ) of 6.3 ± 0.3 mV/e-fold (Fig. 4C). We investigated the time course of INaVPZ inactivation at -30 mV, where activation was minimal. The degree and speed of inactivation was strongly dependent on the duration of the inactivating prepulse (-30 mV; τ = 2123 ± 434 ms; n = 6; Fig. 4, D and E). INaVPZ recovered slowly with time constant, τ = 839 ± 90 ms (n = 7, HP = -90 mV, Fig. 4, F and G). NaVSP-transfected cells also yielded voltage-activated inward currents (Fig. 5A), peaking at ∼+30 mV. The Erev of NaVSP-mediated current (INaVSP) was +76 mV. Ion substitution (Ca2+ replacement) experiments confirmed that NaVSP, like NaVPZ, was also a Na+ -selective channel (data not shown). INaVSP activated and inactivated significantly faster than INaVPZ and INaChBac (τactivation = 3.4 ± 0.3 ms at +30 mV, n = 17; τinactivation = 35 ± 1.5 ms at +30 mV, n = 17) but still severalfold slower than NaV currents. The Boltzmann fit activation curve yielded a V of +21 ± 0.4 mV and κ of 11.8 ± 0.4 mV/e-fold change (n = 28; Fig. 5E). Steady state inactivation was strongly dependent on the voltage (κ = 10.3 ± 0.5 mV/e-fold), with half-inactivation at -22 ± 0.8 mV (n = 11; Fig. 5E). NaVPZ and NaVSP were sensitive to high concentrations of nifedipine (30 μm; data not shown). Expression of bacterial genes in systems where the protein can be studied (mammalian cells for patch clamp) is crucial to interpreting and extending static structural data through structure-function studies. Such functional expression is also important to understanding their native roles in bacteria. However, successful functional expression of bacterial proteins in mammalian cells is rare. Here, we identified 11 putative 6TM Na+ prokaryotic channel subunit genes and were able to functionally express 2 of the 11 in mammalian cells, where their electrophysiological properties could be studied. Both channels were Na+-selective and activated by voltage. One conclusion based on comparison of bacterial channels and NaVs is that the major evolutionary pressure for gene duplication and concatenation of subunits was to increase the speed of channel gating. Given the high selectivity of presumed homomeric bacterial Na+ channels, the case for pore asymmetry as a means to increase Na+ selectivity seems a less likely scenario. Little is known about the molecular determinants that control mammalian NaV activation rates. Mammalian NaV channels activate and inactivate within a few milliseconds (<10 ms), roughly 10-100 times faster than NaChBac, the only bacterial voltage-gated channel functionally expressed up to now. Interestingly, NaVSP activation is ∼4-fold faster than NaChBac, whereas NaVPZ activation is ∼2 times slower than NaChBac, despite 77% sequence homology between NaVSP and NaVPZ. In NaVSP, NaVPZ, and NaChBac, the S4 domain and short S3-S4 linker are highly conserved, suggesting that the structural determinants for the kinetics differences are located elsewhere. Notably, there are several NaVSP-specific residues in the putative pore-forming domains (Gly143 in S5, Ile172 in the pore loop, Val189 in the linker between the P loop and S6, and Met202 in S6). These residues may contribute to the relatively fast activation kinetics of NaVSP. Na+ channel inactivation mechanisms are better understood than those of activation. Interdomain linkers mediate fast inactivation in NaVs by “ball and chain” or N type inactivation (26Vassilev P.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 241: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), but these domains are obviously missing in tetramers of 6TM bacterial channels. Additionally, the removal of segments within the N and C cytoplasmic domains of NaChBac (24Yue L. Navarro B. Ren D. Ramos A. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (unpublished data) does not substantially alter its inactivation rate. If the cytoplasmic domains do not participate in inactivation, we can then begin to look at other domains. Studies on 6TM HERG K+ channels indicated that the S5-P linker was crucial for its C-type inactivation, probably by providing allosteric coupling between its outer mouth and the voltage sensor (27Liu J. Zhang M. Jiang M. Tseng G.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NaChBac inactivates with a time constant similar to NaVPZ, but the NaChBac S5-P linker (from Gln167 to Ser180) has low homology to NaVPZ. NaChBac and NaVPZ inactivates 5-fold more slowly than NaVSP. In the pore-S6 linker, NaVSP lacks the negatively charged glutamate present in both NaChBac and NaVPZ. Future studies will focus on this and other sequence differences. However, the difficulty of obtaining functional expression of many mutants highlights the need for structural data. By exclusion of alternative mechanisms, we hypothesize that C-type inactivation, in which the Na+ pore is shut, is the more likely mechanism for NaVBac channel inactivation. Na+ channels have been proposed to play a central role in Na+-dependent flagellar mobility in some prokaryotes. Marine Vibrio species utilize their Na+-driven polar flagella for swimming (5McCarter L.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 6Yorimitsu T. Homma M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and in the alkaliphilic Bacillus species, [Na+]o determines the activity of the flagellar motor (4Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Imae Y. Atsumi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under alkaliphilic conditions, the H+-motive force is weak due to the high intracellular pH (pH 8-9) of these bacteria (4Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Gilmour R. Sturr M.G. Guffanti A.A. Hicks D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, a Na+ cycle driven by the Na+ channel may have evolved to power the flagellar motor (4Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Imae Y. Atsumi T. J. Bioenerg.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, bacteria whose flagellar motors are powered by Na+ (as opposed to H+) express NaChBac homologs. In bacteria, the Na+/H+ exchanger prevents cytotoxic Na+ accumulation and also supports pH homeostasis at elevated pH (4Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Sugiyama S. Matsukura H. Imae Y. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Booth I.R. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10045-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In low [Na+]o environments or in the absence of solutes to support Na+ uptake through Na+-coupled solute transporters, the pH homeostasis function may rely on a Na+ channel (4Krulwich T.A. Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Sugiyama S. Matsukura H. Imae Y.

We propose that sustained voltage-gated Na+ channel opening is primarily responsible for this Na+ entry (33Booth I.R. Edwards M.D. Miller S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10045-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is possible that some mammalian Na+ channels play a role in Na+ or H+ homeostasis. Interestingly, the mammalian persistent and resurgent Na+ currents have similar kinetics to NaVBac (34Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Wood J.N. Nature. 1996; 379: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 35Do M.T. Bean B.P. Neuron. 2003; 39: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These persistent Na+ currents may be mediated by subthreshold gating of fast NaV channels (36Taddese A. Bean B.P. Neuron. 2002; 33: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or perhaps by NaV1.8 and NaV1.9. NaChBac selectivity is converted from Na+ to Ca2+ by replacing an amino acid adjacent to glutamatic acid in the putative pore domain by a negatively charged aspartate (from TLESWAS to TLEDWAS or TLDDWAD) (24Yue L. Navarro B. Ren D. Ramos A. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two bacterial strains (C. psychrerythraea and M. degradans) have a putative pore sequence (TFEDWTD) similar to that of the Ca2+-selective NaChBac mutant. We have not been able to functionally express these channel subunits in mammalian cells, but one possibility is that these proteins form heteromeric channels with other related subunits in the same species.

To determine the involvement of the linker histone C-terminal domain (CTD) in each of these functions, and to test the hypothesis that the functions of this highly basic domain are mediated by neutralization of linker DNA negative charge, four truncation mutants were created that incrementally removed stretches of 24 amino acids beginning at the extreme C terminus of the mouse H10 linker histone.

Linker histones comprise a family of small nucleosome-binding proteins that have a short N terminus, a central winged helix-like globular domain, and a long, highly basic C-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviation used is: CTD, C-terminal domain.1The abbreviation used is: CTD, C-terminal domain.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Binding of linker histones to nucleosomal arrays in vitro influences chromatin fiber structure at multiple levels. It has been widely observed that linker histones protect an additional 20 bp of DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion (2Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function.3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 4Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Upon direct examination, nuclease protection appears to result from linker histone-linker DNA interactions involved in the formation of an apposed linker DNA stem motif (5Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Koster A.J. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), rather than from wrapping additional DNA around the nucleosome as was initially believed (2Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function.3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Linker histones also have important functions in chromatin condensation. They stabilize locally folded secondary chromatin structures, e.g. “30-nm diameter fiber” (2Wolffe A.

Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The linker histone globular domain plays a major role in protecting additional DNA from nuclease digestion (2Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function.3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability to stabilize extensively folded secondary chromatin structures lies exclusively in the linker histone CTD (9Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 11Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The linker histone domains that facilitate fiber self-association have yet to be defined. The biochemical properties of the linker histone CTD are enigmatic. In most isoforms, this domain consists of ∼100 amino acid residues. There is no CTD sequence conservation among the linker histone isoforms (2Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function.3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). However, ∼40% of each somatic linker histone CTD consists of lysine residues that are very evenly distributed throughout the domain (12Subirana J.A. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fact that peptides derived from the linker histone CTD have no detectable secondary structure in solution (3Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar), together with the extensively basic character of this domain, has led to the proposal that the CTD functions in chromatin as an unstructured cationic stretch of amino acids that binds to linker DNA and neutralizes negative charges (11Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Subirana J.A. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There are, however, several hints that the structural features of the linker histone CTD may be more complex. In addition to the large percentage of basic amino acid residues, alanine, serine, threonine, and proline residues also are frequently found in the CTD of mouse H10, chicken H5, and all human somatic linker histones. By contrast, the CTDs of all linker histone isoforms are almost completely deficient in the acidic, aromatic, and highly hydrophobic amino acids. Protein domains having this distinctive amino acid composition are thought to possess “intrinsic disorder” (13Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J.

In the present study we use biochemically defined model systems to probe the mechanistic basis of linker histone CTD function in chromatin. We initially compared the biochemical properties of native chicken erythrocyte H5 and recombinant mouse H10. Subsequently, the structural and functional effects of incremental deletions of the mouse H10 CTD were determined. Our results indicate that distinct subdomains within the CTD are responsible for mediating linker histone effects on linker DNA conformation, and stabilization of condensed chromatin fiber structures. A revised mechanism for CTD function in chromatin is proposed. Construction of Mouse Histone H10 C-terminal Deletion Mutants— The Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and BL21(DE3) pLysS transformed with the plasmid pET-H10-11d were gifts from Dr. Susan Wellman. pET-H10-11d consists of the wild type mouse H10 cDNA cloned into expression vector pET-11d (28Wellman S.E. Song Y. Su D. Mamoon N.M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 117-123PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences encoding C-terminal deletion mutants H10CΔ24, H10CΔ48, H10CΔ72, and H10CΔ97 (see Fig. 2A) were synthesized by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: TACCATGGCTACCGAGAACTCC and TTGGATCCTCAGGCCTTGACTGG for H10CΔ24; TACCATGGCTACCGAGAACTCC and GGGGATCCCTAGGCCTTCTTGA for H10CΔ48; TACCATGGCTACCGAGAACTCC and GGGGATCCTCACTTCTTTGGAGT for H10CΔ72; and TACCATGGCTACCGAGAACTCC and TTGGATCCTCACTTGGCCAGCC for H10CΔ97. PCR products were subcloned into pET-11d using standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to yield expression vectors pET-H10CΔ24–11d, pET-H10CΔ48–11d, pET-H10CΔ72–11d, and pET-H10CΔ97–11d, and propagated in E. coli strain XL1-Blue. The identities of the constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing of purified plasmid DNAs. Histone Purification—Core histone octamers and native chicken erythrocyte linker histone H5 were purified as described previously (30Garcia-Ramirez M. Leuba S.H. Ausio J. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length and mutant H10 proteins, pET-H10-11d, pET-H10CΔ24–11d, pET-H10CΔ48–11d, pET-H10CΔ72–11d, and pET-H10CΔ97–11d were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS-competent cells. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C, harvested, and washed as described (28Wellman S.E. Song Y. Su D. Mamoon N.M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 117-123PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were sonicated, and the H10 proteins were purified as described (32Carter G.J. van Holde K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 33Cerf C. Lippens G. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Ramakrishnan V. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11345-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell pellets were sonicated in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A). The pH of the lysis buffers were 8.3, 8.3, 8.0, 8.0, and 7.8 for H10, H10CΔ24, H10CΔ48, H10CΔ72, and H10CΔ97, respectively. Sonicated cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and then pelleted. The NaCl concentration of the supernatants was decreased to 0.3 m by dilution, the supernatants were mixed with pre-hydrated CM-Sephadex C-25 (C-25) (Sigma), and the mixtures gently rocked for 3 h at 4 °C to allow the binding of the H10 proteins to the C-25. The mixtures were centrifuged to pellet the C-25, the resin was washed in 10 mm Tris·HCl, 1mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 mm NaCl at the same pH as that of the lysis buffer, and the pelleted resin was loaded onto a C-25 column (2.5 × 25 cm) pre-equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. The proteins were eluted from the C-25 column with a 0.3–1.0 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at the same pH as the lysis buffer. At the completion of these steps, H10, H10CΔ48, and H10CΔ97 required no further purification. However, we routinely observed that the fractions containing H10CΔ24 and H10CΔ72 were contaminated with degradation products. Consequently, the C-25 fractions containing either H10CΔ24 or H10CΔ72 were combined, adjusted by dilution to 10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ∼300 mm NaCl at the same pH as that of the lysis buffer, and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The mutant H10 proteins were then eluted with the same gradients used for the C-25 column. The purity of all H10 proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Preparations of 208-12 nucleosomal arrays consisting of ∼50% saturated arrays (12 nucleosomes/template) and ∼50% subsaturated arrays (10–11 nucleosomes/template) were assembled by salt dialysis as described (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Binding of H5 and H10 to 208-12 nucleosomal arrays was achieved by incubating linker histone with nucleosomal arrays (150 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, for 3 h on ice at various molar ratios (r) of linker histone to 208-bp DNA repeat, followed by dialysis of the samples against 10 mm Tris, 0.25 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 (TEN), overnight at 4 °C (6Carruthers L.M.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using either a Beckman XL-A or XL-I ultracentrifuge as described (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C.

Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using Ultrascan (version 5.0) software. Data were plotted as boundary fraction versus s20,w to yield the integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients, G(s). Average sedimentation coefficients were obtained at boundary fractions equal to 0.5 of the G(s) plot. For folding experiments, arrays were mixed with an equal volume of 2× MgCl2 stock solutions prior to sedimentation to obtain the desired final MgCl2 concentration. The final absorbance at 260 nm of all samples was 0.6–0.8. Agarose Multigel Electrophoresis—Electrophoretic mobilities, μ, were measured in a multigel composed of 9 individual agarose running gels ranging in concentration from 0.2 to 1.0%. The casting and running buffer was 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 0.25 mm Na2EDTA. Samples were loaded and electrophoresed at 1.33 V/cm for 6 h. The temperature was 24 ± 3 °C. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and the gel image was digitized. For each individual band, the migration was measured from the center of the well to the center of the band using NIH Image software and subsequently converted to μ. The effective macromolecular radius (Re) and free-electrophoretic mobility (μo) were obtained from μ as described (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C.

Self-association Assay—The salt-dependent self-association of H5- and H10-bound nucleosomal arrays was determined using a differential centrifugation assay as described (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each salt concentration assayed, data were plotted as the percentage of the initial sample absorbance that remained in the supernatant after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The Ability of Chicken Erythrocyte H5 and Recombinant Mouse H10 to Bind to Nucleosomal Arrays, Alter Linker DNA Conformation, and Stabilize Condensed Secondary and Tertiary Chromatin Structures, Is Indistinguishable—The experiments described below extend our previous studies of linker histone structure-function relationships (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

The linker histone used in our earlier experiments was H5 purified from chicken erythrocytes. However, given that recombinant chicken erythrocyte H5 is expressed very poorly in bacterial cells (39Gerchman S.E. Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this linker histone isoform is a poor candidate for mutagenesis studies. Because the H10 isoform is considered to be the mammalian functional homologue of chicken H5 (40Pehrson J. Cole R.D. Nature. 1980; 285: 43-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 41Pehrson J.R. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and mouse H10 can be readily expressed and purified from E. coli (28Wellman S.E. Song Y. Su D. Mamoon N.M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 117-123PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant mouse H10 was chosen for all studies involving recombinant proteins. To determine whether the in vitro properties of purified chicken H5 and recombinant mouse H10 were the same, we directly compared the binding of these linker histone isoforms to biochemically defined nucleosomal arrays, and characterized their respective abilities to stabilize condensed chromatin structures in salt (Fig. 1). Binding was assayed by determining the increase in average s20,w of 208-12 nucleosomal arrays in low salt TEN buffer as a function of the molar linker histone input ratio (rLH). Under these low salt conditions, nucleosomal arrays and chromatin fibers are unfolded, and there is no contribution to the s20,w from higher order folding. Instead, the increase in s20,w results from a combination of the mass of the bound linker histone, and a decreased array frictional coefficient (i.e. shortening of the overall length of the unfolded 12-mer array) because of linker histone-dependent formation of an apposed linker DNA stem motif (5Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Koster A.J. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using native chicken erythrocyte H5 showed that binding of approximately one H5 per nucleosome was achieved at rLH ≅ 1.3, and led to an increase in average s20,w in low salt from 29 to 36 S (Refs. 6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 7Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37285-37290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar; also see Table I). Binding of native chicken erythrocyte H5 and recombinant mouse H10 to 208-12 nucleosomal arrays is shown in Fig. 1A. Consistent with our previous studies, both linker histone isoforms caused an increase in average s20,w with increasing rLH, until a narrow plateau region was achieved at rLH = 1.2–1.3. The average s20,w in this plateau region was 36.8 ± 0.7 S for chicken erythrocyte H5 and 35.9 ± 0.3 S for recombinant H10. We previously have shown that the plateau is narrow because the average s20,w increases rapidly at higher rLH values because of nonspecific linker histone binding and aggregation (Fig. 1A) (6Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

The data in Fig. 1A demonstrate that, within experimental error, stoichiometric binding of native chicken erythrocyte H5 and recombinant mouse H10 to 208-12 nucleosomal arrays was achieved at the same molar linker histone input ratio, and led to the same increase in sedimentation coefficient under low salt conditions.Table ILinker histone stoichiometriesrLHzaCalculated total macromolecular charge.μ0StoichiometrybStoichiometry = [zNA(μ0LH - μ0NA)/μ0NA]/zLH.× 10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1NAcParent 208-12 nucleosomal arrays.-327-1.95 ± 0.2dValues represent the mean ± Sd of two to three determinations.H5eH5 stoichiometries calculated by the same method in previous studies were 1.3 ± 0.2 (6) and 1.4 ± 0.2 (7).1.361-1.55 ± .011.1 ± 0.1dValues represent the mean ± Sd of two to three determinations.H101.353-1.63 ± .031.0 ± 0.1H10Δ241.841-1.64 ± .011.3 ± 0.1H10Δ482.030-1.67 ± .011.6 ± 0.1H10Δ722.321-1.79 ± .021.3 ± 0.2H10Δ972.314-1.81 ± .011.7 ± 0.2a Calculated total macromolecular charge.b Stoichiometry = [zNA(μ0LH - μ0NA)/μ0NA]/zLH.c Parent 208-12 nucleosomal arrays.d Values represent the mean ± Sd of two to three determinations.e H5 stoichiometries calculated by the same method in previous studies were 1.3 ± 0.2 (6Carruthers L.M.

In TEN, ∼50% of both the H5- and H10-bound arrays sedimented at 36–37 S (boundary fraction ≥50%), indicating that this fraction consisted of 208-12 DNA templates stoichiometrically bound with 12 histone octamers/template and 1 linker histone per nucleosome (see Fig. 1A) (6Carruthers L.M.

https://openalex.org/W1967036562,"The molecular chaperone Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae dissolves protein aggregates in the cell and is thus of crucial importance for the thermotolerance of yeast. In addition to this disaggregase activity, Hsp104 has a key function in yeast prion propagation, as Hsp104 was found to be essential for the maintenance of the associated phenotypes. In vivo data suggest that Hsp104 function is affected by guanidinium chloride. Adding small amounts of this compound to yeast medium causes curing of the prions: cells lose their prion-related phenotype. Guanidinium chloride was also found to impair heat shock resistance. Here, we present a detailed in vitro analysis showing that guanidinium chloride is an uncompetitive inhibitor of Hsp104. Micromolar concentrations of this agent reduce the ATPase activity of Hsp104 to ∼35% of its normal activity. This inhibition is not related to the denaturing properties of this compound, because Hsp104 was not affected by urea. Guanidinium ions selectively bind to the nucleotide-bound, hexameric state of the molecular chaperone. Thus, they increase the affinity of Hsp104 for adenine nucleotides and promote the nucleotide-dependent oligomerization of the chaperone. Our findings strongly suggest that guanidinium chloride causes curing of yeast prions by perturbing the ATPase of Hsp104, which is essential for both prion propagation and thermotolerance.

Micromolar concentrations of this agent reduce the ATPase activity of Hsp104 to ∼35% of its normal activity. This inhibition is not related to the denaturing properties of this compound, because Hsp104 was not affected by urea. Guanidinium ions selectively bind to the nucleotide-bound, hexameric state of the molecular chaperone. Thus, they increase the affinity of Hsp104 for adenine nucleotides and promote the nucleotide-dependent oligomerization of the chaperone. Our findings strongly suggest that guanidinium chloride causes curing of yeast prions by perturbing the ATPase of Hsp104, which is essential for both prion propagation and thermotolerance. Aggregation of proteins is a common phenomenon in living cells. Protein aggregates can, for example, form during stress conditions such as heat shock or the biogenesis of labile proteins. The molecular chaperone Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is crucial for the disaggregation of protein aggregates and thus constitutes a major factor for thermotolerance in yeast (1Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Disaggregation appears to be a complex process requiring the assistance of several other chaperones, including the Hsp70 system (3Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of this reaction are poorly understood. In addition to its involvement in thermotolerance, Hsp104 plays a key role in the propagation and inheritance of the yeast prions [PSI+] and [URE3] (4Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B.

Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism is still unknown, it is likely that in both cases, thermotolerance and prion propagation, analogous interactions with non-soluble protein aggregates occur (8Narayanan S. Bosl B. Walter S. Reif B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9286-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When the expression level of Hsp104 is decreased, both the recovery from heat stress and prion replication are affected (4Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 7Moriyama H. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the addition of small amounts of the chaotropic salt guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) 1The abbreviations used are: GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; Gdm+, guanidinium ion; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; SLS, static light scattering; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. to the growth medium also leads to a loss of prion propagation, a phenomenon termed curing (11Tuite M.F. Mundy C.R. Cox B.S. Genetics. 1981; 98: 691-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curing by GdmCl has been observed for all yeast prions tested to date (9Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 10Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although GdmCl seems to inhibit the replication of the prions (15Eaglestone S.S. Ruddock L.W. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Ness F. Ferreira P. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5593-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that it does not target the prion proteins themselves but Hsp104. First, GdmCl blocks the disaggregase activity of Hsp104 in vivo and reduces the thermotolerance of yeast (17Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Jung G. Masison D.C. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Second, both GdmCl-treated and Hsp104-deficient yeast cells have similar phenotypes in respect to prion propagation (17Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Jung G. Masison D.C. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that, in yeast strains with a point mutation in Hsp104 (D184S), prion phenotypes can no longer be cured by GdmCl (19Jung G. Jones G. Masison D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9936-9941Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Finally, Glover and Lindquist noted that low residual concentrations of GdmCl during re-activation of chemically denatured luciferase inhibit ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 (3Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Hsp104 and its prokaryotic homologue, ClpB, belong to the Hsp100/Clp protein family (20Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whose members possess characteristic nucleotide-binding domains of the AAA-ATPase (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) type. As a general feature, AAA-ATPases promote structural changes in bound substrates by ATP-driven conformational movements (21Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Hsp104 has two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2, and forms ring-shaped hexamers (23Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomerization equilibrium is highly dynamic and is influenced by numerous parameters, including not only protein concentration but also ionic strength and nucleotides. In the absence of nucleotides, Hsp104 is a mixture of monomeric and hexameric species, but other species such as dimers may exist as well (24Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Binding of ADP or ATP to NBD2 shifts this distribution toward the hexameric form (23Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High salt concentrations, on the other hand, stabilize monomeric Hsp104 (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, ATP turnover by Hsp104 seems to be highly dependent on its quaternary structure. Studies by Lindquist and co-workers showed that mutants of Hsp104 that are defective in oligomerization possess virtually no ATPase activity (24Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). While NBD2 is involved in Hsp104 assembly, NBD1 seems to account for most of the ATP hydrolysis of Hsp104 under steady-state conditions (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here, we present a detailed in vitro analysis showing that GdmCl is an uncompetitive inhibitor of Hsp104. GdmCl binds only to the nucleotide-bound form of Hsp104 and increases the affinity to nucleotides while reducing kcat at the same time. Our results confirm a direct link between prion curing and inactivation of Hsp104. Cloning of Hsp104 Gene from S. cerevisiae—The gene encoding Hsp104 was isolated from yeast strain W303 using PCR amplification with appropriate primers (forward, 5′-AAA AAG CAT GCA GGA CCA AAC GCA ATT TAC AGA AAG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAA AGG ATC CTT AAT CTA GGT CAT CAT CAA TTT C-3′). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pQE70 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using restriction sites for SphI and BamHI. The insert contained the authentic stop codon, resulting in a protein that lacks the C-terminal His6 tag encoded by the vector. Successful cloning was verified by DNA sequencing. Production of Recombinant Hsp104 —Plasmids carrying the Hsp104 genes were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). For protein production, 6 liters of Luria Bertani medium containing 100 mg/l ampicillin were inoculated with an overnight culture. Flasks were incubated at 30 °C until the culture had reached an A600 nm of ∼0.8. Expression of Hsp104 was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested 3 h later. Purification of Hsp104 was carried out as described previously (26Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The concentration of Hsp104 was determined using an extinction coefficient of ϵ276 nm = 31,900 m–1 cm–1. Molar concentrations of Hsp104 refer to the monomeric species. ATPase Assays—ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 was monitored using a coupled enzymatic assay in combination with an ATP-regenerating system (27Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This setup avoids some of the problems arising from the fact that ADP binds to Hsp104 more strongly than ATP does and, thus, is a potent competitive inhibitor (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ATP hydrolyzed by Hsp104 is regenerated by pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), resulting in the formation of pyruvate. In a second step, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase and NADH, a reaction that can be followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The assay mixture contained 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml l-lactate dehydrogenase (both from rabbit muscle). All enzymes and reagents used in the assay were from Roche Applied Science. Assays were carried out in thermostatted 120-μl cuvettes at 30 °C using a Cary50 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Assays were performed in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 5 mm ATP and 0.5 μm Hsp104 unless indicated otherwise. The rate of ATP hydrolysis, V, was determined from the slope dA340 nm/dt using a molar absorbance coefficient for NADH of ϵ340 nm = 6,200 m–1cm–1. For each data point, four independent measurements were carried out to calculate the mean value. The corresponding S.D. values are shown as error bars in the respective figures. To simplify the comparison of rates obtained for different enzyme concentrations, we use the apparent rate constant of hydrolysis, kapp = V/[Hsp104], to quantify ATP turnover. To evaluate the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on ATP concentration, values of V were fitted to the model of Michaelis-Menten, shown in Equation 1, V=kcat·[E]0[ATP][ATP]+Km(Eq. 1) in which kcat is the rate constant of turnover under saturation conditions, [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant. Static Light Scattering (SLS)—SLS measurements of Hsp104 were carried out in assay buffer at 20 °C using a miniDAWN Tristar detector (Wyatt Tec., Santa Barbara) equipped with a flow cell. Samples containing 0.5–2.5 μm Hsp104, 5 mm GdmCl, and 5 mm ADP in various combinations were injected. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton). All experiments were performed at 30 °C using assay buffer. For the binding of GdmCl to Hsp104 or Hsp104·nucleotide complexes, experiments were carried out using 14.1 mm GdmCl in the injection syringe and an injection volume of 5 μl. The protein concentration in the cell was 30 μm. For the binding of ADP to Hsp104 in presence of GdmCl, the injection syringe was filled with a solution of 2.82 mm nucleotide. The protein concentration in the cell was 25 μm. Identical concentrations of GdmCl were added to the syringe and the cell. Data analysis was performed with the Origin software package (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV/Vis-optics and interference optics. Rotation speed for sedimentation runs was 50,000 rpm, and the protein was detected based on the absorbance at 280 nm. Scans were performed every 7 min. Aluminum centerpieces were used that contained the buffer and the protein solution (10 μm) in separate chambers. Measurements were carried out in 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 800 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. To examine the influence of GdmCl on hexamerization, samples additionally contained 30 μm ADP and/or 10 mm GdmCl. The distance of the sedimentation boundary from the center of the rotor, r, was determined for every scan, and the sedimentation coefficient, s, was calculated using Equation 2, lnrr0=s·ω2·(t-t0)(Eq. 1) in which r0 represents the position of the boundary at the start of the experiment, t0, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, and t is the time of the scan. Low Concentrations of GdmCl Inhibit ATP Hydrolysis by Hsp104 —We first determined the influence of GdmCl on ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 under steady-state conditions. Because of the strong inhibitory effect of ADP on Hsp104 (see below), we employed an assay that contains an ATP-regenerating system consisting of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that GdmCl markedly reduces the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at concentrations as low as 30 μm. However, even at saturating concentrations of GdmCl (up to 100 mm; data not shown), ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 is not abolished completely but only drops to ∼50% of the initial value. Because GdmCl may simply affect Hsp104 because of its denaturing properties, we performed assays using urea instead of GdmCl. In contrast to GdmCl, urea had no effect on ATP hydrolysis even at concentrations exceeding 10 mm (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with findings that, unlike GdmCl, urea cannot cure yeast prion phenotypes (28Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. McLaughlin C.S. Yeast. 1988; 4: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, we can rule out that GdmCl interferes with the ATPase activity of the chaperone by simply denaturing Hsp104. Furthermore, we conclude that the guanidinium ions (Gdm+) and not the chloride ions are responsible for the inhibition of Hsp104, because the assay buffer contains a salt background of 150 mm KCl. To verify the specificity of this effect, we examined whether GdmCl could inhibit other ATP-hydrolyzing, oligomeric chaperones such as GroEL and Hsp90. None of these enzymes exhibited sensitivity to GdmCl (data not shown). Thus, we can exclude that Gdm+ inhibits the enzymes in the regenerative ATPase assay or changes the catalytic properties of ATPases in general. GdmCl Does Not Affect Hexamerization of Hsp104 —It has been shown previously that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is highly dependent on the oligomeric state of Hsp104. The assembly into hexamers strongly increases the ATPase activity (24Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, Gdm+ could indirectly reduce the apparent rate constant of ATP turnover, kapp, by stabilizing the less active monomers. To distinguish between direct inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and indirect effects on oligomerization, we used SLS to determine whether Gdm+ changes the apparent molecular weight of Hsp104. Samples containing Hsp104, GdmCl, and ADP in various combinations were loaded on the sample loop of an high pressure liquid chromatography system and then injected into a SLS detector equipped with a flow cell. Fig. 2A shows a representative SLS trace for Hsp104 at a concentration of 1 μm. Upon the addition of 5 mm ADP, the scattering signal increases by 120% (cf. traces 1 and 3), indicating an increase in the apparent molecular weight due to the ADP-induced hexamerization of the chaperone. Because the samples contained some particles with high scattering intensity, we were not able to accurately calculate the apparent molecular weight. However, Fig. 2A clearly shows that ADP promotes the oligomerization of Hsp104 and that our experimental setup is suited to detect changes in the oligomeric state of Hsp104. When samples containing GdmCl were injected, we did not observe significant changes in the apparent molecular weight of the protein in comparison to the measurements in the absence of GdmCl (Fig. 2A). Thus, Gdm+ does not seem to disrupt the oligomeric state of the chaperone, either in the presence or the absence of ADP. Support for this conclusion comes from experiments in which we determined the influence of protein concentration on the Gdm+ effect. When the concentration of Hsp104 is increased from 0.5 to 5 μm, the apparent rate of hydrolysis, kapp, increases slightly from 42 to 57 min–1 (Fig. 2B, black bars). In the presence of 5 mm GdmCl, the activity of Hsp104 drops by ∼50%, irrespective of the protein concentration used in the assay (Fig. 2B, white bars). This result argues against Gdm+ being an inhibitor of oligomerization. Otherwise, its inhibitory effect should be less pronounced at high protein concentrations, where the hexameric state of Hsp104 is more stable. Binding of Gdm+to Hsp104 Is Nucleotide-dependent—As demonstrated above, GdmCl is not an inhibitor of oligomerization but specifically reduces ATP turnover. To obtain a more detailed picture, we directly studied the interaction between Gdm+ and Hsp104 using ITC. When GdmCl was titrated to Hsp104 in the absence of ADP, no binding signal could be monitored (Fig. 3A). Thus, Gdm+ does not seem to bind to nucleotide-free Hsp104. However, when we carried out the titration with 5 mm ADP present in both injection syringe and sample cell, we did observe binding of Gdm+ to Hsp104 (Fig. 3B). Using a model with one binding site per monomer, the analysis of the ITC data yielded an apparent KD of 600 μm. In the absence of Hsp104, no signal could be observed (data not shown). We can therefore rule out that the signal reflects the formation of a complex between Gdm+ and ADP. Further experiments showed that Gdm+ binds to Hsp104·ATPγS and Hsp104·AMPPNP with similar affinity (data not shown). In summary, our results suggest that Gdm+ interacts only with nucleotide-bound Hsp104, although the type of adenine nucleotide seems to be less important. Gdm+Increases the Affinity of Hsp104 for Nucleotides— Because Gdm+ only binds to Hsp104 in the presence of nucleotide, thermodynamics predicts that GdmCl, in turn, should promote nucleotide binding. Thus, we carried out a series of ITC experiments in which we titrated Hsp104 with an ADP stock solution in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdmCl. From the binding curves, we calculated the corresponding KD for ADP. The signal-to-noise ratio of the ITC data was not sufficient to discriminate between binding to NBD1 and NBD2, respectively, and we fitted the data to a simplified model with just one (average) binding site (Fig. 4). It is apparent that increasing concentrations of GdmCl enhance the binding of ADP to Hsp104. In the absence of GdmCl, ADP binds with an apparent KD of ∼50 μm. In the presence of 10 mm GdmCl, this value decreases to ∼25 μm. The increased affinity toward ADP is mainly due to an increase in binding enthalpy, ΔH, in the presence of GdmCl (data not shown). At saturating concentrations of GdmCl, binding of ADP is 2.5 times tighter than in the absence of GdmCl. Gdm+Stimulates the Assembly of the Hsp104 Hexamer— Our ITC measurements show that the affinity of Hsp104 for nucleotides is increased in the presence of GdmCl. Because nucleotide binding induces hexamerization of Hsp104, we next asked whether Gdm+ could also promote the nucleotide-dependent hexamerization of Hsp104. The SLS traces recorded in the presence of ADP seem to indicate that this is not the case (cf.Fig. 2A). However, these measurements were carried out under conditions where Hsp104 was completely hexameric, and a stimulatory effect of Gdm+ would have gone unnoticed. Thus, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation to search for conditions under which Hsp104 is dissociated even in the presence of ADP. Our screen showed that, at 800 mm KCl, the sedimentation coefficient of Hsp104 hardly increases upon the addition of 30 μm ADP (8.7 versus 8 S), indicating that the protein can no longer associate under these conditions (compare Fig. 5C). This is in agreement with a study reporting that, at a high salt concentration, the hexameric state of Hsp104 is destabilized (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The sedimentation profile of a protein sample containing 800 mm KCl and 30 μm ADP is shown in Fig. 5A. The lines represent absorbance scans recorded at increasing times of sedimentation. Upon the addition of 10 mm GdmCl to the buffer (Fig. 5B), the sedimentation of the protein is significantly faster (s = 13.3 S), suggesting that the hexameric species becomes more populated. This stimulatory effect of Gdm+ on Hsp104 assembly is even more evident when the migration of the sedimentation boundary is plotted as a function of time (Fig. 5C). The slope of this graph is a measure for the sedimentation velocity of the protein. Clearly, sedimentation is faster in the presence of GdmCl, indicating that Hsp104 increases in size. Importantly, we only observed this effect of Gdm+ when ADP was present in the sample (data not shown). These results demonstrate that GdmCl can indeed stimulate the association of Hsp104 under conditions where nucleotide-dependent hexamerization is energetically less favorable. Gdm+Is an Uncompetitive Inhibitor of Hsp104 —To further characterize the inhibitory effect of Gdm+ on ATP hydrolysis, we examined the dependence of the turnover number on ATP concentration, both in the presence and the absence of GdmCl. In the absence of GdmCl, a plot of ATP turnover versus ATP concentration shows a Michaelis-Menten-like profile with an apparent Km of ∼11 mm (Fig. 6A). The low affinity of Hsp104 toward ATP has been reported before, although the values of Km and kcat seem to be highly dependent on the experimental conditions, especially on pH and ionic strength (29Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although Km is only a crude measure for substrate affinity, it becomes obvious why using an ATP regenerating system is crucial in the case of Hsp104. ADP binding is stronger by at least two orders of magnitude (Fig. 4), and, therefore, ADP is a very potent competitive inhibitor. Above 25 mm ATP, the regenerative ATPase assay system became less reliable, and we were thus not able to obtain accurate data at higher ATP concentrations. The maximum turnover number, kcat, was determined to be in the range of 70 min–1, in good agreement with previous studies (24Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of Hsp104 under these conditions is lower than the numbers shown in Fig. 1. This is due to an increase in MgCl2 concentration from 10 to 25 mm (data not shown) and may be explained by the pronounced salt sensitivity of Hsp104 (29Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm GdmCl, the kinetics of hydrolysis again follow a Michaelis-Menten-like behavior, but the respective parameters Km and kcat are changed (Fig. 6A). At high ATP concentrations, the turnover number is 27 min–1, only 35% of the value determined in the absence of GdmCl. At the same time, the Km for ATP is decreased to 4 mm, indicating that ATP binds more tightly in the presence of GdmCl. This finding is consistent with the effect of GdmCl on ADP binding that we observed using ITC (Fig. 4). The effect of Gdm+ is best described by the model of uncompetitive inhibition in which the inhibitor reversibly binds to the enzyme·substrate complex (here, Hsp104·ATP) and renders it less active (30Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 136-143Google Scholar). Because the turnover of the enzyme·substrate complex is slowed down (or even abolished), kcat will be decreased in the presence of the inhibitor. At the same time, the inhibitor stabilizes the enzyme·substrate complex, resulting in a decrease of Km. This type of inhibition can be easily identified: It gives rise to a series of parallel lines in a Lineweaver-Burk plot, because Km and kcat are reduced to the same extent. This is exactly what we observe for GdmCl (Fig. 6B). In the presence of 5 mm GdmCl, both Km and kcat decrease ∼2.5-fold. It is well established that the presence of 1–5 mm GdmCl in the growth medium can cure yeast prion phenotypes, presumably by the inhibition of Hsp104 (9Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 10Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tuite M.F.

Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our results show that, in vitro, these low concentrations of GdmCl indeed change the enzymatic properties of Hsp104, thereby providing a strong link between curing and Hsp104 inactivation. Our data also demonstrate that inactivation is not related to the denaturing properties of GdmCl, because 100 times higher amounts of urea have no effect on ATP hydrolysis. This is in perfect agreement with in vivo experiments showing that urea lacks the curing potency of GdmCl (28Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. McLaughlin C.S. Yeast. 1988; 4: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Binding of Gdm+to Hsp104·Nucleotide Complexes—Our ITC experiments demonstrate that binding of Gdm+ to Hsp104 is dependent on nucleotides; no binding was observed in the absence of ADP. Thus, either the nucleotide directly contacts Gdm+, or the binding of Gdm+ requires a conformational change in Hsp104 that is induced by nucleotides. Gdm+ as a cation could, for example, interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the bound nucleotide. This, in turn, could slow down ATP hydrolysis, for instance by masking the γ-phosphate group from catalytic residues or the attacking water molecule. However, residues from the protein must participate in the binding of Gdm+ as well because free ADP did not form a complex with GdmCl, and other ATPases, such as GroEL and Hsp90, were not affected by GdmCl. Gdm+Is an Uncompetitive Inhibitor of Hsp104 —The effect of GdmCl on ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 is adequately described by the model of uncompetitive inhibition, which requires the following: (i) that Gdm+ binds to the enzyme·substrate complex, Hsp104·ATP, but not to the free enzyme; and (ii) that both Km and kcat are reduced to the same extent. The inhibition by Gdm+ is only partial, i.e. the ternary enzyme·substrate·inhibitor complex, Hsp104· ATP·Gdm+, can still form the product, although more slowly than Hsp104·ATP. In agreement with our experimental findings, the model also predicts that the inhibitory effect becomes more pronounced at a high ATP concentration (compare Fig. 6A), because the species the inhibitor binds to, Hsp104·ATP, is more populated under these conditions. It is not known which step is rate-limiting in ATP hydrolysis under steady-state conditions. But if turnover is governed by product dissociation, GdmCl may simply decrease the off rate of ADP by a factor of 2.5. This would account for both the decreased KD we measured with ITC and the smaller kcat in the hydrolysis experiments. Furthermore, Gdm+ may not only change the rate of hydrolysis but also the molecular context of this reaction. In the case of the GroE chaperone, (productive) ATP hydrolysis occurs in a quantized manner, i.e. the seven ATP molecules bound to one ring are hydrolyzed simultaneously (31Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Any compound that could affect this cooperativity would render GroE non-functional although the effect on overall ATP turnover may be small. Furthermore, one could envision that Gdm+ blocks the transmission of the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to the site on Hsp104 where the “work” is actually done, whatever this work may be on a molecular level. These possibilities are, of course, not mutually exclusive. Molecular Mechanism of Prion Curing in Yeast—Interestingly, ATP hydrolysis of Hsp104 is not completely abolished in the presence of GdmCl. Under saturating conditions it is reduced to 35% of its normal level. In vivo data, on the other hand, suggest that Hsp104 function is lost entirely when yeast grows in medium containing GdmCl, because its phenotype resembles that of an hsp104 knockout. A closer look at the time dependence of curing in vivo may provide an explanation for this seeming contradiction. Wegrzyn et al. report that, although growing [PSI+] cells in medium containing GdmCl causes curing of the prion phenotype, this process is significantly slower than curing by removal or inactivation of Hsp104 (32Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Whereas in the first case [psi–] cells only appear after at least 3–5 generations, curing in the second case already starts after two generations. The authors interpret these differences in curing kinetics by suggesting that either the mechanism of curing by GdmCl is independent of Hsp104 or that GdmCl does not completely inactivate Hsp104. Our results are in agreement with the latter possibility; we find that Gdm+ only partially inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp104. Additional support comes from experiments in which the cellular level of Hsp104 was reduced. For curing to occur, it was sufficient to decrease the expression of the chaperone to ∼25% of the normal level (32Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Over the past years, a wealth of data has been accumulated both in vivo and in vitro, showing convincingly that destroying the capability of Hsp104 to hydrolyze ATP results in a loss of function (29Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Most of these studies have been carried out with mutants in which conserved lysine residues in NBD1 (K218T) and/or NBD2 (K620T) have been replaced by threonine. These mutations strongly reduce the capability of the affected domain to bind or hydrolyze nucleotides (29Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both mutations reduce the thermotolerance of yeast (20Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and can cause curing of the [PSI+] phenotype (16Ness F. Ferreira P. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5593-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our results now provide evidence that, more specifically, the rate of hydrolysis of ATP is important for the biological activity of Hsp104. In the presence of GdmCl, nucleotide binding to Hsp104 is even enhanced. Nevertheless, its chaperone function in vivo is severely compromised. Hattendorf and Lindquist have shown that, under steady-state conditions, NBD1 accounts for most of the ATPase activity displayed by Hsp104 (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, we assume that Gdm+ slows down ATP turnover in NBD1, which, in turn, decreases the biological activity of Hsp104. Eaglestone et al. have put forward a conclusive model in which GdmCl prevents the Hsp104-mediated formation of new prion seeds and thus blocks further prion replication (15Eaglestone S.S. Ruddock L.W. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The prion phenotype will eventually be lost, because the existing seeds become diluted in the following cell divisions. Although we currently do not understand the molecular mechanism of seed formation by Hsp104, our findings show that ATP turnover is essential in this process. We thank B. Bösl, P.

Although these compounds bind to PPARγ transcription factors as agonists, emerging evidence suggests that TGZ acts independently of PPARγ in many functions, including apoptosis. We previously reported that TGZ induces an early growth response transcription factor (EGR-1) by the ERK phosphorylation pathway rather than by the PPARγ pathway (Baek, S. J., Wilson, L. C., Hsi, L. C., and Eling, T. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5845-5853). In this report, we show that the expression of the antitumorigenic and/or pro-apoptotic gene NAG-1 (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1) is induced by TGZ and correlates with EGR-1 induction. In cotransfection and gel shift assays, we show that EGR-1-binding sites are located within region -73 to -51 of the NAG-1 promoter and have an important role in the transactivation of TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. In contrast, PGJ2 induced NAG-1 protein expression, but PJG2 may not affect the same region that TGZ does in the NAG-1 promoter. The effect of PGJ2 is probably PPARγ-dependent because a PPARγ antagonist inhibited the PGJ2-induced expression of NAG-1. TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression was not inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist. The fact that TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression was accompanied by the biosynthesis of EGR-1 also suggests that EGR-1 plays a pivotal role in TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. Our results suggest that EGR-1 induction is a unique property of TGZ, but is independent of PPARγ activation. The up-regulation of NAG-1 may provide a novel explanation for the antitumorigenic property of TGZ.

Furthermore, TGZ and PGJ2 affect several pathways in a PPARγ-independent manner. TGZ up-regulates nitric oxide synthesis (19Hattori Y. Hattori S. Kasai K.

Barbieri S.S. Poma F. Tremoli E. Colli S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) independent of PPARγ. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that TGZ induces the early growth response gene EGR-1 independently of the PPARγ transcription factor (25Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol.

However, the molecular mechanism by which TGZ and PGJ2 exhibit antitumorigenesis, other than by PPARγ activation, is not known. The EGR-1 transcription factor (also known as NGFI-A, TIS8, krox-24, and zif268) is a member of the immediate-early gene family and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in response to signals such as mitogens, growth factors, and stress stimuli. EGR-1 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene (26Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar, 27Calogero A. Arcella A. De Gregorio G.

Moreover, EGR-1 is down-regulated in several types of neoplasia as well as in an array of tumor cell lines (33Huang R.P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E.D.

Although the expression of NAG-1 is regulated by several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs independent of cyclooxygenase (40Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Lee C.H. Eling T.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it is also regulated by several antitumorigenic compounds, including resveratrol (38Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), genistein (41Wilson L. Baek S.J. Call A. Eling T. Int. J.

Although Sp1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-1 are essential factors in the regulation of the basal level of NAG-1 expression, compound-induced NAG-1 expression at the transcriptional level has not been fully characterized. In this study, we examine the relationship between PPARγ ligands and NAG-1 expression. PPARγ ligands, including TGZ and PGJ2, induce NAG-1 expression in human colorectal cancer cells. We found that TGZ induces EGR-1 expression, followed by induction of NAG-1 at the transcription level, whereas PGJ2 does not induce EGR-1. Rather, NAG-1 seems to be induced by PGJ2 through the PPARγ transcription factor because a PPARγ antagonist inhibited NAG-1 expression. EGR-1 induction by TGZ appears to be independent of PPARγ because other PPARγ ligands did not induce EGR-1, and PPARγ-binding sites are not located in the TGZ response element in the NAG-1 promoter. These data suggest that the expression of NAG-1 provides a novel mechanism for understanding how TGZ exerts its antitumorigenic activity.

Construction of Plasmids—The full-length EGR-1 cDNA in the pcDNA3 expression vector was described previously (25Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5845-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The luciferase constructs containing the NAG-1 promoter and Sp1 in the pcDNA3 expression vector were generated previously (43Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pNAG133/+70 constructs were previously generated (38Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The pNAG41/+70 construct was generated using primers 5′-AAGTCCGGGGACTATAAAGGCCGGTCCGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAGAGCCATTCACCGTCCTGAGTTC-3′ (antisense). After PCR, the fragment was cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and further cloned into the pGLBasic3 vector digested with XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The NGFI-A-binding protein NAB1 cDNA in the expression vector was cloned by PCR from the IMAGE:843249 clone (Invitrogen) using primers 5′-TCCAGAGTAATGGCTGCGGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCACAGCTATCTTGAATCTTC-3′ (antisense). The amplified products were cloned into the pCR2.1/TOPO vector (Invitrogen), followed by cloning into the pcDNA3.1/NEO expression vector. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HCT-116 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After growth for 16 h, plasmid mixtures containing 1 μg of NAG-1 promoter linked to luciferase and 0.1 μg of pRL-null (Promega, Madison, WI) were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the cotransfection experiment, plasmid mixtures containing 0.5 μg of promoter linked to luciferase, 0.5 μg of expression vector, and 0.1 μg of pRL-null were transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). For PPARγ ligand treatments, the cells were treated with the ligand in the absence of serum for 24 h and then assayed for luciferase activity. Western Blot Analysis—The level of protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis with anti-EGR-1 and anti-NAG-1 antibodies. Cells were grown to 60-80% confluency in 10-cm plates, followed by 16 h of additional growing in the absence of serum. After treatment with the indicated compounds, total cell lysates were isolated using precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). After sonication of samples, lysate proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred for 1 h onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline and Tween 0.05% and probed with each antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline and Tween 0.05%, the blots were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed several times. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (43Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the gel shift assay, double-stranded oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extracts in binding buffer (Geneka Biotechnology) containing 2 × 105 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. To assure the specific binding of transcription factors, the probe was chased with 1-, 10-, and 50-fold molar excesses of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide. For the supershift experiments, anti-EGR-1 antibody (Geneka Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min before addition to the binding reaction. Samples were then electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA, and gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—After reaching 60-80% confluency in 10-cm plates, the cells were treated at the indicated concentrations with PPARγ ligands in the absence of serum. For the cycloheximide experiment, the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml compound for 30 min prior to TGZ treatment. Total RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ten μg of total RNA was denatured at 55 °C for 15 min, separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and then transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After fixing the membrane by UV, blots were prehybridized in hybridization solution (Rapid-Hyb buffer, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 65 °C, followed by hybridization with cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (DECAprimeII kit, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The probes used were full-length NAG-1 fragments. After 4 h of incubation at 65 °C, the blots were washed once with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. mRNA abundance was estimated from the intensities of the hybridization bands of autoradiographs with a Scion Image (Scion Corp.). Equivalent loading of RNA samples was confirmed by hybridizing the same blot with a 32P-labeled β-actin probe, which recognizes an mRNA of ∼2 kb. PPARγ Ligands PGJ2 and TGZ Induce NAG-1 Expression by Different Pathways—PPARγ ligands have an antitumorigenic activity that is either dependent on binding to the ligand to PPRE or independent of PPARγ transcriptional binding (25Baek S.J.

Hematol. 2002; 30: 1020-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which PPARγ ligands exert antitumorigenesis may involve the transcriptional up-regulation of antitumorigenic proteins. We measured PTEN and p53 tumor suppressor gene expression. The PTEN protein is only marginally induced, whereas the level of p53 is not altered by TGZ in HCT-116 cells (25Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5845-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NAG-1, which has antitumorigenic activity, was significantly induced by the PPARγ ligands. As shown in Fig. 1A, PGJ2 and TGZ, which are both PPARγ ligands, induced NAG-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner (3-fold at 1 and 5 μm, respectively). HCT-116 cells were also treated with 1 μm PGJ2 or 5 μm TGZ for different times. Both PGJ2 and TGZ induced NAG-1 protein expression as early as 6 h (Fig. 1B), and a marked increase in NAG-1 was observed at 24 and 48 h, indicating that PGJ2 and TGZ induce NAG-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, the PPARα ligand WY-14643 did not induce NAG-1 expression at concentrations up to 100 μm (data not shown), indicating that induction of NAG-1 is specific for this PPARγ ligand. We then examined whether NAG-1 induction by PPARγ ligands is dependent on the PPARγ transcription factor in HCT-116 cells expressing intact PPARγ (25Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5845-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). HCT-116 cells were treated with a combination of PPARγ ligands and/or GW9662, a selective PPARγ inhibitor. Western analyses suggest that the PPARγ antagonist suppressed the PGJ2-induced NAG-1 expression, but did not suppress TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. These findings suggest that TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression may be PPARγ-independent, whereas PGJ2 increased NAG-1 expression through activation of PPARγ (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of a PPARγ antagonist on PGJ2-and TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. The quiescent cells were pretreated with or without the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (1 μm) for 30 min prior to the addition of either TGZ (5 μm) or PGJ2 (1 μm). After 24 h, total proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis. Equal loading was confirmed by determining actin immunoreactivity. The relative NAG-1 levels normalized by actin are shown at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NAG-1 Promoter Activity and PPARγ Ligands—To evaluate the importance of cis-acting elements in conferring PPARγ-inducible NAG-1 expression, the 3.5-kb NAG-1 promoter and other deletion constructs were transfected into HCT-116 cells and then treated with either PGJ2 or TGZ. As an internal control, the plasmid pRL-null was used to determine the transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3A, a large increase in luciferase activity was observed after TGZ treatment for all NAG-1 promoter constructs. However, in contrast, an increase in luciferase activity was not observed with PGJ2 treatment. In fact, the response of the different constructs to PGJ2 appeared to be the same as that to the vehicle. The pGLBasic3 promoterless vector was transfected into HCT-116 cells as a negative control, and no significant luciferase activity was observed with either PGJ2 or TGZ treatment. These data suggest the presence of a positive TGZ response element in the 3.5-kb NAG-1 promoter, but the absence of a PGJ2 response element. These results also indicate that TGZ and PGJ2 induce NAG-1 expression by different mechanisms, which is consistent with the finding from the Western analysis experiment in which we used a PPARγ antagonist (Fig. 2). To investigate whether this promoter region is responsive to other ligands, pNAG133/LUC-transfected cells were treated with the ligands all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, retinol, rosiglitazone, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, PGJ2, WY-14643, and TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 3B, TGZ increased luciferase activity, but the other ligands did not. This result supports the notion that TGZ increases the transcriptional activity of NAG-1 by a mechanism that does not utilize the nuclear receptor PPARγ. TGZ Response Element Is Located in Region -73 to -51 of the NAG-1 Promoter—A p53 site that is controlled by several dietary antitumorigenic compounds is present in the NAG-1 promoter at position +43 (38Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). TGZ is known to induce apoptosis by either a p53-dependent or p53-independent pathway (47Bae M.A. Rhee H. Song B.J. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 139: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 48Chung S.H. Onoda N. Ishikawa T. Ogisawa K. Takenaka C. Yano Y. Hato F. Hirakawa K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2002; 93: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of p53 in TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression and to further define the TGZ response element, we generated two constructs containing the p53 site at position +43, pNAG133/+70 and pNAG41/+70. These constructs were transfected into HCT-116 cells, which were treated with vehicle or TGZ. As shown in Fig. 4A, the p53 site is not responsible for TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression because pNAG41/+70-transfected cells did not exhibit an increase in luciferase activity in the presence of TGZ. Thus, the TGZ response element is located between positions -133 and -41 in the NAG-1 promoter. There are two Sp1 sites (Sp1-B and Sp1-C) in this region of the NAG-1 promoter, which play a pivotal role in basal level expression (43Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, these Sp1-B and Sp1-C sites overlap with putative EGR-1-binding sites (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate a functional role for the Sp-1 or EGR-1 site in TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression, we generated point/deletion mutation clones in the Sp1 and EGR-1 sites (Fig. 4B). The analysis of all mutant constructs revealed a dramatic reduction of luciferase activity compared with the wild-type construct, indicating that the TGZ response element may be located in region -73 to -51 region of the NAG-1 promoter. Furthermore, both Sp1 and EGR-1 may be involved in TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. Sp1 and TGZ Induce NAG-1 Expression—Because region -73 to -51 of the promoter contains two Sp1 sites and two EGR-1 sites, the corresponding transcription factors might bind and transactivate the TGZ-induced NAG-1 expression. To evaluate the importance of these sites, Sp1 and EGR-1 expression vectors were generated and c"

PDE molecules contain three regions: an N-terminal splicing region, a regulatory domain, and a catalytic domain near the C terminus. The 11 PDE families share a conserved catalytic domain of about 300 amino acids but rare homology in other regions across families. The function of the N-terminal splicing region of the PDE families is unknown. The regulatory domains of PDEs contain various structural motifs such as a calmodulin-binding domain in PDE1, upstream conserved region in PDE4, PAS (period clock protein, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, and single-minded protein) domain in PDE8, GAF (cGMP-specific PDE, adenylyl cyclase, and Fh1A) domain in PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11. The regulatory domains have been shown to play roles in the regulation of the catalytic activity of PDEs or to participate in cross-talk with other signaling pathways (16Mehats C. Andersen C.B. Filopanti M. Jin S.L. Conti M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Manganiello V.C. Murata T. Taira M. Belfrage P.

Trans. 1996; 24: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PDEs share high degree (25-49%) of amino acid conservation in the catalytic domains, implying a similar three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domains. However, PDE families and isoforms within the respective family have varying substrate preferences for cAMP and cGMP. The PDE4, -7, and -8 families prefer to hydrolyze cAMP, whereas PDE5, -6, and -9 are cGMP-specific. PDE1, -2, -3, -10, and -11 show activities toward both substrates but have distinct Km values for cAMP and cGMP (16Mehats C. Andersen C.B. Filopanti M. Jin S.L. Conti M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition, many PDE families possess selective inhibitors that bind to the conserved active site. For example, rolipram is a PDE4-selective inhibitor, and sildenafil (VIAGRA™) is a PDE5-selective inhibitor (19Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2002; 56: 453-459PubMed Google Scholar). In the past 3 decades, selective inhibitors of PDEs have been widely studied as therapeutics such as cardiotonics, vasodilators, smooth muscle relaxants, antidepressants, antithrombotics, antiasthmatics, and agents for improving cognitive functions such as learning and memory (20Movsesian M.A. Exp.

Many PDE inhibitors have been in clinical trials or have already entered the marketplace. For example, the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostazol (Pletal™) is a drug for the reduction of symptoms of intermittent claudication, and the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil (Viagra™), vardenafil (Levitra™), and tadalafil (Cialis™) are used for treatment of male erectile dysfunction.

Here we report the structures of the catalytic domains of human PDE5A1 and PDE4D2 in complex with a nonselective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). These structures reveal a common subpocket in the active site of PDEs for binding of this nonselective inhibitor. Structural comparison between PDE4 and PDE5 suggests that conformational difference, in addition to the specific amino acid determinants, is another mechanism of inhibitor selectivity. Protein Expression and Purification—The catalytic domain of human PDE4D2 (BF059733) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the catalytic domain of human PDE5A1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the bovine PDE5A1 gene. The coding regions for amino acids 535-860 of PDE5A1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the expression vector pET15b. The resultant plasmid pET-PDE5A1 was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (Codonplus) for overexpression. The E. coli cell carrying pET-PDE5A1 was grown in LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.7, and then 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for further growth at 15 °C overnight. Recombinant PDE5A1 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen), thrombin cleavage, Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Biosciences) columns. The PDE5A1 protein had purity greater than 95% as shown by SDS-PAGE. A typical batch of purification yielded over 10 mg of PDE5A1 from a 2-liter cell culture. The fragment of human PDE5A1 expressed in E. coli had a catalytic activity of about 2 μmol/min/mg, which is comparable with that of the protein expressed in a baculovirus system (36Fink T.L.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of PDE4D2-IBMX and PDE5A1-IBMX were grown by hanging drop. The catalytic domain of 15 mg/ml PDE4D2 (amino acids 79-438) in a storage buffer of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA was mixed with 5 mm IBMX. The PDE4D2-IBMX complex was crystallized against a well buffer of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% PEG3350, 30% ethylene glycol, 10% isopropyl alcohol, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C. The well buffer was used as the cryosolvent for freezing the crystals in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on beamline 14C at Advanced Photon Source (Table I). The PDE4D2-IBMX crystal has the space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 99.3, b = 112.5, and c = 160.9 Å. The catalytic domain of 10 mg/ml PDE5A1 (amino acids 535-860) was mixed with 5 mm IBMX and crystallized against a well buffer of 0.1 m Tris·base (pH 7.5), 17% PEG3350, and 0.2 m MgSO4 at room temperature. To freeze the crystals in liquid nitrogen, the cryosolvent was prepared by mixing 20% glycerol with the well buffer. Diffraction data of PDE5A1-IBMX were collected on beamline X12C at National Synchrotron Light Source (Table I). It has the space group P3121 with cell dimensions of a = b = 74.5, and c = 130.1 Å.

The translation search yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.182 and R-factor of 0.526 for 3247 reflections between 4 and 8 Å resolution. The amino acid differences between PDE5A1 and PDE4D2 were replaced, and the atomic model was rebuilt by program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1RKO and 1RKP). Overall Structures—The crystallographic asymmetric unit of PDE4D2 in complex with IBMX contains four catalytic domains (residues 79-438) that form a tetramer. The monomer of PDE4D2-IBMX consists of 16 helices (Fig. 1) that fold into three subdomains as described previously in the structures of PDE4B (31Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and PDE4D2-rolipram (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of PDE5A1 (residues 535-860) contains 16 helices and has the same folding topology as that of PDE4D2 (Fig. 1). The crystal of PDE5A1 contains one catalytic domain in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, which apparently exists as a monomer. This is consistent with the biochemical studies that the monomeric fragment of bovine PDE5A (residues 508-865) has similar catalytic activity as the full-length PDE5A (36Fink T.L. Francis H. Beasley A. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The electron density showed that residue 778 of PDE5A1 is better modeled with leucine instead of isoleucine in the wild type PDE5A1 sequence. The interpretation of this observation is not clear, but it may be caused by spontaneous mutation during PCR.Fig. 1Structures of the PDE-IBMX complexes. A, ribbon diagram of PDE4D2-IBMX. The α-helices are colored as cyan, and blue color represents 310 helices. The first metal ion is interpreted as zinc, as discussed previously (31Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H.

D, the correspondence of amino acid sequence to the secondary structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The superposition of the catalytic domains of PDE5A1 over PDE4D2 showed an root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å for the Cα atoms of 257 superimposable residues. However, the root mean square deviation increases to 4.8 Å if the entire catalytic domain is compared (312 residues). Three regions show different tertiary structures and are not superimposable, in addition to residues 289-298 in PDE4D2, which become a short connection with deletion of 6 residues in PDE5A1. The N-terminal regions of residues 79-113 in PDE4D2 and 535-566 in PDE5A1 contain two helices but have a totally different three-dimensional arrangement. The region of residues 208-224 in PDE4D2 and 661-676 in PDE5A1, which is labeled as H-loop in Fig. 1, shows differences of over 7 Å for the Cα atom positions of two short helices H8 and H9. Besides, the H-loop of PDE5A1 is flexible, although traceable in electron density, as shown by an average B-factor of 71.8 Å2 in comparison with 36.6 Å2 for all atoms of the structure. The region of residues 341-364 in PDE4D2 or 787-812 in PDE5A1 (M-loop in Fig. 1) shows dramatic conformational differences. Nine residues 341-349 at the tail of helix H14 in PDE4D2 are unfolded into coil or random conformations in PDE5A1. Residues 793-807 in PDE5A1 are not traceable due to lack of electron density and presumably exist in random conformation, in contrast to the ordered conformations of the corresponding sequences in PDE4D2. It is interesting to note that our structure of PDE5A1-IBMX shows some conformational differences from those of PDE5A in complex with the inhibitors such as sildenafil. Although the structure of PDE5A-sildenafil is not available for a detailed comparison, the paper by Sung et al. (35Sung B.J. Hwang K.Y. Jeon Y.H. Lee J.I. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Moon J. Yoon J.M. Hyun Y.L. Kim E. Eum S.J. Park S.Y. Lee J.O. Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M. Nature. 2003; 425: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported that residues 665-675 of the H-loop are disordered, and the M-loop is ordered in the PDE5A-sildenafil structure. In contrast, our structure of PDE5A1-IBMX shows that the H-loop is traceable, but the M-loop is disordered. One possible interpretation of these differences may be that bindings of each of the different inhibitors selectively affect the conformations of these loops. Besides, we note that the catalytic activity of our recombinant fragment 535-860 of PDE5A1 (2 μmol/min/mg) is about 800 times higher than that of the fragment 537-860 for the PDE5A-sildenafil structure (0.0025 μmol/min/mg) (35Sung B.J. Hwang K.Y. Jeon Y.H. Lee J.I. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Moon J. Yoon J.M. Hyun Y.L. Kim E. Eum S.J. Park S.Y. Lee J.O. Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M. Nature. 2003; 425: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structural studies by the two groups imply that the conformational flexibility of H- and M-loops may play roles in inhibitor selectivity. Metal Binding—Two metal-binding sites have been assigned in the crystal structures of PDE4B and PDE4D2 as follows: one is zinc and another is ambiguous (31Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13200-13226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two metal sites are also found in the structure of PDE5A1 and occupy the same location as in the PDE4 structures (Fig. 1). In the PDE5A1 structure, the strongest peak in the 2Fo - Fc map has about 10 times the background and is assigned as zinc, despite the fact that no zinc was added during expression, purification, and crystallization of PDE5A1. This site coordinates with His-617, His-653, Asp-654, Asp-764, and two bound water molecules. These six coordinations form an octahedron and are the same as in PDE4 (31Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The role of the equivalent residues His-607 and His-643 of bovine PDE5 in metal coordination was established by site-directed mutagenesis (42Francis S.H. Turko I.V Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9591-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The second metal ion forms an octahedron with Asp-654 and five bound water molecules and has the same coordinations as in PDE4D2. The second metal ion is assigned as magnesium in the crystal because 0.2 m MgSO4 was used in crystallization. The crystallographic refinement showed that both metal ions have the B-factors comparable with the overall average B-factor of the protein atoms (Table I), in support of the assignment. However, the physiological metal ions await to be identified. Biochemical studies have suggested that zinc is the optimal divalent cation for supporting catalysis in PDE5A1 (43Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IBMX Binding—The electron density maps that were calculated from the PDE4D2 and PDE5A1 structures without IBMXs show that IBMX binds to a subpocket of the active site of PDEs (Fig. 2). The majority of IBMX-binding residues are conserved between PDE4 and PDE5. Thus, the xanthine ring of IBMX stacks against Phe-372 of PDE4D2 or Phe-820 of PDE5A1 on one side and contacts hydrophobic residues Ile-336 and Phe-340 of PDE4D2 or Val-782 and Phe-786 of PDE5A1 on another side. IBMX forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-369 in PDE4D2 or Gln-817 in PDE5A1, in addition to hydrophobic interactions with Leu-319 and Asn-321 of PDE4D2 or Leu-765 and Ala-767 of PDE5A1. On the other hand, IBMX shows some distinct interactions in the two PDE structures. First, O-6 of IBMX forms a hydrogen bond with Nϵ-2 of Gln-817 in PDE5A1, but with a water molecule in PDE4D2. Second, the xanthine ring of IBMX shows a translational shift of about 2 Å when the protein structures of PDE4D2 and PDE5A1 are superimposed (Fig. 2). Third, the isobutyl group of IBMX has different orientations in the two structures and interacts with different residues as follows: Phe-786 of PDE5A1 but Met-273 and Ile-376 of PDE4D2. Finally, IBMX shows unique interactions with Met-273 and Met-357 in PDE4D2 but with Ile-768 in PDE5A1. At the protein level, the amide group of the Gln-817 side chain of PDE5A1 has an opposite orientation from that of Gln-369 of PDE4D2. The configuration of the side chain amide group of Gln-817 in PDE5A1 is apparently fixed by the hydrogen bond to the side chain of Gln-775 that in turn forms hydrogen bonds with Nϵ-1 of Trp-853 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala-767. However, the torsion angle for the amide side chain of Gln-369 in PDE4D2 is about 180° different from Gln-817 of PDE5A1. This configuration of the Gln-369 side chain appears to be essential for formation of hydrogen bonds with Oh1 of Tyr-329 and N-7 of IBMX and is also observed in the structure of PDE4D2-rolipram (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The conservation of the majority residues for the IBMX binding agrees in general with the biochemical studies that IBMX is a nonselective inhibitor for various PDEs (44Beavo J.A. Rogers N.L. Crofford O.B. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Newman E.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar). The extra hydrogen bond between O-6 of IBMX and Gln-817 of PDE5A1 may account for the slightly higher potency of IBMX in PDE5 (IC50 = 10 μm) (45Sekhar K.R. Grondin P. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Schudt C. Dent G. Rabe K.F. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Academic Press, New York1996: 135-146Crossref Google Scholar) than that in PDE4 (IC50 = 31 μm) (46Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Shelton E.R. Baecker P.A. Fong T.A.T. Devens B. Wilhelm R. Eglen R.M. Schudt C. Dent G. Rabe K.F. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Academic Press, New York1996: 161-171Crossref Google Scholar). We speculate that four residues of Ile-336, Phe-340, Gln-369, and Phe-372 of PDE4D2 or Val-782, Phe-786, Gln-817, and Phe-820 of PDE5A1 may define a subpocket for the common binding of nonselective inhibitors of most PDEs. However, it is not clear why IBMX shows significant variations on orientation in the structures of PDE4D2 and PDE5A1. One possible interpretation may be that the active sites in different PDE families possess the key conserved components for binding of the nonselective inhibitor IBMX but have slightly different shapes and sizes. The conformational variation of the active sites in different PDE families may thus require an adjustment of the IBMX orientation to make the best fit in each PDE family. In other words, the conformation of the active site is a determinant for binding of inhibitors. Implication for Inhibitor Selectivity—Selective inhibitors of PDE families have been widely studied as therapeutic agents for various human diseases. Enhancement of selectivity is critical for reducing side effects of the drugs. The structure of PDE4D2 in complex with rolipram showed a good conservation of the most rolipram-binding residues, but a few of them mutate dramatically across PDE families (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This suggests that variation of the active site residues may selectively distinguish inhibitors according to their chemical groups, and therefore the chemical nature of the active site residues may be a determinant for inhibitor selectivity. On the other hand, structural comparison between PDE4 and PDE5 suggests that different shapes of the active sites may also be a determinant of inhibitor selectivity. The structure of PDE5 shows three regions having different conformations from PDE4. Whereas the N-terminal region of 79-113 of PDE4D2 is apparently too far to directly contribute to inhibitor selectivity, H-loop (residues 208-224 of PDE4D2 or 661-676 in PDE5A1) and M-loop (residues 341-364 in PDE4D2 or 787-812 in PDE5A1) are located near the active site. H-loop does not directly contact IBMX and the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but constitutes an edge of the active site. The different conformations of H-loops will make different shapes and sizes of the active sites in PDE4D2 and PDE5A1, thus impacting selective binding of inhibitors. Recent work on the structures of PDE5-sildenafil proposed that Tyr-664 in the H-loop is involved in interaction with sildenafil (35Sung B.J. Hwang K.Y. Jeon Y.H. Lee J.I. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Moon J. Yoon J.M. Hyun Y.L. Kim E. Eum S.J. Park S.Y. Lee J.O. Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M. Nature. 2003; 425: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), supporting a role for the H-loop in selective binding of PDE5 inhibitors. On the other hand, Met-357 of the M-loop (residues 341-364) in PDE4D2 forms hydrophobic interactions with the cyclopentane ring of the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (33Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), indicating its role in binding of the selective inhibitor. In contrast, the corresponding residues 787-812 of PDE5A1 show significantly different conformations: the unfolding of C-terminal end of helix H14 and disordered conformation of 793-807 in PDE5A1 (Fig. 1). Therefore, the M-loop would have different contact patterns when interacting with PDE5 inhibitors from the mode in PDE4. In summary, our structural study suggests that both the conformation of the active site and the chemical nature of the residues in contact with the inhibitors contribute to the selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2093546893,"When there is an imbalance between the light energy absorbed by a photosynthetic organism and that which can be utilized in photosynthesis, photo-oxidative stress can damage pigments, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In this work we compared the wild type and a xanthophyll-deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in their response to high amounts of light. Wild-type Chlamydomonas cells were able to acclimate to high amounts of light following transfer from low light conditions. In contrast, the npq1 lor1 double mutant, which lacks protective xanthophylls (zeaxanthin and lutein) in the chloroplast, progressively lost viability and photosynthetic capacity along with destruction of thylakoid membrane protein-pigment complexes and accumulation of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxides. Loss of viability was partially rescued by lowered oxygen tension, suggesting that the high sensitivity of the mutant to light stress is caused by the production of reactive oxygen species in the chloroplast. Cell death was not prevented by the addition of an organic carbon source to the growth medium, demonstrating that the photo-oxidative damage can target other essential chloroplast processes besides photosynthesis. From the differential sensitivity of the mutant to exogenously added pro-oxidants, we infer that the reactive oxygen species produced during light stress in npq1 lor1 may be singlet oxygen and/or superoxide but not hydrogen peroxide. The bleaching phenotype of npq1 lor1 was not due to enhanced photodamage to photosystem II but rather to a less localized phenomenon of accumulation of photo-oxidation products in chloroplast membranes.

Carotenoids are tetraterpenoid (40-carbon isoprenoid) pigments synthesized by plants and algae and by some fungi and bacteria. They give many flowers and leaves their distinctive red, orange, and yellow colors. Carotenoids also play a role in human and animal nutrition as provitamin A and as potential anti-cancer agents. The chloroplasts of all photosynthetic cells contain β-carotene and some array of oxygenated carotene derivatives, the xanthophylls. In green tissue, the xanthophylls are located in the light-harvesting antennae of the membrane-bound photosystem I (PSI) 1The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; Chl, chlorophyll; Fv/Fm, maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state; HL, high light; LHCII, major light-harvesting complex of PSII; LL, low light; ML, moderate light; NPQ, nonphotochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence; PFD, photon flux density; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; TAP, Tris-acetate-phosphate; HS, high salt; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester. and photosystem II (PSII) complexes. They aid in light harvesting and are essential for maintaining the health of the photosynthetic apparatus by participating in energy dissipation under excessive light and by preventing photo-oxidative damage to the thylakoid membrane through quenching of excited intermediates, such as triplet chlorophylls and singlet oxygen (1Frank H.

Sci. 2000; 355: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The contents of β-carotene and xanthophylls in the chloroplasts of plants and algae are tightly regulated in response to the environment and to the developmental stage of the organism, and their accumulation is coordinated with the biogenesis and assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus. Carotenoid deficiency, caused either by mutation or by the application of herbicides, has devastating effects on chloroplast integrity, interferes with thylakoid membrane biogenesis, and influences the expression of nuclear genes that encode the protein components of the chloroplast (4Oelmüller R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 229-239Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In plants and green algae, the presence of either zeaxanthin or lutein in the chloroplast is necessary for protection against photo-oxidative stress. Zeaxanthin is the only xanthophyll that accumulates exclusively under light stress. Work with mutants impaired in the accumulation of lutein and zeaxanthin has shown that when plants and algae are under high light stress, these pigments are required for the efficient transition of the light-harvesting antenna from a conformation that favors light harvesting to one that allows for thermal dissipation of part of the excess excitation energy (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Pogson B.J. Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Dellapenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13324-13329Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7Niyogi K.K. Shih C. Chow W.S. Pogson B.J. DellaPenna D. Björkman O. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 67: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This thermal dissipation of excess light energy is known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) (8Müller P. Li X.-P. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). The process of NPQ is accompanied by the deepoxidation of existing violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the so-called xanthophyll cycle (9Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 1-24Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). However, zeaxanthin may also prevent photo-oxidative stress by a mechanism separate from NPQ, such as through direct quenching of excited intermediates and/or scavenging of free radicals (10Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 11Baroli I. Do A.D. Yamane T. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 992-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It has been suggested as well that zeaxanthin may exert its protective effect by making the thylakoid membrane less permeable to oxygen (12Gruszecki W. Frank H. Young A. Britton G. Cogdell R. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 363-379Google Scholar). Two xanthophyll-deficient mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are defective in the development of NPQ when exposed to high light (HL), but neither mutation has a lethal effect on growth in HL conditions (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The npq1 mutant is impaired in the HL-induced de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin, such that zeaxanthin accumulation in HL is prevented, but the mutant can survive the HL treatment (13Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The lor1 mutation prevents the constitutive accumulation of lutein and its derivative loroxanthin in Chlamydomonas (14Chunaev A. Mirnaya O. Maslov V. Boschetti A. Photosynthetica (Prague). 1991; 25: 291-301Google Scholar). Even though the lor1 strain has a normal xanthophyll cycle, it is partially defective in NPQ, and it can survive in HL (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The double mutant npq1 lor1, which accumulates violaxanthin and neoxanthin as the only xanthophylls irrespective of light conditions, shows a severe lack of NPQ and undergoes irreversible bleaching at a photon flux density (PFD) of 500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, a condition in which the wild type and the single mutants grow normally (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Suppressors that restore growth of npq1 lor1 in HL include npq2 mutants that cause constitutive accumulation of zeaxanthin, demonstrating that zeaxanthin is sufficient for survival and growth in HL (11Baroli I. Do A.D. Yamane T. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 992-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this work, we analyzed the behavior of the low light-grown npq1 lor1 double mutant under conditions of oxidative stress and during exposure to HL leading to photobleaching. We monitored the changes in growth, photosynthetic activity, and oxidative stress status in the double mutant in comparison with the wild-type strain. Our results suggest that photobleaching of npq1 lor1 in HL is because of excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the thylakoid membrane due to the absence of the antioxidants, zeaxanthin and lutein. Our results also rule out the possibility that photobleaching of npq1 lor1 is initiated by an enhanced susceptibility to photodamage of the PSII reaction center. Strains and Growth Conditions—The npq1 lor1 double mutant has been described previously (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The wild-type strain CC125 was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Duke University, Durham, NC). To score the amount of growth under different conditions, the cells were grown photoautotrophically on plates in minimal HS medium or mixotrophically in acetate-containing TAP medium (15Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 575-579Crossref Google Scholar). The strain stocks were maintained at a PFD of 10 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 on TAP agar medium. For light transition experiments, the cells were grown photoautotrophically to the early exponential phase (fewer than 1.5 × 106 cells/ml) in 100 ml of HS at 25 °C with shaking in air in sterile beakers under continuous low light (LL; 50 μmol of photons m-2 s-1). Illumination was provided from the top by cool white fluorescent lights, and the light path through the cultures was 3.5 cm. The cultures were transferred to high light (HL; 500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1), and the samples were taken for analysis during a period of 48 h. PFDs were measured with a quantum meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Cell densities were determined using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was measured by spreading a known volume of cell culture on TAP agar medium and scoring the number of colonies that appeared on the plate after 10 days of growth in LL. To test the effect of pro-oxidants and anaerobiosis on growth in the light, cells were grown in HS medium until they reached a density of 1-2 × 106 cells/ml. At this point, the cells were concentrated by centrifugation to 1 × 107 cells/ml, serial dilutions were prepared, and the cells were immediately spotted onto HS agar medium with or without pro-oxidants. The concentrations of pro-oxidants that were used supported at least partial growth of the wild-type strain. All additives were water-soluble. Rose bengal (Sigma), hydrogen peroxide (Fisher), methyl viologen (Sigma), and metronidazole (Sigma) plates were prepared 1 day prior to use. The plates were incubated in LL for 7 days with the exception of metronidazole plates, which were incubated for 10 days. Anaerobic experiments were carried out in anaerobic BBL GasPak Pouches (BD Biosciences). In this case, the cells were spotted onto plates that were then incubated for 1 day at LL before being transferred to an intermediate PFD of 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 (moderate light (ML)). The incubation in LL allowed the pouches to become anaerobic before the cells were exposed to a higher light intensity. Measurements of Fluorescence and Oxygen Evolution—Chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence was measured using an FMS2 pulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer (Hansatech, King's Lynn, UK). The cells, contained in 10-ml culture samples, were deposited onto 2.5-mm diameter 12-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by filtration and were dark-adapted in a moist Petri dish for 15 min prior to the measurements. To avoid variation in fluorescence parameters due to state transitions, the cells were exposed to 8 min of illumination with weak far-red light (light-emitting diode source of 735 nm peak wavelength) prior to determination of Fv/Fm. The light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution was measured with a polarographic Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech) at 25 °C. Intact cells were used in their original growth medium with the addition of 4 mm NaHCO3 as a terminal electron acceptor. Illumination with white light was provided by an LS2 lamp (Hansatech), and the intensity of the incident light was varied with neutral-density filters (Melles-Griot, Irvine, CA). Dark respiration was measured first, followed by measurements of the rate of photosynthesis at three sequentially increasing PFDs (550, 750, and 1000 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) to account for changes in the light intensity necessary for saturation of photosynthesis after the transfer from LL to HL. Only the light-saturated rates of oxygen evolution are shown. The total cellular Chl content and Chl a:Chl b ratios were determined spectrophotometrically in 90% acetone (16Porra R. Thompson W. Kriedemann P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Measurement of Oxidative Stress Parameters—ROS were measured using the cell-permeant fluorescent dye, 5-(-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The 5-ml culture samples were harvested by centrifugation at 3200 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 750 μl of HS medium (freshly adjusted to pH 5.7 with acetic acid) to bring the total volume to 1 ml. 1.5 μl of CM-H2DCFDA (freshly dissolved in Me2SO; final concentration 10 μm) or a Me2SO-only control were added to the cell samples, which were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended as before, and fluorescence of 105 cells was measured on an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). The extent of lipid peroxidation in cells was estimated by measuring the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and by thermoluminescence. For TBARS determination, 10-ml culture aliquots were taken before and at time intervals after exposure to HL. Butylated hydroxytoluene was added to the samples at a final concentration of 0.01% (w/v) to terminate lipid peroxidation chain reactions, and the content of TBARS was measured as described by Baroli et al. (11Baroli I. Do A.D. Yamane T. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 992-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thermoluminescence measurements were performed with a custom-built apparatus (17Ducruet J.-M. Toulouse A. Roman M. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. V. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 4353-4356Google Scholar). The cells were deposited on 2.5-mm diameter 12-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (Millipore), which were placed in the copper chamber of the apparatus. The samples were heated from 25 to 150 °C at a rate of 6 °C min-1. Temperature was controlled using a thermocouple mounted between the sample and the heating element. The luminescence signal was recorded during sample heating with a compact red-extended photomultiplier (H5701-50, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) shielded with an RG665 glass filter (Schott, Yonkers, NY). Both the sample temperature and thermoluminescence were recorded by a computer using a DaqPad-1200 data acquisition system (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The amplitude of the 135 °C thermoluminescence band was used as an index of lipid peroxidation (10Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 18Vavilin D.V. Ducruet J.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 191-198Google Scholar). Preparation of Protein Extracts, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—To prepare whole-cell protein extracts for SDS-PAGE, cells were harvested from 15-ml culture aliquots by centrifugation at 3200 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. Protein sample preparation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described in Ref. 11Baroli I. Do A.D. Yamane T. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 992-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. The anti-D1 and anti-LHCII antibodies were kindly provided by A. Melis (University of California, Berkeley, CA) and F.-A. Wollman (Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France), respectively. Growth under Photo-oxidative Stress Conditions—The npq1 lor1 double mutant was unable to grow photoautotrophically on agar medium at light intensities higher than 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 (Fig. 1). The growth impairment at 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 (ML) could be rescued if the agar plates were kept under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1). However, rescue of the light sensitivity phenotype by anaerobiosis was partial and was not seen at higher light intensities (data not shown). The addition of acetate as an organic carbon source was unable to rescue the sensitivity of npq1 lor1 to HL (Fig. 1). Cell Viability and Photosynthesis during Exposure to HL—To characterize the photo-oxidative stress experienced by npq1 lor1 cells, we examined liquid cultures of the double mutant and the wild type at various times after transfer of LL-grown cells to HL. When grown photoautotrophically in liquid cultures under continuous LL, both the wild type and the double mutant npq1 lor1 had a similar doubling time of ∼14 h. Fig. 2A shows that, when exposed to HL, the rate of increase in cell density slowed down but persisted in both strains. The wild-type culture had an initial slight decrease in cell viability, as assayed by colony forming units, after transfer to HL (Fig. 2B). The apparent viability of wild-type cells then increased rapidly between 3 h and 6 h, after which viability was maintained at a level that was consistent with the total cell density. In contrast to the wild type, the npq1 lor1 cells showed a substantial decline in viability that was already evident after 6 h in HL. By 24 h of HL treatment, only 20% of the initial cells were able to form colonies (Fig. 2B), but there was a slight increase in cell viability between 24 and 48 h. As with the doubling time, photosynthetic parameters were similar in the mutant and wild type when cells were grown in LL, except that npq1 lor1 showed a significantly elevated Chl a:Chl b ratio of ∼3.5 compared with a value of ∼2.6 for the wild type (see also Ref. 5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The Chl a:Chl b ratio did not change significantly in either strain during the HL treatment (data not shown). The cellular total Chl content of LL-grown cells was ∼25% lower in the double mutant compared with the wild type (Fig. 3A). During the first 6 h of HL treatment, the Chl content in the wild type initially decreased ∼20% and then stabilized at the lower value. In the double mutant, the Chl content decreased progressively upon exposure to HL until it reached only 12% of the initial value after 48 h of HL treatment. At this point, the npq1 lor1 culture contained a mixed population composed of bleached cells, which were devoid of thylakoid membranes when observed with transmission electron microscopy (data not shown), and cells containing at least some Chl. These two kinds of cells could be distinguished by flow cytometry (see below). The decrease in Chl in the double mutant was preceded by a loss of photosynthetic activity, measured either as the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state, Fv/Fm (Fig. 3B), or as oxygen evolution in whole cells (Fig. 3C). On a per cell basis, photosynthetic oxygen evolution in npq1 lor1 was only 15% of the initial value after 48 h in HL (Fig. 3C). As with the cell viability, the Fv/Fm value showed a partial recovery in the double mutant, which was also evident when photosynthetic oxygen evolution was calculated on a per mol of Chl basis (Fig. 3D). In the wild type, there was an initial decrease in Fv/Fm, and the culture stabilized at this lower value of ∼0.65 for the rest of the treatment. The decline in PSII efficiency was not accompanied by a decrease in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, which remained the same during the first 6 h of treatment and then showed a progressive increase followed by stabilization after 24 h in HL (Fig. 3C). Loss of Photosynthetic Proteins during Exposure to HL—The loss of Chl and photosynthetic activity in the double mutant was indicative of damage to the thylakoid membrane. To characterize the kinetics of this photodamage, we monitored the content of specific photosynthetic proteins. Fig. 4 shows the contents of the PSII reaction center D1 protein and the peripheral LHCII as a function of time in HL as determined by immunoblotting. The wild type showed no significant change in the cellular level of either protein during exposure to HL. In contrast, after a lag of ∼6 h, the cellular content of the D1 protein decreased dramatically (half-time ∼6 h) in the double mutant such that only 30% of the initial D1 content remained after 48 h in HL (Fig. 4A). LHCII proteins in npq1 lor1 cells were also lost in HL, but more gradually, with a half-time of ∼24 h. Effect of Lack of Zeaxanthin and Lutein on the Rate of D1 Photodamage—The reaction center of PSII has been reported to produce singlet oxygen under conditions that lead to photoinhibition (19Macpherson A.N. Telfer A. Barber J. Truscott T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 301-309Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Telfer A. Bishop S.M. Phillips D. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13244-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the npq1 lor1 double mutant is defective in the rapidly induced thermal dissipation process of NPQ in PSII, the loss of D1 protein (Fig. 4A) could be due to enhanced sensitivity of the PSII reaction center to photodamage and concomitant generation of reactive singlet oxygen in its proximity. Alternatively, singlet oxygen or other reactive oxygen species could be formed at higher levels in the chloroplast of npq1 lor1 as a consequence of the lack of the protective xanthophylls, zeaxanthin and lutein. To address the question of whether PSII and thylakoid destruction in the double mutant was caused by lack of thylakoid membrane antioxidant capacity or whether it was induced by increased photoinhibition of PSII, we monitored photodamage by following the turnover rate of the D1 protein of PSII after a short exposure to HL in the presence of the chloroplast protein translation inhibitor lincomycin. Fig. 5 shows that the D1 protein in the double mutant had a significantly longer half-life than in the wild type (2.2 h and 1.4 h, respectively). A similar trend was observed when Fv/Fm was measured in the same experiment (data not shown). These results with D1 protein turnover were consistent with measurements of the PSII excitation pressure as a function of light intensity in the two strains (data not shown). Taken together, these results rule out the possibility of thylakoid photobleaching in npq1 lor1 being caused primarily by increased photodamage to PSII and point to a more generalized damage in the thylakoid membrane itself. Lipid Peroxidation during HL Exposure—We also examined the kinetics of accumulation of damaged membrane lipid products in npq1 lor1. A well known effect of ROS in the thylakoid membrane is the peroxidation of unsaturated lipids through the initiation of radical chain reactions. Lipid peroxidation, measured as TBARS, increased ∼9-fold during exposure of the double mutant to HL, whereas the wild type showed only a slight increase in lipid peroxidation (Fig. 6A). The oxidation of lipids in the proximity of Chl can also be monitored by the luminescence signal emanating from cells heated to temperatures higher than 70 °C (18Vavilin D.V. Ducruet J.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 191-198Google Scholar, 21Cadenas E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 40: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B shows that, compared with that of the wild type, in the double mutant, the thermoluminescence signal peaking at 135-145 °C increased considerably during HL illumination, consistent with the TBARS results (Fig. 6A). ROS Production during HL Exposure—The fact that the light sensitivity of the npq1 lor1 double mutant was diminished in the presence of a lowered oxygen tension (Fig. 1) suggested that ROS might be the cause of bleaching in HL. We measured the presence and relative quantity of ROS in npq1 lor1 and wild-type cells during exposure to HL (Fig. 7A). The measurements were performed by flow cytometry using the cell-permeant indicator dye CM-H2DCFDA. This dye diffuses passively into the cell where its acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases, trapping it in the cell and exposing the CM-H2DCF, which, when oxidized, fluoresces brightly. This dye thus indicates levels of ROS in live cells only. The use of flow cytometry allowed us to measure separately the fluorescence emitted from Chl and from the ROS indicator dye in each individual cell. The Chl fluorescence measurements (Fig. 7B) yielded results that were very similar to the measurements of Chl per cell (Fig. 3A). Significant variability was present in the ROS measurements at all time points, particularly the 0 and 48 h time points, but the overall trend was consistent (Fig. 7A). The mean fluorescence in both strains after 3 h in HL was consistently lower (and less variable) than at 0 h. The average ROS level in live cells increased significantly in the npq1 lor1 double mutant after 24 and 48 h of HL exposure, whereas in the wild type, it remained steady at a low level. After 24 and 48 h of HL, two populations of mutant cells were distinguishable. One exhibited increased ROS and normal Chl fluorescence, whereas the other population, presumably dead cells unable to retain or activate the dye, showed little or no ROS or Chl fluorescence (Fig. 7C). Only the populations of presumed live cells (i.e. cells that could take up the dye) were used to calculate the average ROS fluorescence (Fig. 7A). Growth in the Presence of Exogenous Pro-oxidants—To gain insight into which ROS might be produced in the npq1 lor1 double mutant when exposed to excess light, we examined sensitivity to different ROS in LL (Fig. 8). Concentrations of pro-oxidants were selected that were just below what was necessary to inhibit growth of wild-type cells completely. The npq1 lor1 double mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to rose bengal, a photosensitizing dye that generates singlet oxygen upon illumination. npq1 lor1 was also more sensitive than the wild type to the superoxide generators methyl viologen and metronidazole but not to hydrogen peroxide. The addition of methyl viologen to agar plates significantly retarded the growth of npq1 lor1 relative to the wild type, and the double mutant bleached more rapidly than the wild type on both methyl viologen and metronidazole plates. A previous study showed that the npq1 lor1 mutant of Chlamydomonas bleaches when grown on agar plates at HL (5Niyogi K.K. Björkman O. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14162-14167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Here we extend that study and present data on the response of wild-type cells to HL and the temporal sequence of events that leads to photo-oxidative damage and cell death in the mutant. Response of Wild-type Chlamydomonas Cells to a Transition from LL to HL—A light intensity of 500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 did not appear to be excessive for growth of wild-type Chlamydomonas, but it caused some initial symptoms of light stress. When grown in LL and transferred to HL, the wild type responded with a slowing down of the cell duplication rate (doubling time of 14 h in LL versus >24 h after transfer to HL, Fig. 2A) and an initial slight decrease in cell viability. The number of cells able to form colonies then rose substantially between 6 and 12 h in HL (Fig. 2B), despite the more gradual increase in cell density (Fig. 2A). The discrepancy between cell density and apparent cell viability might be explained by an increase in the plating efficiency of wild-type cells occurring within the first 6 h after transfer from LL to HL. After the initial stress period in which the Chl/cell and Fv/Fm decreased slightly but significantly (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), the wild-type cells stabilized at lower values of both parameters. In contrast, the light shift did not have any negative effect on the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, measured as oxygen evolution in intact cells (Fig. 3, C and D), or on the cellular content of the PSII D1 protein (Fig. 4A) consistent with the notion that the HL treatment is not photoinhibitory to the wild type. The LHCII protein level showed a transient decrease of ∼10% during the first 12 h in HL, but it stabilized at a level almost identical to the initial one (Fig. 4B). A similar response of the major LHC proteins has been observed in the green alga Dunaliella salina (22Webb M.R. Melis A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The fact that the Chl a:Chl b ratio remained constant after the shift from LL to HL suggests that there was no preferential down-regulation of the LHC proteins relative to the content of reaction centers within the first 48 h in HL. A similar lack of LHC down-regulation has been observed in wild-type Arabidopsis immediately following transfer from LL to HL (23Müller-Moulé P. Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Photo-oxidative Stress in npq1 lor1 Cells—Why does the npq1 lor1 double mutant bleach in HL? Upon transfer from LL to HL, symptoms of light stress in npq1 lor1 cells were first manifested within 3 h as declines in PSII efficiency, measured as Fv/Fm, and photosynthetic oxygen evolution (Fig. 3). The addition of acetate as an organic carbon source did not rescue growth of npq1 lor1 in HL (Fig. 1), however, which would indicate that essential processes other than photosynthesis are being affected by the HL treatment. Cell viability began to decrease between 3 and 6 h (Fig. 2B) followed by loss of D1 and LHCII proteins after6hinHL (Fig. 4) and accumulation of lipid peroxidation products after 12 h in HL (Fig. 6). The fact that lowered oxygen tensions reduced the extent of bleaching in npq1 lor1 at least partially (Fig. 1) suggests the involvement of ROS, yet significantly higher levels of ROS were detected only after at least 12 h in HL (Fig. 7A). Because the intracellular CM-H2DCF probe for ROS is a soluble molecule, it is conceivable that ROS are generated initially in chloroplast membranes where photosynthesis and other processes would be subject to photo-oxidative damage and are not readily detected by the probe until later time points when antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed. The lack of NPQ in the mutant might be expected to increase ROS levels in thylakoids, primarily resulting in photodamage to PSII that leads to a more general photo-oxidative bleaching. However, npq1 lor1 was not more susceptible than the wild type to PSII photodamage, as indicated by turnover of the D1 protein (Fig. 5). In addition, the recently described npq5 mutant of Chlamydomonas, which has normal xanthophyll composition but lacks NPQ, survives excess light (24Elrad D. Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1801-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that lack of NPQ and enhanced rates of photodamage to PSII are not the primary underlying cause of the HL sensitivity of npq1 lor1, and they point instead to a more general deficiency in antioxidant capacity as the causative factor. Formation of ROS in the chloroplast is consistent with the widespread damage to the thylakoid membrane that we observed when npq1 lor1 was exposed to HL (see particularly Figs. 4 and 6). The lack of NPQ could increase the yield of singlet oxygen in the Chl antenna of PSII. In addition, higher levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide could be produced at PSI due to lack of NPQ. We hoped to provide insights into these possibilities by examining the effect on npq1 lor1 of pro-oxidants that produce different ROS. The double mutant was considerably more sensitive than the wild type to the singlet oxygen generator rose bengal and to the superoxide generators metronidazole and methyl viologen but not to H2O2 (Fig. 8). Thus, we can exclude formation of H2O2 as a cause of enhanced oxidative damage in the mutant. Toxicity of metronidazole and methyl viologen is the result of the ability of these molecules to accept electrons from ferredoxin and subsequently donate electrons to oxygen, generating superoxide. Metronidazole is toxic to Chlamydomonas only in the light, and PSI-deficient mutants are more resistant to the inhibitor, supporting the idea that toxicity occurs because of superoxide generation at the acceptor side of PSI (25Schmidt G.W. Matlin K.S. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Methyl viologen is capable also of killing Chlamydomonas cells in the dark (25Schmidt G.W. Matlin K.S. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating that its toxicity does not derive entirely from photochemical superoxide production in the chloroplast. Nevertheless, in LL-grown cells, the presence of lutein in the chloroplast of wild-type cells is apparently sufficient to protect against toxicity of methyl viologen (Fig. 8). The ROS indicator dye that we used, CM-H2DCFDA, does not allow a distinction between singlet oxygen and superoxide in vivo and attempts to measure singlet oxygen with a specific probe (DanePy) (26Hideg E. Kálai T. Hideg K. Vass I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11405-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in intact cells failed because of interfering background fluorescence of Chlamydomonas cells. 2E. Hideg, I. Baroli, and K. K. Niyogi, unpublished results. Both singlet oxygen and superoxide could be produced by the mutant in HL. However, other results reported here indicate that singlet oxygen could be the main ROS produced in HL-exposed npq1 lor1. For example, HL treatment of the mutant led to extensive formation of lipid peroxides (Fig. 6A), a known product of singlet oxygen attack on membrane lipids (27Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1520-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, it is likely that some of the high-temperature thermoluminescence signal that was detected in npq1 lor1 at wavelengths of >665 nm (Fig. 6B) is attributable to singlet oxygen. This red luminescence can be because of both singlet oxygen and excitation energy transfer from triplet carbonyls to Chl (28Havaux M. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 409-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given that the Chl content of the mutant was strongly reduced in HL (Fig. 3A), the high thermoluminescence signal might be due, at least in part, to singlet oxygen. These results, along with the fact that zeaxanthin and lutein are well known as efficient quenchers of singlet oxygen (reviewed in Ref. 3Baroli I. Niyogi K.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), are consistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of singlet oxygen are produced in npq1 lor1 in HL. To test this hypothesis, experiments will be performed to examine singlet oxygen-regulated gene expression (29Leisinger U. Rufenacht K. Fischer B. Pesaro M. Spengler A. Zehnder A.J.B. Eggen R.I.L.

To test for possible physiologic functions of the actin binding activity of V-ATPase, early responses of resorbing osteoclasts to inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity by wortmannin and LY294002 were examined. Rapid co-localization between V-ATPase and F-actin was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, and corresponding association between V-ATPase and F-actin in immunoprecipitations and pelleting assays was detected. This response was reversed as osteoclasts recovered resorptive activity after inhibitors were removed. By expressing and characterizing fusion proteins containing segments of the actin-binding amino-terminal regions of the B subunits of V-ATPase, we mapped the actin-binding site to a 44-amino acid domain. An 11-amino acid segment with a sequence similar to the actin-binding site of human profilin I was detected within this region. 13-Mers containing these profilin-like segments bound actin in fluorescent anisotropy studies and competed with profilin for binding to actin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the 11-amino acid profilin-like actin-binding motifs (amino acids 49–59 of B1 and 55–65 of B2) were replaced with an 11-amino acid spacer with a sequence based on the homologous sequence from subunit B of Pyrococcus horikoshii, an organism that lacks an actin cytoskeleton. These substitutions eliminated the actin-binding activity of the B subunit fusion proteins. In summary, binding between V-ATPase and F-actin in osteoclasts occurs in response to blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. This response was fully reversible. The actin binding activities of the B subunits of V-ATPase required 11-amino acid actin-binding motifs that are similar in sequence to the actin-binding site of mammalian profilin I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18499-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The V-ATPase is a complex enzyme containing at least 13 different subunits, some of which are present in multiple copies per holoenzyme (16Gluck S.L.

Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). As a close relative to the ATP synthase, V-ATPase is a rotary motor (18Yokoyama K. Nakano M. Imamura H. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar, 19Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). The A subunit is the site of ATP hydrolysis and forms an alternating hexagon with the B subunit. Together, the A and B subunits alter conformation in response to ATP hydrolysis to power turning of a central stalk. This is coupled to proton transport across an associated membrane. The physical location of the B subunit within the enzyme, exposed in a position farthest removed from the associated membrane, makes it an attractive candidate to mediate interactions between V-ATPase and cytoskeletal elements (8Holliday L.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).There are two isoforms of the B subunit. The B2, or “brain” isoform, is expressed ubiquitously, at low levels in most cells and at high levels in cells including osteoclasts, macrophages, and neurons (20Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K.

It is found at high levels in intercalated cells of the kidney and in certain cells of the eyes, ears, epididymus, and placenta (20Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S.

Recently, a PDZ-binding domain was identified in the carboxyl terminus of B1, and data were presented suggesting that B1 interacts with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory co-factor, which in turn binds ezrin/radixin/moesin class actin-binding proteins, thus providing a potential link between V-ATPase and the actin cytoskeleton (14Breton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).More directly, our group has shown that both B subunit isoforms contain high affinity actin-binding sites that mediate direct interaction between V-ATPase and F-actin (8Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These binding sites were previously narrowed to amino acids 1–106 of B1 and 1–112 of B2. We have provided evidence that this interaction is involved in V-ATPase transport in osteoclasts and have proposed that the interaction between V-ATPase and microfilaments is required for efficient bone resorption (7Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The fact that the B1 isoform, which is not found in osteoclasts, also binds actin suggests that interaction between V-ATPase and F-actin is important in cell types other than osteoclasts.Additional evidence for linkage of V-ATPase to the actin cytoskeleton was produced in studies of V-ATPase from Manduca sexta. Isolated Manduca V-ATPase was found to bind F-actin with a similar affinity to that of bovine kidney and mouse marrow V-ATPase. Interaction between subunit B and microfilaments was confirmed. In addition, the C subunit was reported to bind microfilaments (9Vitavska O. Wieczorek H. Merzendorfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18499-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity is a crucial general mechanism for establishing cell polarity. Numerous studies indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is involved in regulating the formation of actin rings and ruffled membranes of resorptive osteoclasts (26Lee Z.H. Lee S.E. Kim C.W. Lee S.H.

Src homology 2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase, a phosphatase that coordinates with class I PI 3-kinases to regulate phosphatidylinositol signaling, is required for normal osteoclast activity (34Takeshita S.

Med. 2002; 8: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).We previously found that the actin binding activity of the B subunit was located in the amino-terminal 106 amino acids of B1 and 112 amino acids of B2 (8Holliday L.S.

Fusion proteins containing these segments competed with V-ATPase enzyme for binding to microfilaments. Additionally, in unactivated osteoclasts, much of the V-ATPase was bound to F-actin (7Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, in active osteoclasts, little binding between V-ATPase and F-actin was detected.When osteoclasts are treated with wortmannin, internalization of V-ATPase from the ruffled membrane to cytosolic vesicles occurs synchronously over a period of 40 min (33Nakamura I. Sasaki T. Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Kita Y. Ihara S. Suda T. Fukui Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The early response of resorbing osteoclasts to blocking PI 3-kinase activity with respect to the interaction between V-ATPase and F-actin was examined. Rapid association between V-ATPase and microfilaments was detected, indicating direct or indirect regulation of the binding interaction by PI 3-kinase activity. This interaction was rapidly reversible. We sought to precisely map the actin-binding sites in the mammalian B subunits and to identify amino acid residues that are crucial for the interaction. We demonstrate that the binding sites are in 44-amino acid sections of the B subunits and that a portion of the binding sites, which is similar in sequence to the actin-binding site of mammalian profilin I, is required for the actin binding activities of the B subunits.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was either obtained commercially (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) for use in pelleting assays or prepared from frozen muscle (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR) in Buffer G (5.0 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8) (35Kang F.

The marrow was washed twice with α-MEM D10 and then plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plates for 5 days in α-MEM D10 plus 10-8 μm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cultures were fed on day 3 by replacing half of the medium per plate and adding fresh 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. After 5 days in culture, osteoclasts appeared. These were detected as giant cells that stained positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP; a marker for mouse osteoclasts) or overexpressed V-ATPase subunits (38Holliday L.S.

After the time indicated, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked overnight with PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm sodium azide at 4 °C. For E subunit and B subunit staining, slices were incubated for 2 h in E11 (64 μg/ml) or polyclonal anti-B2 antibody (diluted 1:1000) in PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin, washed three times with HENAC, and incubated for 1 h in Texas Red or Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Park, PA) both diluted 1:500 in PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin. After an overnight wash in HENAC, the slices were examined for fluorescent staining. For phalloidin staining, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml) in PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin for 10 min prior to examination, washed three times in PBS, and examined immediately. After actin rings or V-ATPase patches had been determined, slices were then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and the numbers and morphology or TRAP+ cells were determined. Counters who were blinded to the trial conditions performed scoring of actin rings, V-ATPase patches, and TRAP+ cells. Total numbers of actin rings were determined, and some osteoclasts were observed to contain two or three actin rings or V-ATPase patches.

Following a centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material, the extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μg of E11 or a 1:200 dilution of anti-B2. 50 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The protein A beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C and washed three times with the Triton X-100 buffer. The wash buffers were removed by aspiration with a bent 23-gauge needle, and Laemmli sample buffer was added. The samples were heated at 85 °C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies as described in the legends of Figs. 3 and 4.Fig. 4The marine toxin jasplakinolide disrupts actin rings but does not induce binding of V-ATPase to F-actin.A, mouse marrow osteoclasts were cultured on dentine slices for 2 days and then treated with Me2SO or 50 μm jasplakinolide for 30 min, fixed, and co-stained with phalloidin and anti-B2 polyclonal antibody. In control osteoclasts, F-actin and V-ATPase were well segregated. Osteoclasts treated with jasplakinolide had disrupted actin rings but no special co-localization of V-ATPase and F-actin. Bar, 5 μm. B, the number of osteoclasts with actin rings was greatly reduced by treatment with 100 nm wortmannin (30 min) or 50 μm jasplakinolide (30 min). The asterisk denotes p < 0.05. C, mouse marrow cultures were incubated on dentine slices for 2 days and then solubilized by plunging the slices into ice-cold extraction buffer. V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated with E11. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with either an anti-actin monoclonal AC-40 or anti-E subunit monoclonal E11. No significant change in the amount of actin binding to V-ATPase was detected after treatment with jasplakinolide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Constructs—DNA fragments representing segments of the coding region of the human B1 and B2 genes were generated by PCR using full-length B1 and B2 subunit genes in pCEP4 as templates. We found that constructs made using the B2 sequence as a template were particularly susceptible to degradation by endogenous bacterial proteases. We were unable to overcome this problem using low temperature induction strategies and protease-deficient bacteria. Because both B1 and B2 bind actin, we focused our efforts on the B1-based constructs. The sense and antisense primers used for the various constructs were as follows: MBP-B1-(23–106), sense (5′-CGGAATTCCGAGAACACATGCAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTAGCAAGTGGTCTTCC-3′); MBP-B1-(36–106), sense (5′-CGGAATTCCACCCCCGTGTCACCTAC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTAGCAAGTGGTCTTCC-3′; MBP-B1-(1–82), sense (5′-CGGAATTCATGGCCATGGATAGAT-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTACTCAAGGACCTGCCC-3′); MBP-B1-(1–67), sense (5′-CGGAATTCATGGCCATGGAGATAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTAGTGGACGATCTCCGC-3′); MBP-B1-(1–53), sense (5′-CGGAATTCATGGCCATGGAGATAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTACACCACCAGGGGCCC-3′); MBP-B2-(1–59), sense (5′-ATGGCGCTGCGGGCGATGCGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CAGCTCTAGATGAGATCACTAGTGGACCA-3′); MBP-B2-(51–112), 5′-TCTGGAGTCAATGGTCCACTAGTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGACTAACAGGACGTTTTCTT-3′). Forward and reverse primers were added to a final concentration of 2 μm in PCR buffer (Roche Applied Science). PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. The PCR product was purified using the DNA Wizard kit (Promega, Madison, WI), cut with restriction enzymes XmnI and XbaI for the B2 subunit constructs, and EcoRI and XbaI for the B1 subunit constructs (all restriction enzymes were from New England BioLabs), separated on an agarose gel, and purified once more using the DNA Wizard kit. The DNA fragments were ligated overnight at 15 °C into the pMAL-c2x vector (New England BioLabs). Chemically competent TB1 cells were transformed by heat shock with the vectors. Colonies were grown overnight on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-containing LB agarose plates and selected by restriction enzyme digests. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that B subunit DNA was ligated in frame into the pMAL-c2x plasmid and that the sequence of the inserts was correct.Expression of Fusion Proteins—Preliminary experiments were performed inducing bacterial expression of fusion proteins with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for various times to determine the optimal induction time for each fusion protein. For larger scale preparations, bacteria were grown from an overnight culture inoculated into LB medium (250 ml to 2 liters). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C with shaking to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Bacteria were then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.3 mm for the optimal time, harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min, broken by sonication, and subjected to centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was collected. Purification was accomplished by amylose affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs). The purified fusion proteins were immediately dialyzed into F-buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol).Fusion proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE, and the sizes of the induced proteins were verified. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce).F-actin Pelleting Assay—Binding to F-actin was detected by a pelleting assay as described previously (7Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S.

Purified rabbit muscle actin was polymerized at a concentration of 100 μm in F-buffer and diluted into F-buffer immediately prior to the experimental procedure. F-actin alone (1.0–4.5 μm), fusion proteins (0.1–1 μm), or mixtures of the two were incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

ABCA1 mutations can cause a severe HDL deficiency and atherosclerosis. Here we show that the protein-tyrosine kinase (TK) Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) modulates the apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 required for removing cellular lipids. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, the TK inhibitor genistein, and the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 suppressed apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells without altering the membrane ABCA1 content. Whereas PKA inhibition had no effect on apoA-I binding to cells or to ABCA1, TK and JAK2 inhibition greatly reduced these activities. Conversely, PKA but not JAK2 inhibition significantly reduced the intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity of ABCA1. Mutant cells lacking JAK2 had a severely impaired apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and apoA-I binding despite normal ABCA1 protein levels and near normal cholesterol translocase activity. Thus, although PKA modulates ABCA1 lipid transport activity, JAK2 appears to selectively modulate apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1. TK-mediated phosphorylation of ABCA1 was undetectable, implicating the involvement of another JAK2-targeted protein. Acute incubation of ABCA1-expressing cells with apoA-I had no effect on ABCA1 phosphorylation but stimulated JAK2 autophosphorylation. These results suggest that the interaction of apolipoproteins with ABCA1-expressing cells activates JAK2, which in turn activates a process that enhances apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 and lipid removal from cells.

There is emerging evidence that multiple signaling events play a role in controlling ABCA1 protein levels and activity. It has been shown that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of ABCA1 is essential for optimum lipid transport activity (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A.

ABCA1 contains a cytosolic PEST sequence that, when phosphorylated, directs calpain-mediated proteolysis of ABCA1 (12Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L.

These studies implicate apolipoprotein interactions with cells as initiating ABCA1-modulating signaling events. The nature of these interactions is poorly understood. Cross-linking experiments have shown that apolipoproteins interact directly with ABCA1 on the cell surface (20Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

In the current study, we investigated the role of different signaling pathways in modulating ABCA1 activity. We found that, in addition to PKA, the protein-tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is required for optimum ABCA1-dependent transport of lipids from cells to apolipoproteins. Unlike PKA, which affects the lipid transport activity of ABCA1 without affecting apolipoprotein binding, JAK2 appears to selectively modulate the apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 required for lipid removal. Results showing that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) stimulates JAK2 autophosphorylation reveal a novel mechanism by which apolipoproteins potentiate their ability to remove excess cholesterol from cells. Cell Culture and Cellular Proteins—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing mifepristone-inducible human ABCA1 were generated as described previously (23Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J.

To avoid the complications of altered ABCA1 transcription, we used a BHK cell line stably transfected with a mifepristone-inducible ABCA1 cDNA (23Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The PKA inhibitor H89 significantly decreased cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells to apoA-I (Fig. 1, a and b) without altering apoA-I binding to cells (Fig. 1d) or covalent cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 (Fig. 1e). Thus, as also reported previously (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), PKA inhibition impairs ABCA1-dependent lipid transport without affecting the apolipoprotein binding activity of ABCA1. Addition of the PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP had no stimulatory effect on these parameters, consistent with endogenous levels of cAMP being sufficient for maximum ABCA1 activation by PKA. We found that the broad spectrum TK inhibitor genistein and the JAK2-specific TK inhibitor AG490 also markedly decreased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells (Fig. 1, a and b) but, in contrast to H89, genistein and AG490 also suppressed apoA-I binding to cells (Fig. 1d) and to ABCA1 (Fig. 1e). These effects do not appear to be cell-specific, as genistein and AG490 inhibited ABCA1-dependent cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from non-transfected, cholesterol-loaded murine J774 macrophages (not shown). Daidzein, an inactive analog of genistein, or the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X had no significant effect on apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux from ABCA1 transfectants (Fig. 1, a and b). Moreover, the SRC family TK inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-3,4-d-pyrimidine or the epidermal growth factor receptor TK inhibitor tyrphostin-23 had no effect on apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux (Fig. 1, a and b) or apoA-I binding to cells (Fig. 1d) or to ABCA1 (Fig. 1e). Transient transfection of ABCA1-transfected BHK cells with a dominant-negative JAK2 cDNA significantly suppressed apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that both PKA and JAK2 modulate ABCA1 activity but by different mechanisms. The inhibitory effects of genistein, AG490, and H89 on apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux were concentration-dependent, with near maximum effects occurring at 100, 40, and 40 μm, respectively (Fig. 2a). We compared time courses for these inhibitory effects by preincubating cells for various times with inhibitors and measuring apoA-1-mediated cholesterol efflux during subsequent 1.5-h incubations. Both genistein and AG490 significantly decreased cholesterol efflux without preincubation, having their maximum effects during the 1.5-h incubation with apoA-1 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, H89 did not significantly decrease apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux until after a 2-h preincubation and did not reach maximum inhibition until after a 5-h preincubation (Fig. 2b). Thus, ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux is more acutely sensitive to JAK2 inhibition than to PKA inhibition. PKA but Not JAK2 Inhibition Suppresses ABCA1 Cholesterol Translocase Activity—We showed previously (23Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that induction of ABCA1 in transfected BHK cells redistributes cholesterol to cell-surface sites accessible to the added enzyme cholesterol oxidase. Here we compared the effects of JAK2 and PKA inhibition on this redistribution. With radiolabeled cells deficient in ABCA1, about 6% of the [3H]cholesterol was converted to [3H]cholestenone by treating cells for 15 min with cholesterol oxidase (Fig. 3a), and this as well as cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3c) was unaffected by 6-h preincubations with apoA-I, AG490, or H89. Incubating cells with mifepristone for 6 h to induce ABCA1 prior to the oxidase treatment led to a greater than 2-fold increase in redistribution of [3H]cholesterol to oxidase-accessible sites (Fig. 3b). Including apoA-I in the medium during the 6-h induction phase reduced this redistribution in association with removal of [3H]cholesterol from cells (Fig. 3d). Inducing ABCA1 in the presence of AG490 redistributed a nearly normal amount of [3H]cholesterol to oxidase-accessible sites (Fig. 3b), despite a reduced ability of apoA-I to remove this cholesterol (Fig. 3d). Thus, most of the effects of the JAK2 inhibitor could not be attributed to an impaired intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity of ABCA1. In contrast, the ABCA1-mediated redistribution of [3H]cholesterol to oxidase-accessible pools was reduced by over 60% in the presence of H89 (Fig. 3b), consistent with PKA inhibition having a direct effect on this process. These data along with those in Fig. 1 suggest that, whereas H89 selectively impairs ABCA1 lipid transport activity, JAK2 selectively modulates the apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 required for removing lipids from cells. PKA or TK Inhibition Had No Effect on ABCA1 Protein Levels—Immunoblot analysis of whole cells revealed that treating cells for 3 h with either 8-Br-cAMP, H89, genistein (Fig. 4a), or AG490 (not shown) had no effect on the cellular content of ABCA1. Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins and isolation of ABCA1 by immunoprecipitation showed that none of these treatments affected the cell-surface distribution of ABCA1 (Fig. 4a). Both PKA and JAK2 therefore modulate ABCA1 activity without directly affecting protein expression or trafficking to the plasma membrane. PKA but Not TK Inhibition Reduces ABCA1 Phosphorylation—We measured the effects of PKA and TK inhibition on the relative degree of ABCA1 phosphorylation by labeling cells with [32P]orthophosphate and isolating ABCA1 by immunoprecipitation. To test the possibility that these inhibitors affect apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 phosphorylation (17Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J.

Blots showed a single 32P-labeled band with a molecular mass of ∼240 kDa in ABCA1-transfected cells but not in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4b), consistent with the previously reported constitutive phosphorylation of ABCA1 (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37368-37374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was unaffected by short-term treatments with apoA-1. ABCA1 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by the PKA inhibitor H-89 but not by the TK inhibitors genistein (Fig. 4b) or AG490 (not shown). Consistent with the efflux data, the phosphorylation state of ABCA1 was not increased further by the PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP. These data suggest that PKA but not TK contribute to the constitutive phosphorylation of ABCA1. To examine further if ABCA1 tyrosines are phosphorylated, we isolated intact ABCA1 from cells by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE and performed immunoblot analyses with phosphoserine- and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Although phosphoserines in ABCA1 were readily detectable, we were unable to detect any signal for phosphotyrosines (data not shown). We were also unable to identify ABCA1 among membrane proteins immunoprecipitated with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. These results suggest that ABCA1 is not phosphorylated by TKs and implicate another JAK2-targeted protein in the ABCA1 pathway. ABCA-dependent Lipid Removal Is Impaired in Cells Lacking JAK2—We examined the effects of a total absence of JAK2 on ABCA1 function by comparing parameters of ABCA1 activity between wild-type 2C4 fibrosarcoma cells and a mutant 2C4 cell line that lacks JAK2 mRNA and protein (γ2A cells) (25Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the basal state, both the wild-type 2C4 and mutant γ2A cells had nearly undetectable levels of ABCA1 protein (Fig. 5a). Treating these two cell lines with the LXR ligand 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol plus the retinoid X receptor ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid induced ABCA1 to comparable levels (Fig. 5a). These ligands also increased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol (Fig. 5c) and phospholipid (Fig. 5d) efflux, apoA-I binding to cells (Fig. 5e), and apoA-I cross-linking to ABCA1 (Fig. 5b), but these were markedly reduced in mutant γ2A cells compared with wild-type 2C4 cells. As with ABCA1-transfected BHK cells, induction of ABCA1 in both of these cell lines increased the cholesterol fraction accessible to cholesterol oxidase treatment, and this was only slightly lower in γ2A cells lacking JAK2 (Fig. 5f). Thus, although a lack of JAK2 has little effect on ABCA1 expression or intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity, it severely impairs apolipoprotein-ABCA1 interactions and lipid removal. ApoA-I Stimulates JAK2 Autophosphorylation—Cytokine-induced activation of JAK2 has been shown to involve autophosphorylation of JAK2 (27Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of apoA-I on the phosphorylation state of JAK2 by immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific JAK2 antibody. Acute treatment (15 min) of ABCA1-deficient cells with either apoA-I or AG490 had little effect on the total or phosphorylated amounts of JAK2 (Fig. 6). However, apoA-1 treatment of ABCA1-expressing cells markedly increased the amount of phosphorylated JAK2 without affecting the total amount of JAK2 (Fig. 6). This increase was largely prevented when cells were preincubated with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, indicating that it mostly involved an autophosphorylation mechanism. Thus, the interaction of apoA-I with cells acutely stimulates autophosphorylation of JAK2 by an ABCA1-dependent process. The current study provides several lines of evidence that the non-receptor TK JAK2 modulates ABCA1-dependent lipid transport from cells to HDL apolipoproteins. First, treatment of ABCA1-transfected BHK cells with the broad spectrum TK inhibitor genistein or the JAK2-specific TK inhibitor AG490 greatly suppressed apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. Second, dominant-negative JAK2 transfection of these cells significantly decreased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Third, apoA-I had a severely impaired ability to remove cholesterol and phospholipids from a mutant cell line that lacks JAK2. These studies show that JAK2 activity and expression are required for optimum ABCA1-dependent transport of cellular lipids to apolipoproteins. Additional evidence suggests that JAK2 selectively modulates the apolipoproteins-ABCA1 interactions required for lipid removal. The inhibitory effects of genistein and AG490 on lipid efflux were associated with a similar degree of inhibition of apoA-I binding to ABCA1-expressing cells and covalent cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1. These inhibitors had no effect on the plasma membrane content of ABCA1, and AG490 had only a small, insignificant effect on the intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity of ABCA1 as determined by cholesterol oxidase accessibility. We observed a similar pattern when mutant γ2A cells lacking JAK2 were compared with the parental wild-type 2C4 cells. Thus, apoA-I interactions with ABCA1 and lipid efflux to apoA-I were substantially impaired by inhibiting or abolishing JAK2, whereas ABCA1 protein levels were unaffected, and ABCA1 cholesterol translocase activity was only slightly reduced. The most likely explanation for these findings is that JAK2 promotes apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 or a closely proximal site, and this facilitates the removal of cellular lipids. A comparison of TK inhibitors suggests that most if not all the effects of genistein could be attributed to JAK2 inhibition. Genistein and AG490 inhibited lipid efflux and apolipoprotein binding to similar extents. The effects of both inhibitors were rapid, causing near maximum inhibition when added to the medium during the 1.5-h cholesterol efflux assay. Moreover, inhibitors of SRC family or epidermal growth factor receptor TKs had no effect on ABCA1 activity. These studies, however, do not exclude the possibility that another genistein-sensitive TK also influences ABCA1 activity. We used the PKA inhibitor H89 as a positive control for our studies, as it was reported previously that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ABCA1 was required for its lipid transport activity (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We confirmed that PKA inhibition reduces apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells without affecting apoA-I binding to these cells. We also show that PKA inhibition has no effect on apoA-I cross-linking to ABCA1 but significantly reduces the intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity of ABCA1. These results suggest that, whereas JAK2 modulates apolipoprotein-ABCA1 interactions, PKA selectively modulates the lipid transport activity of ABCA1. These findings reveal that these two ABCA1 activities can be regulated independently. In agreement with a previous report (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we found that 40–50% of the constitutive phosphorylation of ABCA1 was mediated by PKA. This direct phosphorylation of ABCA1 appears to account for the effects of PKA on lipid transport activity (16See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found no detectable effects of TK inhibition on ABCA1 phosphorylation or any evidence that ABCA1 tyrosines were phosphorylated. This implicates another JAK2-targeted protein that is responsible for promoting apolipoprotein-ABCA1 interactions. Receptor-mediated activation of JAK2 often involves JAK2 autophosphorylation (27Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We found that acute treatment (15 min) of ABCA1-expressing BHK cells with apoA-I dramatically increased JAK2 phosphorylation. Because most of this was blocked by the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490, this represented an autophosphorylation event. ApoA-I had little or no effect on JAK2 autophosphorylation in cells lacking ABCA1, indicating that this was an ABCA1-dependent process. These data coupled with the inhibitor results suggest that this rapid JAK2 autophosphorylation is involved in promoting apoA-I interactions with ABCA1. This would imply that JAK2 is activated in response to apoA-I binding to a molecule other than ABCA1 or to sites on ABCA1 distinct from those mediating lipid removal. Alternatively, apoA-I-stimulated JAK2 autophosphorylation may serve some other function. Although more studies are needed to identify the mechanisms involved, these findings raise the possibility that apoA-I acts like a signaling ligand to potentiate its ability to remove lipids from cells by the ABCA1 pathway. JAK2 is a cytoplasmic TK that activates diverse signaling pathways (28Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 29Kerr I.M. Costa-Pereira A.P.

Of particular interest is the involvement of JAK2 in activating insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (30Carvalheira J.B. Ribeiro E.B. Folli F. Velloso L.A. Saad M.J. Biol. Chem.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), receptor docking proteins that mediate signaling of multiple hormones and cytokines, including insulin and leptin. One of the targets of insulin receptor substrates is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which regulates glucose transport. We found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol transport, excluding a role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in this pathway. Nevertheless, our studies raise the interesting possibility that ABCA1 has an insulin receptor substrate counterpart that plays a role in cholesterol and phospholipid transport. In summary, the current study suggests a new mechanism by which apolipoproteins regulate their ability to remove excess cellular cholesterol. The induction of ABCA1 in cells by overloading them with cholesterol would lead to a rapid autophosphorylation of JAK2 in the presence of apolipoproteins. The activated JAK2 appears to modulate some process that enhances apolipoprotein interactions with ABCA1 or a closely associated site. This binding is required for removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells and may play a role in stabilizing ABCA1 protein. JAK2 activation may involve the interaction of apolipoproteins with either ABCA1 itself, an unidentified receptor, or membrane lipids. A lack of detectable phosphotyrosines in ABCA1 implies that the JAK2-targeted protein is not ABCA1 but some other protein that promotes apolipoprotein-ABCA1 interactions. The inability of apoA-I to stimulate ABCA1 phosphorylation when JAK2 is activated also supports this assumption. It would be of great interest to identify these molecules, as they are obviously important regulated components of this atheroprotective pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2012677944,"A functional myeloperoxidase (MPO) promoter polymorphism, -463GA, has been associated with incidence or severity of inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and some cancers. The polymorphism is within an Alu element encoding four hexamer repeats recognized by nuclear receptors (AluRRE). Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists strongly regulate MPO gene expression through the AluRRE. Opposite effects were observed in granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)- versus macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF)-derived macrophages (Mphi): Expression was markedly up-regulated (mean 26-fold) in MCSF-Mphi and down-regulated (34-fold) in GMCSF-Mphi. This was observed with rosiglitazone and three other PPARgamma ligands of the thiazolidinedione class, as well as the natural prostaglandin metabolite 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J(2). The selective PPARgamma antagonist, GW9662, blocked both the positive and negative effects on MPO expression. Gel retardation assays showed PPARgamma bound hexamers 3/4, and estrogen receptor-alpha bound hexamers 1/2, with -463A in hexamer 1 enhancing binding. Estrogen blocked PPARgamma effects on MPO expression, especially for the A allele. Charcoal filtration of fetal calf serum eliminated the block of PPARgamma, whereas replenishing the medium with 17beta-estradiol reinstated the block. These findings suggest a model in which estrogen receptor binds the AluRRE, preventing PPARgamma binding to the adjacent site. The positive and negative regulation by PPARgamma ligands, and the block by estrogen, was also observed in transgenic mice expressing the G and A alleles. The mouse MPO gene, which lacks the primate-specific AluRRE, was unresponsive to PPARgamma ligands, suggesting the human MPO transgenes will enhance the utility of mouse models for diseases involving MPO, such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's."

Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several RNA-binding proteins have been identified which recognize ARE-containing sequences. Binding of some proteins can lead to increased message expression, as seen for ELAV family proteins (HuR, HuB/Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) (12Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Binding of other proteins, such as TIA-1, TIAR, and tristetraprolin, promotes decreased message expression (14Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R.P. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V.

Still other proteins like AUF1 (also known as hnRNP D) may play a role in both degradation and stabilization of target messages (7Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 19DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity of these interactions is the fact that many of these proteins exist as multiple isoforms that arise because of alternative splicing events, all of which may be subject to post-translational modifications. As a first approach to understanding the mechanism whereby LPS regulates COX-2 expression, we used the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 as a target to identify sequences required for LPS stimulation and proteins that bind this region of the 3′-UTR. The proximal 60 nucleotides of the 3-UTR of COX-2 contained a LPS response element that bound a large number of RNA-binding proteins. Many of these proteins were present as alternatively spliced isoforms and appear to be post-translationally modified. Cell Culture—The RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was maintained in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15 mm HEPES. Cell were stimulated with LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma) at 100 ng/ml for the indicated times. Plasmids—Reporter-gene constructs were generated as described previously (11Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, various regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 were amplified by PCR using primers terminating in XbaI recognition sequences. PCR products were ligated in the unique XbaI site of the pGL3 control vector (Promega Corp.), located in the 3′-UTR of the firefly luciferase gene. Vectors used for synthesis of RNA probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and binding assays were constructed by amplifying the same 3′-UTR sequences except that the primers encoded a HindIII recognition site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. The PCR products were ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Stratagene). Transient Transfections—RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen Corp.). Cells were plated into 6-well cluster dishes, grown to 75% confluence, and transfected with 1 μg of reporter-gene plasmid DNA at a 4:1 SuperFect:DNA ratio. After transfection, cells were incubated overnight and subsequently analyzed for gene expression. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system, following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp.). Briefly, cell monolayers in 6-well cluster dishes were removed by scraping into 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cells were vortexed and cellular debris removed by centrifugation (30 s at 12,000 × g). Luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (E G & G Wallac) as described previously (11Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—All fractionation buffers were kept on ice and contained 0.25 mm Pefabloc, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the flasks into buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol), and incubated on ice for 10 min. After incubation, Nonidet P-40 was added (final concentration 0.25%), and the cells were vortexed for 10 s. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was further centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g and saved as the cytosolic fraction. Nuclei were washed twice in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl2), resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol), and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min with frequent vortexing. Lysed nuclei were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear protein) was removed and used immediately or frozen at -20 °C. For each 225-cm2 flask, ∼1 mg of nuclear protein and 7 mg of cytosolic protein were obtained. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay. In Vitro Transcription—Radiolabeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase plus (Ambion, Inc.) and COX-2 3′-UTR plasmids (described above) as template. Transcription reactions contained 100 units of T7 polymerase; 500 μm each ATP, CTP, GTP; 12.5 μm UTP; 200 μCi of [32P]UTP (6,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences); 10 mm DTT; 10 μg of plasmid template linearized by digestion with BamHI for the COX-2 gene or EcoRI for TA vector control, in a total volume of 50 μl of 1× transcription buffer (Ambion, Inc.). Transcription reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-25 mini Quick Spin RNA Columns (Roche Applied Science). Biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to either the 3′-UTR of the COX-2 gene or a 63-nucleotide region of the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) were made by in vitro transcription using a modified protocol of the T7-MEGAshortscript high yield kit (Ambion). A final reaction volume of 20 μl contained the following: 2 μl of 10× transcription buffer; 2 μl each of 75 mm ATP, GTP, UTP; 1 μl of 75 mm CTP; 7.5 μl of 10 mm biotinylated CTP (Invitrogen); 10 μg of COX-2 DNA template; and 2 μl of T7 MEGAshortscript enzyme mix. Transcription was carried out overnight at 37 °C and the reaction stopped by adding 2 μl of RNase-free DNase and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with mini Quick Spin RNA columns centrifuged at 1500 × g for 4 min. The final concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. EMSA and Antibody Supershifts—Typically, 5-10 μg of cell fraction protein was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in EMSA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 5 mg/ml heparin) with 1-5 pmol of 32P-labeled RNA probe in a final volume of 20 μl. For supershift experiments, binding mixtures included 0.2 μg of affinity-purified IgG for anti-HuR, -TIA-1 and -TIAR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); or 1 μl of anti-AUF1 (20Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar); or 1 μl of normal goat serum (Sigma). RNase T1 (10 units) was added to EMSA or supershift samples and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Loading buffer (5 μl) containing 80% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was added, and samples were electrophoresed (250 V for 3 h) on 4% polyacrylamide gels (pre-run 1 h at 200 V) containing 44 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 44 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, 4% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1), and 2.5% glycerol. EMSAs were visualized by autoradiography. Binding Reaction—Approximately 20 units of RNase inhibitor was added to 5 mg of nuclear or cytosolic protein and incubated with 120-150 μg of biotinylated RNA at room temperature for 2 h with constant rotation. Streptavidin-agarose beads (600 μl) were washed three times with 1 ml of EMSA binding buffer, added to the protein/biotinylated RNA mixture, and incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature with constant agitation. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of EMSA binding buffer at room temperature, and bound proteins were eluted from the RNA with a high ionic strength salt solution (1 m NaCl in EMSA binding buffer) or with rehydration buffer. Sample Preparation—For protein identification experiments, samples were desalted using a Millipore Centricon centrifugal filter device with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. Protein samples were brought up to a volume of 2 ml in a 4% CHAPS solution, applied to the Centricon membrane, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 4 h. The concentrated sample was again diluted to 2 ml in 4% CHAPS, applied to the membrane, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 8 h to a final volume of ∼30 μl. Protein concentrations were measured using the RC DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For Western analysis, samples were desalted and concentrated by acetone precipitation. Acetone, stored at -80 °C, was added at a ratio of 5:1 (v/v), vortexed briefly, and incubated for 30 min at -80 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the protein pellet was air dried for 5 min. Protein was resuspended in 250 μl of rehydration buffer prior to isoelectric focusing. Isoelectric Focusing—Samples were added to the rehydration solution (8 m urea, 0.15 mg/ml DeStreak reagent (Amersham Biosciences), 4% CHAPS, 0.2% carrier ampholytes, pH 7-10, 0.0002% bromphenol blue) in a ratio of 9:1 of rehydration solution to sample. Samples were applied to 11-cm immobilized pH gradient strips, pH 7-10 (Bio-Rad) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Strips were passively rehydrated overnight (16 h) while covered in mineral oil. After rehydration, the strips were transferred to a focusing tray with prewetted wicks and covered with fresh mineral oil. The strips were focused for a total of 17,000 volt-hours with rapid ramping on the Bio-Rad Protean IEF Cell. Second Dimension—After focusing the strips were equilibrated in equilibration buffer I (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, and 2% DTT) for 10 min and equilibration buffer II (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, and 2.5% iodoacetamide) for 10 min, both with gentle agitation. The strips were rinsed in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) and applied to the well of an 8-16% acrylamide Criterion precast gel (Bio-Rad) for protein identification and 10.5-14% acrylamide for Western analysis. The strips were covered with an overlay of agarose and run for 1 h at 200 V. Protein Identification—Gels were transferred to the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory (PNACL) at Washington University, where spots were picked by an automated gel cutter and transferred to an automated sample digestion robot. Samples were analyzed by a PE-Biosystems Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometer and a Finnigan liquid chromatography quadrupole ion trap electrospray mass spectrometer. Data base searching utilized Mascot software and MM-Fit from Protein Prospector version 4.05 (UCSF). Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated from RAW 264.7 cells treated with and without LPS for 1 h. Proteins that bound to biotinylated RNA were eluted with rehydration buffer and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described above. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) for 1 h at 20 V, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with monoclonal anti-HuR antibody, polyclonal anti-TIA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); polyclonal anti-TIAR (BD Biosciences); or polyclonal anti-AUF1 (Upstate Biotechnology) all at a 1:1,000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Signal detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The First 60 Nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 Contain a Negative Control Element That Is Regulated by LPS—Various regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 were inserted into the 3′-UTR of the luciferase reporter-gene (Fig. 1A) and transiently expressed in RAW 264.7 cells. When the full-length 3′-UTR (1-2232) was placed in the reporter message, luciferase activity decreased more than 90% compared with luciferase alone (Fig. 1B). Luciferase activity decreased 60% with insertion of only the first 60 nucleotide of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2. This region of the 3′-UTR contains multiple copies of the AUUUA consensus sequence reported to confer decreased stability and/or translational efficiency of COX-2 mRNA (11Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Sequential deletion of the proximal portion of this region of the 3′-UTR resulted in first an increase in reporter-gene expression and then a further decrease in expression (Fig. 1B), suggesting that multiple control elements were operative. When RAW cells were exposed to LPS, reporter-gene activity from a message-containing luciferase control without any COX-2 sequence increased less than 2-fold within a 6-h treatment time (Fig. 1C). However, the activity of the reporter-gene containing the full-length 3′-UTR increased more than 10-fold (Fig. 1C) under the same treatment conditions. Again, a large portion of the increase occurred in the presence of the proximal region of the 3′-UTR alone, where the 60-nucleotide insert caused a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity within 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1C) and more than 10-fold over a 10-h stimulation (results not shown). The LPS responsiveness of the reporter-gene was lost when the first 23 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR were deleted. Thus, the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 contain major control elements that confer decreased expression under nonstimulated conditions and increased expression in response to LPS stimulation. The First 60 Nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 Form Multiple RNA-Protein Complexes That Contain Known RNA-binding Proteins—To understand more fully how the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 regulates message expression, we set out to identify protein factors that bind to this region of the message. In the first set of experiments we used EMSAs to look for known RNA-binding proteins that regulate message expression. When in vitro transcribed RNA representing the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 was incubated with either nuclear fractions or cytosolic fractions from RAW 264.7 cells, there were shifts in the mobility of the RNA probe indicating the formation of multiple RNA-protein complexes. EMSA results identified at least five distinct complexes (Fig. 2). These complexes formed using both nuclear (lanes labeled N) and cytosolic (lanes labeled C) fractions and were not grossly altered by treatment with LPS. However, truncating the RNA probe resulted in decreased intensity of some complexes (Fig. 2, C4 and C5) and increased intensity of others (Fig. 2, C2 and C3). These changes were more prominent with the nuclear protein fractions. The fact that the mobility of the complexes did not change as a result of the truncation suggests that the composition of the complexes was not altered drastically, and the change in intensity occurred because of a change in complex stability. The identity of some of the proteins present in the complexes was determined by adding antibodies raised against known RNA-binding proteins and looking for a loss in complex intensity and/or formation of a higher molecular mass complex (supershift). Using this approach we demonstrated that the RNA-binding proteins TIAR, AUF1, HuR and TIA-1 were able to bind to the proximal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. When antibodies against either TIAR or TIA-1 were included in the binding reaction containing cytosolic protein fractions and RNA probes (Fig. 3A), two higher molecular mass complexes formed (supershifts S2 and S3). Both supershifts were present with the 1-60 probe, whereas only the higher supershift (S3) remained when the probe was truncated. In all cases, the supershift was accompanied with a severely decreased intensity in complex C3. Likewise, addition of anti-HuR antibody resulted in formation of a supershift (S1) and decreased intensity of complexes C1 and C2 formed with cytosolic proteins (Fig. 3A). The supershift was more apparent in the 60-nucleotide probe and decreased as the probe was truncated, whereas the loss of complexes C1 and C2 occurred with both probes. Addition of antibody directed against AUF1 caused no major change in the intensity of the RNA-protein complexes nor caused the appearance of a supershift when used in conjunction with cytosolic protein fractions (Fig. 3A). When using nuclear fractions (Fig. 3B), supershift results with TIA-1, TIAR, and HuR antibodies were similar to those using proteins isolated from cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3A). The exceptions were that the TIA-1 and TIAR antibodies formed a single higher molecular mass complex (Fig. 3B, S2), and the HuR-dependent supershift was greatly diminished (Fig. 3B, S1). In contrast, addition of anti-AUF1 antibody to binding reactions containing nuclear protein fractions resulted in nearly a complete disappearance of all RNA gel shifts (Fig. 3B). These results were reproducible and dependent on the concentration of antibody added, suggesting that AUF1 was present in all the nuclear RNA-protein complexes. In all cases, the appearance of a supershift and disappearance of complex(es) was not affected by treating cells with LPS prior to cellular fractionations. Additional Proteins That Bind the 3′-UTR of COX-2—As a second approach to identify proteins that bind to the 3′-UTR of COX-2, biotinylated RNA probes were incubated with nuclear protein fractions, and bound proteins were isolated with streptavidin-coated agarose beads. Proteins were eluted from the RNA with a high ionic strength buffer (1 m NaCl), separated on two-dimensional gels, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The indicated spots (Fig. 4) were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI and confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry. The identification of the spots is summarized in Table I. The 19 spots we identified were represented by six different proteins. Two of these proteins were identified previously in the EMSA experiments described above; namely, TIAR and AUF1. The additional proteins were CPF-A (hnRNP A/B), RBM3, hnRNP A2/B1, and hnRNP A3.Table IIdentification of proteins bound to the conserved ARE of COX-2 messageSpot no.ProteinOrganismAccession no.Mass% Sequence coveredMALDI % Peptides matchedES-MSaES-MS, electrospray-mass spectrometry.

Open table in a new tab CPF-A was identified as an ARE-binding protein that exists as two isoforms, p37 and p42, which arise because of alternative splicing (21Dean J.L. Sully G. Wait R. Rawlinson L. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 709-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified five spots that matched the sequence of CBF-A, three migrated at the lower molecular mass (p37), and two at the higher molecular mass (p42). The liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry data from spots 1 and 4 contained sequences that span the alternatively spliced exon junction confirming that these proteins were the p37 isoform. Spot 16 lacked sequence data at the splice junction; however, this protein migrated at the same apparent molecular mass as spots 1 and 4 and was also designated as the p37 isoform. Peptide sequence data for spots 2 and 17 did not confirm the presence of the alternatively spliced exon; however, the migration of these proteins in the second dimension suggests that they were the p42 isoform. Similarly, AUF1 exists as multiple alternatively spliced isoforms (22Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this case there two exons, 2 and 7, which are alternatively spliced giving rise to four different isoforms, p37, p40, p42, and p45. Both exons 2 and 7 are present in p45, isoform p42 lacks exon 2, p40 lacks exon 7, and p37 is missing both exons 2 and 7. We have identified six different spots migrating at four different molecular masses as AUF1. Unfortunately, no peptide sequence data confirmed whether exon 7 was present or absent in any of the AUF1 spots. Peptide sequence data for spots 3 and 11 confirm the presence of exon 2, and because these proteins migrated at the highest molecular mass they were assigned to isoform p45. Spot 10 migrated at a slightly lower molecular mass, and sequence data confirmed that exon 2 was absent in this protein suggesting that this was isoform p42. Spot 12 migrated at the same apparent molecular mass and was also designated as isoform p42. AUF1 spot 5 migrated at the lowest molecular mass, and sequence data confirmed that exon 2 was absent. Accordingly, this spot was assigned to isoform p37. Finally, spot 14 migrated at a molecular mass between isoforms p37 (spot 5) and p42 (spots 10 and 12), suggesting that it was isoform p40. Thus, all four isoforms of AUF1 were able to bind to the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. Protein spots 9 and 13 were identified as hnRNP A2/B1. Like CBF-A and AUF1, the spots migrated at different molecular masses. Spot 13 migrates at the reported molecular mass, 36 kDa, whereas spot 9 migrated at a higher molecular mass, raising the possibility that hnRNP A2/B1"
https://openalex.org/W2005583530,"Nitric oxide is an endogenous thiol-reactive molecule that modulates the functions of many regulatory proteins by a thiol-redox mechanism. NO has now been shown to inhibit the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells through such a mechanism. Exposure of L929 cells to interferon-gamma resulted in the endogenous production of NO and in inhibition of the activation of ASK1 by hydrogen peroxide. The interferon-gamma-induced inhibition of ASK1 activity was blocked by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Furthermore, the NO donor S-nitro-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) inhibited ASK1 activity in vitro, and this inhibition was reversed by thiol-reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. SNAP did not inhibit the kinase activities of MKK3, MKK6, or p38 in vitro. The inhibition of ASK1 by interferon-gamma was not changed by 1H- (1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one, an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase nor was it mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that replacement of cysteine 869 of ASK1 by serine rendered this protein resistant to the inhibitory effects both of interferon-gamma in intact cells and of SNAP in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation data showed that NO production inhibited a binding of ASK1, but not ASK1(C869S), to MKK3 or MKK6. Moreover, interferon-gamma induced the S-nitrosylation of endogenous ASK1 in L929 cells. Together, these results suggest that NO mediates the interferon-gamma-induced inhibition of ASK1 in L929 cells through a thiolredox mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2100076132,"Transfection studies have implicated the multiple drug resistance pump, MDR1, as a glucosyl ceramide translocase within the Golgi complex (Lala, P., Ito, S., and Lingwood, C. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 6246–6251). We now show that MDR1 inhibitors, cyclosporin A or ketoconazole, inhibit neutral glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in 11 of 12 cell lines tested. The exception, HeLa cells, do not express MDR1. Microsomal lactosyl ceramide and globotriaosyl ceramide synthesis from endogenous or exogenously added liposomal glucosyl ceramide was inhibited by cyclosporin A, consistent with a direct role for MDR1/glucosyl ceramide translocase activity in their synthesis. In contrast, cellular ganglioside synthesis in the same cells, was unaffected by MDR1 inhibition, suggesting neutral and acid glycosphingolipids are synthesized from distinct precursor glycosphingolipid pools. Metabolic labeling in wild type and knock-out (MDR1a, 1b, MRP1) mouse fibroblasts showed the same loss of neutral glycosphingolipid (glucosyl ceramide, lactosyl ceramide) but not ganglioside (GM3) synthesis, confirming the proposed role for MDR1 translocase activity. Cryo-immunoelectron microscopy showed MDR1 was predominantly intracellular, largely in rab6-containing Golgi vesicles and Golgi cisternae, the site of glycosphingolipid synthesis. These studies identify MDR1 as the major glucosyl ceramide flippase required for neutral glycosphingolipid anabolism and demonstrate a previously unappreciated dichotomy between neutral and acid glycosphingolipid synthesis.

GlcCer 1The abbreviations used are: GlcCer, glucosyl ceramide; MDR1, multi-drug resistance protein 1 (P-glycoprotein); MRP1, multidrug resistance protein 1; CsA, cyclosporin A; GSL, glycosphingolipid; Cer, ceramide; LacCer, lactosyl ceramide (Galβ1–4Glc ceramide); GM3, monosialoganglioside (SAα2–3Galβ1–4Glc ceramide); Gb3, globotriaosyl ceramide (Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc ceramide); Gb4, globotetraosyl ceramide (GalNacβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc ceramide); CTH, ceramide trihexoside; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; KOT, knock-out; VT1, verotoxin 1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. is the precursor of the majority of eukaryotic GSLs (1Stults C.L.M. Sweeley C.H. Macher B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 167-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The UDP galactose β1–4 glucosyl ceramide glycosyltransferase (LacCer synthase) within the Golgi lumen then provides the common precursor, LacCer for the synthesis of most complex GSL. Drug-resistant tumor cells have been shown to increase GlcCer synthesis (2Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 3Lucci A. Cho W. Han T. Giuliano A. Morton D. Cabot M. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar), and this has been postulated as a mechanism for drug resistance by providing an alternative biosynthetic destination for ceramide, which might otherwise induce apoptosis (4Liu Y.-Y. Han T.-Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). GlcCer is synthesized from ER-derived ceramide, on the cytosolic cis-Golgi surface (5Coste H. Martel M.B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J.

A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and may be transported to the plasma membrane from this site (8van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However, the active sites of the glycosyltransferases responsible for further elongation of GSLs are located within the Golgi lumen (9Lannert H. Bunning C. Jeckel D. Wieland F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Burger K. van der Bijl P. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, a mechanism for the translocation of GlcCer from the cytosolic surface of the Golgi to the lumen must exist. We have shown that transfection of cells with the mdr1 gene results in a marked elevation of GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb3 levels with a concomitant increase in cell sensitivity to the Gb3-binding verotoxin 1. Both effects were reversed in the presence of MDR1 inhibitors (11Lala P. Ito S. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We proposed that MDR1 can function as a GlcCer translocase to flip GlcCer to the inner Golgi surface to enhance LacCer and subsequent Gb3 synthesis. MDR1 has been shown to function as a membrane translocase for chemically modified short chain fatty acid GlcCer (8van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However such derivatized, indicator GSLs have been considered possible drug substrates for MDR1, and the ability of MDR1 to translocate natural, long-chain GSLs has been questioned on the basis of lack of overt phenotype in MDR1 knockout mice (12Borst P. Zelcer N. van Helvoort A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that fibroblasts from such mice are indeed defective in GSL synthesis, in the manner predicted from the in vitro MDR1 inhibition studies now reported. In this study, we address the question as to whether MDR1, which is widely expressed in normal tissues (13Lum B.L. Gosland M.P. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1995; 9: 319-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is involved in GSL synthesis in cultured cells in general. These studies fill a major gap in understanding the mechanism of GSL biosynthesis and demonstrate a new, unsuspected distinction between acidic and neutral GSL synthesis. MDCK cells transfected with the human MDR1 cDNA were a gift from Dr. M. Gottesman (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (14Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The human astrocytoma cell line SF-539, and IOMM Lee and CH157 MN meningioma cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. J. Rutka (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Vero, HEp-2, SF-539 astrocytoma, ovarian carcinoma SK VLB (MDR variant of the parental SKOV3 cell line (15Bradley G. Naik M. Ling V. Canc. Res. 1989; 49: 2790-2796PubMed Google Scholar)), MDR1-MDCK cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% or 10% FBS and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. MDR1-MDCK medium also contained 80 ng/ml colchicine, and SK VLB medium contained 1 μg/ml vinblastine. HeLa cells, NIH 3T3 cells, and meningioma IOMM Lee and CH157 MN cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 gm/liter of glucose for HeLa and 3T3, and with 1 gm/liter of glucose for meningioma cell lines) with 10% FBS. Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma and Jurkat E6.1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium also supplemented with 10% FBS. ECV 304 bladder carcinoma cell line (16MacLeod R.A. Dirks W.G. Matsuo Y. Kaufmann M. Milch H. Drexler H.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was maintained in M199 medium with 10% FBS and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. KOT cells (KOT11 and KOT51 subclones) are epidermal fibroblasts derived from a triple knock-out (mdr1 a-/-/b-/-/mrp1-/-) mouse (17Wijnholds J. deLange E.C. Scheffer G.L. van den Berg D.J.

Zeiss C.J. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1469-1476PubMed Google Scholar) and were a generous gift from Dr. J. Wijnholds (Department of Ophthalmo-genetics, Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute). Subclones were taken after 25 passages, after which the cells were grown for another 25 passages prior to use in the present studies. For MDR1 inhibition, cells were grown in medium containing inhibitor at the highest concentration (±4 or 8 μm CsA for 4 days, or 5, 10, or 15 μm ketoconazole for 5 days), which our prior studies had shown to have no effect on cell growth. VT1 was purified as described previously (19Nutikka A. Binnington-Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 73: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). Target cells in logarithmic growth phase were cultured in microtiter plates and incubated in triplicate, with increasing dilutions of VT1. After 72 h, the cells remaining attached were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and quantitated using a microtiter plate reader as previously (20Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Non-adherent Daudi and Jurkat cell survival data were calculated by 1% Trypan Blue dye exclusion. For MDR1 inhibition studies, CsA or ketoconazole was added to cells 4 or 5 days, respectively, prior to VT1 and maintained during the cytotoxicity assay. GSLs were extracted from 5 × 106 exponential growth phase cells. Adherent cells were scraped, and all cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was extracted with 20 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) as described (21Pudymaitis A. Armstrong G. Lingwood C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The extract was partitioned against water, and the lower phase was applied to a silica column in CHCl3/CH3OH (98:2). The column was washed extensively with CHCl3 and the glycolipid fraction eluted with CH3COCH3/CH3OH (9:1) (22Nutikka A. Binnington-Boyd B. Lingwood C. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 73: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar). Gangliosides were separated from pooled upper and lower phases by DEAE-Sephadex G-25 chromatography and eluted using 0.4 m ammonium acetate in methanol (23Yogeeswaran G. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2151-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Equivalent GSL aliquots, based on cell number, were separated by TLC, and the plates were dried and blocked with 1% gelatin in water at 37 °C overnight. After washing with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plates were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml VT1 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were incubated with monoclonal anti-VT1 antibody (24Boulanger J. Petric M. Lingwood C.A. Law H. Roscoe M. Karmali M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2830-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (2 μg/ml) followed, after washing, by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. VT1 bound was visualized with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (22Nutikka A. Binnington-Boyd B. Lingwood C. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 73: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar). Eighty percent confluent MDR1-MDCK cells were washed, scraped into PBS, and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m sucrose, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 10% of the supernatant (to give a crude, cell free “microsomal” fraction). Protein content was measured by BCA assay (Pierce). GSLs in MDR1-MDCK microsomes were metabolically labeled with UDP-[14C]galactose. 100 μl of the microsomal fraction (100 μg of protein) was incubated in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mm), and MnCl2 (10 mm) ± 4 μm CsA at 37 °C for 2 h, with shaking. 0.2 μCi of UDP-[14C]galactose was then added to a 300-μl final volume and incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. For some assays, exogenous liposomal GlcCer (60 μg sonicated in 20 μl of H2O) was added during the latter incubation. MDR1-MDCK Cells—GSLs of exponential growth phase cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine (0.5 μCi/ml) for 72 h, ± 4 μm CsA. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested by gently scraping. Cellular lipids were extracted and applied on DEAE-Sephadex as above. Neutral GSLs were unbound, and gangliosides were eluted with ammonium acetate (23Yogeeswaran G. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2151-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by TLC and labeled species quantitated by phosphorimaging. Mouse Wild Type and Knockout (KOT) Fibroblasts—Cells (wild type and KOT11 fibroblasts) were grown, in duplicate, in the presence of 2.5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate or 1 μCi/ml [14C]serine for 60 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (1:2.2:0.2, v/v), and extraction was allowed to proceed for 10 min. 3 ml was then transferred to an 11-ml glass tube, and 0.88 ml of CHCl3, 0.78 ml of Hanks' balance salt solution, and 0.78 ml of 10 mm acetic acid were added. Cells were then vortexed, and the lower phase was removed. The lower phase was dried and separated by two-dimensional TLC (first dimension, CHCl3:CH3OH:25% NH4OH:H2O (65:35:4:4, v/v); second dimension, CHCl3:CH3COCH3: CH3OH:CH3COOH:H2O (50:20:10:10:5, v/v)) and radioactive species quantitated by phosphorimaging and identified relative to standards. Wild type and KOT 51 fibroblasts were similarly labeled with [14C]serine ± 20 μm of indomethacin, a selective inhibitor of MRP1 (25Touhey S. O'Connor R. Plunkett S. Maguire A. Clynes M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 1661-1670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this case, the dried lipid extract was saponified in 600 μl of 0.2 m KOH in MeOH for 3 h at 37 °C, neutralized with 1.6 ml of 10 mm HAc, 2 ml of CHCl3, 1.8 ml of MeOH, and partitioned. Both phases were recombined, and polar products were removed on a SepPak C18 column. The methanol-eluted fraction was then separated by two-dimensional TLC as above. Western Blot Analysis of MDR1—Cell pellets were washed three times with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, 5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C. After spinning for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, SDS-PAGE (26Laemmeli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Western blotting were performed on 60-μg protein samples by a standard procedure (27Hill B. Whelan R. Hurst H. McClean S. Cancer Res. 1994; 73: 2990-2999Google Scholar) using anti-MDR1 monoclonal antibody C219 (1 μg/ml) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunostaining of Cell Surface MDR1—HeLa, MDR1-MDCK, Vero, SK VLB, IOMM Lee, and CH157 MN cells were grown on glass cover-slips. Washed cells were incubated with MRK-16 monoclonal anti-MDR1 antibody (10 μg/ml; Kamiya) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, also at 4 °C for 1 h. Following extensive washing with 50 mm PBS, the coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, mounted with DABCO, and examined and photographed using a Leica DMIRE 2 (Leica Canada, Ontario) fluorescence microscope under incident UV illumination. All images were recorded at the same exposure. Post-embedding Immunogold Cryo-electronmicroscopy—Logarithmic phase MDR1-MDCK cells were scraped and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2–4 h at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed thoroughly in phosphate buffer, embedded in 15% gelatin, cut into mm3-pieces, and infused with 2.3 m sucrose for several hours. The blocks were then mounted on aluminum cryo-ultramicrotomy pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryo-sections were cut with a diamond knife at -95 °C using a Leica Ultracut R cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Canada, Ontario). Sections were transferred to Formvar-coated nickel grids in a loop of molten sucrose, and the grids were washed thoroughly in PBS containing 0.15% glycine and 0.5% BSA and PBS containing BSA alone. Sections were then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against Golgi marker rab6 (32Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) for 1 h. Following a thorough rinse in PBS/BSA, samples were incubated in a goat anti-rabbit IgG 5-nm gold complex (Amersham Biosciences, Quebec, Canada) for 1 h. This procedure was repeated on the same specimens except MRK-16 anti-MDR1 antibody was used as the primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG 10-nm gold complex as the secondary antibody. Sections were then rinsed thoroughly with PBS followed by distilled water and stabilized in a thin film of methylcellulose containing 0.2% uranyl acetate. Controls included the omission of primary and secondary antisera and the use of an irrelevant antibody (either poly- or monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein). Samples were then examined in a JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA), and images were recorded using a charge-coupled device camera (AMT Corp.). Controls were uniformly negative for gold particles. Image analysis was performed on a minimum of 100 images from each group at a nominal magnification of 100,000× using an image analysis program (Image Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics) to determine cell particle density and percentage particle colocalization (where colocalization was defined as 5- and 10-nm particles being within 20 nm of each other). Data Analysis and Statistics—Differences in CD50 values for each of the cell lines, obtained before and after treatment with CsA and ketoconazole, were compared by 2-tailed non-parametric Student's t test. Means and standard deviations for each experimental point, repeated at least three times, as well as the statistical analysis were performed by GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. MDR1 Inhibitors Inhibit Gb3Synthesis and Protect Cells against VT1 Cytotoxicity—The Gb3-containing cell lines, MDR1-MDCK (canine epithelial), Vero (monkey epithelial), Hep-2 (human epithelial), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), Daudi (human B lymphoid), SF-539 (human astrocytoma), SK VLB (human ovarian carcinoma), Iomm Lee (human meningioma), CH157 MN (human meningioma), and ECV 304 (human bladder carcinoma) cell lines were analyzed for neutral GSL and Gb3 content and VT1 sensitivity, before and after ketoconazole or CsA treatment (Fig. 1 and Table I). For each cell line, these drugs were used at the maximum concentration, which alone had no effect on cell viability. Inhibition of MDR1 using either drug protected all cell lines (except HeLa cells) against VT1 cytotoxicity (Table I). The lower phase GSL fraction from control, CsA-treated, or ketoconazole-treated cells was separated by TLC and Gb3 identified by VT1/TLC overlay. In each case, (except HeLa cells), the Gb3 (and LacCer and GlcCer) content was significantly reduced in treated cells, correlating with the protection afforded against VT1 cytotoxicity. In HeLa cells, VT1 sensitivity and their Gb3 content was largely unaffected by either MDR1 inhibitor. The Gb3 content and VT1 sensitivity of SK VLB and ECV 304 cells was less effectively reduced after CsA, as opposed to ketoconazole treatment, consistent with our finding that the vinblastine sensitivity of these cell lines was affected only by ketoconazole (not shown). Despite the fact that Gb3 synthesis in ECV 304 and SF-539 cells was significantly inhibited by CsA, a reduced effect on VT1 sensitivity was observed. NIH 3T3 cells are VT1-insensitive and contain only trace levels, if any, Gb3 (28Meivar-Levy I. Futerman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The neutral GSLs of mouse 3T3 cells were eliminated by CsA treatment. Similarly, human T cells do not express Gb3 (29Cohen A. Madrid-Marina V. Estrov Z. Freedman M. Lingwood C.A. Dosch H.-M. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the neutral GSLs of the Jurkat T cell line (primarily GlcCer) were lost following culture with CsA (see Figs. 1 and 3a).Table IEffect of CsA or ketoconazole on cell line VT1 sensitivity The effect of MDR1 inhibition on the sensitivity of exponentially growing cell cultures to VT1 was determined. The VT1 dose required to kill 50% of cells (CD50) calculated from the dose response was increased for all cells (except HeLa), after culture of cells with CsA or ketoconazole as described in Fig. 1. For each experiment, the effect on cell sensitivity to vinblastine was simultaneously assayed to confirm efficacy to prevent MDR1-mediated drug efflux.Cell typeaDose-dependent VT1 cytotoxicity assayed in triplicate, repeated at least twicePretreatmentNone,CD50CsAKetoconazoleCD50Approximate increasep valueCD50Approximate increasep valueng/mlng/ml-foldng/ml-foldMDCK-MDR13.00 × 10-60.42105<0.00014.50 × 10-21050.0001Vero3.95 × 10-60.195 × 104<0.00012.60 × 10-36 × 102<0.0001SF 5390.0431.69390.00013.16 × 10-17.3<0.0001HEp-24.58 × 10-60.0143 × 1030.00112.40 × 10-45 × 1020.0011HeLa2.54 × 10-62.8 × 10-610.22 NSbNS, not significant3.32 × 10-610.08 NSIOMM Lee4.00 × 10-476.802 × 108<0.0001NDcND, not determinedCH157 MN0.3826.47700.0005NDDaudi4.391.78 × 1034 × 1020.0449.94 × 1032 × 103<0.0001SK VLB7.86 × 10-97.0 × 10-910.35 NS7.93 × 10-7100<0.0001ECV 3047.85 × 10-97.7 × 10-910.49 NS4.80 × 10-26 × 1050.0001a Dose-dependent VT1 cytotoxicity assayed in triplicate, repeated at least twiceb NS, not significantc ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Comparison of the effect of MDR1 inhibition on GM3/ganglioside and Gb3/neutral GSL synthesis.a, cellular GSL content.

Neutral GSLs were visualized by orcinol and VT1 overlay for Gb3. Gangliosides were visualized using resorcinol staining. Similar results were obtained in three experiments. b, metabolic labeling MDR1-MDCK cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]serine ± 4 μm CsA for 4 days, and the neutral and acidic GSLs were extracted, separated, and resolved by TLC and visualized by autoradiography.

The [14C]serine-labeled doublet in the neutral GSL fraction comigrates with sphingomyelin and is reactive with the molybdenum stain for phosphate (not shown). This experiment was repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of CsA on Cell-free Glycolipid Synthesis—GSL synthesis (LacCer and some Gb3) in a crude MDR1-MDCK microsomal fraction, monitored by [14C]UDP-galactose incorporation, was inhibited by CsA (Fig. 2). Addition of exogenous GlcCer increased LacCer labeling, but CsA inhibition was maintained. Selective CsA Inhibition of Neutral Glycolipid as Opposed to Ganglioside Synthesis—GlcCer is the precursor of both gangliosides and neutral GSLs. We therefore compared the effect of ketoconazole or CsA on the synthesis of Gb3 and GM3, the simplest ganglioside, in MDR1-MDCK and Vero cells. The effect of CsA on Jurkat cell GlcCer, the only neutral GSL made, and ganglioside content, was compared. In Vero cells cultured with ketoconazole and MDR1-MDCK cells cultured with CsA, Gb3 levels were inhibited by >95%, whereas the level of GM3, the only ganglioside expressed, was unaffected. In Jurkat cells, GlcCer was reduced by >90%, whereas GM3, GM1, and one unidentified, more polar, ganglioside were unaltered after CsA treatment (Fig. 3a). Autoradiography of the metabolically labeled neutral and acidic GSL fraction of MDR1-MDCK cells cultured with or without CsA, shows that, although Gb3 synthesis was significantly reduced, the synthesis of GM3 and the more complex gangliosides were not inhibited at all by CsA (Fig. 3b). Sphingomyelin was identified in the [14C]serine-labeled neutral GSL fraction (Fig. 3a), and labeling was not inhibited, even slightly enhanced, in CsA-treated cells. Glycolipid/Phospholipid Profile of Mouse mdr1a, 1b mrp1 Knockout Fibroblasts—Mice contain two MDR1 homologous genes, which have been knocked out in combination with MRP1 (17Wijnholds J. deLange E.C.

Comparison of the metabolic labeling of GSLs of fibroblasts from knockout mice (mdr 1a-/-, 1b-/-mrp 1-/-), and wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 4 and Table II) showed the same effect we observed with CsA and ketoconazole treatment of cell lines. [14C]Acetate and [14C]serine labeling of GlcCer and LacCer in the KOT cells was markedly reduced (by >80 and 90%, respectively, Table II) as compared with wild type fibroblasts. Synthesis of an uncharacterized CTH Table II species was also reduced, but less severely. In contrast, labeling of GM3 ganglioside was not significantly affected. Phospholipid labeling was also altered in the KOT cells: sphingomyelin labeling was increased, and phosphatidyl choline labeling with [14C]serine was reduced. Neutral lipid labeling from either [14C]acetate or [14C]serine was also significantly reduced in KOT cells.Table IIQuantitation of metabolic labeling of GSL of MDR1 knockout fibroblasts with [14C]acetate or [14C]serine (shown inFig. 4) The metabolically radiolabeled lipids extracted from cells (in duplicate) and separated by two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 4) were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. By both [14C]acetate (A) and [14C]serine (B) labeling, the synthesis of neutral GSLs GlcCer and LacCer was severely reduced, whereas GM3 ganglioside synthesis was not inhibited in the KOT cells, as compared to the wild type control. Phospholipid synthesis was relatively unaffected except for increased SM synthesis and a marked decrease in PC labeling from [14C]serine.

https://openalex.org/W2089917418,"We have used a lentiviral vector to stably express p53 at a physiological level in p53 knockout HCT116 cells. Cells transduced with wild type p53 responded to genotoxic stress by stabilizing p53 and expressing p53 target genes. The reconstituted cells underwent G1 arrest or apoptosis appropriately depending on the type of stress, albeit less efficiently than parental wild type cells. Compared with cells expressing exogenous wild type p53, the apoptotic response to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) was >50% reduced in cells expressing S15A or S20A mutant p53, and even more reduced by combined mutation of serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 33, and 37 (N6A). Among a panel of p53 target genes tested by quantitative PCR, the gene showing the largest defect in induction by 5FU was BBC3 (PUMA), which was induced 4-fold by wild type p53 and 2-fold by the N6A mutant. Mutation of N-terminal phosphorylation sites did not prevent p53 stabilization by doxorubicin or 5FU. MDM2 silencing by RNA interference activated p53 target gene expression in normal fibroblasts but not in HCT116 cells, and exogenous p53 could be stabilized in HCT116 knockout cells despite combined mutation of p53 phosphorylation sites and silencing of MDM2 expression. The MDM2 feedback loop is thus defective, and other mechanisms must exist to regulate p53 stability and function in this widely used tumor cell line.

The MDM2 feedback loop is thus defective, and other mechanisms must exist to regulate p53 stability and function in this widely used tumor cell line. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in over 50% of human tumors and plays an important role in the response to genotoxic stress and hypoxia (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5870) Google Scholar). p53 responds to upstream signals by activating transcription of genes important for cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The spectrum of target genes induced depends on the type of stress and the tissue analyzed (2Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In additional to its transcriptional activity p53 also induces apoptosis by non-transcriptional mechanisms, including inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL at the mitochondrial membrane (3Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Upstream regulators of p53 function include the MDM2 oncogene and the p14ARF tumor suppressor gene (4Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). MDM2 is a p53 target gene that acts in a negative feedback loop to inhibit p53 by blocking the access of transcription co-factors to the p53 transactivation domain (6Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) and by inducing p53 degradation (7Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 8Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3769) Google Scholar).

This leads to p53 poly-ubiquitination by p300, and it is the poly-ubiquitinated form that is degraded by the proteasome (5Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 9Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 10Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The second major type of regulation of p53 is phosphorylation by kinases, including ATM, ATR, chk1, chk2, JNK1, CDK1, CDK2, casein kinases 1 and 2, protein kinase C, and the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase (reviewed by Anderson and Appella (11Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 3. Academic Press, New York2003: 237-247Google Scholar)). Kinases targeting the N-terminal transactivation domain are of particular interest, because they can regulate the recruitment of transcription cofactors and the binding of MDM2. The most intensively studied sites are serines 15, 20, 33, and 37. In response to DNA damage, Ser-15 is phosphorylated by the ATM and ATR kinases, and Ser-20 by the chk1 and chk2 kinases. Ser-15 phosphorylation is thought to regulate binding of transcription co-factors like the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (12Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and Ser-20 to regulate the binding of MDM2 (13Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-33 and Ser-37 leads to acetylation of Lys-382 by p300 (14Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Several other histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes have been implicated in transcriptional activation by p53, including p300/CBP-associated factor, transformation/transcription domain-associated protein, and general control of amino acid synthesis 5-like protein complexes (14Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 15Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The model that emerges from these studies is that phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of p53. Against this must be set a large body of evidence from mutagenesis studies showing little or no effect of mutating p53 phosphorylation sites (17Blattner C. Tobiasch E. Litfen M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). There is no doubt that the sites are phosphorylated in vivo in response to stress, as has been demonstrated repeatedly by 32P labeling and by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies (11Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 3. Academic Press, New York2003: 237-247Google Scholar, 19Saito S. Yamaguchi H. Higashimoto Y. Chao C. Xu Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37536-37544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the assays used to test p53 function employed overexpression systems or cells with constitutive or defective signaling to p53. Tumor cells lacking p53 function frequently activate transfected wild type p53 constitutively, either as a result of ongoing DNA damage or as a side effect of the transfection procedure. To avoid this problem, one can use cells that have retained wild type p53. It is possible to see regulation of the stability of exogenously supplied p53 mutants in these cells, but it is difficult to test the transcriptional activity or apoptotic function of the mutants because of the presence of the resident wild type allele (18Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Finally, it is now possible using knock-in mouse technology to test the activity of specific mutants expressed from the endogenous locus. This approach has only been applied to a small number of phosphorylation sites, but 18A and 23A knock-in mice (equivalent to 15A and 20A in human p53) are not spontaneously tumor prone, suggesting that phosphorylation on these sites is not essential for the tumor suppressor activity of p53 (20Chao C.

Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we have used a lentiviral vector to stably express p53 regulatory site mutants at a normal, physiological level. We used a cell line that was derived from wild type p53-containing HCT116 cells by gene disruption. By definition, the parental cells tolerate the presence of wild type p53, and several studies have shown that they respond appropriately to diverse stresses (22Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C.

We show that exogenous p53 in these cells can be stabilized, activate p53 target genes, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to stress, and we describe the phenotype of classic p53 regulatory mutants in these cells. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HCT116 and p53-null derivatives were supplied by Dr. B. Vogelstein (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Human diploid lung fibroblasts (HLFs) were supplied by Dr. M. Nabholz. DO7 mouse hybridoma cells were supplied by Dr. D. Lane (24Vojtesek B. Bartek J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 151: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were DO7 and FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for p53, C-19, for p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and SMP-14 for MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Flow cytometry was performed as described by Saller et al. (25Saller E. Tom E. Brunori M. Otter M. Estreicher A. Mack D.H. Iggo R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4424-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide was used at 60 mg/liter to block protein synthesis for measurement of p53 stability. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA, random hexamers, and SuperScriptII polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative PCR was performed on a Lightcycler (Roche Applied Science, Switzerland) for Fig. 1D and Table I, and a PE5700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) for Figs. 5 and 7. Samples were measured in duplicate on the Lightcycler and in triplicate on the PE5700. The range was ±10% of the mean threshold cycle number for samples tested on the Lightcycler. The standard deviation of the triplicate measurements on the PE5700 is shown as error bars in the figures. The amount of mRNA was normalized to ribosomal RNA in Figs. 5 and 7 and to HPRT1 and SDHA1 as described by Vandesompele et al. (26Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N.

For lentivirus production, the lentiviral vector plasmid (20 μg) and second generation packaging plasmids (5 μg of pMD2-VSVG and 15 μg of pCMVΔR8.91) (27Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D.

Trono (www.tronolab.unige.ch). Lentivirus-containing supernatant was collected 36 h after transfection, 0.2 μm-filtered, and snap-frozen at –70 °C. HCT116 p53 knockout cells were infected at low multiplicity (∼10% transduction efficiency) and selected in puromycin to ensure that each cell contained only a single integrated provirus. For MDM2 RNAi, shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors were created by Gateway recombination (Invitrogen) using the plasmid pSP-161 as described by Bridge et al. (28Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A.

These PCR products were re-amplified with primer oSP-122 and an attB2-modified primer, GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCAAAAAGCTTCCA. PCR products were cloned into pSP-161 using BP clonase (Invitrogen) to give pSP-173 (MDM2 shRNA A), pSP-174 (MDM2 shRNA B), pSP-212 (MDM2 shRNA C), pSP-192 (no shRNA insert), and pSP-221 (Pirh2). For RNAi experiments, HLFs and HCT116 cells were infected at a multiplicity of 5–10 infectious units per cell. Exogenous p53 Responds to DNA Damage in p53 Knockout HCT116 Cells—Wild type p53 was cloned into a lentiviral vector under the control of the RSV promoter (Fig. 1A). p53 knockout derivatives of HCT116 colon tumor cells were infected with this virus, and transduced cells were selected with puromycin. For simplicity, “parental wt” in the figures refers to endogenous wild type p53 in parental HCT116 cells; all other forms are expressed from integrated lentiviruses in p53 knockout cells. The RSV promoter construct was chosen because integration of a single copy of the virus in these cells gave a level of expression of exogenous p53 similar to that of parental wt p53 (Fig. 1B). The difference in migration of the two p53 forms is explained by the codon 72R/P polymorphism (see below). The level of MDM2 and p21 was substantially higher before 5FU treatment in the p53 expressing cells than in knockout cells transduced with a control virus (Fig. 1B). This indicates that p53 has basal transcriptional activity in the absence of exogenous stress. If signaling to p53 is intact in these cells, treatment with DNA-damaging and chemotherapeutic agents should induce p53 stabilization, p53 target gene expression, and cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) is an anti-metabolite that is converted to FdUMP, which inhibits thymidylate synthase but has additional effects on RNA metabolism that are more important for the apoptotic response in these cells (22Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that 5FU treatment led to an increase in level of the p53, MDM2, and p21 proteins, which was the same in the p53-transduced and parental wt cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increase in p53 level after 5FU treatment was due to protein stabilization, cells were treated with cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). The half-life of both endogenous and exogenous protein increased in response to 5FU, although the difference was slightly greater in the parental wild type cells. The target gene response to 5FU was tested at the RNA level by quantitative PCR (Fig. 1D). The magnitude of the p21 and MDM2 RNA induction was similar in the p53-transduced and parental wt cells. Finally, the biological consequences of p53 activation were tested by flow cytometry. In untreated cells, the cell cycle distribution was similar in the presence and absence of p53 (Fig. 1E, control). In parental wt cells, the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin induced G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest, whereas 5FU induced apoptosis (Fig. 1E, parental wt). Knockout cells transduced with control virus failed to undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis in response to these treatments (Fig. 1E, null). Transduction of wild type p53 restored both the G1 arrest response to doxorubicin and the apoptotic response to 5FU (Fig. 1E, wt), although the magnitude of the response was reduced compared with the parental wild type cells. A trivial explanation for the difference is that the exogenous p53 has proline at codon 72, whereas the parental cells have arginine (31Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra 3rd, A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). To rule this out, both p53 isoforms were tested in the lentiviral system. The stability, inducibility, and apoptotic phenotype of the two forms were similar in all of the assays performed (Fig. 2). In summary, p53-null HCT116 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing wild type p53 respond to DNA-damaging and chemotherapeutic agents by stabilizing p53 and inducing expression of p53 target genes. They undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis appropriately depending on the type of stress, but the response is weaker than in parental wt cells. Response of Phosphorylation and Acetylation Site Mutants to Doxorubicin—Because exogenous p53 can respond to DNA damage signals in the p53 knockout cells, the signaling pathways upstream of p53 must be largely intact in these cells. Indeed, Saito et al. (19Saito S. Yamaguchi H. Higashimoto Y. Chao C. Xu Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37536-37544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) recently tested p53 for modification at 12 different sites in parental wt HCT116 cells using phosphorylation and acetylation-specific antibodies and showed that all of the sites mutant in our constructs are modified in response to genotoxic stress. To test the role of different modifications in HCT116 cells, the following mutants were cloned into the lentiviral vector: single mutants S15A, S20A, and K382R; a double mutant S33A/S37A; and a sextuple mutant S6A/S9A/S15A/S20A/S33A/S37A (“N6A”). None of the mutations prevents MDM2 binding (18Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The tumor mutant 175H was used as a negative control: it fails to transactivate p53 target genes and is usually stable in the absence of DNA damage signaling in cells lacking p53 function. Doxorubicin was used to introduce double strand DNA breaks. These activate ATM and chk2, which directly phosphorylate Ser-15 and Ser-20 (11Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 3. Academic Press, New York2003: 237-247Google Scholar). Two antibodies were used to test the p53 level: a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all forms of p53, and the monoclonal antibody DO7 whose binding is known not to be affected by post-translational modifications (13Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of all of the p53 mutants except 175H increased after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3A; the 20A mutation destroys the DO7 epitope, explaining the absence of signal with this mutant and N6A). The mutant showing the best inducibility was 20A (2.9-fold increase in p53 level after doxorubicin treatment, versus 3.5-fold for parental wt, 1.9-fold for exogenous wt, and 1.5- to 2.3-fold for the other mutants). The good response of 20A is paradoxical, given the postulated role of serine 20 phosphorylation in blocking MDM2 binding. All of the regulatory site mutants were able to induce p21 and MDM2 expression, although none was as efficient as parental wild type p53 (Fig. 3A). In particular, the good inducibility of the 20A mutant at the p53 protein level did not result in a better induction of p21 or MDM2. Cells containing the regulatory site mutants showing the least inducibility of p21 and MDM2 still expressed more p21 and MDM2 in the uninduced state than the 175H mutant, indicating that even low levels of these mutants have demonstrable transcriptional activity. Flow cytometry was used to test the biological activity of the mutants. As described above, parental wt cells gave 2-fold more G1 arrest than the cells transduced with wild type p53. The correct control for assessment of the contribution of the regulatory sites is thus the cells transduced with the lentiviral wild type vector, not the parental wt cells. Despite the lower induced p21 level with some mutants (range 0.5 to 0.9 relative to the p21 level with exogenous wt), all except 175H were able to induce G1 arrest to a similar level as was seen with exogenous wild type p53 (Fig. 3B). In summary, mutation to alanine of Ser-15 and Ser-20, which are highly conserved and known to be phosphorylated by ATM and chk2 in response to DNA double strand breaks, does not prevent p53 stabilization following doxorubicin treatment. Mutation of either residue, as well as mutation of K382 to a non-acetylatable form, causes a small reduction in the transcriptional response detected by Western blotting for p21 and MDM2. None of the mutations tested can abolish the G1 arrest response, although it is important to note that the response in all cases was weaker than in the parental wt cells. These results are compatible with phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 and acetylation of Lys-382 playing a role in the recruitment of transcription cofactors to the promoters of p53 target genes, although no single change can abolish the transcriptional response and even multiple substitutions have at best a partial effect. Response of Phosphorylation and Acetylation Site Mutants to 5FU—Cells expressing the same mutants were then tested with 5FU. All except the 175H control were stabilized following drug treatment (Fig. 4A). p21 and MDM2 were induced to a similar extent as in the parental wt cells (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry showed defects in apoptosis induction by the 15A, 20A, N6A, and 382R mutants (Fig. 4B). Relative to exogenous wild type p53, individual mutations produced a >50% reduction in the apoptotic response, whereas the combined N6A mutations reduced apoptosis to the background level seen in the p53-null cells. Because the apoptotic response of the 33A/37A mutant was the same as with exogenous wild type p53, the loss of activity of the N6A mutant is most likely due to the combined effect of the 15A and 20A mutants. A biological role for acetylation of lysine 382 is suggested by the partial loss of apoptosis induction by this mutant. Because the effects were only partial, the experiments were repeated using cells infected at a higher multiplicity of infection, resulting in a higher starting level of p53. The level of apoptosis increased with the p53 level, confirming that p53 function is only partially impaired by the mutations (data not shown). p21 and MDM2 do not induce apoptosis, so the normal induction of these genes by the N6A mutant does not rule out a transcriptional basis for the apoptotic defect of this mutant. To identify possible transcriptional mediators of the effect, we selected a group of genes induced on microarrays by wt p53 in these cells 2M. D. Kaeser, S. Pebernard, and R. D. Iggo, unpublished data. plus some likely candidates culled from the literature, and examined their induction by the N6A mutant using quantitative PCR. The basal level of expression of all of the genes was slightly lower with the N6A mutant (Table I, Basal). This could be explained by a difference in expression of the wt and N6A p53 from the integrated lentiviruses, but the ratio of the p53 mRNA levels measured in the same samples was 1.0, suggesting that the transduced cell populations were well matched. There were small differences in the inducibility of the genes tested, although all could still be induced (Table I). The largest difference was in the induced level of the BBC3 gene (PUMA), which has previously been implicated in apoptosis induction by p53 in HCT116 cells (32Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W.

Tethered on plasma membrane, these enzymes are potentially regulated by the trafficking machinery of the cells.

The cell surface, populated with various protein molecules that mediate communications between the cell and its immediate environment, in many ways defines the cellular phenotype. One class of such molecules is cell surface proteinases that exert functional influence through irreversible cleavage of their substrates (1Werb Z.

Therefore, these surface proteinases should be regulated properly, and perhaps, differently from other cell surface molecules. The membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases or MT-MMPs 1The abbreviations used are: MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; MDCK cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: MT-MMP, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase; MDCK cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. are good examples of cell surface proteinases employed by various cell types to alter their surrounding environment during angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, tumor invasion, and metastasis (1Werb Z.

Yet little is known about the cellular mechanisms regulating the trafficking of MT-MMPs to and from the cell surface. The MT-MMP subfamily can be divided into two subgroups, MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs with type I transmembrane domains and MT4- and MT6-MMPs with glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar, 7Pei D. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Because the first group MT-MMPs have similar structures at their carboxyl termini with transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails, it is expected that their activities should be regulated by the trafficking machinery that presumably interacts with their cytoplasmic tails (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Given their apparent divergence in their cytoplasmic domains, the trafficking pattern of each MT-MMP may differ significantly (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Indeed, although MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are regulated by endocytosis, MT5-MMP does not appear to internalize well in the cells analyzed (24Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Functionally, we have recently shown that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP have distinct activities toward two well established substrates, proMMP-2 and type I collagen (25Jiang A. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38765-38771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these distinctions are encoded in their individual domains, i.e. catalytic and hemopexin domains, as analyzed by domain-swapping experiments (25Jiang A. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38765-38771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the type I MT-MMPs may be regulated coordinately by the cellular trafficking machinery to deliver their distinct proteolytic activities to the cell surface. In this report we demonstrate that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are co-internalized and co-routed through the recycling pathway back to the cell surface, providing the cells a unique way to regulate their activity dynamically under physiological as well as pathological conditions. Cell Culture—Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained as described (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MT1-MMPΔ3 was constructed by a two-step process using high fidelity PCR and inserted in the EcoRV site of pCR3.1 expression vector as described (7Pei D. J. Biol.

The DNA constructs were transfected into various cells by Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Select experiments were performed in the presence of MMP inhibitor, BB-94 and MP-070, to prevent the autocatalytic decay of MT1-MMP. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Gelatin Zymography— These procedures have been described previously (7Pei D. J. Biol.

In brief, serum-free media supplemented with purified pro-MMP-2 or proMMP-2 in fetal bovine serum (5% v/v) were added to cells. After the indicated time period, conditioned media were collected, cleared of cell debris by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS/PAGE impregnated with gelatin (1 mg/ml) as described (7Pei D. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors mixture tablet Complete (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g, 20 min) to remove debris, and the resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated and blotted as described (28Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—For internalization experiments cells seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and shifted to 4 °C. Anti-MT-MMP antibodies were added to the cells at 0.2 μg/ml for 2 h. Antibody was subsequently removed, and cells were washed before being shifted to 37 °C with prewarmed media for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline diluent (0.3% Triton X-100, 1% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.2) for 1 h followed by staining with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted by NO-FADE (10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% p-phenylenediamine, pH 8.0). For colocalization experiments, cells were labeled with M2 anti-FLAG or anti-p230 antibodies as the primary antibodies after fixation followed by Alex-595-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was carried out in the Biomedical Image Processing laboratories at the University of Minnesota using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 system attached to an Olympus microscope (Melville, NY) with a 60× oil objective. The images were processed in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Quantification was carried out in Openlab (Improvision, Coventry, UK). The statistic analysis was done with GraphPad Prism software program (San Diego, CA). Recycling Patterns for MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP—We have recently demonstrated that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP differ greatly in their activities against type I collagen and proMMP-2 (25Jiang A. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38765-38771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is not clear if they are regulated similarly by the cellular trafficking machinery, given the apparent divergence between their cytoplasmic domains (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine the difference between these two enzymes, we extended our internalization experiments up to 90 min as described (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP virtually followed the same pattern of recycling as shown in Fig. 1A. Both molecules were labeled on the cell surface at 4 °C (Fig. 1A, panels a and b). Upon shifting to 37 °C to commence internalization, a lag period of 10 min was observed (Fig. 1A, panels c and d). In the next 20 min most of the cell surface MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP were internalized (Fig. 1A, panels e and f). Between 50–70 min the internalized molecules appeared to have recycled back to the cell surface (Fig. 1A, panels g, h, i, and j). Further incubations suggest that the recycled MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are re-internalized again, resembling the steady state pattern observed for MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, panels k and l), suggesting that an equilibrium is achieved through the recycling of MT-MMPs between intracellular pools and the cell surface. Because internalized MT-MMPs may enter intracellular compartments where MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP dissociates from their respective antibodies, the observed findings in Fig. 1A may reflect the route of the dissociated antibody rather than that of the two enzymes. To address this concern, we re-stained the cells that underwent internalization with rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody and found that the internalized MT1-MMPs labeled with mouse anti-MT1-MMP antibody remained reactive with the rabbit antibody (Fig. 1B, panel b), strongly suggesting that the internalized MT1-MMP-antibody complex remains intact. Similar results were obtained for the MT3-MMP-antibody complex (data not shown). Further quantification supports the conclusion that both MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP undergo internalization and recycling in a similar fashion (Fig. 1C). To confirm whether the recycled MT1-MMPs are indeed re-exposed on cell surface, we labeled MT1-MMP on the cell surface with FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1D, panels a–c), allowed them to internalize for 30 min, stripped off any residual antibodies on the cell surface (Fig. 1D, panels g–l), and then incubated for a further 30 min to allow the internalized MT1-MMP to resurface (Fig. 1D, panel j–l). Should the resurfaced MT1-MMP molecules remain associated with the mouse antibodies, anti-mouse IgG should be able to detect these resurfaced molecules. Indeed, we detected the resurfaced mouse antibodies as shown in Fig. 1D, panel l. Similar results were obtained when MT3-MMP recycling was analyzed in a similar fashion (data not shown). Together, we conclude that both MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP recycles through the intracellular compartment. Recycling of MT-MMPs through the Trans-Golgi Network—To understand the route of MT1-MMP recyling we traced the internalized MT1-MMP with markers for various vesicles. Consistent with our previously conclusion that the internalized MT1-MMP enters the endosomes (23Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we observed that the newly internalized MT1-MMPs co-localize with RUFY, a rab4-interacting protein associated with early endosomes (29Yang J. Kim O. Wu J. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30219-30226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). When most of the cell surface labels were internalized, a significant portion of the internalized MT1-MMP became co-localized with p230, a marker for trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2B, panel b). Interestingly, we also found that a majority portion of the internalized MT1-MMPs are co-localized with furin, a resident protein in the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with internalized MT3-MMP (data not shown). Given these results, we conclude that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are internalized through the early endosomes, routed through the trans-Golgi network, where they are recycled back to the cell surface. Co-internalization of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP—The recycling patterns of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are very similar as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, suggesting that they may recycle through the same vesicles. To test this possibility, we co-transfected cells with both MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP and performed internalization experiments with mouse anti-MT1-MMP antibody and rabbit anti-MT3-MMP antibodies as described in Fig. 1. A time course study revealed that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP are virtually co-localized throughout the recycling process. As shown in Fig. 3A, signals of internalized MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP overlapped in almost 100% of the vesicles observed. This observation is consistent with the recent report that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP share similar motifs in their cytoplasmic domains for internalization (24Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the observed co-internalization is due to passive segregation of cell surface molecules in the same vesicles, we compared the internalization of MT1-MMP with that of transferrin. As shown in Fig. 3B, transferrin is internalized much faster than MT1-MMP, with the internalization process virtually completed in 5–10 min, compared with a time frame of 30–40 min for MT1-MMP. These data strongly suggest that MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP share the same internalization pathway, distinct from that employed by transferrin. The Carboxyl Motif DKV582 in MT1-MMP Is Required for Its Recycling—To begin to probe the cellular machinery regulating MT1-MMP recycling, we analyzed a panel of MT1-MMP mutants with carboxyl-terminal truncations. One of the mutants, MT1-MMPΔ3 (Fig. 4A), revealed an interesting pattern of trafficking. Distinct from the pattern exhibited by wild type MT1-MMP shown in Fig. 1A, panels g and i, this mutant fails to recycle to the cell surface after an apparently normal internalization process (Fig. 4B). Further quantitative analysis confirmed that MT1-MMPΔ3 follows the same kinetics as wild type MT1-MMP during internalization (Fig. 4C, 10 and 30 min) but remains intracellular when the wild type molecules recycle to the cell surface (Fig. 4C, 50 and 70 min). Similar results were obtained with MT3-MMP (data not shown). Together these data suggest that the well conserved DKV582 motif in MT1-MMP encodes a signal for recycling. In this report we describe the recycling of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP in MDCK cells in a coordinated fashion. Both molecules recycle every 60 min between plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, mostly trans-Golgi and endosomal vesicles, in a pattern distinct from the transferrin receptor. These findings outline a basic trafficking map for the MT-MMPs, which may be exploited for the development of drugs against MT-MMP-dependent pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis. Furthermore, our data raise the possibility that MT-MMPs can be mobilized in a coordinated fashion to specialized areas of the cell membrane where focalized proteolysis is a prerequisite for many pathological and physiological conditions. One concern about the experimental system described here is the bivalent nature of the antibodies used, which may bind to both the antigens (MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP) and the antibody receptors on cell surface, thus altering the trafficking pattern. Fortunately, MDCK is a well characterized cell line utilized routinely for trafficking-related studies (30Jou T.S. Leung S.M. Fung L.M. Ruiz W.G. Nelson W.J. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). So far, no Fc receptors have been reported for MDCK cells, and Fc receptor had to be transfected into MDCK cells when IgG transcytosis was investigated (30Jou T.S. Leung S.M. Fung L.M. Ruiz W.G. Nelson W.J. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Seiki and co-workers (24Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) observe no difference between intact IgG and its Fab fragment in internalization and trafficking of MT1-MMP in several cell lines. Finally, the fact that both the wild type MT1-MMP and MT1-MMPΔ3 underwent distinct routes of trafficking, as detected by the same antibodies in the same cells, also suggests that the Fc moiety has no effect on MT1-MMP trafficking. In agreement, a report was published using antibody labeling to demonstrate that MT1-MMP does recycle back to cell surface (32Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Together, the data presented in this report reflect the trafficking pattern of MT-MMPs without the influence from any potential Fc-Fc receptor interaction. Recycling of MT-MMPs may be one of the strategies to mobilize their proteolytic activity rapidly in response to physiological and pathological signals. This mechanism may allow the cells to maintain a dynamic pool of MT-MMPs readily deployable to the cell surface. Recycling may also enable the cells to redistribute cell surface molecules as described for endothelin-converting enzyme (33Muller L. Barret A. Etienne E. Meidan R. Valdenaire O. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Redistribution of the MT-MMPs may mobilize pre-existent molecules to cell surface locations or compartments undergoing active proteolysis, thus affording the cells the capability to regulate proteolytic activity without altering the profile of gene expression. The observed co-recycling of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP suggests that both enzymes could be coordinated at the cellular level through trafficking events to focus their distinct proteolytic activities on the extracellular matrix barriers encountered by cells such as metastasizing tumor cells. Indeed, both MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP have been localized together in malignant tumor specimens (19Sato H. Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Ueno H. Nakamura H. Inoue M. Imai K. Noguchi M. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2055-2060PubMed Google Scholar). Given the irreversible nature of proteolysis, a selective advantage may be achieved by re-directing MT-MMPs to focal area where the underling extracellular matrix is hydrolyzed abnormally. The hydrolysis of extracellular matrix would certainly lead to alteration of the cell microenvironment, which could confer growth advantages for the surrounding cells such that subsequent mutations and genetic alterations can be accumulated. Thus, therapeutic or preventive intervention may be designed against the trafficking pathway of MT-MMPs. Finally, we defined a recycling-deficient mutant in MT1-MMP, i.e. MT1-MMPΔ3. Urena et al. (22Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) note that the carboxyl-terminal residue of MT1-MMP and transforming growth factor α determines their subcellular localization. However, the carboxyl-terminal mutant of MT1-MMP analyzed by these investigators failed to mature properly (22Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to our finding that MT1-MMPΔ3 behaves just like the wild type molecule except for its recycling to cell surface. More work is needed to reconcile our observation with that of Urena et al. (22Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular proteins interacting with this motif remain unknown. However, we have identified an adaptor protein with two PDZ motifs that can interact with the analogous EWV motif of MT5-MMP. 2X. Wang, P. Wang, and D. Pei, unpublished results. Interestingly, through a phage display screen, the DKV582 motif of MT1-MMP was identified as a binding site for the PDZ domain of the nNOS protein (21Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to implicate nNOS in the trafficking of MT1-MMP. 3A. Jiang and D. Pei, unpublished results. Given the specific defect identified for MT1-MMPΔ3 in this report, we are currently searching for the cellular factor that can interact with the DKV582 motif of MT1-MMP and regulate its trafficking in cells. We thank members of the Pei laboratory for encouragement and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1972532256,"The transcriptional events that control T cell tolerance are still poorly understood. To investigate why tolerant T cells fail to produce interleukin (IL)-2, we analyzed the regulation of NFkappaB-mediated transcription in CD4(+) T cells after tolerance induction in vivo. We demonstrate that a predominance of p50-p50 homodimers binding to the IL-2 promoter kappaB site in tolerant T cells correlated with repression of NFkappaB-driven transcription. Impaired translocation of the p65 subunit in tolerant T cells was a result from reduced activation of IkappaB kinase and poor phosphorylation and degradation of cytosolic IkappaBs. Moreover, tolerant T cells expressed high amounts of the p50 protein. However, the increased expression of p50 could not be explained by activation-induced de novo synthesis of the precursor p105, which was constitutively expressed in tolerant T cells. We also demonstrate the exclusive induction of the IkappaB protein B cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl-3) in tolerant T cells as well as its specific binding to the NFkappaB site. These results suggest that the cellular ratio of NFkappaB dimers, and thus the repression of NFkappaB activity and IL-2 production, are regulated at several levels in tolerant CD4(+) T cells in vivo."

DGKs have been widely studied in animals, but their analysis in plants is fragmentary. Here, we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of AtDGK2, encoding DGK from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtDGK2 has a predicted molecular mass of 79.4 kDa and, like AtDGK1 previously reported, harbors two copies of a phorbol ester/DAG-binding domain in its N-terminal region.

Phylogenetically, plant DGKs fall into three clusters. Members of all three clusters are widely expressed in vascular plants. Recombinant AtDGK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. The enzyme phosphorylated 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol to yield PA, exhibiting Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. Estimated Km and Vmax values were 125 μm for DAG and 0.25 pmol of PA min-1 μg-1, respectively. The enzyme was maximally active at pH 7.2. Its activity was Mg2+-dependent and affected by the presence of detergents, salts, and the DGK inhibitor R59022, but not by Ca2+. AtDGK2 exhibited substrate preference for unsaturated DAG analogues (i.e. 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol). The AtDGK2 gene is expressed in various tissues of the Arabidopsis plant, including leaves, roots, and flowers, as shown by Northern blot analysis and promoter-reporter gene fusions.

These enzymes phosphorylate diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). DAG is released by the catalytic activity of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate is generated by the same reaction. Both DAG and PA are second messengers and play a central role in the biosynthesis of major phospholipids. In animal cells, DAG allosterically activates protein kinase C (PKC) (1Asaoka Y. Nakamura S.

In plant cells, DAG has been demonstrated to induce both ion pumping in patch-clamped guard cell protoplasts and opening of intact stomata (7Lee Y. Assmann S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PA has also signaling functions; in animal cells, it elicits several biological responses, including cytoskeletal organization by inducing actin polymerization and stress fiber formation (2Martelli A.M.

Plant J. 2001; 26: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also modulates the activity of several enzymes (8Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 227-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). DGK activity is likely to be tightly controlled to regulate DAG and PA levels coordinately, allowing the cell to perform its proper physiological functions. In addition to the PLC/DGK pathway, PA can also be generated by the activity of phospholipase D.In mammals, nine different DGK isozymes have been reported so far (14Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). No DGK gene has yet been discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was therefore suggested that signaling-related DGKs may control physiological functions unique to multicellular organisms (15Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In plants, functional analysis of DGK genes is largely absent. Katagiri et al. (16Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported the molecular cloning of a cDNA (AtDGK1) putatively encoding a DGK from Arabidopsis thaliana. Unfortunately, AtDGK1 was not enzymatically active when expressed in either Escherichia coli or mammalian (COS-7) cells, leaving the question open whether AtDGK1 indeed represents a DGK. Northern blot experiments indicated that AtDGK1 is expressed in root, leaf, and shoot tissue but not in flowers or siliques (16Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In tomatoes, Snedden and Blumwald (17Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA, designated LeCBDGK, encoding a calmodulin-binding DGK isoform. Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2+-binding regulatory protein widely distributed in plants and animals. In LeCBDGK, the CaM-binding domain was located close to the C terminus of the protein. A second cDNA, LeDGK1, was isolated and found to be identical to LeCBDGK, except that it lacked the codons encoding the CaM-binding domain. The two transcripts are generated by alternative splicing from the same gene. Both DGK isoforms were found to be catalytically active when expressed in E. coli. An effect of CaM on the catalytic activity of recombinant LeCBDGK was not discovered. However, in the presence of Ca2+, LeCBDGK associated with membrane cell fractions in vitro. This association was disrupted by the addition of CaM antagonists, suggesting that Ca2+ plays a role in recruiting the enzyme from soluble to membrane cell fractions (17Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The physiological role DGKs play in plants is not precisely known at the present stage. Recently, Ruelland et al. (18Ruelland E. Cantrel C. Gawer M. Kader J.C. Zachowski A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) investigated the response of Arabidopsis suspension cells to cold treatment. These researchers discovered that the content of PA rapidly, within minutes, increases in response to a temperature drop. This elevation was largely due to a simultaneous activation of the PLC/DGK pathway, although a minor fraction (20%) of the PA was generated by phospholipase D activity. Inhibitors affecting either PLC or DGK reduced PA accumulation (18Ruelland E. Cantrel C. Gawer M. Kader J.C. Zachowski A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Genes for enzymes of the plant phosphoinositide pathway have been discovered in recent years (reviewed in Ref. 19Mueller-Roeber B. Pical C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 22-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and cold induction of AtPLC1 (encoding phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C) (20Hirayama T. Ohto C.

We demonstrate that recombinant AtDGK2 enzyme raised in E. coli is catalytically active, generating PA from DAG. AtDGK2 is transcribed in a number of tissues, including roots, leaves, and flowers. Its transcriptional activity is promoted by cold treatment, indicating that AtDGK2 may participate in cold signaling.

Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) and New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Oligonucleotides were obtained from TibMolbiol (Berlin, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed by AGOWA (Berlin, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, other chemicals were purchased from Roche Applied Science, Merck, or Sigma. E. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was employed for general DNA work. For sequence analyses, the tools provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/), and The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR; available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/) were used. InterPro and Motif Scan were accessed via ExPASy, and PROSITE, Pfam, and SMART via InterPro. Cloning strategies were developed using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, MI). The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus data repository was accessed via the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.Cloning of AtDGK2 cDNA—Amplification by PCR was carried out using the Advantage-HF2 PCR kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. C24 leaf cDNA was used as template. Primer sequences were as follows: primer O-DGK4For (5′-primer), 5′-ATGATGGAAGTGGGGTTCTCTCTTATTC-3′; primer O-DGK1Rev (3′-primer), 5′-CTACGAGAGATGGAGAGCCATTTGCTG-5′. Reaction details were as follows: 95 °C for 50 s; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Individual fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The entire AtDGK2 cDNA, present in plasmid pCR2.1-dgk2, had a length of 2139 bp (deposited under GenBank™ accession number AY380783).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA isolated from 10-week-old A. thaliana C24 plants raised on soil was used for Northern blot analysis. Twenty-five μg of RNA was loaded per lane on 1.5% agarose gels and separated by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions. RNA was blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked by UV illumination. Prehybridization was done for 2 h at 62 °C in sodium phosphate buffer (0.25 m, pH 7.2) containing 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA. The AtDGK2 cDNA was radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) using the Rediprime II DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in sodium phosphate buffer. The membranes were washed twice for 15 min at 65 °C (first wash: 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS; second wash: 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS). Membranes were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-OMAT AR) at -80 °C for 1 day.Promoter-GUS Fusions—A 1.2-kb 5′ genomic fragment upstream of the ATG start codon of the AtDGK2 gene was amplified by PCR using primers PromDGKFor (5′-CCCAAGCTTCATCTGTACTAAATGTGATTAAACTTG-3′; added HindIII site underlined) and PromDGKRev (5′-CATGCCATGGCTTGTAAATCTAATATGTCATTCC-3′; added NcoI site underlined). A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. C24 genomic DNA served as template. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 50 s; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min); 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified promoter fragment was inserted into plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the promoter was fused via HindIII/NcoI to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in pCAMBIA-1303 (available on the World Wide Web at www.cambia.org.au/main/r_et_quickpick.htm). The same promoter fragment was also tested in plants employing binary vector pGPTV-HPT (available on the World Wide Web at www.biotech.unl.edu/transgenic/vectors.html). The final constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90), and transgenic Arabidopsis plants were obtained using the floral dip method (23Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic plants were selected on sterile medium containing hygromycin.GUS activity was determined in vacuum-infiltrated plants or tissues using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid (X-gluc) as substrate (24Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8173) Google Scholar). Infiltrated plants were incubated in GUS staining solution overnight at 37 °C. GUS staining patterns were viewed with a Leica ATC 2000 binocular microscope. To prepare tissue sections, stained tissues were fixed in hydroxyethylmethacrylate Technovit 7100 (Heraeus-Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany). Tissue sections (15 μm) were cut with a Leica RM 2155 microtome (Leica Instruments, Nussloch, Germany) and viewed under an Olympus AX70 TRR-AF1 microscope.Low Temperature, ABA, and Drought Response Assays—Seeds of wild-type A. thaliana ecotype C24 and transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with the promAtDGK2::GUS fusion construct were sown in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of soil (GS90; Gebr. Patzer, Sinntal Jossa, Germany) and vermiculite (Deutsche Vermiculite Dämmstoff, Sprockhövel, Germany) and cultured under controlled environmental conditions in growth chambers with an irradiance of 150 microeinsteins at a 20/18 °C (day/night) temperature regime, a photoperiod of 16 h, and a relative humidity of 75%. At day 7 after germination, seedlings were transferred to a growth chamber under the same conditions except that the photoperiod was reduced to 8 h. Twenty-eight days after germination, plants were kept under 250 microeinsteins, 20/18 °C, 80/50% relative humidity (day/night). Low temperature treatments were carried out by transferring plants of different ages (3-10 weeks) to growth chambers set at 4 °C for different periods of time under the light and photoperiodic conditions given above. After treatment, plants were either frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation (wild-type plants) or were subjected to GUS analysis (transgenic plants). For ABA (Sigma) treatments, mixed isomers of the phytohormone were dissolved in 10 ml of 1 n NaOH. Plants were sprayed with a final concentration of 100 μm ABA and harvested at different time points. Control treatments were given by spraying plants with water containing the same final concentration of NaOH. Drought stress was applied to whole transgenic plants by omitting watering. Plants were sampled after 2 and 5 days.Expression of Recombinant AtDGK2 in E. coli—The coding region of the AtDGK2 cDNA, flanked by EcoRI sites, was transferred from plasmid pCR2.1-dgk2 to plasmid pET43c (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), yielding plasmid pET43c-dgk2. The pET43c vector allows the generation of fusion protein containing a NusA tag (facilitating the solubility of membrane-associated proteins), and a His6 tag (for detection and purification of target proteins; see Novagen, on the World Wide Web at www.novagen.com). Plasmid pET43c-dgk2 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.2-0.3, expression of NusA-His-AtDGK2 fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). Cells were harvested 4 h later by centrifugation; resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science); and lysed by sonification. Recombinant AtDGK2 was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's (Qiagen) protocol. All homogenates were frozen and stored at -80 °C until assayed. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Enzyme Assays—Diacylglycerol kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidic acid at 25 °C. The standard assay contained in a total volume of 250 μl: 40 mm Bis-Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm spermine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Triton X-100, 250 μm cardiolipin, 500 μm 1,2-DOG, 1 mm ATP (containing ∼5 μCi of labeled ATP), and approximately 1 μg of the purified enzyme fraction. The lipids diacylglycerol and cardiolipin, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), were placed in 7-ml Schott glass disposable reaction tubes (with screw cap; Schott, Mainz, Germany), dried under a stream of nitrogen vapor, resuspended in a solution of sodium deoxycholate dissolved in water, and sonified for 5 min in a Sonorex RK 100 Sonifier (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). The assay mix was preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C, ATP was added, and the reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 750 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2) containing 1% HCl. Extraction and separation of phospholipids were performed as follows. 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 500 μl 1 m KCl plus 0.2 m H3PO4 were added, and the mixture was mixed thoroughly on a vortexer; samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a Labofuge 200 (Heraeus Sepatech, Osterode, Germany). The lower phase (lipids) was transferred to a new glass reaction tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen vapor. Fifty μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) were added to each tube, and the sample was applied to TLC silica plates (Merck) that had been treated with 1% potassium oxalate solution in methanol/water (2:3) and heated for 15 min at 110 °C. The plates were run with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:14:12:8). For autoradiography, the plates were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR) for 1 day. The amount of phosphate incorporated was determined by scratching off the individual spots and counting the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. PA standard was obtained from Sigma (product code P 9511). Amersham Biosciences provided [γ-32P]ATP (15 TBq/mmol). Lipids (1,2-SAG, 1,2-DOG, 1,2-DOCG, 1,2-DPG, 1,2-DMG, and cardiolipin), salts (MgCl2, CaCl2, LiCl, and NaCl), detergents (Na-DC and CHAPS), and the DGK inhibitor R59022 were purchased from Sigma. Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) provided Triton X-100.HPLC Analysis of the Reaction Products of DGK Assay—The products of diacylglycerol kinase assays were obtained by two-phase partitioning. The organic phase was reduced to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the glycerolipids were deacylated (26Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The water-soluble products of deacylation were resolved by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of (NH4)2HPO4 (27Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was monitored on-line with a Canberra Packard A515 Radiomatic Flow Detector, integration interval 12 s.RESULTSIsolation of AtDGK2 cDNA and Sequence Characterization—A partial cDNA encoding a polypeptide similar to AtDGK1 from A. thaliana and similar to DGKs from animals was retrieved from an expression profiling experiment that was targeted toward the identification of differentially expressed genes in leaf tissues. 2M. Ornatowska, M.-I. Zanor, G. Plesch, and B. Mueller-Roeber, unpublished results. A cDNA encompassing the entire coding region of the novel DGK, designated AtDGK2 (for A. thalianadiacylglycerol kinase 2), was subsequently cloned via high fidelity polymerase chain reaction, using a pool of leaf first-strand cDNAs as template. The AtDGK2 protein deduced from the cDNA sequence has a molecular mass of 79.4 kDa (712 amino acid residues) and an isoelectric point of 8.45. The overall structure of AtDGK2 and of all other Arabidopsis DGKs (see below) is displayed in Fig. 1a. The AtDGK2 protein shares 50% identical amino acids with AtDGK1, 39% with human DGKα (GenBank™ accession number NM_001345), 28% with human DGKι (NM_004717), 39% with Caenorhabditis elegans Dgk-1 (NM_075789), and 30% with C. elegans Dgk-3 (NM_066630). The closest other plant homologue (45% identical amino acids) is a predicted DGK from rice encoded by transcript AK100331.All DGKs have a conserved catalytic domain, DGKc (Pfam accession number PF00781) (Fig. 1, a and b), which in AtDGK2 includes amino acid residues 342-471. DGKc domains contain a presumed ATP binding site with a GXGXXG consensus sequence (where G represents glycine, and X represents any amino acid) (28Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the presumed ATP binding site in AtDGK2 (Gly401-Ala406) has an alanine instead of a glycine residue at the end of this motif, it is obvious from our results (see below) that this change does not render the enzyme inactive. An uncharacterized AtDGK2 homologue from rice (GenBank™ accession number AK100331; see below) also contains a GXGXXA motif.AtDGK2 also harbors a presumed DGK accessory domain (DGKa; Pfam accession no. PF00609), which is associated with DGKc, indicating that it contributes to the functionality of the catalytic domain. The accessory domain (158 aa) is located at residues 491-648. Furthermore, this enzyme contains two copies of about 60 amino acids each of a PKC, diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding domain (DAG/PE-binding domain; InterPro accession number IPR002219) between residues 72-133 and 145-208, respectively. PE are analogues of DAG and potent tumor promoters in animals. PE can directly stimulate PKC. PE and DAG bind in a zinc-dependent manner to the so-called C1 region of the protein (29Shindo M. Irie K. Masuda A. Ohigashi H. Shirai Y. Miyasaka K. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18448-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The C1 region contains one or two copies (depending on the PKC isozyme) of a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which is essential for DAG/PE-binding. C1 domains are also present in animal DGKs, where they exist in two or three copies, designated as C1A, C1B, and C1C. Recent studies using NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography have clarified the three-dimensional structure of C1B domains of various PKC isozymes. The typical core structure of C1 domains in PKC contains two histidines and six cysteines in the order HX12CX2CX13-14CX2CX4HX2CX7C (where X represents any amino acid), coordinating two zinc atoms in a tetrahedral geometry. The core of animal DGK C1 domains is slightly different, HX10-12CX2-6CX9-19CX2CX4HX2-4CX5-10C, but the zinc-coordinating histidine and cysteine residues are present (29Shindo M. Irie K. Masuda A. Ohigashi H. Shirai Y. Miyasaka K. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18448-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We screened the GenBank™ data base using the AtDGK2 sequence as a bait and retrieved cDNA sequences from Oryza sativa (GenBank™ accession number AK100331) and Zea mays (partial cDNA, resulting from an EST assembly project; AY110054). Like AtDGK2, both monocot proteins contained two copies of a DAG/PE-binding domain (although one of each was not fully supported by either PROSITE or SMART; in the maize protein, this was due to the fact that the coding sequence close to the 5′ end of the EST-assembled cDNA was uncertain). To test for the existence of additional C6/H2-type DGKs, we screened the TAIR data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org/) using the Patmatch tool. None of the proteins retrieved (with the exceptions of AtDGK1 and AtDGK2) contained a DGK catalytic domain, indicating that no additional DGKs of the C6/H2-type are present in Arabidopsis.DAG/PE-binding domain 1 has the core HX14CX2CX16-22-CX2CX4HX2CX7C in all four identified plant proteins (i.e. AtDGK1 and AtDGK2, as well as the rice and maize enzymes), with a flexible length of the amino acid stretch after the second cysteine. In contrast, DAG/PE-binding domain 2 has the invariant core HX18CX2CX16CX2CX4HX2CX11C (Fig. 1b). In animal DGKs, the more C-terminally located DAG/PE-binding domain contain"
https://openalex.org/W2006274704,"The annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer (AIIt) is a multifunctional Ca2+-dependent, phospholipid-binding, and F-actin-binding phosphoprotein composed of two annexin A2 subunits and two S100A10 subunits. It was reported previously that oxidative stress from exogenous hydrogen peroxide or generated in response to tumor necrosis factor-α results in the glutathionylation of Cys8 of annexin A2. In this study, we demonstrate that AIIt is an oxidatively labile protein whose level of activity is regulated by the redox status of its sulfhydryl groups. Oxidation of AIIt by diamide resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of the ability of AIIt to interact with phospholipid liposomes and F-actin. The inhibitory effect of diamide on the activity of AIIt was partially reversed by dithiothreitol. In addition, incubation of AIIt with diamide and GSH resulted in the glutathionylation of AIIt in vitro. Mass spectrometry established the incorporation of 2 mol of GSH/mol of annexin A2 subunit at Cys8 and Cys132. Glutathionylation potentiated the inhibitory effects of diamide on the activity of AIIt. Furthermore, AIIt could be deglutathionylated by glutaredoxin (thiol transferase). Thus, we show for the first time that AIIt can undergo functional reactivation by glutaredoxin, therefore establishing that AIIt is regulated by reversible glutathionylation.

Thus, we show for the first time that AIIt can undergo functional reactivation by glutaredoxin, therefore establishing that AIIt is regulated by reversible glutathionylation. The molecular mechanisms by which the cell alleviates oxidative stress and achieves redox homeostasis are still a matter of considerable debate. However, the modulation of the thiol disulfide status of critical cysteine residues on proteins is being recognized as a critical mechanism of oxidative signal transduction as well as a cellular response to protect key regulatory molecules from oxidative insult (1Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 2Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Konig S. Fales H.M. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B.

Recent evidence suggests that the reversible covalent modification of cysteine residues by the tripeptide glutathione (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) plays a significant role in the antioxidant network of the cells and is involved in regulating individual aspects of cellular function (3Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 4Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). Although proteins can bind cysteine, GSH, and homocysteine to generate mixed disulfides, GSH is the dominant ligand, as it occurs in the cell at concentrations between 1 and 10 mm (5Smith C.V. Jones D.P. Guenthner T.M. Lash L.H. Lauterburg B.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6Seres T. Ravichandran V. Moriguchi T. Rokutan K. Thomas J.A. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar). S-Glutathionylation has been shown to alter the function of a number of discrete proteins under oxidant stress (7Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, the formation of a mixed disulfide with glutathione precludes the irreversible oxidation of the cysteine thiol to a sulfinic or sulfonic acid and enables reactivation of the protein by cellular thioreductases. Annexins compose a large multigene family of water-soluble proteins that can bind to negatively charged phospholipids and cellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (9Moss S.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 87-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 11Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The annexin family is structurally characterized by two domains: a highly conserved α-helical protein core consisting of four 70-amino acid repeats (eight repeats in the case of annexin VI) and a variable N-terminal segment (12Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Annexin A2 is unique among the annexins, for its N-terminal tail possesses a high affinity binding site for a dimeric protein (monomeric Mr 11,000), S100A10 (13Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Annexin A2 can thus exist as a monomer or as its heterotetrameric complex ((annexin A2)2-(S100A10)2), known as the annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer (AIIt). 1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol; BioGEE, biotinylated glutathione diethyl ester; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AIIt, annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer; DTT, dithiothreitol; BioGEE, biotinylated glutathione diethyl ester; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Annexin A2 has been shown previously to aggregate and fuse biological membranes (14Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Liu L. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259 (U. J. P.): 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and AIIt has been identified as a cross-linker between the plasma membrane and secretory granules (17Nakata T. Sobue K. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Senda T. Okabe T. Matsuda M. Fujita H. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that annexin A2 and AIIt are involved in regulating membrane trafficking events such as exocytosis and endocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 13Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition to phospholipid binding activity, a number of annexins have been identified as Ca2+-dependent F-actin-binding proteins (12Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells has a predominant role in numerous processes such as cell-cell interaction and cellular morphology (19Hitt A.L. Luna E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cytoskeleton participates in signal transduction events that direct cell migration and proliferation and membrane trafficking (21Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J.

Annexin A2 can bind F-actin and possesses a pronounced Ca2+-dependent filament bundling activity when expressed in its heterotetrameric form (9Moss S.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 87-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown previously that the F-actin-binding site can be mapped directly to the C terminus of annexin A2, as truncation of the last 9 amino acid residues of the C terminus inhibits F-actin binding activity of annexin A2 and AIIt (24Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Annexin A2 was recently identified as an oxidant-sensitive protein in HeLa cells. It was shown that oxidant stress either from exogenous H2O2 or generated in response to tumor necrosis factor-α increases incorporation of a glutathione analog into the reactive cysteine of the annexin A2 N-terminal domain (25Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, Singh and Liu (26Singh T.K. Liu L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and Liu and co-workers (27Rowan III, W.H. Sun P. Liu L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that chemical modification of AIIt by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide or by treatment with peroxynitrite results in a loss of liposome aggregation activity in vitro. Although annexin A2 has been implicated in numerous pathophysiological processes, very few studies have been directed toward identification of the role these reactive cysteine residues may play in the biological activity of the protein. In this study, we show for the first time that AIIt is an oxidatively labile protein whose level of activity is regulated by the redox status of its sulfhydryl groups. We also report that glutathionylation of AIIt in vitro results in the modification of Cys8 and Cys132 of the annexin A2 subunit and results in the inhibition of the phospholipid and F-actin binding activity of AIIt. However, deglutathionylation of AIIt by glutaredoxin restores AIIt activity. These results suggest that the cysteine(s) of annexin A2 may play a role in the regulation of the biological activities of the protein and can be regulated by reversible glutathionylation. Materials—AIIt was purified from bovine lung as described by Kang et al. (29Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purified glutaredoxin (thiol transferase) was kindly provided by Dr. John J. Mieyal (Case Western University). Monoclonal anti-annexin A2 and anti-annexin A2 light chain antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-glutathione antibody was purchased from Vitogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin was purchased from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), N-ethylmaleimide, Me2SO, diamide (1,1′-azobis(N,N′-dimethylformamide)), tumor necrosis factor-α, streptavidin-agarose, agarose, AG 50-X4 (H+ form), and AG 1-X4 (Cl– form) were purchased from Sigma. 1.25 m HCl in anhydrous ethanol was purchased from Fluka. Catalase was purchased from Calbiochem. Mutagenesis of Annexin A2—Bacterial expression vectors containing the wild-type sequence for annexin A2 (pAED4.91-annexin A2) were mutated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers that introduced Cys-to-Ser mutations at positions 8 and 132 of annexin A2 were synthesized. All of the mutations introduced were verified by DNA sequence analysis. These various plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and grown as described previously (28Kwon M. Caplan J.F. Filipenko N.R. Choi K.S. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zhang L.

Purification of Recombinant AIIt—Equimolar amounts of human recombinant annexin A2 and human recombinant S100A10 were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then at 4 °C for 1 h, and the peak of the heterotetramer was isolated from the individual subunits by gel permeation chromatography. Proteins were subsequently stored in buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) at –80 °C until used. Preparation of Biotinylated Glutathione Ethyl Ester (BioGEE)—Bio-GEE was prepared according to a modified procedure of Finkel and co-workers (25Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To a solution of 40 mm GSSG in 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) was added a 0.15 m solution of N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin in Me2SO to a final concentration of 18 mm. The mixture was shaken gently overnight at room temperature. DTT was subsequently added to a final concentration of 80 mm, and the solution was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. Unreacted glutathione was removed by incubating the reaction mixture with AG 50W-X4 resin (12 ml) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. The resultant slurry was centrifuged briefly, and the pH of the extracted supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 and loaded onto an AG 1-X4 column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2). The column was washed with acetate buffer (6 bed volumes) and then with 90% EtOH (6 bed volumes). The glutathione-containing fractions were eluted with 0.5 m HCl in 90% EtOH. Biotinylated glutathione elutes at pH ≤3. Thiol-containing fractions were determined using Ellman's reagent, and the solvent was subsequently removed in vacuo using a rotary evaporator. The resultant residue was treated with 1.25 m HCl in anhydrous EtOH at room temperature overnight; the solvent was evaporated using a Speed-Vac; and the concentration of free thiol was determined before use. Mass Spectrometry—The molecular mass of control or glutathionylated AIIt was initially analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry on a Micromass Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer. Prior to tryptic digestion, AIIt was separated into annexin A2 and S100A10 subunits and purified using reversed-phase chromatography on a Zorbax 300 SB-C8 column (1 mm × 15 cm). The annexin A2 subunit was dried and rehydrated into 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and trypsin was added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 10 min (limited digestion) or overnight (complete digestion) at 37 °C. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was also reduced with 10 mm tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). The Micromass Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer with a CapLC high pressure liquid chromatography system was used to analyze samples. Data obtained by Q-TOF liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was searched using the software search engine Mascot from Matrix Science. Method for Free Sulfhydryl Determination Using Ellman's Reagent— The Ellman method for assaying thiols is based on the reaction of thiols with chromogenic 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) whereby formation of the yellow dianion of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid is measured. Samples were incubated with 200 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 100 mm Na2PO4 (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 200 μl. Each sample was then analyzed spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using an ELx-808 spectrophotometric plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). The results were related to a standard curve generated using reduced glutathione as the standard. Argon Dialysis of Proteins—After purification and reconstitution, wild-type and mutant AIIt, annexin A2, and S100A10 were dialyzed against pre-degassed buffer A under argon to prevent possible oxidation of cysteine residues. Modification of AIIt by Glutathionylation—Dialyzed AIIt (8–10 μm) was treated with GSH (2 mm) and diamide (1 mm) in degassed buffer A at room temperature for 2 h. Excess diamide and GSH were then removed by performing three buffer exchanges using an Amicon Centricon-10 microconcentrator. Glutaredoxin-mediated deglutathionylation of AIIt was examined by incubation of glutathionylated AIIt (18 μm) with 0.5 mm GSH and 1.0 μm glutaredoxin in buffer A at 25 °C. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Samples were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size) at 4 °C for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris-HCl and 154 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) for 1 h at room temperature and then treated for 1 h at room temperature with 1.0 μg/ml monoclonal anti-annexin A2 or anti-S100A10 antibody or 2 μg/ml anti-glutathione antibody in TBS with 5% skim milk. The blot was washed thoroughly with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated at room temperature with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in TBS with 5% skim milk. In the case of biotinylated samples, the blocked membrane was incubated with 0.4 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin in TBS with 5% bovine serum albumin. After the respective antibody incubations, the membrane was washed extensively with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Phospholipid Vesicle Aggregation Assay—In 12 × 75-mm culture tubes, 50 μl each of 20 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol (dissolved in chloroform) were shelled by N2 gas. The resultant lipid residue was resuspended in 1 ml of phospholipid aggregation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 2 mm MgCl2) and sonicated at 75 watts for three 15-s bursts with a Braun probe sonicator to generate phospholipid vesicles at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Phospholipid vesicle aggregation was assayed in a Varian UV-visible spectrophotometer at 450 nm in a final volume of 600 μl. Initially, phospholipid vesicles (35 μg), Ca2+ (8 μm), and phospholipid aggregation buffer were combined, resulting in a final phospholipid concentration of 0.055 mg/ml. To initiate the reaction, 20 μg of AIIt or annexin A2 were added to the reaction mixture. Absorbance readings were taken continuously for 10 min. Results are expressed as the percentage of starting A450 nm (no AIIt added) and are typically presented as mean ± S.D. (n = 3) as outlined previously (29Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the calculation of percent AIIt activity, the extent of phospholipid aggregation at 10 min by untreated AIIt was considered as 100% activity. Phospholipid Vesicle Binding Assay—Following phospholipid liposome aggregation, the reaction mixture (0.600 ml) was centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a desktop centrifuge. The protein/phospholipid ratios used in the analysis ranged from 0.001 to 0.02 AIIt/phospholipid. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of SDS disruption buffer and boiled for 3–5 min. The pellet fraction was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. F-actin Bundling Assay—F-actin was prepared as described previously (30Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). F-actin bundling was measured by the light scattering intensity perpendicular to the incident light in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrophotometer as described previously (31Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were both set at 400 nm with 10- and 5-nm slit widths, respectively. F-actin (0.60 μm) was incubated in bundling buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and 0.33 mm ATP), and CaCl2 (500 μm) was added to the bundling assay mixture to a final volume of 0.600 ml. Bundling was initiated by the addition of AIIt to a final concentration of 0.85 μm. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, light scattering intensity was recorded in at least triplicate. Following the F-actin bundling assay, the reaction mixture (0.600 ml) was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min in a desktop centrifuge. The pellet (which contained F-actin bundles) was resuspended in 30 μl of SDS disruption buffer and boiled for 3–5 min. The pellet fraction was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. F-actin Binding Assay—F-actin binding was performed as described above, except that the reaction volume was 0.200 ml. After the 15-min incubation period, the sample was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. The pellet was first solubilized in 25 μl of 100 mm KCl for 30 min, and then 25 μl of SDS disruption buffer were added. Subsequently, the mixture was boiled for 3–5 min. The pellet fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Miscellaneous Techniques—Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Brilliant Blue and standardized the concentrations to bovine serum albumin as described by Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). All reagents used were analytical grade or better. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Oxidant-dependent Incorporation of Glutathione into Annexin A2—BioGEE is a biotinylated membrane-permeable analog of glutathione that was developed to detect incorporation of glutathione into proteins exposed to oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated previously using BioGEE that two prominent S-glutathionylated proteins of HeLa cells include thioredoxin peroxidase and annexin A2 (25Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have investigated the generality of this observation using HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells as a model system. As shown in Fig. 1A, oxidant stress from exogenous hydrogen peroxide caused an increase in the incorporation of BioGEE into a large number of cellular proteins. Furthermore, reduction of these proteins with DTT resulted in the loss of the label, establishing that these proteins were indeed S-glutathionylated. However, treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide did not alter the cellular protein levels of annexin A2 (Fig. 1B). Next, we exposed the HT1080 cells to hydrogen peroxide and purified the glutathionylated proteins from the crude cellular extract by pull-down with streptavidinagarose, followed by elution with DTT. The glutathionylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and annexin A2 was identified by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide resulted in the enrichment of annexin A2 in the glutathionylated protein fraction. This establishes that prior exposure of the HT1080 cells to hydrogen peroxide enhanced the incorporation of the biotinylated glutathione analog into annexin A2, therefore confirming the suggestion that annexin A2 becomes S-glutathionylated upon oxidative stress (25Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). AIIt Is Sensitive to Sulfhydryl Oxidation—Diamide is a highly specific thiol oxidant that preferentially oxidizes small thiol-containing molecules such as glutathione (33Babizhayev M.A. Menshikova E.V. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 56: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 34Obin M. Shang F. Gong X. Handelman G. Blumberg J. Taylor A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, diamide can also oxidize exposed cysteines of proteins. The observation that AIIt is glutathionylated in vivo suggests that AIIt might be susceptible to sulfhydryl oxidation. We tested the susceptibility of AIIt to thiol oxidation by measuring the activity of AIIt after treatment with diamide. As a measure of the biological activity of AIIt, we chose the well characterized ability of AIIt to aggregate phospholipid vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner (reviewed in Refs. 12Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar and 35Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Annexins: Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, Texas2003: 127-156Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), diamide dramatically inhibited the activity of AIIt in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibition of AIIt activity occurred at 0.24 mm diamide; and at 2 mm diamide, the activity was maximally inhibited by ∼90%. We then determined whether the oxidation of AIIt by diamide was reversible. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of AIIt with 2 mm diamide resulted in a significant loss of protein activity, and this loss could be partially reversed by DTT. In contrast, more rigorous treatment of AIIt with 5 mm diamide resulted in a loss of the ability of DTT to restore the activity of the protein. This suggests that the inhibition of the activity of AIIt by diamide involves oxidation of sulfhydryl groups because it was partially reversed by DTT (Fig. 2B). The inability of DTT to stimulate recovery of the activity of AIIt at higher diamide concentrations suggests that the protein could also be irreversibly oxidized by diamide. Our results demonstrate that oxidation of AIIt by diamide causes a dramatic loss of AIIt activity and that DTT can partially reverse this diamide effect. Diamide may therefore be blocking the activity of AIIt by inducing disulfide bond formation between the subunits of AIIt or between the two different molecules of AIIt. To determine the mode of action whereby diamide may be inducing structural changes to the protein, nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of diamide-treated and untreated AIIt was performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, diamide treatment of AIIt resulted in a small shift in the mobility of the protein as well as the formation of aggregates. The change in the appearance and mobility of AIIt upon SDS-PAGE was reversed if the diamide-treated protein was incubated with DTT. These observations suggest that diamide causes the oxidation of AIIt thiols and the formation of disulfide linkages between AIIt molecules. To examine whether diamide treatment affected the binding of AIIt to the phospholipid vesicles, the aggregation mixture was centrifuged, and the AIIt pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of AIIt bound to the phospholipid vesicles revealed that oxidation of AIIt by diamide resulted in a loss of the ability of AIIt to bind to the phospholipid vesicles (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, incubation of the diamide-oxidized protein with DTT afforded partial restoration of AIIt activity. It has been shown previously that annexin A2 binds F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro (31Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Glenney Jr., J.R. Tack B. Powell M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recent studies have established that the C terminus of the annexin A2 subunit of AIIt comprises an F-actin-binding domain. Interestingly, the last 9 amino acid residues of the C terminus of the annexin A2 subunit (330LLYLCGGDD338) appear to be entirely responsible for the F-actin binding activity of AIIt (24Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+-dependent binding to F-actin, AIIt (but not annexin A2) rapidly and reversibly forms anisotropic F-actin bundles (31Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used light scattering to examine the ability of diamide-oxidized AIIt to bundle actin filaments. As shown in Fig. 2E, oxidation of AIIt by diamide resulted in a loss of F-actin bundling. Addition of DTT partially reversed the oxidative effects of 1 mm diamide, but failed to reverse the oxidative effects of 5 mm diamide. To confirm that the decrease in light scattering was due to a loss of formation of supramolecular structures (bundles) of F-actin, we took advantage of the fact that F-actin does not sedimen"

These findings shed light on the mechanism of accessory protein recruitment to trans-Golgi network and endosomal clathrin coats. Clathrin-coated vesicles sort biosynthetic and endocytic cargo within the interconnected system of membrane-bound organelles formed by the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, lysosomes, and plasma membrane (1Kirchhausen T.

The coats on these vesicles contain, in addition to clathrin, an array of adaptor proteins involved in vesicle formation and cargo selection (2Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C.

These complexes are composed of two large (90–130-kDa), one medium (∼50-kDa), and one small (∼20-kDa) “adaptin” subunit, namely γ·β1·μ1·σ1 for AP-1, α·β2·μ2·σ2 for AP-2, and δ·β3·μ3·σ3 for AP-3 (subunits listed in order of decreasing molecular mass). Each of the large subunits (γ/α/σ and β1–β3, respectively) is organized into three domains: an amino-terminal “trunk,” a connecting “hinge,” and a carboxyl-terminal “ear.” The trunk domains of the large subunits together with the medium (μ1–μ3) and small (σ1–σ3) subunits constitute the “core” of the AP complexes, from which the two hinge and ear domains project outward (4Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a family of monomeric proteins named GGAs (i.e. GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 in humans) that also function as clathrin adaptors (4Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of the GGAs is unrelated to the AP subunits, but the carboxyl-terminal half of the GGAs is structured as hinge and ear domains analogous to those of the large AP subunits. Moreover, the earlike domain of the GGAs exhibits significant sequence similarity to that of the γ-adaptin subunit of AP-1 (of which there are two isoforms termed γ1- and γ2-adaptin) (5Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Lewin D.A. Sheff D. Ooi C.E. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E. Chicione L.M. Webster P. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This conserved domain, which is present in the three GGAs and the two γ-adaptins, is herein referred to as the γ-adaptin ear (GAE) domain.The ear domains of the AP large subunits function as platforms for the recruitment of accessory proteins via recognition of specific sequence motifs. The AP-2 α and β2 ear domains are the most extensively characterized biochemically and structurally. They bind a large number of accessory proteins (including Eps15, epsin 1, amphiphysin I, AP180, auxilin, and dynamin 1 and 2) that participate in various aspects of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These accessory proteins contain DPF, DPW, or FXDXF motifs that are responsible for interactions with the α and β2 ear domains (8Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

The β2 ear domain has a similar structure but only binds DPF and DPW sequences on its carboxyl-terminal platform subdomain (9Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H.

Recent crystallographic analyses revealed that the GAE domain of the γ-adaptins and the GGAs consists of a β-sandwich similar to that of the α and β2 ear domains but lacking the platform subdomain (13Kent H.M.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).We have recently determined that Rabaptin-5 binds to the GAE domains of the γ-adaptins and the GGAs via the sequence FGPLV (residues 439–443 of Rabaptin-5) (25Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Substitution of Phe (residue 439), Gly (residue 440), Leu (residue 442), and, to some extent, Val (residue 443) by Ala impairs the recognition of Rabaptin-5 by the GAE domains, whereas substitution of Pro (residue 441) is less critical (25Mattera R.

Thus, hydrophobic contacts between the FGPLV sequence and GAE domains are the main determinants of binding; however, acidic residues preceding this sequence provide a stabilizing effect that is noticeable when assaying relatively short (406–476 or 428–455) but not longer fragments of Rabaptin-5 (25Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, crystallographic studies demonstrated that the Phe and Leu residues constitute the main points of attachment of the FGPLV sequence to the GAE domain of GGA3 (26Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with the Gly and Pro being important for the correct spacing of the anchoring residues. The preceding acidic amino acids and other neighboring residues contribute secondary, less critical, interactions.Analyses of GAE-binding determinants from enthoprotin, Ent3p, Ent5p, and p56 have also identified short sequences that contain a critical Phe separated by two residues from another Phe or Trp. In the case of p56, these two residues anchor the sequence to the GAE domain of GGA1 in a manner similar to that of the key Phe and Leu residues of Rabaptin-5 binding to the GGA3-GAE domain (27Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, all of these proteins seem to bind to the GAE domains by virtue of a conserved peptide motif. Comparison of known or putative GAE-binding sequences has led to the proposal of various consensus motifs, including (D/E)FXD(F/W) (23Mills I.G. Praefcke G.J. Vallis Y. Peter B.J. Olesen L.E.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 211-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (where X represents any amino acid, and Ø is a hydrophobic residue). However, the requirement for specific residues at different positions within the motif has not been systematically analyzed. The experimental analysis of these requirements is important not only to define a canonical motif that describes all known GAE-binding sequences but also to predict novel GAE-binding partners. We have undertaken such an analysis using in vitro binding assays, the yeast two-hybrid system, and the screening of combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. This combined experimental approach has allowed us to define a general consensus GAE-binding motif and to identify novel ligands for the GAE domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant DNApGAD Constructs—Mutations in pGAD424-Rabaptin-5-(406–476) or pGAD10-myc-Rabaptin-5-(5–476) templates (25Mattera R.

The library was sorted separately against each target, and phage were propagated in Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene) supplemented with both M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to facilitate phage production and 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression of the library.

The candidate sequences were selected based on (a) the identification of the GAE-binding sequence FGPLV in Rabaptin-5 (25Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), (b) the presence of GAE-binding sites in the 518–786 segment of γ-synergin (18Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J.

Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J.

The initial set of peptides tested (Table I) included LADDFGEFSL and SDDDFADFHS (residues 666–675 and 772–781, respectively, in human γ-synergin) and GNGDFGDWSA and SSDLFDLMGS (residues 368–377 and 420–429, respectively, in human enthoprotin) (residues at positions 0 and +3 in known or putative GAE-binding sequences have been underlined throughout). The enthoprotin-(368–377) peptide is similar to the P5 peptide used by Mills et al. (23Mills I.G. Praefcke G.J. Vallis Y. Peter B.J. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. J.

ND, not determined Open table in a new tab These biotinylated peptides were assayed for binding to GST fusion proteins comprising the GAE domains of γ2-adaptin, GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3. The Rabaptin-5-(435–447) peptide bound to all four GST-GAE domains but not to the GST-β3B ear used as a negative control (Fig. 1). The order of reactivity of the Rabaptin-5-(435–447) peptide for the GGA-GAE domains (GGA1 > GGA3, with minimal binding to GGA2) was similar to that observed in pull-downs of full-length Rabaptin-5 from bovine brain cytosol by various GST-GGA-GAE fusion proteins, as was the lack of binding to the Rabaptin-5 peptide containing the F439A and L442A substitutions (positions 0 and +3) (25Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Importantly, only one peptide from each pair of γ-synergin and enthoprotin peptides (LADDFGEFSL and GNGDFGDWSA, respectively) bound specifically to the GST-γ2-adaptin ear fusion protein, although not to the other GST-GAE fusion proteins (Fig. 1). The other two peptides (SDDDFADFHS and SSDLFDLMGS) did not bind to any of the GAE domains tested (data not shown; results summarized in Table I). Variants of the active γ-synergin and enthoprotin peptides containing Ala substitutions at 0 and +3 did not bind to the GST-γ2-adaptin ear (Fig. 1).The lack of binding of the LADDFGEFSL and GNGDFGDWSA peptides to the GGA-GAE domains could have been due to a low affinity of the corresponding interactions. Indeed, the peptide-binding assays were performed using 4–10 μm biotinylated peptides together with a 0.05–0.1 μm concentration of the GST fusion proteins and, thus, were designed to detect interactions in the low micromolar (∼0.5–10 μm) range of affinities (use of higher concentrations of biotinylated peptides and GST fusions resulted in high nonspecific binding). Therefore, interactions in the high micromolar range of affinities could not be detected in these direct binding assays. In this context, we have recently demonstrated using competition-binding assays that both the LADDFGEFSL and GNGDFGDWSA peptides bind to GST-GGA3-GAE, albeit with affinities that are 25–50 times lower than that of the Rabaptin-5 DESDFGPLVGADS peptide (26Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The γ-synergin and enthoprotin peptides (10-mers) shown in Fig. 1 were short"

Pike J.W. Feldman D. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The VDR, which belongs to the steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor family, is composed of two principal domains, one domain for hormone binding (exons 6–9) and one domain for DNA binding (exons 2 and 3, coding for two zinc fingers) (2Haussler M.R.

Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Attempts have been made to identify the receptor mediating the non-classical rapid effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3, but the data are still controversial (7Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Bishop J.E. Henry H.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Nemere I. Schwartz Z. Pedrozo H. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. J. Bone Miner.

A first set of data supports the hypothesis that VDR itself mediates 1,25-(OH)2D3 rapid effects. Among those findings are the observations that functional VDR expression and rapid response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in enterocytes have a simultaneous onset during rat post-natal development (20Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Duchambon P. Drueke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 5: 20403-20406Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and that the generation of transgenic mice lacking the first zinc finger of the VDR blocks rapid and long-term responses of osteoblasts to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (21Erben R.G. Segiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Möller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). But other data suggest that the presence of a functional nuclear VDR is not compulsory, as these findings showed persistent rapid effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on protein kinase C (PKC) activation and Ca2+ increase in osteoblasts of transgenic mice expressing a non-functional VDR lacking the second zinc finger and most of the ligand-binding domain (22Wali R. Kong J. Demay M.B. Brasitus T.A. Bissonnette M. Li Y.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16 (Abstr. F499): S229Google Scholar). Moreover, putative vitamin D membrane receptors that are different from the nuclear VDR, such as annexin II (23Baran D.T. Quail J.M. Ray R. Leszyk J. Honeyman T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the recently identified membrane-associated rapid response steroid (MARRS) (24Farach-Carson M.C. Nemere I. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), have been located on the external surface of the cell. In an attempt to solve this dilemma, we tested rapid and long term effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in dermal fibroblast cultures from three children with severe hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) and missense homozygous mutations of the VDR gene and from one age-matched child with no clinical and biological signs of vitamin D resistance. Cells from patient 1, with a K45E mutation in the DNA-binding domain, were selected as a model with no DNA binding or transactivation capacity of the VDR, based on the preliminary data obtained with these cells and on an earlier report describing the consequences of the same mutation in another patient (25Rut A.R. Hewison M. Kristjansson K. Luisi B. Hugues M.R. O'Riordan J.L.H. Clin. Endocrinol. 1994; 41: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells from patients 2 and 3, with a W286R mutation in the ligand-binding domain, were selected as models with markedly destabilized ligand binding capacity, as shown by previous biological studies (26Nguyen T.M. Adiceam P. Kottler M.L. Guillozo H. Rizk-Rabin M. Brouillard F. Lagier P. Palix C. Garnier J.M. Garabedian M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and as suggested by x-ray crystal structure analysis of the mutated VDR. 2D. Moras and N. Rochel, personal communication at the 12th Workshop on Vitamin D, Maastricht, The Netherlands, July 6–10, 2003. 2D. Moras and N. Rochel, personal communication at the 12th Workshop on Vitamin D, Maastricht, The Netherlands, July 6–10, 2003. In the three cases, the remaining portion of the VDR gene was normal, unlike in the previously reported osteoblast models, which bore large deletions of the VDR gene (21Erben R.G. Segiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Möller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Wali R. Kong J. Demay M.B. Brasitus T.A. Bissonnette M. Li Y.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16 (Abstr. F499): S229Google Scholar). For the rapid effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3, we followed changes in intracellular calcium in Fura2-loaded cells, an effect observed within seconds and reported in a number of cell systems (5Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Bishop J.E. Henry H.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For long term effects, we evaluated the activity of the 24-hydroxylase, a key mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme complex in the catabolism pathway of vitamin D (27Henry H.L. Steroids. 2001; 66: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as well as the mRNA expression of two of its components, CYP24 and ferredoxin. These enzyme activity and mRNA expressions are known to be markedly enhanced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (27Henry H.L. Steroids. 2001; 66: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Nishimura A. Shinki T. Jin C.H. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Christakos S. Barletta F. Huening M. Dhawan P. Liu Y. Porta A. Peng X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lastly, to determine precisely the mechanism underlying a possible association between rapid and long term effects, culture experiments have been performed in the presence or absence of verapamil, a blocker of Ca2+ channels, or of PD98059, an inhibitor of the MEK 1/2-kinase (30Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), which has been shown to inhibit induction of CYP24 gene expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (31Dwivedi P.P. Hii C.S. Ferrante A. Tan J. Der C.J. Omdahl J.L. Morris H.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29643-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that VDR and especially the KGFFRR motif of its DNA-binding domain, including lysine 45, are required for the rapid effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on intracellular calcium. They also suggest that part of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced stimulation of the 24-hydroxylase activity depends on these rapid effects via a calcium- and MAPK-dependent mechanism, leading to increased mRNA expressions of the CYP24 and ferredoxin genes. Materials—Unlabeled 1,25-(OH)2D3 was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche, and unlabeled 24,25-(OH)2D3 was a gift from Dr. Uskokovic (Hoffmann-La Roche). 25-(OH)[26,27-3H]D3 (specific activity, 23 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chromatography solvents (n-hexane and isopropanol), methanol, and chloroform were purchased from Merck. Verapamil, nifedipine, U-73122, U-73343, and PD 98059 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Patient and Control Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts from the three hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets patients were started from skin biopsies. Patient 1, a girl aged 3 years and 6 months at the time of the skin biopsy, exhibited severe vitamin D-resistant rickets with complete alopecia (unpublished case). The sequencing data of this patient's VDR gene showed a missense mutation in the DNA-binding domain (lysine to glutamic acid at position 45, located in exon 2), a mutation identical to that reported by other authors (25Rut A.R. Hewison M. Kristjansson K. Luisi B. Hugues M.R. O'Riordan J.L.H. Clin. Endocrinol. 1994; 41: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from this patient, as reported earlier (25Rut A.R. Hewison M. Kristjansson K. Luisi B. Hugues M.R. O'Riordan J.L.H. Clin. Endocrinol. 1994; 41: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), had a normal ability to bind 1,25-(OH)2D3 (affinity and number of binding sites) as compared with control fibroblasts. Patient 2, a girl aged 7 months, and patient 3, her older brother aged 5 years and 7 months at the time of the skin biopsy, exhibited severe vitamin D-resistant rickets without alopecia (26Nguyen T.M. Adiceam P. Kottler M.L. Guillozo H. Rizk-Rabin M. Brouillard F. Lagier P. Palix C. Garnier J.M. Garabedian M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the VDR gene in both patients showed a missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain (mutation of tryptophan to arginine at position 286, located in exon 7). The patients' dermal fibroblasts were unable to bind 1,25-(OH)2D3 when tested at 25 °C for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight, but they expressed a normally sized VDR protein (immunocytochemistry and Western blotting) and VDR mRNA of normal length (Northern blotting). In addition, the VDR trafficking toward the nucleus did not seem to be affected in the patients' cells (26Nguyen T.M. Adiceam P. Kottler M.L. Guillozo H. Rizk-Rabin M. Brouillard F. Lagier P. Palix C. Garnier J.M. Garabedian M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from an age-matched control were derived from skin sample collected during plastic surgery. This child, aged 2 years and 9 months, had no known alteration of calcium and bone metabolism. Cell Culture—Control and patients' fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone until confluent. The cells were then trypsinized and seeded on rectangular glass coverslips (3 cm2) at a density of 60,000 cells for calcium assay or in 24-well culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well for 3 days in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 24-hydroxylase activity and mRNA determinations. 25-(OH)D3 24-Hydroxylase Assay—The fetal bovine serum was removed, and 1 ml of fresh serum-free medium was added for 1 h before adding non-radioactive 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 pm–10 nm) or its solvent (ethanol) for a further 18 h as described (32Hewison M. Rut A.R. Kristjansson K. Walker R.E. Dillon M.J. Hugues M.R. O'Riordan J.L. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 39: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After rinsing with serum-free medium, 1.6 nm 25-(OH)[3H]D3 (0.05 μCi) were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 120 min. The medium was removed, and the 3H-labeled vitamin D3 derivatives present in the medium were extracted by adding 2 ml of methanol plus 2 ml of chloroform. The chloroform extract was co-chromatographed with 100 ng of unlabeled 24,25-(OH)2D3 using a straight phase high pressure liquid chromatography system (Beckman, Berkeley, CA) equipped with a 4.6 × 250-m Ultrasphere Si column (Altex, Berkeley, CA), and equilibrated with n-hexane-isopropanol (95:5) (flow rate, 1.5 ml/min). Absorbance at 254 nm was continually monitored, and effluent fractions were collected every minute. After evaporation to dryness, fractions were dissolved in Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the radioactivity was measured. In some experiments, verapamil (1 or 100 μm) or PD 98059 (10 μm) was added 1 h before the addition of unlabeled 1,25-(OH)2D3 or its solvent. The 24-hydroxylase enzyme activity (fmol/culture well/120 min) was calculated based on the percent of the injected radioactivity recovered in the 24,25-(OH)2D3 region after high pressure liquid chromatography. 24-Hydroxylase Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from control and patients fibroblasts using the guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (30 μg) were fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by diffusion blotting for Northern blot analysis. The filters were baked at 80 °C for 120 min in an oven. 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels were analyzed in control and patients' fibroblasts treated with 1 pm–10 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 or its solvent for 16 h. They were hybridized with a 32P-labeled human 24-hydroxylase cDNA probe labeled by the random primer method (Rediprime, Amersham Biosciences). The human 24-hydroxylase cDNA (2.6 kb) was cloned in the pGEM 3Z plasmid (a gift from Prof. H. F. DeLuca). After hybridization, Northern blot autoradiograms were assessed by scanning densitometry (Gel Doc 2000, Bio-Rad). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as control for loading and transfer efficiency as it is unaffected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. 24-Hydroxylase (CYP24) and Ferredoxin mRNA Analysis by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—4 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using Superscript™ II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 25 μl. 2 μl of reverse transcription product was PCR-amplified with human 24-hydroxylase primers (24 forward primer, 5′-GGT GAC ATC TAC GGC GTA CA-3′ and 24 reverse primer, 5′-TTT AAA TAC GGC ATA TTC CTC AAA-3′) or with human ferredoxin primers (ferredoxin forward primer, 5′-TGA TTC TCT GCT AGA TGT TGT G-3′ and ferredoxin reverse primer, 5′-TAT GAA GTC CAC TCA TCC ATG T-3′). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Appligene Oncor) with 0.16 μm each primer in buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 2.5% Me2SO for 35 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 59 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The mRNA of the human small ribosomal protein 14 (S14) was used as a steadily expressed internal control. Amplification was performed with forward and reverse S14 primers (5′-GGC AGA CCG AGA TGA ATC CTC A-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAG GTC CAG GGC TCT TGG TCC-3′ (reverse)), and carried out for 23 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The resulting PCR products (519-bp fragment for 24-hydroxylase and 397-bp fragment for ferredoxin) were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, whereas the 144-bp fragment for S14 was resolved in a 2% agarose gel. DNA was blotted onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by alkaline transfer. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C in a high astringent solution containing the appropriate γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The internal oligonucleotide probes had the following sequences: 5′-GCC ATG ATG AAG TTC ACA GC-3′ (for 24 hydroxylase); 5′-TTT GGT GCA TGT GAG GGA AC-3′ (for ferredoxin); and 5′-GAT GTA TAG GGC GGT GAT ACC CAG CTC CTT-3′ (for S14). The autoradiography signals were analyzed with a densitometric scanner (BioRad Gel Doc 2000), and the results are expressed in arbitrary units as the ratio of 24-hydroxylase or ferredoxin to S14 densitometric values. Calcium Measurement—Confluent fibroblasts were incubated for 24 h in a serum-free medium and assayed for intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) as described (8Le Mellay V. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 75: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM in Hanks' HEPES, pH 7.4 (137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 0.441 mm KH2PO4, 0.442 mm Na2HPO4, 0.885 mm MgSO4.7H2O, 27.7 mm glucose, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES) for 30 min at room temperature. The glass coverslip carrying the cells was inserted into a cuvette containing 2.5 ml of Hanks' HEPES, pH 7.4, that is placed in a temperature-controlled (37 °C) Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorometer (Sciencetec-Braun, Les Ulis, France). Drugs and reagents were added directly to the cuvette under continuous stirring. The Fura-2 fluorescence response to the intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i was calibrated from the ratio of the 340/380 nm fluorescence values after subtraction of the background fluorescence of the cells at 340 and 380 nm. The dissociation constant for the Fura-2-Ca2+ complex was taken as 224 nm (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The values for Rmax and Rmin were calculated from determinations with 25 μm digitonin, 4 mm EGTA, and enough Tris base to raise the pH to 8.3 or higher. Each measurement on Fura-2-loaded cells was followed by a parallel experiment under the same conditions with cells not loaded with Fura-2. The [Ca2+]i response to 10 pm–1nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 was studied in basal conditions or 120 s after the addition of one of the following compounds (each 1 μm): verapamil or nifedipine (two selective blockers of l-type Ca2+ channels), U-73122 (a direct inhibitor of phospholipase C linked to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate), or U-73343 (an inactive analog of U-73122). Statistical Analysis—The data were subjected to an overall statistical evaluation using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Test groups were compared with respective untreated control groups using the Mann and Whitney non-parametric U test. Rapid Effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on Intracellular Calcium— 1,25-(OH)2D3 (100 pm) induced a significant (p < 0.001) transient increase in [Ca2+]i within 5–10 s in Fura2-loaded fibroblasts derived from the control child, who had no disorder of calcium metabolism. The peak value was observed after 15 s, and a subsequent lower plateau phase persisted above basal level for more than 60 s (Fig. 1). The 1,25-(OH)2D3 effect on [Ca2+]i peak value was dose-dependent and bell-shaped, with a maximum at 100 pm (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Dose-dependent effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on intracellular calcium in control and patient fibroblasts. Changes in [Ca2+]i following the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in Fura2-loaded control, K45E (patient 1), and W286R (patient 2) fibroblasts are depicted. The [Ca2+]i was determined at t = 15 s after the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Values are the mean ± S.E., n = 3–11 coverslips for each concentration, and significant differences from ethanol treated cells are noted. *, p < 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.005; and ***, p ≤ 0.0003View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fibroblasts from patient 1, who bears the K45E mutation on the DNA-binding domain (Figs. 1 and 2), did not respond to1,25-(OH)2D3 within the tested range (10 pm–1 nm). In contrast, a clear [Ca2+]i response, similar to that observed in control cells but with a significantly faster decay after 20 s (p < 0.03), was observed in cells from patients 2 and 3, two siblings who bear the W286R mutation on the VDR ligand-binding domain (Figs. 1 and 2). Effect of Ca2+Channel Blockers and PLC Inhibitors on Intracellular Calcium Response to 1,25-(OH)2D3—Incubating the control fibroblasts for 120 s with 1 μm verapamil, a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, significantly decreased the height of the transient 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced peak (Fig. 3). The use of nifedipine (1 μm), another blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, gave similar results (data not shown). Adding 1 μm U-73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C linked to the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5 bisphosphate, for 120 s abolished the transient 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced peak (Fig. 3). U-73343, its inactive analog, had no effect (data not shown). Both calcium channel blockers and U-73122 blocked the transient peak [Ca2+]i response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in W286R fibroblasts as in controls (Fig. 3, data shown for verapamil and U-73122). Effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on 24-Hydroxylase Activity—Control fibroblasts cultured in basal conditions produced detectable amounts of 24,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 2 h after the addition of its precursor 25-(OH)[3H]D3 (Fig. 4). 1,25-(OH)2D3, added 18 h before the enzyme assay, stimulated 24-hydroxylase activity in a dose-dependent manner with a significant 2-fold increase over base line at 1 pm up to a 9-fold increase at 10 nm. Fibroblasts bearing the K45E mutation (patient 1) showed no detectable 24-hydroxylase activity in basal conditions and did not respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 at concentrations ranging from 1 pm to 10 nm (Fig. 4). Fibroblasts bearing the W286R mutation (patient 2) were similar to controls as regards their basal production of 24,25-(OH)2D3 and their response (2.5-fold increase) to the lowest (1 pm) 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration tested (Fig. 4). But, unlike in controls, no further stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity was observed with higher 1,25-(OH)2D3 doses, and a barely significant 1.8-fold increase was observed with 10 nm. Effect of Ca2+Channel Blockers on 24-Hydroxylase Activity— Treatment of control fibroblasts with 1 μm verapamil significantly increased the basal 24-hydroxylase activity, whereas 100 μm verapamil had no effect (Fig. 5). Both verapamil treatments abolished the stimulatory effect of low (1 pm and 100 pm) doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on 24,25-(OH)2D3 production. But they did not significantly alter the effect of the highest (10 nm) 1,25-(OH)2D3 dose (Fig. 5). As in control cells, basal 24-hydroxylase activity was increased in W286R fibroblasts after 1 μm verapamil pretreatment and unchanged after 100 μm verapamil treatment (Fig. 5). In these patient cells, both verapamil treatments abolished the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity in the dose range tested (1 pm-10 nm). Effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on 24-Hydroxylase (CYP24) mRNA Expression—24-hydroxylase mRNA expression could not be detected by Northern blots (Fig. 6) but was detectable by RT-PCR (data not shown) in nuclear extracts from control fibroblasts cultured under basal conditions. This mRNA expression became detectable by both techniques 6 h after the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (100 pm) to the culture medium, and the highest levels were observed after 18–24 h by Northern blot (24-hydroxylase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA ratios) and RT-PCR (24-hydroxylase/S14 ratios) analyses. All tested doses (1 pm–10 nm) of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were effective after 18 h, and a maximal effect was observed with 100 pm and 10 nm (Fig. 6). No 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression cou"
https://openalex.org/W2085214569,"The RecQ helicase family is highly conserved from bacteria to men and plays a conserved role in the preservation of genome integrity. Its deficiency in human cells leads to a marked genomic instability that is associated with premature aging and cancer. To determine the thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of Escherichia coli RecQ helicase with DNA, equilibrium binding studies have been performed using the thermodynamic rigorous fluorescence titration technique. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides revealed that RecQ helicase bound to DNA with an apparent binding stoichiometry of 1 protein monomer/10 nucleotides. This stoichiometry was not altered in the presence of AMPPNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate) or ADP. Analyses of RecQ helicase interactions with oligonucleotides of different lengths over a wide range of pH, NaCl, and nucleic acid concentrations indicate that the RecQ helicase has a single strong DNA binding site with an association constant at 25 °C of K = 6.7 ± 0.95 × 106m-1 and a cooperativity parameter of ω = 25.5 ± 1.2. Both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA bind competitively to the same site. The intrinsic affinities are salt-dependent, and the formation of DNA-helicase complex is accompanied by a net release of 3–4 ions. Allosteric effects of nucleotide cofactors on RecQ binding to DNA were observed only for single-stranded DNA in the presence of 1.5 mm AMPPNP, whereas both AMPPNP and ADP had no detectable effect on double-stranded DNA binding over a large range of nucleotide cofactor concentrations. The RecQ helicase family is highly conserved from bacteria to men and plays a conserved role in the preservation of genome integrity. Its deficiency in human cells leads to a marked genomic instability that is associated with premature aging and cancer. To determine the thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of Escherichia coli RecQ helicase with DNA, equilibrium binding studies have been performed using the thermodynamic rigorous fluorescence titration technique. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides revealed that RecQ helicase bound to DNA with an apparent binding stoichiometry of 1 protein monomer/10 nucleotides. This stoichiometry was not altered in the presence of AMPPNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate) or ADP. Analyses of RecQ helicase interactions with oligonucleotides of different lengths over a wide range of pH, NaCl, and nucleic acid concentrations indicate that the RecQ helicase has a single strong DNA binding site with an association constant at 25 °C of K = 6.7 ± 0.95 × 106m-1 and a cooperativity parameter of ω = 25.5 ± 1.2. Both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA bind competitively to the same site. The intrinsic affinities are salt-dependent, and the formation of DNA-helicase complex is accompanied by a net release of 3–4 ions. Allosteric effects of nucleotide cofactors on RecQ binding to DNA were observed only for single-stranded DNA in the presence of 1.5 mm AMPPNP, whereas both AMPPNP and ADP had no detectable effect on double-stranded DNA binding over a large range of nucleotide cofactor concentrations. DNA helicases catalyze the unwinding of duplex DNA (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. to provide the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediate that is required for diverse DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination, transcription, and DNA repair (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). DNA helicases function as molecular motors and use the chemical energy derived from nucleoside 5′-triphosphate binding or hydrolysis to mechanically disrupt the hydrogen bonds between the two strands in dsDNA and to translocate along DNA for processive unwinding (2Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The RecQ helicase family, which is widespread in diverse organisms from Escherichia coli to humans, has become more interesting since the discovery that several human diseases, such as Bloom's, Werner's, and Rothmund-Thompson syndromes, are linked with these enzymes (3Yu C.E.

Analyses of these and related diseases at the cellular and molecular levels led to the conclusion that RecQ helicase plays a conserved role in the preservation of genomic integrity (6Frei C.

The prototypical member of the RecQ helicase family, the E. coli RecQ protein, plays an essential role both in DNA recombination and in suppression of illegitimate recombination (17Hanada K. Ukita T.

E. coli RecQ helicase (610 amino acids, molecular mass, 68,920 Da) displays a 3′-5′ polarity in DNA unwinding and can unwind diverse DNA substrates including DNA with blunt ends, with 5′ or 3′ overhangs, nicked or forked DNA, and three- or four-way junctions as well as G4 DNA (a guanine-rich parallel four-stranded DNA structure) (20Umezu K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Elucidation of the interactions between helicase and its DNA substrate is a very important step in understanding the mechanism by which helicases bind and unwind dsDNA. Currently little is known about the thermodynamic characteristics of the binding reaction between RecQ and DNA. Additionally, the effect of solution conditions, salt, and type of salt on the intrinsic affinities and the roles of nucleotide cofactors remain unclear. Thus, more knowledge concerning the properties and kinetic mechanism of RecQ helicase binding to DNA is needed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying helicase function. Toward this goal, we have investigated the DNA binding properties of E. coli RecQ helicase under equilibrium conditions using fluorescein-labeled DNA substrates. Free fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide (ssDNA or dsDNA) displays low fluorescence anisotropy. Its anisotropy is enhanced upon protein binding due to the reduced rotational mobility of the formed protein-DNA complex. According to the Perrin equation (22Perrino F.W. Loeb L.A. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) the anisotropy of a fluorescent complex increases with an increase of its volume. Thus, the change in anisotropy of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides can be used to measure the extent of protein binding. This approach has been used successfully in a number of studies (23Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Ebright Y.W. Blatter E.E. Zhou Y. Ebright R.H.

Our results indicate that the binding site size of 10 nucleotides per monomeric enzyme does not change as oligonucleotide length increases, implying that RecQ helicase binds to DNA as a monomer. Interestingly, RecQ helicase appears to bind to DNA with high affinity and low cooperativity. In addition, only the nucleotide cofactor AMPPNP increases the affinity of the enzyme for ssDNA in a narrow concentration range, whereas ADP has no detectable effect. The formation of a helicase-DNA complex is accompanied by net release of ions. These properties offer insight into the mechanism by which RecQ helicase exercises its functions in cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Buffers—All buffers were made with reagent grade chemicals using distilled water purified through a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., France). ADP, ATP, and AMPPNP were purchased from Sigma. Standard titration buffer is 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol.pH Measurements—pH measurements were performed with a Knick 654 pH meter and an Ingold microelectrode. For calibration three standard buffers were used, and the precision was about ± 0.01 pH unit at 25 °C. To obtain a pH range from 5 to 10, 30 mm sodium citrate, MES, and Tris acetate were employed for pH intervals 5.0–6.0, 5.5–7.2, and 6.8–10, respectively. The possible effect of pH on anisotropy of DNA substrate was taken into account.Agarose Gel Mobility Shift Assay—RecQ helicase-DNA complexes were formed in standard titration buffer in a total volume of 35 μl at room temperature. The EcoRI-restricted 3-kilobase plasmid DNA (60 μm, in nucleotides) was mixed with various concentrations of protein in the range of 0–20 μg. After incubation for 30 min, 5 μl of loading buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, and 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added to each sample. The complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 100 V for 1.5 h and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.RecQ Helicase—His6-tagged E. coli RecQ helicase was expressed from pET 15b expression plasmid in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described (27Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overexpressed protein was purified under native conditions by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography columns (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences) and an ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE Sephadex A-50). The His tag was cleaved using biotinylated thrombin, and removal of the biotinylated thrombin was accomplished using streptavidin-agarose magnetic beads (Novagen, Madison, WI). Based on Sypro Orange-stained SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry analyses, the purity of the RecQ preparation was >95%.Oligonucleotides—The PAGE-purified unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Proligo (France). Their structures, sequences, and extinction coefficients are shown in Table I. The concentrations of oligonucleotides were determined by measuring the extinction coefficients. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were made in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated to 85 °C for 5 min, and annealing was allowed by slow cooling to room temperature.Table IOligonucleotide sequences used in this studySubstrateLengthStructure and sequenceϵ260 nmaThe extinction coefficients of ssDNA were determined using Proligo's software, and those of dsDNA were determined experimentallycm-1m-1A75′-F-TAGCAGTbF represents the fluorescein chemical group7.1 × 104B105′-F-CTCTAGCAGT9.28 × 105C135′-F-AATCTCTAGCAGT12.77 × 105D185′-F-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGC17.73 × 105E215′-F-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT20.92 × 105F365′-F-AGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT35.84 × 105G455′-F-AGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT44.01 × 105H21/215′-F-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT; 3′-CACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA16.7 × 105F36/365′-F-AGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT; 3′-TCTGGGAAAATCAGCCACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA36 × 105a The extinction coefficients of ssDNA were determined using Proligo's software, and those of dsDNA were determined experimentallyb F represents the fluorescein chemical group Open table in a new tab Anisotropy Assays—The binding assay was performed by using a Beacon 2000 polarization instrument (PanVera Corp.) (28Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An appropriate quantity of fluorescein-labeled ssDNA or dsDNA was added to a standard titration buffer (150 μl total volume) in a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C. The anisotropy of the fluorescein-labeled DNA was measured successively until it stabilized. Then an appropriate quantity of RecQ helicase was added. After the addition of each titrant the anisotropy was measured continuously until it reached a stable plateau. To determine the concentration of the helicase-DNA complex, fluorescence signals observed in these RecQ helicase titrations were subtracted from that observed in the absence of enzyme. The increase in sample volume during the titration was taken into account in the analysis of the data. The reported values are from the average of two to three measurements.Determination of the Binding Site Size—The binding site size was determined from the intersection of lines drawn through the ascending and plateau regions of the anisotropy data by visual inspection. Stoichiometry (N) and dissociation constant (KD, in units of molarity) parameters were further determined by globally fitting the anisotropy data according to Equation 1 (29Kopelman M. Cogan U. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 439: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Xu H. Wang Y. Bleuit J.S. Morrical S.W.

The method used to obtain rigorous estimates of the average binding density v (number of protein molecules bound per nucleotide) and free protein concentration LF has been previously described in the literature (31Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The titration data were analyzed using Equations 3, 4, 5 from Epstein (33Epstein M.A. Prog. Exp.

The intrinsic binding constant (K, in units of m-1) and the binding cooperativity parameter (ω, unit-less) were determined from the fit of the binding isotherms by the least squares method. For the 13-, 21-, 36- and 45-mer oligonucleotide ssDNA, the concrete expressions of θ are as follows. Q(13)=η1+η Q(21)=1021×12η+2η2+4η2ω1+12η+η2+2η2ω Q(36)=1036×27η+272η2+34η2ω+105η3+126η3ω+21η3ω21+27η+136η2+17η2ω+35η3+42η3ω+7η3ω2 Q(45)=1045×36η+650η2+52η2ω+1680η3+720η3ω+48η3ω21+36η+325η2+26η2ω+560η3+240η3ω+16η3ω2+60η4+240η4ω+180η4ω2+24η4ω3+15η4+60η4ω+45η4ω2+6η4ω3 where η = KLT, and the value of n used is 10 for RecQ (see “Results”).RESULTSValidity of Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements to Determine the Binding Isotherms—We used two separate means to show that the increase in anisotropy is directly proportional to binding. First, we directly analyzed the relationship between the fractional saturation and the fluorescence anisotropy during the titration. Fig. 1A shows that, at a given concentration of fluorescein-labeled 21-mer oligonucleotide, the observed fluorescence anisotropy increases during the protein titration. If we assume that at saturation the moles of RecQ helicase added are equal to the moles of fluorescein-labeled DNA and all fluorescein-labeled DNAs are bound without precipitation of the RecQ-DNA complexes, then the fractional saturation of RecQ helicase can be derived from the anisotropy determined at each RecQ helicase concentration during titration. If the fluorescence anisotropy signal change really reflects the degree of saturation of the ligand, a linear relationship should exist between the fluorescence anisotropy and the fractional saturation of the ligand. As expected, Fig. 1B (circle) shows that the observed anisotropy increases linearly with an increase of the fractional saturation of RecQ helicase.Secondly, to obtain thermodynamically rigorous binding parameters independent of any assumption about the relationship between the observed signal and the degree of binding, we analyzed the measured fluorescence anisotropy titration curves using the macromolecular binding density function method of Lohman and Bujalowski (31Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). At any given particular anisotropy value in Fig. 1A all titrations have the same binding density v = LB/MT, where LB is the bound ligand concentration (moles of RecQ) and MT the total macromolecule concentration (moles of nucleotides). The relation between the total ligand concentration and free ligand concentration (LF) should obey the law of mass conservation, LT=LB+LF=vMT+LF(Eq. 10) For m different anisotropy values, m sets of values of {LTm, MTm} could be obtained. The values of v and LF could then be obtained from a linear plot of LT versus MT (Equation 10), with a slope of v and an intercept of LF. The fractional saturation (θ) can be determined from both binding density (v) and binding site size (n) with θ = vn. Fig. 1B (square) shows the linear dependence of the observed anisotropy on the fractional saturation of RecQ helicase. The value of θ could be determined experimentally up to 0.85, and its maximum value was derived from the extrapolation of the anisotropy data to its maximum (when Amax = 0.23, θ = 1). Both of the above analyses clearly show that the fluorescence anisotropy assay is a reliable method for binding studies.DNA Binding Site Size and Effect of DNA Length on Helicase Binding—An agarose gel mobility shift assay was used to determine the binding site size. Under our experimental conditions a shift of the 3-kilobase DNA was observed, and its magnitude was dependent on the RecQ helicase concentration (Fig. 2, inset). This shift was stabilized when the stoichiometric ratio between DNA and RecQ helicase corresponded to 10–12 nucleotides of DNA per RecQ helicase monomer (Fig. 2). This indicates that about 11 nucleotides were occluded by a RecQ helicase monomer.Fig. 2Determination of binding stoichiometry (N) by agarose gel mobility shift assay. The protein-DNA complex migration distance was determined from the gel mobility assay (inset). Increasing concentrations of RecQ protein (in the range of 0.5–20 μm) were added to 60 μm (nucleotides) of EcoRI-cut 3-kilobase plasmid DNA and run on a 0.8% agarose gel. The complexes were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The stoichiometry (N) was determined from the intersection of asymptotic lines drawn through steeply ascending and saturated regions of the data derived from the inset. The relative migration distance of RecQ-DNA complex (Rf) is calculated as Rf = (Rs - R0)/(Ru - R0), where Rs is the migration distance of the complex in the presence of RecQ protein, R0 in the absence of the protein, and Ru the upper limit of the migration distance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The precise value of the binding site size is important for determining the affinity (K) and cooperativity (ω) parameters for interactions between helicase and DNA. We, therefore, further determined the stoichiometry value of RecQ helicase binding to an oligonucleotide using the fluorescence anisotropy method under equilibrium binding conditions. We have previously determined the apparent dissociation constants for oligonucleotides of lengths of 13-, 21-, 36-, and 45-mer. Thus, the stoichiometry for DNA binding can be obtained under conditions where the oligonucleotide concentration is kept much higher than the dissociation constant (29Kopelman M. Cogan U. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 439: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Xu H. Wang Y. Bleuit J.S. Morrical S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the results of fluorescence anisotropy titrations of fluorescein-labeled 21- and 45-mer oligonucleotides with increasing RecQ helicase concentrations. In both cases fluorescence anisotropy increases sharply and then saturates. Binding stoichiometry was estimated empirically from the intersection of asymptotes as shown in Figs. 3, A and B. In the case of fluorescein-labeled 21-mer DNA the anisotropy increases from 0.055 to a plateau value of 0.18, demonstrating that RecQ helicase binds to DNA with 2:1 stoichiometry (Table II) and, thus, suggesting that the binding site size of RecQ helicase is 10 nucleotides. This conclusion was further supported by results obtained from global fits of the data in Fig. 3 to Equation 1.Fig. 3Determination of stoichiometry by measuring fluorescence anisotropy titration of RecQ with ssDNA. Experimental conditions and treatments of data were described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each titration the starting concentration of ssDNA was 100 nm. A and B represent titrations of 21- and 45-mer ssDNA with RecQ helicase, respectively. The stoichiometry was determined both from the intersection of asymptotic lines drawn through the steeply ascending and plateau regions of the data and from global nonlinear regression fits (Table II) of the data.

The stoichiometry values determined by both direct inspection and global regression fits are summarized in Table II. We noted that there is a clear linear relation between the stoichiometry and the length of ssDNA used in the determination (Fig. 3C). The slope value of 11.4 ± 1.5 nucleotides indicates that the DNA binding site size is less than 11 nucleotides per enzyme. Additionally, when fluorescein-labeled 13- and 36-mer ssDNA was titrated with RecQ helicase in the presence of 1 or 2 mm AMPPNP or ADP, the stoichiometry values are essentially the same as in the absence of these nucleotide cofactors (Table II).To further determine the number of nucleotides directly engaged in interactions with the DNA binding site of RecQ helicase, a series of ssDNA of different lengths from 7- to 45-mer were examined. Consistent with the above observation, oligonucleotides of more than 10 nucleotides in length bind tightly to the enzyme at saturating concentrations of RecQ helicase (500 nm) (Fig. 4A). However, the binding amplitude of the 7-mer oligonucleotide is lower compared with that of the 21-mer oligonucleotide. In addition, the 7-mer oligonucleotidehelicase complex is unstable and dissociates gradually as a function of time. However, the complex can be stabilized in the presence of 1.5 mm AMPPNP (Fig. 4B), indicating a possible allosteric regulation of the enzyme by the nucleotide cofactor. Therefore, we conclude that the number of nucleotides directly engaged in interactions with RecQ helicase should be 8 ≤ n ≤ 11 bases.Fig. 4Binding of oligonucleotides of different lengths by RecQ helicase.

Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The binding isotherms were analyzed by the Epstein Equation, which describes more precisely the binding properties of a large ligand to a finite lattice of DNA with an arbitrary length (33Epstein M.A. Prog.

The NTRK family of neurotrophin receptors mediate neuronal cell survival and differentiation, but altered NTRK signaling has also been implicated in oncogenesis. The ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) gene fusion occurs in human pediatric spindle cell sarcomas and secretory breast carcinoma, and encodes the oligomerization domain of the ETV6 transcription factor fused to the protein-tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3. The EN protein functions as a constitutively active protein-tyrosine kinase with potent transforming activity in multiple cell lineages, and EN constitutively activates both the Ras-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways. EN transformation is associated with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Further, IRS-1 functions as the adaptor protein linking EN to downstream signaling pathways. However, the exact nature of the EN-IRS-1 interaction remains unknown. We now demonstrate that EN specifically binds the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1 via an interaction at the C terminus of EN. An EN mutant lacking the C-terminal 19 amino acids does not bind IRS-1 and lacks transforming ability. Moreover, expression of an IRS-1 polypeptide containing the phosphotyrosine binding domain acts in a dominant negative manner to inhibit EN transformation, and overexpression of IRS-1 potentiates EN transforming activity. These findings indicate that EN·IRS-1 complex formation through the NTRK3 C terminus is essential for EN transformation.

Receptor tyrosine kinases are a highly regulated family of proteins in normal cells but may undergo mutations or structural alterations to become oncoproteins in human malignancies. Oncogenic activation of receptor tyrosine kinases can result from genetic lesions such as point mutations or overexpression by gene amplification (see 1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar, 2Meshinchi S. Stirewalt D.L. Alonzo T.A. Zhang Q. Sweetser D.A. Woods W.G. Bernstein I.D. Arceci R.J. Radich J.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1474-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alternatively, chromosomal rearrangements leading to the formation of an oncogenic gene fusion can involve receptor tyrosine kinases-encoding genes (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). In this case, a fusion protein is created in which the tyrosine kinase domain is fused to a dimerization domain contributed by the fusion partner (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). Resulting chimeric tyrosine kinases are thought to constitutively activate downstream signaling cascades of the wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases, potentially leading to oncogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which many of these oncogenic tyrosine kinases link to effector pathways remains largely unknown. We previously cloned the breakpoints of the t(12;15)(p13; q25) translocation associated with congenital fibrosarcoma, a pediatric spindle cell malignancy of the soft tissues (3Knezevich S.R. McFadden D.E. Tao W. Lim J.F. Sorensen P.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). This rearrangement generates a gene fusion encoding the sterile alpha motif dimerization domain of the ETV6 (TEL) transcription factor linked to the protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the neurotrophin-3 receptor NTRK3 (TRKC) (3Knezevich S.R. McFadden D.E. Tao W. Lim J.F. Sorensen P.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts are also expressed in a related pediatric tumor, cellular mesoblastic nephroma (4Knezevich S.R. Garnett M.J. Pysher T.J. Beckwith J.B. Grundy P.E. Sorensen P.H.

The transforming properties of EN require both an active protein-tyrosine kinase domain and the sterile alpha motif oligomerization domain (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). EN expression leads to constitutive elevation of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels, and EN-induced cyclin D1 expression correlates with increased cell cycle progression (10Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that EN expression in NIH3T3 cells leads to constitutive activation of two of the major effector pathways of wild-type NTRK3, namely the Ras-Raf1-MEK1-ERK1/2 MAP kinase (Ras-MAPK) mitogenic pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway leading to activation of the Akt survival factor (10Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotypic transformation and soft agar colony formation by EN-expressing cells are blocked by inhibition of either MEK1 or PI3K. However, we failed to detect interactions between EN and adaptor molecules known to link NTRK3 to Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways such as SHC, GRB2, SH2Bβ, or the p85 subunit of PI3K (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as ABL, SRC, and SHIP2. 2C. L. Lannon, M. J. Martin, C. E. Tognon, and P. H. B. Sorensen, unpublished data. Wild-type NTRK proteins utilize juxtamembrane tyrosine residues (e.g. NTRK3 Tyr485) to interact with several of these adaptors including SHC (11Guiton M. Gunn-Moore F.J. Glass D.J. Geis D.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this residue is not present in the EN oncoprotein because of the position of the fusion point (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that EN fails to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice with a targeted disruption of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFIR) gene but that reintroduction of IGFIR into these cells restores EN transformation activity (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This led us to examine in more detail the relationship between IGFIR signaling and EN transformation. We observed a direct physical interaction between EN and the major IGFIR substrate, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We showed that IRS-1 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in EN-transformed cells and that EN·IRS-1 complexes bind both GRB2 and the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit. This strongly suggests that IRS-1 is functioning as the adaptor molecule linking EN to Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IRS-1 interacts with EN remains unknown. IRS-1 along with IRS-2-4 are a family of tyrosine-phosphorylated scaffold proteins that are substrates for IGFIR and the insulin receptor (15White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although IRS proteins lack enzymatic activity, they are thought to play key adaptor roles in linking the IGFIR and insulin receptor to downstream pathways. Three different domains in IRS-1 have been identified as potentially contributing to IGFIR and insulin receptor binding: the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and the SHC and IRS-1 NPXY binding (SAIN) domain (16White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). PH domains bind phospholipids, thereby mediating the interaction of signaling proteins such as IRS-1 with the plasma membrane (17Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PTB domains in adaptor proteins bind to phosphorylated tyrosines within NPXY motifs in interacting proteins such as cell surface receptors (18Yan K.S. Kuti M. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), thus promoting receptor-adaptor interactions. The SAIN domain of IRS-1 remains poorly characterized but has been postulated to contain other potential protein-protein interaction motifs (16White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 19Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We now show that the distal C-terminal sequence of EN, which is highly conserved among NTRK3 proteins across species, interacts specifically with the PTB domain of IRS-1 and that this interaction is essential for EN transformation activity. Moreover, the transformation activity of EN can be inhibited by a dominant negative IRS-1 construct, whereas IRS-1 overexpression in EN-transformed cells enhances the tumorigenic activity of this oncoprotein. Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained at low confluence in 9% calf serum (Invitrogen) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen). The BOSC23 packaging cell line was obtained from Dr. Rob Kay (Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and DMEM. HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in 10% fetal bovine serum and DMEM. IGFIR knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were engineered to overexpress IGFIR and designated R+ cells, as described previously (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum and DMEM. Generation of Expression Constructs—The cDNA encoding ETV6-NTRK3 was inserted into the retroviral vector MSCVpuro or MSCVneo (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site. The cDNA encoding EN-Δ614 was produced via amplification of residues 1-614 of ETV6-NTRK3 using primers containing HpaI/EcoRI restriction sites (5′-primer, 5′-TGCAGTTAACGTTCC-TGATCTCTCTCGCTGTG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CTGAATTCCTAGATCTC-CTTGATGTTCAACC-3′). The PCR product was digested with HpaI/EcoRI and cloned into MSCVpuro. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged portions of IRS-1 were created by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid as follows: IRS-1B, PH domain alone (open reading frame nucleotides 16-351); IRS-1C, PH/PTB domains (nucleotides 16-779); IRS-1D, PH/PTB/PTB-like domains (nucleotides 16-1391); IRS-1E, PTB domain alone (nucleotides 436-779). MSCVneo/IRS-1 retroviral expression vector was created by excising the mouse IRS-1 cDNA from pBluescript SKII/IRS-1 plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. R. Baserga) using EcoRV and cloning into the HpaI site of MSCVneo. MSCVneo/HA-IRS-1C was created by excising HA-IRS-1C from pcDNA3.1 with HindIII and NotI, treating with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment to give blunt ends, and cloning into the HpaI site of MSCVneo. HA-tagged IRS-1 was created by PCR amplification of full-length IRS-1 (5′-primer, 5′-TCCACAAGCTT-TTATGGCGAGCCCTCC-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CCCCCCATGCGGCCGCA-ATTGACGGTCCTCTGGTTG-3′) and ligation into pMH (Roche) with HindIII and NotI restriction sites. All constructs have been sequence verified. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Y615F mutant of EN was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, using the primer 5′-ATCAAGGAGATCTTCAAAATCCTC-3′. Mutagenesis was performed using EN pBS KS+ as a template. The construct was sequence verified, digested with EcoRI, and cloned into MSCVpuro. Generation of Retrovirally Transduced Cell Lines—Infections of NIH3T3 fibroblasts were carried out using the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral expression system (Clontech). Briefly, the BOSC23 packaging cell line was transfected with target plasmids using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (10Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Cells coexpressing two different constructs were made by transfecting and selecting for the control (MSCV) or ETV6-NTRK3 constructs first then coexpressing and selecting for the second construct (i.e. wild-type and mutant IRS-1). Expression of both proteins was confirmed by Western blot. Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—cDNAs encoding wild type or Δ614 mutant EN constructs were C-terminally tagged with a V5-His tag using pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Different combinations of HA- and V5-tagged constructs were transiently cotransfected in HEK293T cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were prepared as described (10Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations (α-HA, α-V5) were performed on lysates collected 36 h after transfection, followed by V5 or HA Western blotting. Antibodies—The following antibodies were utilized in the Western blotting experiments described in this paper: phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221; IB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling); phospho-Akt (Ser473; IB 1:1,000; Cell Signaling); 4G10 (IB 1:10,000; Upstate Biotechnology); TrkC (C-14; WB 1:1,000; IP 5 μl/IP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin D1/2 (IB 1:2,000; Upstate Biotechnology); GRB2 (Western blot 1:5,000, Transduction Laboratories); GST-ETV6-HLH (IB 1:5,000; IP 2 μl/IP; a generous gift from Peter Marynen, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); HA antibody (HA.11; IB 1:2,000 dilution; IP 5 μl of 1/50 dilution/IP; BabCO); V5 (IB 1:5,000; Invitrogen). Soft Agar Assays—Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in triplicate at a concentration of ∼8 × 104 cells/35-mm dish. Bottom layers were made up of 0.4% agar in 9% calf serum DMEM. Cells were resuspended in a top layer of 0.2% agar in 9% calf serum DMEM. Cells were fed every other day by placing two drops of medium on the top layer. After 2 weeks at 37 °C the number of single cells and colonies/high power field were counted. Results were formulated as a percentage of colonies formed/total number of cells plated. Statistical significance of differences in the respective groups was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney ranks test; p values < 0.05 were considered to be of statistical significance. Tumor Growth in Nude Mice—Pathogen-free male Fox Chase SCID mice (C.B-17), 5-6 weeks old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Two million NIH3T3 cells infected with control vector, ETV6-NTRK3, EN-Δ614, and EN-Y615F were injected subcutaneously at four sites/animal (three animals/group), for a total of 12 monitored sites for each cell line. Animals were housed in laminar flow racks and microisolator cages under specific pathogen-free conditions and received autoclaved food and water. SCID mice were evaluated for tumor growth periodically until 20 days after injection, a time point at which tumor growth in the ETV6-NTRK3 group necessitated the termination of the experiment. The statistical significance of differences in tumor size in the respective groups was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney ranks test; p values < 0.05 were considered to be of statistical significance. The PTB Domain of IRS-1 Mediates Its Association with EN—We demonstrated previously that IRS-1 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in EN-transformed cells, that EN associates with IRS-1 in vivo, and that IRS-1 functions as the adaptor protein linking EN to the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades, which are essential for EN transformation (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To characterize the EN-IRS-1 interaction further, we created a series of HA-tagged IRS-1 constructs expressing specific portions of the protein (Fig. 1A). These constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells along with V5-tagged EN. Expression of each construct was confirmed by α-HA immunoprecipitation followed by α-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). V5-EN expression was confirmed by α-V5 immunoprecipitation followed by α-V5 immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). To determine the region of IRS-1 responsible for binding to EN, lysates were immunoprecipitated with either α-V5 or α-HA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with α-HA or α-V5 antibodies. HA-tagged EN, IRS-1 full-length, IRS-1C, IRS-1D, and -IRS-1E were all able to pull down V5-EN (Fig. 1B). V5-tagged EN was able to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged EN as well as all IRS-1 constructs containing the PTB domain (HA-IRS-1C, HA-IRS-1D, and HA-IRS-1E (Fig. 1C). Only the fragment consisting of the IRS-1 PH domain alone was incapable of associating with V5-EN, indicating that the PTB domain of IRS-1 is required for its interaction with EN (Fig. 1C). Generation of C-terminal EN Mutants—PTB domains are generally thought to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target interacting proteins within NPXpY motifs, where pY is a phosphorylated tyrosine and X is any amino acid (for review, see Ref. 18Yan K.S. Kuti M. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore searched EN sequences for tyrosine residues, particularly within NPXpY motifs, that might mediate the EN-IRS-1 interaction. In wild-type NTRK3 signaling, the juxtamembrane NPQpY516 sequence binds SNT (21Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and SHC (11Guiton M. Gunn-Moore F.J. Glass D.J. Geis D.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20384-20390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This sequence is lost in EN because of the position of the fusion point (3Knezevich S.R. McFadden D.E. Tao W. Lim J.F. Sorensen P.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and previous studies confirmed that EN does not bind SHC (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of the 19 remaining tyrosines in EN (GenBank accession no. AF041811), none is within classical NPXpY motifs (data not shown). None of the 7 tyrosines within the ETV6 portion is likely to mediate the EN-IRS-1 interaction, as replacement of the entire ETV6 sequence with the inducible FKBP dimerization domain (22Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) still results in activation of the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades.2 The other twelve tyrosines reside within the NTRK3 portion of the fusion protein, nine of which are conserved among human NTRK family members (NTRK1-3) (GenBank accession no. NP_002520, NP_006171, and Q16288, respectively). We reasoned that if any of these tyrosines mediates the EN-IRS-1 PTB interaction, then their mutation should block EN transformation. We systematically made tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions of each tyrosine and assessed the resulting EN mutants for NIH3T3 cell soft agar colony formation as described previously (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Tognon C. Garnett M. Kenward E. Kay R. Morrison K. Sorensen P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8909-8916PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously (8Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mutation of the three protein-tyrosine kinase activation loop tyrosines Tyr513, Tyr517, and Tyr518, completely blocked colony formation, whereas mutation of Tyr560, Tyr594, and Tyr628 (the phospholipase Cγ binding site of EN) had no inhibitory effects on colony formation whatsoever (data not shown). Of the remaining tyrosines, only mutation of Tyr615 reduced soft agar colony formation (see below in Fig. 5A). We noticed that Tyr615 lies within a sequence of distal C-terminal NTRK3 amino acids that are highly conserved across vertebrate species (Fig. 2B). Moreover, there is substantial sequence dissimilarity from either NTRK1 or NTRK2 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that this region may be important for NTRK3-specific signaling. We therefore created a deletion mutant, EN-Δ614, lacking the last 19 amino acids of EN (including Tyr615). Levels of expression of EN-Δ614 and the EN-Y615F mutant were similar to that of EN, and both became tyrosine-phosphorylated in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Generation of EN-, EN-Δ614-, and EN-Y615F-expressing cells and assessment of phosphorylation.

Residues identical to the NTRK3 sequence are indicated by a dot. Numbers delineate amino acid boundaries of each protein segment. This region of NTRK3 is considerably different from other members of the NTRK family, suggesting that it may contain unique signaling residues. B, sequence alignment of the same C-terminal 30 amino acids of NTRK3 among four different vertebrate species. * indicates the position of tyrosine 615 of EN. Conservation of this region suggests that it may contain essential residues for unique NTRK3 signaling. — indicates a potential region for IRS-1 PTB binding. C, retroviral gene transfer was used to produce EN- and EN mutant-expressing NIH3T3 cells. To confirm protein expression, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-ETV6 antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Arrows highlight the 73/68-kDa doublet of EN and EN-Y615F and the predicted 70/66-kDa doublet of EN-Δ614. Note that both EN-Δ614 and EN-Y615F are also tyrosine-phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EN-Δ614 Fails to Associate with IRS-1—To determine whether these EN mutants could associate with IRS-1, NIH3T3 fibroblasts were retrovirally infected with EN, EN-Δ614, EN-Y615F, or vector (MSCV) alone. Lysates prepared from serum-starved cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using α-ETV6 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with α-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Consistent with our previous findings (14Morrison K.B. Tognon C. Garnett M.J. Deal C. Sorensen P.H.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5684-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), EN cells demonstrated a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of ∼180 kDa (see Fig. 3A, top panel), which was confirmed to represent IRS-1 by reprobing with α-IRS-1 antibodies (data not shown). Levels of this band were consistently lower in immunoprecipitates from EN-Y615F cells (Fig. 3A, top panel) and completely absent (either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) in those from EN-Δ614 or vector (MSCV) control lysates (Fig. 3A, top panel). Immunoprecipitation from the same lysates with α-IRS-1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with α-phosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that total IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was correspondingly absent or reduced in EN-Δ614 or EN-Y615F cells, respectively (Fig. 3A, middle panel). To confirm that equal levels of IRS-1 were present in each cell line, lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an α-IRS-1 antibody (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). To demonstrate further that EN-Δ614 does not interact with IRS-1, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged IRS-1 and either V5-tagged EN, kinase-dead EN (K380N), or EN-Δ614 constructs. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-V5 antibodies followed by Western blot analysis with α-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3B, a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of ∼180 kDa was only pulled down in EN lysates, the identity of which was confirmed to be IRS-1 by reprobing with α-HA (Fig. 3B) or α-IRS-1 antibodies (data not shown). Equal expression of IRS-1 was confirmed by Western blotting of lysates using α-HA antibodies (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the distal 19 C-terminal amino acids of EN are essential for the interaction of EN with IRS-1 and for the increased total IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation observed in EN-transformed cells.

ShcA adapter proteins are targets of activated tyrosine kinases and are implicated in the transmission of activation signals to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Here we report the identification of an interaction between the adapter protein ShcA and the cytoplasmic domain of Tie2 through in vitro co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Stimulation of endogenous Tie2 in endothelial cells with its ligand angiopoietin-1 increased its association with ShcA and phosphorylation of the adapter protein. The interaction requires the SH2 domain of ShcA and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tie2 as shown by pull-down experiments. Furthermore, Tyr-1101 of Tie2 was identified as the primary binding site for the SH2 domain of ShcA. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ShcA affects angiopoietin-1-induced chemotaxis and sprouting, although it has no effect on survival of endothelial cells. Furthermore, this mutant partially reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between Tie2 with the adapter molecule ShcA and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of migration and three-dimensional organization of endothelial cells induced by angiopoietin-1.

The endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 is thought to be an important modulator of both normal physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis (3Jones N. Iljin K. Dumont D.J. Alitalo K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Tie2 activity is regulated by two naturally occurring secreted ligands.

A second ligand, Ang-2, has a tissue-specific modulatory effect on Tie2 activity. Ang-2 blocks the ability of Ang-1 to activate Tie2 in ECs, but it activates Tie2 expressed in hemangioblast precursor cells or ectopically expressed in fibroblasts (8Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C.

Tyr-1101of Tie2 directly associates in a phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-dependent manner with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which in turn activate PI 3-kinase, leading to cell motility and survival (10Kontos C.D.

Tie2 also binds Dok-R, an adapter molecule structurally homologous to p62dok and insulin-receptor substrate-3 (13Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Dok-R is able to recruit the adapter protein Nck and Ras-GTPase-activating protein. Upstream molecules of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) pathway, Grb2 and Shp2, were also identified as binding partners of Tie2 (11Jones N. Master Z. Jones J. Bouchard D.

Finally, signal transducers and activators of transcription factor-3 and -5 are activated by Tie2 in association with the increased expression of p21 cell cycle inhibitor (15Korpelainen E.I. Karkkainen M. Gunji Y. Vikkula M. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The SH2-containing ShcA proteins are cytoplasmic substrates of RTKs and have been implicated in the transmission of activation signals to Ras proteins (16Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Three Shc genes have been identified in mammals, and their gene products have been referred to as ShcA, ShcB, and ShcC (18Pelicci G. Dente L. De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S.

Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ShcA is ubiquitously expressed, whereas ShcB and ShcC expression appear limited to neuronal cells (18Pelicci G. Dente L. De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sakai R. Henderson J.T. O'Bryan J.P. Elia A.J. Saxton T.M. Pawson T. Neuron. 2000; 28: 819-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ShcA is expressed as three overlapping polypeptides of 46, 52, and 66 kDa that are produced through alternative splicing and differential use of translation initiation sites and differ only in the length of their amino-terminal extensions (16Pelicci G.

Shc proteins possess at their carboxyl terminus an SH2 domain, and toward the amino terminus, these proteins possess a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Following RTK association, Shc proteins become phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues 239, 240, and 317 (22van der Geer P. Wiley S. Lai V.K. Olivier J.P. Gish G.D. Stephens R. Kaplan D. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Gotoh N. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Chida K. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2525-2533PubMed Google Scholar). Both Tyr-239 and Tyr-240 form an optimal binding site for the SH2 domain of the adapter Grb2. The Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos is recruited to this complex through the association with the SH3 domain of Grb2, providing a mechanism through which Shc phosphorylation can lead to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway (24Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Shc can also associate, either directly or via Grb2, with the docking protein Gab1 that in turn binds PI 3-kinase (26Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, ShcA appears to be a scaffold for the assembly of signaling proteins involved in the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway and potentially other signaling pathways. It has been recently shown that ShcA is specifically expressed in the developing cardiovascular system during early embryogenesis (27Lai K.M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of mouse shcA leads to selective defects in vessel organization into a mature vascular network, although the principal vascular progenitors are properly assembled. This is most evident in yolk sac and head vasculature in which vessels are dilated and remain relatively uniform in size. Thus, embryos deficient for ShcA have defects in later stages of vascular patterning that are very similar to those observed in embryos deficient for the Tie2 receptor and its ligand, Ang-1 (28Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Wolburg-Buchholz K. Fujiwara Y. Gendron-Maguire M. Gridley T. Wolburg H. Risau W. Qin Y. Nature. 1995; 376: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 29Suri C.

These data suggest that ShcA may be a target for the Tie2 receptor and may participate in the transduction of the Ang-1 signal in ECs. In this report, we demonstrate that the adapter molecule ShcA is recruited and activated by the Tie2 receptor upon Ang-1 stimulation in ECs. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Shc affects Ang-1-induced migration of sprouting but not survival of ECs. These results suggest the potential role of ShcA in mediating the signaling pathways triggered by the Tie2 receptor that is selectively involved in migration and three-dimensional organization of ECs. Reagents, Cells, and Antibodies—All of the reagents unless specified were purchased from Sigma. ECs from human umbilical veins were prepared and characterized as described previously (30Bussolino F.

They were used at early passages (I-IV). COS7 cells (HTB-14, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and Phoenix Ampho cells (kindly provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) against human Tie2 and the mouse monoclonal Ab (mAb) against and human c-Myc were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pTyr mAb and anti-Vav and anti-p85 Abs were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (Lexington, NY). Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-human ShcA were described previously (16Pelicci G.

Production of recombinant Ang-1 was achieved using a baculovirus expression system as described previously (33Audero E. Cascone I. Zanon I. Previtali S. Piva R. Schiffer D. Bussolino F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 21: 536-541Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the amount of protein in the supernatant was estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards quantified by densitometric analysis (Phoretix 1D, Nonlinear USA Inc, Durham, NC). As control, conditioned medium from Sf9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus (mock) was used. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Confluent ECs (1 × 107 cells/15-cm dish) were made quiescent by 16 h of starvation in M199 containing 0.5% FCS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then stimulated for the indicated period of time at 37 °C. Total protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells with boiling extraction buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4). After centrifugation (20 min, 10,000 × g), supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-Tie2 Ab (1:50) or anti-p85 Ab (1 μg/ml) or with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and mAb anti-Shc (1:100) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, and proteins were solubilized under reducing conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the indicated Abs. The enhanced chemiluminescence technique (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). Isolation of Tie2 cDNA and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Tie2 full-length cDNA was cloned from ECs by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The primers 5′-GTTTTTGAAAGGATCCTTGGGACCTCAT-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCAGTGAGATCTTCACTCCA-3′ were used to amplify the cDNA portion corresponding to the extracellular domain of Tie2 (amino acids 1-631). The primers 5′-GGAGTGAAGATCTCACTGCTTGG-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGGCATGAATTCTCAGCAGT-3′ were used to amplify the cDNA portion corresponding to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (amino acids 632-1125). The two cDNA fragments were reconstructed into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). To generate the carboxyl-terminal mutations, an in vitro oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used. Tie2 cDNAs carrying the appropriate Tyr-Phe mutations were reconstructed in the pCDNA3.1 vector for transient expression in COS7 cells using the DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure (Invitrogen). Pull-down Experiments—GST-ShcSH2 fusion proteins corresponding to ShcA-SH2domain domains was cloned, expressed, and purified exactly as described previously (31Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Casciari C. Giuli S. Pegoraro L. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Arouica M.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 907-917PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins (15 μg) were coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates from COS7 cells (2 × 106 confluent cells) transfected with wild-type or mutant Tie2 cDNAs were incubated with the immobilized GSTs for 90 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm Na3VO4. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were solubilized in boiling Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and immunoblotted with an anti-Tie2 Ab. Retroviral Infection and Immunofluorescence Analysis—SH2 Vav domain (from amino acid 670 to 721) cDNA was cloned from Jurkat T cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The primers 5′-TGGTGCGGCAGAGGGTG-3′ (position 2011-2027 from the ATG) and 3′-GGGGAACTGCAAGGTGGTG-5′ (position 2291-2267) were used to amplify the SH2-cDNA portion corresponding to amino acids 670-721. The cDNAs of ShcASH2 (32Baldari C.T. Pelicci G. Di Somma M.M. Milia E. Giuli S. Pelicci P.G. Telford J.L.

The two transgene domains and green fluorescence protein (GFP) cDNA were under the control of the long terminal repeat and cytomegalovirus promoters, respectively. Amphotropic cell line Phoenix was transfected with PINCO, PINCO-ShcSH2, and PINCO-VavSH2 to produce retroviral supernatant with high viral titer. The virus-containing medium was collected, filtered (0.45-μm filter, Millipore), and supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. ECs at first passage were plated onto 150-mm tissue culture dishes, and culture medium was replaced with the viral supernatant. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and then fresh growing medium was added. After 72 h of infection, cells were analyzed for GFP expression both under fluorescence microscope and through fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS Advantage S. E., BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-c-Myc Ab was performed as described previously (35Primo L. Roca C. Ferrandi C. Lanfrancone L. Bussolino F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Migration Assay—Migration assay was performed as described previously with a modified Boyden chamber technique (30Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M. Bocchietto E. Olivero M. Naldini L. Gaudino G.

Polycarbonate filters (5-μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, Neuroprobe, Pleasanton, CA) were coated with 0.1% gelatin for 30 min at room temperature. Recombinant Ang-1 in M199 supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% FCS was added to the lower compartment of the chamber, and 50 μl of cell suspension (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) in M199 containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% FCS were then seeded in the upper compartment. Checkerboard analysis of the chemotactic response was performed by varying the concentrations of Ang-1 in the upper and lower compartment of the Boyden Chamber (30Bussolino F. Di Renzo M.F. Ziche M.

After 5 h of incubation, filters were removed and cells were fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa solution (Diff-Quick, Baxter Diagnostics, Rome, Italy), and counted from five random high power fields (magnification ×100) in each well. Each experimental point was studied in triplicate. Sprouting Assay—ECs were suspended at a density of 4,000 cells/ml in culture medium containing 20% Methocel stock (12 mg/ml carboxymethylcellulose in M199) and 20% FCS (36Roca C. Primo L. Valdembri D. Cividalli A. Declerck P. Carmeliet P. Gabriele P. Bussolino F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1500-1507PubMed Google Scholar). 800 cells were seeded into non-adherent round bottom 96-well plates (BD Falcon) and cultured overnight at 37 °C. The spheroids were harvested by gently pipetting and centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min. The spheroids were then resuspended in 200 μl of M199 medium containing 40% FCS, 1.2% (v/w) methylcellulose, and the indicated amount of Ang-1. An equal volume of a collagen solution (7 volumes of collagen from rat tail, 1 volume of 10× M199, 1 volume of 0.1 n NaOH, 1 volume of 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.3) was added. Spheroids were then seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, phase-contrast images were captured by using a CCD Hamamatsu ORCA (Hamamatsu Photonics Italia, Arese, Italy) camera linked to an inverted microscope (model DM IRB HC; Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). MTT Assay—ECs were plated on collagen-coated 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight, and then the medium was removed and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Fresh medium containing 0.5% FCS was added, and the cells were starved for 6 h. After starvation, Ang-1 (200 ng/ml) or vascular endothelial growth factor-A165 (20 ng/ml, R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the cells maintained in M199 containing 0.5% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12, 24, and 48 h. Fresh medium with growth factors was added every 24 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml MTT (3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red for 2 h. The formazan product derived from the reduction of the yellow MTT tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial reductases was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 min. Formazan absorbance was assessed at 595 nm in a Bio Assay Reader HTS 7000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (36Roca C. Primo L. Valdembri D. Cividalli A. Declerck P. Carmeliet P. Gabriele P. Bussolino F.

ShcA Binds Tie2 Receptor and Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Ang-1 Stimulation—To examine the signaling properties of Tie2, recombinant Ang-1 was produced in Sf9 insect cell using a baculovirus vector. Ang-1 expressed with this system was functionally active and able to induce Tyr phosphorylation of Tie2, whereas the mock supernatant was ineffective (Fig. 1A). The optimal dose of Ang-1 that activated Tie2 was 200 ng/ml as previously determined (data not shown and Ref. 33Audero E. Cascone I. Zanon I. Previtali S. Piva R. Schiffer D. Bussolino F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 21: 536-541Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was routinely used in the biochemical experiments reported here. A time course experiment performed challenging ECs with this concentration of Ang-1 showed that Tie2 phosphorylation increased as early as 5 min, reached a maximum at 10 min, and then declined (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of Shc proteins is an early event in intracellular signaling in a number of well characterized RTKs (17Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The ability of Ang-1-activated Tie2 to bind and phosphorylate ShcA proteins was investigated in ECs. Serum-starved ECs were incubated with Ang-1 for the indicated period at 37 °C. Tie2 was then immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-ShcA Ab (Fig. 1C, top panel). Association between Tie2 and p52 ShcA was easily detectable at 10 min of stimulation and decreased after 15 min. No association between Tie2 and the p46 and p66 ShcA proteins could be detected, although the cells expressed high amounts of ShcA isoforms (Fig. 1E, right panel). The phosphorylation state of ShcA from control and Ang-1-treated cells was evaluated by Western blotting using an anti-pTyr mAb. As illustrated in Fig. 1C (middle panel), phosphorylation in Tyr residues of p52 Sch associated with Tie2 was evident after 10 min of stimulation with Ang-1 and then drastically reduced after 15 min. In the reverse experiment, lysates of unstimulated and Ang-1-stimulated ECs were incubated with anti-ShcA Ab and the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with an anti-Tie2 Ab. The amount of the receptor co-immunoprecipitated with ShcA increased after 10 min of stimulation with Ang-1 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, immunoprecipitated p52Sch was phosphorylated in Tyr residues in EC stimulated for 10 min by Ang-1 (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that Tie2 activation upon Ang-1 stimulation induces p52 ShcA association with the receptor and its Tyr phosphorylation. Identification of Tie2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites Required for Interaction with SH2 Domain of ShcA—Shc proteins participate in tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated cell activation mainly through the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain that recognizes specific pTyr residues. To investigate whether the SH2 domains of ShcA could directly bind the Tie2 receptor, an in vitro binding experiment was performed using GST-fused Sch-SH2 protein immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with Tie2 cDNA and challenged with Ang-1. The lysates were incubated with the immobilized GSTs and immunoblotted with anti-Tie2 Ab (Fig. 2A). SH2 domain was able to bind Tie2 in response to Ang-1 stimulation, whereas the GST alone did not precipitate the receptor. The carboxyl-terminal tail of Tie2 contains three tyrosine residues (Tyr-1101, Tyr-1107, and Tyr-1112) through which the receptor seems to trigger several cascades of molecular protein-protein interactions (3Jones N. Iljin K. Dumont D.J. Alitalo K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Another Tyr residue (Tyr-815) is present in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor, but its role in Tie2 signal transduction must be still elucidated. To determine the potential binding sites for the SH2 domain of ShcA on Tie2 receptor, we created three Tie2 mutants by mutating the carboxyl-terminal Tyr residues into a Phe residue. These mutants were designed Tie2-Y1101F, Tie2-Y1107F, and Tie2-Y1112F, respectively. Tie2-3F mutant was characterized by mutations in Tyr-1101, Tyr-1107, and Tyr-1112, whereas Tyr-815 was not substituted. This mutant may give indirect indications on the role this Tyr residue. Finally, we created a kinase-dead form of Tie2 (Tie2-K584R) by mutating the Lys-854 in ATP binding site of the kinase domain into an Arg residue (Fig. 2B) (38Dumont D.J. Gradwohl G. Fong G.H. Puri M.C. Gertsenstein M. Auerbach A. Breitman M.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). COS7 cells expressed negligible amount of Tie2, which was not phosphorylated in Tyr residues after Ang-1 stimulation (Fig. 2C). Tie2 constructs were transiently expressed in COS7 cells, and the encoded proteins immunoprecipitated from Ang-1-stimulated cells with anti-Tie2 Ab and immunoblotted with anti-pTyr mAb (Fig. 2C). Basal Tie2 phosphorylation was comparable in wild-type and Tyr-Phe mutants, whereas the K594R mutation completely abrogated the phosphorylation of the receptor. For mapping the ShcA-binding sites, association experiments based on binding of Tie2 receptor mutants with the GST-ShcA-SH2 domain were done (Fig. 2D). The SH2 domain of ShcA was able to bind wild-type Tie2 receptor as well as the single mutants Tie2-Y1107F and Tie2-Y1112F. Binding was lost upon mutation of single Tyr-1101 and for the Tie2-3F (Fig. 2D). Tie2-K584R did not recruit the SH2 Sch domain (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that pTyr-1101 mediates the binding of ShcA to activated Tie2 receptor.

Previous studies suggested that fresh apples inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Here we report that oral administration of apple peel extracts decreased the number of nonmalignant and malignant skin tumors per mouse induced by 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated mouse skin. ESR analysis indicated that apple extract strongly scavenged hydroxyl (OH) and superoxide (O2·-) radicals. Mechanistic studies showed that pretreatment with apple peel extract inhibited AP-1 transactivation induced by ultraviolet B irradiation or TPA in JB6 cells and AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice. This inhibitory effect appears to be mediated by the inhibition of ERKs and JNK activity. The results provide the first evidence that an extract from fresh apple peel extract may inhibit tumor promoter-induced carcinogenesis and associated cell signaling, and suggest that the chemopreventive effects of fresh apple may be through its antioxidant properties by blocking reactive oxygen species-mediated AP-1-MAPK activation.

Chemoprevention has been acknowledged as an important and practical strategy for the management of cancer. Many naturally occurring substances present in the human diet have been identified as potential chemopreventive agents (1Mukhtar H. Ahmad N. Toxicol. Appl.

A previous study (12Eberhardt M.V. Lee C.Y. Liu R.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 903-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 13Wolfe K. Wu X. Liu R.H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003; 51: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) also indicated that whole fresh apple may have antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activity. Whole-apple extracts were shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, and the inhibitory activity could not be attributed solely to the ascorbate content of the apples (12Eberhardt M.V. Lee C.Y. Liu R.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 903-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the consumption of whole fruits may provide the antioxidant balance needed to quench reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in tumorigenesis (14Cao G. Booth S.L. Sadowski J.A. Prior R.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that activator protein-1 (AP-1) plays a critical role in tumor promotion (15Bernstein L.R. Colburn N.H. Science. 1989; 244: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Li J.J. Dong Z. Dawson M.I. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 483-489PubMed Google Scholar). Increased AP-1 activity is associated with malignant transformation and the action of cancer-promoting agents, such as UV radiation, growth factors, and transforming oncogenes (17Adler V. Pincus M.R.

Blocking TPA-induced AP-1 activation has been shown to inhibit neoplastic transformation (19Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study (20Young M.R. Li J.J Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), using transgenic mice, has demonstrated that AP-1 transactivation is required for tumor promotion. To elucidate the mechanism of the antitumorigenic effects of phytochemicals, we studied the effect of apple extract on UVB or TPA-induced AP-1-MAPK activation and neoplastic transformation. Reports focusing on mechanisms for the possible chemopreventive effects of fresh fruits or vegetables are limited. In light of the important roles of ROS and AP-1 activation in tumor promoter-induced transformation and tumor promotion, we hypothesized that the anticarcinogenesis effects of fresh apple may involve the inhibition of AP-1-MAPK activities due to the antioxidant properties of apples. In the present study, we evaluated the potential inhibitory effects of fresh apple extract on DMBA-TPA-induced skin papillomas in the mouse. We also evaluated the effects of these treatments on AP-1-MAPK activation induced by TPA or UV radiation and on neoplastic transformation induced by TPA in JB6 cells. The results of this investigation improve our understanding on the mechanisms by which dietary modulators and nutritional factors may control the production of ROS and result in activation of molecular signals involved in the initiation, promotion, and progression of environmentally induced neoplasia. Positive results would raise the possibility of isolating effective antioxidant compounds from natural foods for application in tumor prevention and treatment. Reagents—Fresh Gala apples were obtained from a local grocery store. Eagle’s minimal essential medium was purchased from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum, gentamicin, and l-glutamine were from Invitrogen assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). PhosphoPlus MAPK Antibody kits were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The spin trap, DMPO, was purchased from Sigma and purified by charcoal decolorization and vacuum distillation. DMPO solution, thus purified, did not contain any ESR-detectable impurities. Chelex 100 chelating resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. The phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was treated with Chelex 100 to remove transition metal ion contaminants. Preparation of Apple Extract—Fresh apple extract was prepared from Gala apples by adding 1 ml of distilled water per g of peeled skin or flesh and blending at high speed. The blended homogenate was strained, centrifuged, and filter-sterilized. The extracts were then aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. Cell Culture—The mouse JB6/AP/κB cell line, which was stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (18Lamb R.F. Hennigan R.F. Turnbull K. Katsanakis K.D. MacKenzie E.D. Birnie G.D. Ozanne B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg of gentamicin/ml. Assay of AP-1 Activity in Vitro and in Vivo—A confluent monolayer of JB6/AP/κB cells was trypsinized, and 5 × 104 viable cells were seeded to each well of a 24-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Twelve hours later, cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 12-24 h to minimize basal AP-1 activity. The cells were then pretreated with apple extract for 2 h followed by exposure to TPA (20 nm) or UVB radiation (4 kJ/m2) for 24 h to monitor the effects on AP-1 induction. Luciferase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay kit obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) as described previously (21Ding M. Shi X.L. Dong Z.G. Chen F. Lu Y.J. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The in vivo effect of apple peel extract was explored by using AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice. The mice were given apple peel extract to drink (ad libitum), and the dorsal skin was also treated topically with apple peel extracts six times, over a period of 6 days. On the 4th day of treatment the mice were topically exposed to TPA (5 μg in 0.2 ml acetone) or UVB irradiation (10 kJ/m2). The luciferase activities were measured using dorsal skin punch biopsy samples as described previously (22Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, the skin tissues were biopsied by a 1.5-mm Biopsy Punch (Acuderm Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL) after exposure. The tissues will be dissolved in lysis buffer (from the luciferase assay kit provided by Promega) at 4 °C for 12 h, and the luciferase activity in the supernatant was measured. Protein Kinase Phosphorylation Assay—Immunoblots for phosphorylation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase were carried out as described in the protocol from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), using phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase. Non-phospho-specific antibodies provided in each assay kit were used to normalize the phosphorylation assay by using the same transferred membrane blot. ESR Measurements—All ESR measurements were conducted using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly. Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using K3CrO8 and DPPH as reference standards. An EPRDAP 2.0 program was used for data acquisitions and analysis. The scavenging ability of apple extract for ·OH and O2·- radicals was measured by ESR using DMPO as the spin trap according to the method described previously (24Janzen E.G. Blackburn B.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 5909-5911Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 25Shi X. Dalal N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Shi X. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ·OH radicals were generated using a Fenton reaction (Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH + ·OH), and O2·- radicals were generated by the reaction between xanthine and xanthine oxidase. Reactants were mixed in test tubes in a final volume of 450 μl. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. The concentrations given in the figure legends are final concentrations. All experiments were performed at room temperature and under ambient air except those specifically indicated. Animals and Two-stage Skin Carcinogenesis—AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice (C57BL/6 crossed with DBA2) were obtained from the University of Minnesota. The mice were originally established by Rincon and Flavell and have been described previously (22Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mice were housed in plastic filter-top cages on corncob bedding, provided autoclaved tap water, and Prolab 3500 fed ad libitum. Both male and female mice (6-9 weeks old) were used, in groups numbering 19-24. The mice in the experimental group were given apple peel extract to drink (ad libitum) 2 days before initiation treatment, and this oral treatment was continued for the duration of the experiment. The negative and positive control groups were given regular water. Dorsal skin of the mice was shaved, and 2 days later a single dose of 400 nmol of DMBA dissolved in 300 μl of acetone was applied. Fourteen days following initiation, the mice (except the negative control group) were promoted by dermal exposure to 17 nmol of TPA in 300 μl of acetone twice a week for 20 weeks. The negative control group was treated with acetone only. The incidence of papillomas was detected by palpation, and the number of papillomas appearing on each mouse was recorded once a week. At the end of the experiment, all the animals were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (6.5 mg/mouse). For histopathology, the largest tumors were removed and fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde followed by paraffin embedding and subjected to pathologic studies. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of n experiments as noted in the figure legends. Significant differences were determined using the Student’s t test. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Inhibition of Papillomagenesis and Malignant Transformation by Fresh Apple Peel Extract—To study the chemopreventive activity of phytocompounds, the antitumorigenic effects of fresh apple were evaluated using experimental animals. In the mouse skin model, initiation can occur as a result of a single dose of DMBA that mutationally activates H-ras (27Balmain A. Pragnell I.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Promotion can be induced by repeated treatment with the tumor promoter TPA (28Naito M. Chenicek K.J. Naito Y. DiGiovanni J. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 4: 639-645Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mice bearing the luciferase reporter gene were subjected to DMBA initiation-TPA promotion. Fourteen days following initiation, the dorsal skin of the mice was exposed to TPA to cause promotion. Oral administration of apple peel extract was started 2 days before DMBA treatment and continued for the duration of the experiment. The incidences of papillomas generation are shown in Fig. 1. DMBA initiation-TPA promotion induced papillomas is an exposure-dependent lesion. Treatment of the mice with apple extract decreased the tumors per mouse at all exposure times. These differences between the apple versus non-apple groups were significant at 16 weeks after promotion. The maximum number of papillomas after 20 weeks of TPA exposure in the apple-treated mice was 5.8 ± 1.8 per mouse compared with 12.8 ± 3.65 papillomas per mouse in the positive control group, indicating a greater than 50% inhibition of papillomagenesis by oral ingestion of apple peel extract. Two representative mice from each group showing the greatest number of papillomas are shown in Fig. 2. Tumors in the positive control group grew rapidly and were well vascularized, whereas tumors in the apple-treated group appeared growth-arrested and desiccated. The percentage of mice developing tumors was similar in both groups (data not shown).Fig. 2External appearance of tumors. Skin tumors were generated by DMBA and TPA treatment. A, two mice from the positive control group showing the greatest number of tumors; B, two mice from the apple-treated group showing the greatest number of tumors. Arrows indicated tumors greater than 4 mm in diameter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to differences in the number of tumors, we found that tumor size was significantly greater in the positive control mice compared with the apple peel extract-treated mice. At the end of the experiment, there were six tumors greater than 4 mm in diameter (arrows in Fig. 2A) in the positive control group, whereas no large tumors were found in the apple-treated mice (Fig. 2B). Malignant lesions grew rapidly and appeared ulcerated. Representative histologies of typical squamous cell carcinoma from the positive control group and squamous papillomas from the apple-treated group are shown in Fig. 3. At the end of the experiment, six tumors (2.6% in a total of 228 lesion) became malignant in the positive control mice, whereas none became malignant in the apple-treated group, suggesting that fresh apple played an important role in preventing malignant conversion. Scavenging of ·OH and O2·- Radicals by Fresh Apple Peel Extract—To study the potential antitumor mechanisms of fresh apple, ESR was utilized to measured the ability of apple peel extract to scavenge ·OH and O2·- radicals. As shown in Fig. 4A, ·OH radicals, generated by the Fenton reaction, were inhibited by addition of apple peel extract in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, a-e). An increase in concentration of the extract was associated with a concomitant increase of ascorbic acid-derived radical signals as indicated by asterisks. Addition of ascorbic acid also inhibited the DMPO/·OH signals (Fig. 4A, f). Comparing Fig. 4A, c and f, the inhibition of the DMPO/·OH signals was similar, but the ascorbic acid-derived signal in f was seven times greater than that in c. Furthermore, the amount of ascorbic acid-derived signal in Fig. 4A, d and e, was smaller than that in f, even though the potency of the ·OH scavenging effect in d and e was much stronger with apple extract than that in f for ascorbic acid. These data suggest that ascorbic acid in apple peel extract plays only a partial role in the ·OH scavenging capacity of apple extract. Fig. 4B, a, illustrates the DMPO/O2·- signal spectra generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase. Apple peel extract exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of O2·- radicals (Fig. 4B, b-e). Inhibition of AP-1 Activity by Apple Extract—Because ROS are involved in AP-1 activation, and AP-1 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis induced by tumor promoters (20Young M.R. Li J.J Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 29Ding M. Shi X. Lu Y. Huang C. Leonard S. Roberts J. Antonini J. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9108-9114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to study the effects of apple peel extract on AP-1 activation. For in vitro studies, we used a mouse epidermal cell line, JB6 P+ cells, stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (19Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of JB6 cells with various dilutions of apple extract produced a dose-dependent decrease in AP-1 activity induced by either UVB irradiation or TPA (Fig. 5, a and b). To determine whether apple peel extract had any effects on cell proliferation or apoptosis or a combination of both, serial dilutions of apple extracts from 1:10 to 1:500 were used to study the effect of apple peel extract on cell proliferation and apoptosis using [3H]thymidine incorporation and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assays. No significant differences were detected (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity was not attributed to a generalized inhibition of cell growth. The in vivo effect of apple peel extract was explored using AP-1-luciferase reporter transgenic mice (26Shi X. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mice were given apple peel extract to drink, and the dorsal skin of the mice was treated topically with apple extract and then exposed to TPA or UVB irradiation. The luciferase activities were measured on dorsal skin punch biopsy samples. The apple peel extract significantly inhibited UVB-induced AP-1 activation at 24 h (Fig. 6a) and TPA-induced AP-1 activation at 72 h post-exposure (Fig. 6b). To rule out the possibility that the effect of apple extract may be due to blocking of UV radiation, we measured absorbance of UV light by apple extract and found no significant differences in absorption of UV light even at a 1:10 dilution (data not shown). Effects of Apple Extract on UVB- or TPA-induced MAPK Activation—It is well known that UV irradiation results in activation of MAP kinases belonging to ERKs, JNKs, and p38 families, whereas TPA mainly activates ERKs (30Kyriakis J.M.

Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar-40). Therefore, we investigated the effect of apple peel extract on UVB- or TPA-induced MAP kinase activity by assessing the phosphorylation of the three MAPK family members. We found that pretreatment of epidermal cells with apple peel extract blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinase family members ERKs and JNK (not p38) (Fig. 7a), as well as TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERKs (Fig. 7b), in a dose-dependent manner. Fresh Apple Extract Inhibited TPA-induced Transformation—Previous studies (19Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 20Young M.R. Li J.J Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) using cell culture and transgenic animals indicate that AP-1 activation plays an important role in tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation. We hypothesized that one of the important anticarcinogenesis mechanisms of apples may be by suppressing tumor promotion. Therefore, we tested the effect of apple extracts on TPA-induced cellular transformation. These studies were conducted on a JB6 cells model using soft agar assays (Fig. 8). Apple peel extract inhibited TPA-induced neoplastic transformation in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that blocking of cell transformation by apple peel extract might be through the inhibition of AP-1 transactivation. The most effective way to prevent disease is to understand the cause of an illness and then change the conditions that permit it to occur. Recent evidence has shown the importance of nutrition in delaying the aging process and in protecting against many degenerative and chronic diseases (1Mukhtar H. Ahmad N. Toxicol. Appl.

A wide variety of phenolic compounds present in fruits and vegetables have been reported to possess anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activity. In this study, we present evidence that oral administration of fresh apple extract inhibits the formation of keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas in the mouse skin model. The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of oral administration of apple extract on tumorigenesis appears to be via free radical scavenging action and an inhibition of AP-1-MAPK signaling. We found that fresh apple peel extract was a potent scavenger of ·OH and O2·- radicals. It also inhibited AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of MAP kinase induced by UV irradiation or TPA stimulation in an epidermal cell line and transgenic animals. Apple peel extract also blocked tumor promoter TPA-induced neoplastic transformation in cell culture. Earlier studies reported that fresh apple can inhibit cancer cell proliferation (11Lu Y.P. Lou Y.R. Xie J.G. Peng Q.Y. Liao J. Yang C.S. Huang M.T. Conney A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12455-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The results of the present study provide further insights into mechanisms of chemoprevention by anti-oxidants in fresh apples. Reactive oxygen species are generated as by-products of cellular metabolism, primarily in the mitochondria. Because ROS are partially reduced products of oxygen, they have a high chemical reactivity with a wide range of bio-macromolecules leading to lipid peroxidation and oxidation of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Because of this reactivity, oxidative stress is thought to play an important contributory role in the pathogenesis of numerous degenerative and chronic diseases, including cancer. Our study indicates that fresh apple extract is a potent scavenger of free radicals examined by ESR, including ·OH and O2·- radicals, and that ascorbic acid contained in the apple peel extract plays only a partial role in this scavenging effect. These results suggest that the antioxidant effects of fresh apples might play an important role in preventing or retarding environmentally induced oxidative damage and oxidant-induced diseases. AP-1 is a transcription factor that is composed of Jun and Fos protein family members. AP-1 has been implicated in tumor promotion because of its ability to alter gene expression in response to tumor promoters, such as epidermal growth factor, TPA, or UV irradiation. Inhibition of AP-1 activation by a variety of agents has been shown to reduce neoplastic transformation (19Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies in transgenic mice indicate that AP-1 transactivation is required for tumor promotion (20Young M.R. Li J.J Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The blockade of TPA-induced cell transformation by apple extract might be through the inhibition of AP-1 activity. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of apple extract on AP-1 activation noted in this study may have a beneficial role in preventing carcinogenesis in vivo. Studies indicate that ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase are key molecules activated in response to oxidant injury. Both UVB and TPA can induce ROS generation in cells (29Ding M. Shi X. Lu Y. Huang C.

AP-1 is a downstream target of these three MAP kinases. We found that apple peel extract could scavenge ·OH and O2·- radicals and inhibit UVB-induced phosphorylation of ERKs and JNKs but not p38 and TPA-induced ERKs. These observations suggest that blocking UVB- and TPA-induced AP-1-MAPK activation with apple peel extract may be due to its antioxidant properties. Administration of fruits or vegetables to animals has been shown to inhibit chemically induced carcinogenesis in many animal models (37Carlton P.S. Kresty L.A. Stoner G.D. Cancer Lett. 2000; 159: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Kresty L.A. Morse M.A. Morgan C. Carlton P.S. Lu J. Gupta A. Blackwood M. Stoner G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6112-6119PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of fresh apple peel extract on TPA- or UVB-induced AP-1-MAPK signaling suggests that these pathways may be a unifying mechanism by which apples inhibit carcinogenesis and tumor growth. Thus, in this study, we further elucidate the mechanisms by which phytochemicals may prevent carcinogenesis. Apple peel extracts inhibited AP-1 activation both in vivo and in vitro, possibly by interfering with signal transduction events involving MAP kinases, ERKs and JNK. Cell transformation studies show that apple peel extract also inhibited TPA-induced cell transformation. These studies open a promising area of investigation in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of phytochemicals on health. We thank Dr. M. Rao for critical discussion of this manuscript and Dr. L. Millecchia for help in taking pictures of soft agar analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2031259972,"The Schizosaccharomyces pombe fep1+ gene encodes a GATA transcription factor that represses the expression of iron transport genes in response to elevated iron concentrations. This transcriptional response is altered only in strains harboring a combined deletion of both tup11+ and tup12+ genes. This suggests that Tup11 is capable of negatively regulating iron transport gene expression in the absence of Tup12 and vice versa. The tup11+- and tup12+-encoded proteins resemble the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tup1 corepressor. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis we show that Tup11 and Fep1 physically interact with each other. The C-terminal region from amino acids 242 to 564 of Fep1 is required for interaction with Tup11. Within this region, a minimal domain encompassing amino acids 405-541 was sufficient for Tup11-Fep1 association. Deletion mapping analysis revealed that the WD40-repeat sequence motifs of Tup11 are necessary for its interaction with Fep1. Analysis of Tup11 mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the WD40 repeats suggested that the Fep1 transcription factor interacts with a putative flat upper surface on the predicted β-propeller structure of this motif. Further analysis by in vivo coimmunoprecipitation showed that Tup11 and Fep1 are physically associated. In vitro pull-down experiments further verified a direct interaction between the Fep1 C terminus and the Tup11 C-terminal WD40 repeat domain. Taken together, these results describe the first example of a physical interaction between a corepressor and an iron-sensing factor controlling the expression of iron uptake genes.

Taken together, these results describe the first example of a physical interaction between a corepressor and an iron-sensing factor controlling the expression of iron uptake genes. Iron is required for a number of biological functions in most life forms, from microbes to mammals (1Kaplan J. Cell. 2002; 111: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because its chemistry allows a reversible one-electron oxidation-reduction reaction, iron plays a crucial role in electron-transfer reactions (3Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the redox active nature of iron can make it toxic due to its ability to unleash highly reactive species in the presence of oxygen that can damage biological cellular components (4Touati D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because of its essential but toxic nature, highly regulated homeostatic controls have evolved across different species in order to maintain intracellular concentration of iron at levels needed for essential biochemical processes while preventing its accumulation to toxic levels (5Kaplan J. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although iron is an abundant transition metal on earth, under aerobic conditions, it is usually present as insoluble ferric hydroxides (6Boukhalfa H. Crumbliss A.L. Biometals. 2002; 15: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Because of its low bioavailability, organisms have developed a variety of mechanisms for iron acquisition including secretion and utilization of siderophores, ferrireductase activity at the cell surface, and heme-iron introduction inside the cell (7Rutherford J.C.

In the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two pathways for iron uptake have been identified (11Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first one consists of a siderophore-iron transport system. Although S. pombe does not produce siderophores, the fission yeast can utilize siderophore-bound iron complexes produced by other microorganisms using three transmembrane proteins, Str1, Str2, and potentially Str3 (11Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Of these three siderophore transporters, Str1 exhibits specificity for ferrichrome-iron, while Str2 is specific for ferroxiamine B-iron and to a lesser extent ferrichrome-iron. Although Str3 may participate in the mobilization of iron bound to siderophores, its substrate specificity has not been determined (11Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The second pathway for iron assimilation in S. pombe involves three components, Frp1, Fio1, and Fip1 (12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Frp1 protein reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ at the cell surface, rendering iron accessible to iron-binding extracellular ligands found in the iron-transport proteins in the plasma membrane (13Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Dancis A. J. Pediatr. 1998; 132 (part 2): S24-S29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once reduced, iron is transported by two high affinity iron uptake proteins encoded by the fio1+ and fip1+ genes (12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Fio1 protein is a multicopper ferroxidase that converts Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is then transported by Fip1, a transmembrane iron permease (12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The frp1+, fio1+, and fip1+ genes are regulated by the cellular need for iron. When cells are grown under iron-deficient conditions, frp1+, fio1+, and fip1+ mRNA levels are induced. In contrast, iron-replete conditions repress the expression of these genes (12Askwith C.

As expected, str1+, str2+, and str3+ gene expression is up-regulated under conditions of iron starvation and down-regulated under conditions of iron repletion (11Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Philpott C.C. Labbé S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

The N-terminal region of Fep1 is highly similar to the N-terminal regions of the Urbs1, SREA, and SRE proteins that have been shown to negatively regulate, in an iron-dependent manner the siderophore biosynthesis pathways of Ustilago maydis, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa, respectively (17Oberegger H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This region of Fep1 harbors two consensus GATA-type zinc finger motifs that has been shown to be required for DNA binding to the consensus sequence 5′-(A/T)GATAA-3′ (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, Fep1 is related to a family of GATA-type transcription factors (23Scazzocchio C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutant fission yeast strain with deletions in both tup11+ and tup12+ genes exhibited a fio1+ gene expression that was highly derepressed and unresponsive to repression by iron (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Elimination of either Tup11 or Tup12 alone was not sufficient to annihilate the iron-mediated repression of fio1+ (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, tup11+ and tup12+, known to encode transcriptional corepressors, are functionally redundant in down-regulating the expression of the iron transport genes. Recent work has demonstrated that Tup11 assembles with itself or the Tup12 protein (24Greenall A. Hadcroft A.P. Malakasi P. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Hoffman C.S. Whitehall S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The S. pombe Tup11 and Tup12 proteins exhibit 39.9 and 43.5% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tup1, respectively (25Janoo R.T.K. Neely L.A. Braun B.R. Whitehall S.K. Hoffman C.S. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the extended homology of Tup11 and Tup12 to Tup1, putative functional domains have been designated for the Tup1 homologues in S. pombe (26Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 70 and 87 amino acids of the S. pombe Tup11 and Tup12 proteins, respectively, bear homology to a similar region in Tup1 that is known to interact with Ssn6. Like Tup1, both Tup11 and Tup12 contain a homologous region located in the middle part of their N-terminal halves that is required for interaction with histones H3 and H4. Consistent with this observation, it has been shown that Tup11 associates with histones H3 and H4 of S. cerevisiae in vitro (26Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Within their C termini, Tup11 and Tup12 contain seven copies of a repeated amino acid motif, named WD40 repeat (27Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), found in Tup1 and other Tup1-like corepressors as well as in other proteins that are unlinked to transcription like the β-subunit of the trimeric G-proteins (28Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray crystal structures of three proteins with seven WD40 repeats, including the Tup1 corepressor, each repeat folds into four antiparallel β strands, forming a blade structure (29Pickles L.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Each WD40 repeat unit is interconnected to the other by a loop to form a seven-bladed β-propeller, structure that is highly symmetrical and assumes an overall donut shape (29Pickles L.M. Roe S.M. Hemingway E.J. Stifani S. Pearl L.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Sprague E.R. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Wolberger C.

Although biochemical data has shown that the sides of the β-propeller are capable of establishing protein-protein contacts, the flat upper surface has been shown to bind to some proteins (30Steele M.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that S. cerevisiae Tup1 and Ssn6 proteins physically interact in vivo to form a corepressor complex (33Williams F.E. Varanasi U. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Tup1 forms a tetramer with one Ssn6 molecule (34Varanasi U.S. Klis M. Mikesell P.B. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6707-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex is incapable of binding to DNA, it is attracted to the regulatory regions of different genes by interacting with transcription factors that function in specific metabolic pathways (28Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A number of potential mechanisms by which the Ssn6-Tup1 complex can repress gene expression have been described (28Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). First, upon location to the target promoter, the corepressor complex may inhibit the activities of the basal transcription factors that activate gene expression through the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (35Papamichos-Chronakis M. Conlan R.S. Gounalaki N. Copf T. Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8397-8403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Second, the Ssn6-Tup1 may promote the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (36Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Third, the formation of a complex between Tup1 and the mRNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1 may abrogate mRNA stability and translation through the association of Tup1 with the mRNA capping enzyme (38Mukai Y. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18895-18901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based on our previous findings that the S. pombe Tup11 protein has the potential to regulate the expression of the fio1+ iron transport gene (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we sought to determine its ability to interact with the iron-sensing DNA-binding repressor Fep1. Using two-hybrid analysis, we demonstrate that Tup11 interacts with the C-terminal region of Fep1, but not with the two adjacent zinc fingers in the N-terminal region. The WD40-repeat domain in Tup11 is necessary for its interaction with Fep1. In addition, we showed that the amino acid residues Tyr362 and Leu542, located on the same surface of the predicted β-propeller structure of the Tup11 WD40 repeats, are critical for the Tup11-Fep1 interaction. When coexpressed in fission yeast, the Tup11 and Fep1 proteins were detected in a heteroprotein complex by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, in vitro protein binding analysis using fusion proteins that were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli revealed that the Tup11 and Fep1 C-terminal regions directly interact with each other. Taken together, our findings indicate that Tup11 and Fep1 are components of a heteromeric complex that is required for transcriptional down-regulation of genes that are critical for iron acquisition in fission yeast. Yeast Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strain L40 (Matahis3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (39Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) was used for two-hybrid analysis. When plasmid selection was required, the L40 strain was grown in synthetic complete (SC) medium minus the indicated nutrients (40Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). For routine growth, yeast extract (1%), bactopeptone (2%), dextrose (2%) (YPD) medium was used (41Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The wild-type S. pombe strain used in this study was JY741 (h- leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210) (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The fission yeast strain was maintained on yeast extract plus supplement (YES) medium (42Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Under selective conditions, S. pombe cells were grown on Edinburgh minimal medium lacking specific nutrients required for plasmid selection (43Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Iron starvation or iron repletion was performed by adding the indicated amount of bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (BPS) or FeCl3 to cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase (OD600 nm ∼ 1.0). At this mid-logarithmic phase, cells were treated for 90 min at 30 °C. Subsequent to treatment, 20-ml samples were withdrawn from the cultures for steady-state mRNA or protein analyses (16Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 44Beaudoin J. Mercier A. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14565-14577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Plasmids—To generate the LexA-tup11+codons1-614 plasmid, the full-length tup11+ gene was isolated by PCR using primers that corresponded to the start and stop regions. The tup11+ gene was amplified from the plasmid pBTM-tup11 (26Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Mukai Y. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18895-18901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The PCR product obtained was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript SK. Once sequenced to verify that no DNA sequence alterations were present, the tup11+ gene was cloned into the BamHI and PstI sites of pLexN-a (45Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 29-42Google Scholar) to produce pLexA-tup11+codons1-614. Plasmids pLexA-tup11+codons1-92, pLexA-tup11+codons1-301, and pLexA-tup11+codons1-356 were created by a similar strategy, except that only the first 92, 301, and 356 codons of tup11+ were isolated by PCR. Likewise, the wild-type tup11+ codons 69-301, 69-356, 69-614, and 301-356 were isolated by PCR and cloned downstream of and in-frame to the lexA gene, creating the pLexA-tup11+codons69-301, pLexA-tup11+codons69-356, pLexA-tup11+codons69-614, and pLexA-tup11+codons301-356 plasmids. Chimeric plasmids containing the first 211 codons of lexA fused to the tup11+codons 134 through 614, tup11+codons 192 through 614, tup11+codons 245 through 614, tup11+codons 267 through 614, or tup11+codons 284 through 614 were also created and designated pLexA-tup11+codons134-614, pLexA-tup11+codons192-614, pLexA-tup11+codons245-614, pLexA-tup11+-codons267-614, and pLexA-tup11+codons284-614, respectively. Using pLexA-tup11+codons1-614, the mutations Tyr362 → Cys and Leu542 → Ser were created by the overlap extension method (46Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the 1845-bp BamHI-PstI fragment from each respective PCR-amplified fragment was used to replace the equivalent fragment from plasmid pLexA-tup11+codons1-614 to produce the pLexA-Tup11 Tyr362 → Cys and pLexA-Tup11 Leu542 → Ser mutant plasmids. The DNA sequence of the BamHI-PstI fragment from each respective mutant was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. To create the prey plasmids, pVP16-fep1+codons2-564, pVP16-fep1+codons242-564, pVP16fep1+-codons319-564, pVP16-fep1+codons360-564, pVP16-fep1+codons390-564, pVP16-fep1+codons405-564, and pVP16-fep1+codons432-564, BamHI-NotI fragments of the fep1+ gene containing different 5′-termini relative to the start codon of the gene but all extending through the stop codon were inserted into pVP16. Likewise, the fep1+codons 2-281 were amplified by PCR, purified, and inserted in-frame into pVP16, producing the pVP16-fep1+codons2-281 plasmid. Plasmids pVP16-fep1+codons242-457, pVP16-fep1+codons319-457, pVP16-fep1+-codons360-457, pVP16-fep1+codons360-491, pVP16-fep1+codons360-541, and pVP16-fep1+codons405-541 contained the wild-type fep1+ C-terminal codons 242-457, 319-457, 360-457, 360-491, 360-541, and 405-541, respectively. All six plasmids contained these fep1+ sequences cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pVP16. Two-hybrid Analysis—To study the association between Tup11 and Fep1, the complete or truncated versions of the tup11+ open reading frame were inserted downstream of and in-frame to the E. coli lexA gene as bait. The prey plasmid, pVP16 (45Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 29-42Google Scholar, 47Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), contains the VP16 acidic activation domain followed by a polylinker in which different fragments of the fep1+ gene were introduced. Each L40 transformant strain harboring the indicated bait and prey plasmids was tested for the interaction of the two fusion proteins using previously described standard procedures (48Fashena S.J. Serebriiskii I.G. Golemis E.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 328: 14-26Google Scholar). For quantitative measurements, β-galactosidase activity was determined using early logarithmic phase cultures (OD600 nm of ∼0.5) of yeast cells transformed with the indicated plasmids. 4-ml samples were withdrawn from the cultures, and the cells were harvested, washed with sterile water, and resuspended in 700 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The cells were permeabilized by adding 50 μl of chloroform and 50 μl of 0.1% SDS. After the cell suspension was vortex-mixed for 10 s, 200 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to each sample. Following a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, 350 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 was added to stop the reactions. After clarification by centrifugation at 4 °C, the A420 nm was measured within the linear response range and expressed in standard units (49Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Values shown are the average of triplicate assays of three independent transformants. In addition to liquid β-galactosidase assays, a riboprobe derived from the plasmid pKSlacZ (50Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the steady-state levels of lacZ mRNAs from the integrated (lexAop)8-lacZ reporter construct in the L40 strain. Total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method as described previously (51Köhrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). RNase protection analyses were carried out as described previously (52Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pKSACT1 (50Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) to probe ACT1 mRNA as an internal control. For protein expression analysis of the LexA-Tup11 and VP16-Fep1 fusion protein derivatives, and PGK, the following antisera were used for immunodetection: monoclonal anti-LexA antibody 2-12; monoclonal anti-VP16 antibody 1-21 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and monoclonal anti-PGK antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Protein Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—To determine whether Fep1 interacts with Tup11 in fission yeast cells, plasmid pNTAP-fep1+codons2-564 was constructed as follows. The fragment containing the fep1+ gene (codons 2-564) was isolated by PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), purified, and cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pREP1-NTAP (53Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNTAP-fep1+codons319-564 was generated by using a similar approach, except that the DNA fragment harboring the fep1+ gene corresponded to codons 319 through 564. Plasmid pGST-tup11+ containing the full-length S. pombe tup11+ gene fused downstream of and in-frame to the GST coding region was created by inserting a BamHI-SacI fragment encompassing the entire coding sequence of the tup11+ gene into the corresponding sites of pAAUGST (54Gilbreth M. Yang P.R. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R.A. Kansra S. Gadiraju R. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14781-14786Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The coding region of the tup11+ gene that contains either the mutation Tyr362 → Cys or Leu542 → Ser was also swapped for an identical DNA region into the pGST-tup11+ plasmid, creating pGST-tup11Tyr362 → Cys and pGST-tup11Leu542 → Ser. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, JY741 cells were co-transformed with pGST-tup11+ or mutant derivatives or pAAUGST, and pNTAP-fep1+codons2-564, or"

The establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin is regulated not only by genetic elements but also by epigenetic elements that include histone tail modification (e.g. acetylation and methylation) and DNA methylation. Here we show that the p33ING1-Sin3-HDAC complex as well as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) are components of a pathway required for maintaining proper histone modification and heterochromatin protein 1 binding at the pericentric heterochromatin. p33ING1 and DMAP1 interact physically and co-localize to heterochromatin in the late S phase, and both are required for heterochromatin protein 1 binding to heterochromatin. Although the p33ING1-Sin3-HDAC and DMAP1-DNMT1 complexes are recruited independently to pericentric heterochromatin regions, they are both required for deacetylation of histones and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. These data support a cooperative model for histone deacetylation, methylation, and DNA methylation in maintaining pericentric heterochromatin structure throughout cell divisions.

These data support a cooperative model for histone deacetylation, methylation, and DNA methylation in maintaining pericentric heterochromatin structure throughout cell divisions. Heterochromatin is that portion of the genome that generally remains condensed throughout the cell cycle and replicates late in the S phase because of its unique, higher order chromatin structure. Heterochromatic DNA is predominantly present in the centromeric and telomeric regions of the chromosome that are composed of repetitive DNA sequence elements. In general, heterochromatic DNA sequences are heavily methylated on cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides. It is suggested that the chief DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 1The abbreviations used are: DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; HDAC, histone deacetylase; DMAP1, DNMT1-associated protein 1; ING1, inhibitor of growth family 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siGFP, small interfering green fluorescence protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA.1The abbreviations used are: DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; HDAC, histone deacetylase; DMAP1, DNMT1-associated protein 1; ING1, inhibitor of growth family 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siGFP, small interfering green fluorescence protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is important for the maintenance of DNA methylation in mammalian cells (1Rhee I.

In addition to methylated DNA, histones are found to be hypoacetylated and hypermethylated at heterochromatin. These distinct covalent modifications are thought to be important for heterochromatin structure and function and are faithfully transmitted to daughter cells during cell division (3Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar).Among the enzymes that modify histone tails, the histone methyltransferase Suv39h was found to be specifically required for maintaining pericentric heterochromatin structure and genome stability (4Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Methylation of histone H3K9 creates binding sites for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (5Bannister A.J.

Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar), a marker of heterochromatin that is thought to reinforce the structure of heterochromatin. Loss of Suv39h leads to delocalization of HP1 from the pericentric heterochromatin (4Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). On the other hand, prolonged treatment of cells with trichostatin A, a general histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, also disrupts the normal localization pattern of HP1 (7Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), suggesting that the localization of HP1 to heterochromatin also requires histone deacetylase activity to maintain histone hypoacetylation at pericentric heterochromatin. It remains unknown, however, which of the many HDAC complexes in the cell is responsible for such an effect.DNMT1 may provide a functional link between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation because DNMT1 was reported to interact and co-localize with HDAC2 at replication foci in the late S phase when heterochromatin was replicated (8Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown how HDAC2 is targeted to DNMT1 and the late replication foci, whereas DNMT1 and DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) interact and co-localize to DNA replication foci throughout the S phase. This discrepancy raises the possibility that other factors may be involved in targeting HDAC activity specifically to heterochromatin during heterochromatin duplication in the late S phase.In this paper we report the components of a pathway that maintain histone modification for HP1 binding. We find that the candidate tumor suppressor p33 inhibitor of growth family 1 (ING1) complex, which includes the core Sin3-HDAC1/2 complex, physically and functionally interacts with the DNMT1-DMAP1 complex to maintain histone hypoacetylation and methylation of histone H3 of K9 at pericentric heterochromatin during cell division in human cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Antibodies, Plasmids, and Transfections—293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The stable HeLa cell line expressing FLAG-DMAP1 was cultured in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin. The M2 anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. Anti-acetyl-histone H3, H4, and anti-dimethyl-histone H3K9 antibodies were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Anti-trimethyl-histone H3K9 antibody was described previously (9Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S. Huskisson N. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Wu R. Gilbert D.M. Shi W. Fundele R. Morrison H. Jeppesen P. Singh P.B. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2002; 111: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The DNMT1 monoclonal antibody was from Imgenex. Anti-Sin3 and proliferation cell nuclear antigen antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HP1α and anti-HP1β antibodies were from Chemicon International. The M31 anti-HP1β rat antibody was from Serotec. Rabbit ING1 and DMAP1 antibodies were raised against bacterially produced His-ING1 and GST-DMAP1 (Bethyl Laboratories) and affinity-purified.ING1 and DMAP1 were cloned into pET or pGEX4T-1 vectors and were expressed as His6 or GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3). For transient transfection in 293T cells, ING1 was cloned into a pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech Laboratories), and FLAG-DMAP1 was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen).Transient transfection of GFP-ING1 and FLAG-DMAP1 in 293T cells was carried out with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. To establish the FLAG-DMAP1-stable cell line, FLAG-DMAP1 was cloned into a pBabe vector and then transfected into PT67 cells for a retrovirus particle package. The virus-containing medium was used for HeLa cell transduction.In Vitro Pull-down Assay, Immunoprecipitation, Mass Spectrometry, and Cell Cycle Synchronization—An in vitro pull-down assay was performed using Sepharose-immobilized His6-ING1 or GST-ING1 to pull down interacting proteins from HeLa nuclear extract, or DMAP1 translated in vitro (TnT, Promega). Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, protein identification with mass spectrometry, and immunostaining were described previously (10Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For cell cycle synchronization, cells were first blocked in mitosis using 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. Mitotic cells were collected by mitotic shake-off, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in medium containing 80 μg/ml mimosine to block cells at the G1/S boundary. Twelve hours later, cells were released into fresh medium to allow entry into the S phase, and cells were collected at different times.RNA Interference—The siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research and prepared by annealing two 21-ribonucleotide oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. The sequences targeting each gene were ING1, 5′-AAGGAGCUAGACGAGUGCUAC-3′; Sin3, 5′-AAGCAGUGUCUGAGACCAUGC-3′; DMAP1, 5′-AAGUCUAUGCCUUGCUCUACU-3′; and DNMT1, 5′-AACGGUGCUCAUGCUUACAAC-3′. siGFP and siVimentin were purchased from Dharmacon Research and used as controls. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA duplex using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. All experiments described in this paper were carried out on cells 3 or 4 days after siRNA transfections.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (11Li J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In a search for p33ING1-binding proteins, we carried out a His6-p33ING1 pull-down assay in HeLa nuclear extract followed by mass spectrometric identification. We found DMAP1 as a p33ING1-interacting protein (data not shown). The specific binding of DMAP1 to ING1 (both p33 and p24ING1 isoforms, Fig. 1A) in HeLa nuclear extract was verified by a GST pull-down assay and by Western blotting (Fig. 1B), whereas proliferation cell nuclear antigen and HP1β as controls cannot bind p33ING1 or p24ING1. In vitro-translated DMAP1 also binds to ING1 (Fig. 1C), and the conserved plant homeodomain is not required for binding (data not shown). In addition, DMAP1 can interact with ING1 within cells. When GFP-p33ING1 or p24ING1 and FLAG-DMAP1 are co-transfected into 293T cells, immunoprecipitation of DMAP1 by the FLAG antibody (M2) co-precipitates GFP-p33ING1 and GFP-p24ING1 but to a lesser extent (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, a small percentage of endogenous p33ING1 can also be co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-DMAP1 from a cycling stable HeLa cell line that expresses FLAG-DMAP1 at a similar level to endogenous DMAP1. Importantly, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated p33ING1 is diminished when cells are blocked at the G1/S boundary using hydroxyurea. Similarly, DNMT1 is co-immunoprecipitated with DMAP1 from cycling cells but not from hydroxyurea-treated cells (Fig. 1E), in agreement with the observation that DNMT1 and DMAP1 interact throughout the S phase. These results show that DMAP1 and p33ING1 physically interact, and their interaction may be cell cycle-regulated (see below).Because DNMT1 associates with DMAP1 at replication foci throughout the S phase but associates only with HDAC2 in the late S phase (8Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), our finding that DMAP1 physically interacts with p33ING1 raises the possibility that DMAP1 may bring p33ING1-Sin3-HDAC1/2 to DNMT1 in the late S phase. We examined p33ING1 and DMAP1 localization during the cell cycle by indirect immunostaining. To facilitate this analysis, we used the stable HeLa cell line that expresses FLAG-DMAP1 at a level similar to the endogenous DMAP1 (see Fig. 1B). We synchronized HeLa cells by a double block procedure in which nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells enriched by mitotic shake-off were blocked in mimosine and then released into drug-free medium. Cells were fixed and immunostained at different times after release from mimosine using a mouse anti-FLAG antibody and a rabbit anti-p33ING1 N terminus antibody. Cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, both FLAG-DMAP1 and p33ING1 were stained in a speckle pattern during early S phase (2.5 h after mimosine release), but they do not co-localize. Starting in mid S phase (4.5-5.5 h), the two proteins appear to begin forming bright foci and partially co-localize (data not shown). When cells enter late S phase (6.5 h), they form large foci and co-localize to the highest extent. The large DMAP1 and ING1 foci disappear when cells exit the S phase (7.5 h) and resume the speckled pattern in the G2 phase. These results indicate that p33ING1 and DMAP1 interaction is regulated and confined to the late S phase.Fig. 2Cell cycle-regulated localization of ING1 and DMAP1 to heterochromatin.A, co-localization of ING1 and DMAP1 was regulated by the cell cycle. HeLa cells that stably express FLAG-DMAP1 were synchronized by a double block procedure. At different times after release, cells were fixed with cold methanol/acetone (90:10 in volume) and double immunostained with a mouse M2 antibody (red) and a rabbit anti-ING1 N terminus antibody (green) as described previously (10Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNA was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue). B, ING1 and DMAP1 co-localize with HP1β in the late S phase. Co-immunostaining is shown of ING1 or DMAP1 with HP1β in the late S phase cells 6.5 h after release from the double block procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because heterochromatin is replicated in the late S phase, we examined whether DMAP1 or p33ING1 co-localizes with a heterochromatin maker, HP1β, in the late S phase cells. HP1β shows distinct, large foci and co-localizes with DMAP1 or p33ING1 foci in the late S phase, i.e. 6.5 h after release (Fig. 2B). This observation supports the idea that DMAP1 and p33ING1 are recruited to the heterochromatin region during the late S phase and suggests that the two proteins and possibly their interaction may be involved in heterochromatin duplication.p33ING1-Sin3 and DNMT1-DMAP1 Complexes Are Required for Heterochromatin Protein 1 to Form Foci and for Trimethyl-H3K9 to Concentrate on Heterochromatin—As hyperacetylated histones are deposited onto the newly synthesized DNA during DNA replication, these histones must be deacetylated to form heterochromatin (14Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Our finding that p33ING1 localizes to heterochromatin during the late S phase raises the possibility that the p33ING1-Sin3-HDAC1/2 complex may be responsible for histone deacetylation in heterochromatin, and loss of p33ING1 (and the Sin3 complex) may lead to incomplete deacetylation of histones and eventually affect proper heterochromatin formation. To test this possibility, we used small RNA interference to silence ING1 and Sin3 and examined the effect of siRNA on the organization of heterochromatin by analyzing localization of two heterochromatin markers, HP1α and trimethylated histone H3 at K9. Recent work on heterochromatin histone modifications found that the trimethylated H3K9 may also be used as a heterochromatin marker in immunofluorescence (9Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K.

These large foci may correspond to the pericentric heterochromatin region. In contrast, these large foci are significantly disrupted, and HP1α and trimethyl-K9 are uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus with some small foci remaining in siING1- and siSin3-transfected cells, a pattern similar to that seen in trichostatin A-treated cells (7Maison C.

These results demonstrate that the p33ING1-Sin3 complex is required for the localization of HP1α and for the concentration of trimethyl-H3K9 to the heterochromatin region. This is consistent with a recent study showing that an mSin3-associated protein, mSds3, is essential for pericentric heterochromatin formation in a mouse knock-out model (16David G. Turner G.M. Yao Y. Protopopov A. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The human SDS3 protein is an integral component of the p33ING1-Sin3 complex. 2J. Qin, M.

Indeed, transfection of HeLa cells with siDMAP1 leads to delocalization of HP1α and trimethyl-H3K9 foci (Fig. 3B). Therefore, DMAP1 is also required for HP1α and trimethyl-H3K9 association with heterochromatin. Given the previous observation that recruitment of DMAP1 to replication foci throughout the S phase requires DNMT1 (8Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), we next tested the role of DNMT1 in localizing HP1α and trimethyl-H3K9 to heterochromatin. A similar effect was observed when DNMT1 was down-regulated (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the DNMT1-DMAP1 complex also functions in the pathway of maintaining heterochromatin structure.To corroborate the above results, we examined HP1β, another heterochromatin marker. To co-stain HP1α and -β, we used mouse anti-HP1α and rat anti-HP1β (M31) antibodies for immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 3C, HP1α and -β form similar foci, and more importantly, they co-localize to a large degree in siVimentin-transfected control cells. Similarly to HP1α, the large HP1β foci are also significantly disrupted, and HP1β stains uniformly throughout the nucleus with some small foci remaining when cells are transfected with siING1 or siDMAP1. As shown in Fig. 3D, the protein levels of ING1, DMAP1, Sin3, and DNMT1 are significantly reduced by siRNA transfection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the loss of these proteins in the cell has a dramatically adverse effect on the localization of heterochromatin markers to heterochromatin.Both p33ING1-Sin3 and DMAP1-DNMT1 Complexes Are Required to Maintain Histone Deacetylation and H3K9 Methylation at the Pericentric Heterochromatin—We first investigated the global changes in histone acetylation and methylation using total extracted histones from siING1- and siDMAP1-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, neither acetylation nor H3K9 methylation of bulk histones is significantly affected by the loss of ING1 or DMAP1 (Fig. 3D), suggesting that they may have only a restricted effect on histone modification of specific chromosome regions, such as the pericentric heterochromatin. Chromatin-associated HP1β is somewhat decreased in the absence of ING1 or DMAP1, but the total HP1β level in whole cell lysate does not change. This is consistent with the dynamic nature of HP1 binding to heterochromatin (9Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S. Huskisson N. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Wu R.

Science. 2003; 299: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The loss of ING1 or DMAP1 impinges on the integrity of heterochromatin, which in turn is likely to change the dynamics of HP1 binding.Fig. 4Regulation of histone acetylation and methylation by and recruitment of the p33ING1-Sin3 and DNMT1-DMAP1 complexes at pericentric heterochromatin.A, the knockdown of ING1 or DMAP1 does not grossly change histone acetylation and methylation. Total histones and chromatin-associated proteins from mock-, siING1-, and siDMAP1-transfected cells were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the status of histone acetylation and methylation was measured with acetylation- and methylation-specific antibodies by Western blotting. Note the decreased association of HP1β on chromatin in siING1- and siDMAP1-transfected cells, but the HP1β total protein level does not change. B, increased histone acetylation and diminished histone methylation at pericentric heterochromatin in siING1- and siDMAP1-transfected cells are shown. DNA immunoprecipitated by various antibodies (specific for all acetylated histone H3, all acetylated H4, acetylated H3K9, dimethylated H3K9, and trimethylated H3K9) in the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments was amplified by specific primers for the chromosome 4 centromere region, a promoter of the MTA2 gene, the α-satellite of the X chromosome, and a promoter of the D3 gene. C, independent recruitment is shown of the p33ING1-Sin3 complex and the DNMT1-DMAP1 complex to the pericentric heterochromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows associations of Sin3, ING1, DMAP1, and DNMT1 with pericentric heterochromatin in mock, and various siRNA transfected cells.

Lin Q. Wang W. Wade P. Wong J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For this purpose, specific pairs of PCR primers were designed to allow the amplification of the chromosome 4 centromeric regions and X chromosome-linked α-satellite repetitive DNA (19Waye J.S. Willard H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2731-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These two types of centromeric DNA are found in the pericentric heterochromatin territories of chromosome 4 and X, respectively. The MTA2 and D3 genes were chosen as control euchromatin loci. As shown in Fig. 4B, a knockdown of ING1 or DMAP1 results in elevated levels of acetylated H3 and H4, diminished dimethylated and trimethylated H3K9, and a concomitant increase in acetylated H3K9 in the chromosome 4 centromeric region. Similar results were obtained when the chromosome 10 centromeric region was analyzed (data not shown). In contrast, the knockdown of ING1 and DMAP1 has no significant effect on the acetylation or methylation patterns over the euchromatic MTA2 and D3 gene promoter regions. On the other hand, the effect on the X chromosome-linked α-satellite region is less dramatic with little effect on both acetylation and methylation, which is consistent with the observation that facultative heterochromatinization of the X chromosome may affect the histone modifications differently at the X centromere when compared with the other chromosomes (4Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T.

We also found that a knockdown of Sin3 or DNMT1 led to a similar change in histone modifications (data not shown). These results establish an essential role of the p33ING1-Sin3 and DMAP1-DNMT1 complexes for histone deacetylation in pericentric heterochromatin and demonstrate that the p33ING1-Sin3-HDAC and DMAP1-DNMT1 complexes are required for maintaining histone H3K9 methylation in pericentric heterochromatin. In addition, it demonstrates that DNA methyltransferase is also important for maintaining histone hypoacetylation and methylation in pericentric heterochromatin. These results and published work indicate that histone deacetylation and histone and DNA methylation may be interdependent at the pericentric heterochromatin region in maintaining a heterochromatin structure that is conducive for HP1 binding.Independent Recruitment of p33ING1 and DMAP1 to Pericentric Heterochromatin—Because our data demonstrate a physical interaction between p33ING1 and DMAP1, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to investigate their recruitment to specific pericentric heterochromatin loci. As shown, Sin3, p33ING1, DMAP1, and DNMT1 all associate with the centromeric region of chromosome 4 (Fig. 4C, top row). Inter"

Here we demonstrate that CD-1, C57BL/6, 129/Sv, and other mouse strains synthesize high levels of AOH1 in the liver and AOH2 in the skin. By contrast, the DBA/2 and CBA strains are unique, having a selective deficit in the expression of the AOH1 and AOH2 genes. DBA/2 animals synthesize trace amounts of a catalytically active AOH1 protein. However, relative to CD-1 animals, an over 2 log reduction in the steady-state levels of liver AOH1 mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity is observed in basal conditions and following administration of testosterone. The DBA/2 mouse represents a unique opportunity to purify AOX1 and compare its enzymatic characteristics to those of the AOH1 protein. The spectroscopy and biochemistry of AOX1 are very similar to those of AOH1 except for a differential sensitivity to the non-competitive inhibitory effect of norharmane. AOX1 and AOH1 oxidize an overlapping set of aldehydes and heterocycles. For most compounds, the substrate efficiency (Vmax/Km) of AOX1 is superior to that of AOH1. Alkylic alcohols and acetaldehyde, the toxic metabolite of ethanol, are poor substrates of both enzymes.

Given the closer relationship to AOX1, we named the two proteins aldehyde oxidase homologues 1 and 2 (AOH1 and AOH2). AOH1 and AOH2 are encoded by two distinct genes that map at a very short distance from the AOX1 locus on mouse chromosome 1 (1Garattini E. Mendel R. Romao M.J. Wright R. Terao M. Biochem.

Currently, very little is known regarding the substrate specificity, the enzymatic characteristics, and the physiological function of the AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 enzymes. The definition of the enzymatic and biochemical characteristics of AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 is hampered by the fact that efficient heterologous systems for the expression of molybdoflavoproteins in their recombinant and catalytically active forms are not available. This has focused our attention on the development of efficient methods for the purification of the enzymes from their native sources (7Carpani G. Racchi M. Ghezzi P. Terao M. Garattini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

Comparison of the enzymatic properties of AOX1 and AOH1 is particularly relevant and difficult. In fact, the two molybdo-proteins cannot be separated on common chromatographic supports easily. In addition, the vast excess of AOH1 over AOX1 in mouse liver and lung makes it difficult to obtain the latter enzyme in a pure and AOH1-free form. The physiopathological function of AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 is completely obscure. For this reason, it would be useful to identify and characterize natural strains of mice with reduced or enhanced expression of the AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 genes. With reference to this last point, several years ago, Holmes and co-workers (15Holmes R.S. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Holmes R.S. Adv. Exp. Med.

Here we follow up on the observation and demonstrate that DBA/2 and CBA inbred mice have a specific deficit in the expression of both AOH1 and AOH2 proteins relative to other common outbred and inbred laboratory strains of mice such as CD-1 and C57BL/6. Thus, the DBA/2 mouse was used to isolate AOX1 in pure form from the hepatic tissue and to compare the biochemical characteristics of the enzyme with those of AOH1. AOH1 and AOX1 oxidize not only aromatic and unsaturated aldehydes but also alkylic aldehydes, including acetaldehyde, with similar efficiencies. Despite this, the levels of acetaldehyde in ethanol-treated DBA/2 mice are not different from those observed in similarly treated CD-1 mice. Chemicals—All-trans-retinaldehyde, all-trans-retinoic acid, 2-hydroxypyrimidine (2-OH-pyrimidine), menadione, norharmane (β-carboline), allopurinol, benzamidine, phthalazine, potassium ferricyanide, testosterone propionate, xanthine, and hypoxanthine were purchased from Sigma. Butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were from Aldrich. Ethanol was obtained from Carlo Erba Chemicals (Rodano, MI, Italy). Animals—CD-1, C57BL/6, CBA, BDF1, SWR/J, 129/Sv, C3H/He, and BALB/C, weighing ∼25–30 g, were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Calco, Como, Italy) and kept at 25 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle and given standard chow and water ad libitum in the “Mario Negri” Institute animal house facilities. Animals were treated according to the standards set by Italian Law. 2Legislative Decree 116 of January 27, 1992, authorization 169/94-A issued December 19, 1994, by the Ministry of Health. All animal experiments were approved by the Internal Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996 edition) and European Union directives and guidelines. 3European Union directives and guidelines: Legislative Decree September 19, 1994, 626 (89/391/CEE, 89/654/CEE, 89/655/CEE, 89/656/CEE, 90/269/CEE, 90/270/CEE, 90/394/CEE, 90/679/CEE).

SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard techniques (20Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were measured with the Bradford method using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Zymogram analysis of BOX and hypoxanthine oxidizing activities was performed following electrophoresis on cellulose acetate plates (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX), as described (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V. Bastone A. Federico C. Saccone S. Fanelli R. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

Determination of aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases by zymogram analysis was carried out according to the method of Holmes et al. (21Holmes R.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1978; 61: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In some experiments, BOX activity was determined quantitatively on purified CD-1-derived AOH1 protein or on partially purified preparations of the same enzyme from DBA/2 animals. The protein preparations were electrophoresed on cellulose acetate plates, as above, overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate (Sigma), 0.9 mm 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2–4]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma), and 30 mm benzaldehyde. Following 10 min of incubation, the overlay was detached from the acetate plate, and the spots corresponding to BOX activity were cut with scissors. The purple precipitate due to the reduction of MTT was dissolved along with cellulose acetate in 100 μl of N,N′-dimethylformamide (Sigma), and the solution was read at 540 nm in a Beckman DU65 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Appropriate blanks obtained by cutting an equivalent area of the same cellulose acetate plate and extracted in the same volume of N,N′-dimethylformamide were always run in parallel. Northern Blot Analysis, RT-PCR Amplification of the AOH1 cDNAs, PCR Amplification of the 5′-Flanking Regions of the AOH1 Gene, and Sequencing—Total RNA was extracted from the liver of DBA/2, CBA, and CD-1 mice, and the poly(A+) fraction of the RNA was selected according to standard protocols (20Shambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed on the poly(A+) fraction. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of mouse XOR (22Terao M. Cazzaniga G. Ghezzi P. Bianchi M. Falciani F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were labeled with [32P]dCTP with the use of the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). The coding regions of the AOH1 cDNAs from CD-1 and DBA/2 mice were amplified by RT-PCR using Advantage 2 DNA polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the two amplimers described previously (13Terao M.

The cDNAs were subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced in both directions with the use of appropriate oligonucleotide primers and an automatic DNA sequencer model CEQ 8000 (Beckman Instruments). To amplify the 5′-flanking regions of the AOH1 genes of DBA/2 and CD-1 mice, we first amplified the region of genomic DNA contained between exon 35 of AOX1 and exon 1 of AOH1 by PCR using the following two amplimers: sense primer, 5′-ATGAGCCTGGATCCTATGTTCCCT-3′ (nucleotides 3975/3998 of the AOX1 cDNA); antisense primer, 5′-TAAGCTCATCTGACTCCTTAGAAGGA-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 205/230 of the AOH1 cDNA) (13Terao M.

The resulting DNA fragments were subjected to a second round of PCR amplification with the same antisense primer as above and the sense primer 5′-CCTAACTGCATGTGTGTGTG-3′ (nucleotides –894/–875 of the AOH1 gene 5′-flanking region) (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V. Bastone A. Federico C. Saccone S. Fanelli R. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

This resulted in the amplification of DNA fragments of ∼1.6 kbp from the CD-1 and ∼1.1 kbp from the DBA/2 DNAs. These two amplification products were subcloned into pBluescript by the T/A cloning method using a commercially available kit (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) and the two constructs named CD-1-pBlue and DBA-pBlue. Sequencing was performed in both directions, as above. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were custom-synthesized by Invitrogen. Computer analysis of the DNA sequences was performed using the GeneWorks sequence analysis system (Intelligenetics, San Diego, CA). A search of potential binding sites for transcription factors in the 5′-flanking region of the DBA/2-derived AOH1 gene was performed using the MatInspector algorithm and the TRANSFAC data base (23Wingender E. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knuppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Functional Characterization of the 5′-Flanking Regions of the AOH1 Genes and Transfection of the Molybdo-flavoenzyme cDNAs—HEK-293 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). To determine the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking regions of exon 1 of the CD-1- and DBA/2-derived AOH1 genes, we constructed plasmids pCD-1-gal and pDBA2-gal. To obtain these constructs, CD-1-pBlue and DBA-pBlue were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the resulting fragments were inserted in the plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) digested with EcoRI and XhoI to release the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-enhancer sequences. These constructs contain the two 5′-flanking regions of the AOH1 genes from CD-1 and DBA/2 mice placed in front of the bacterial β-galactosidase reporter gene. The constructs were transfected in HEK-293 cells along with a plasmid expressing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Rous sarcoma virus promoter (RSV-Luc) (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V. Bastone A. Federico C. Saccone S. Fanelli R. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

Garattini E. Terao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Forty eight hours following transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and cell extracts were used for the determination of β-galactosidase activity according to MacGregor and Caskey (25MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The promoter activity associated with the pCD-1-gal and pDBA2-gal constructs was always normalized for the level of luciferase activity in the cell extracts. The AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 cDNA constructs in the pCMV-neo (Invitrogen) expression vector have been described previously (13Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G. Demontis S. Marini M. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30690-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The corresponding pCMV-XOR construct was generated by insertion of the coding region of the XOR cDNA (EcoRI-PvuII fragment) (22Terao M. Cazzaniga G. Ghezzi P. Bianchi M. Falciani F. Perani P. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) into the polylinker region of the pCMV-neo plasmid. All the constructs were transfected into HEK-293 cells as above. Purification of AOX1 and AOH1 Proteins—AOH1 was purified from the liver of male CD-1 mice, as described previously (12Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V. Bastone A. Federico C. Saccone S. Fanelli R. Salmona M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46347-46363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). AOX1 was isolated from the hepatic tissue of DBA/2 mice. Unless otherwise stated, all the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Livers (typically 35–40 g) from male DBA/2 mice were homogenized in 3 volumes of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with an Ultraturrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Homogenates were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 45 min to obtain cytosolic extracts. Extracts were heated at 55 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. An equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-glycine buffer, pH 9.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Solubilized proteins (equivalent to 10 g of fresh liver) were mixed with 5 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-glycine buffer, pH 9.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Following 2 h of incubation, the resin was washed 4 times with 10 ml each of the equilibration buffer to remove unbound proteins. Adsorbed proteins were eluted twice with 5-ml aliquots of equilibration buffer containing 10 mm benzamidine (Sigma). The eluate was concentrated to ∼1 ml with Centriplus YM-100 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and diluted to 10 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The resulting solution was applied to a 5/5 FPLC Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The AOX1 protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient (22.5 ml) from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The purification of AOX1 was monitored by determination of phthalazine oxidizing activity, as described below. In the case of phthalazine oxidation, 1 unit of enzymatic activity corresponds to 1 nmol of phthalazine oxidized/min. The purification of AOX1 was also monitored by quantitative Western blot analysis. For this type of experiment, an equivalent amount of protein solution, at each purification step, was loaded onto the same gel and processed for analysis. Chemiluminescence signals corresponding to AOX1 bands were quantitated with a scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). The total amount of AOX1-immunoreactive protein in the various experimental samples is expressed in arbitrary units and is calculated on the basis of the intensity of the Western blot signal in optical density multiplied by the total volume of each purification step. One arbitrary unit of immunoreactive protein corresponds to 100 OD of the specific AOX1 band in each experimental sample. Mass Spectrometry of the Purified AOX1 and AOH1 Proteins—The masses of tryptic peptides obtained from purified AOX1 and AOH1 were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyses of AOX1 and AOH1 tryptic peptides were performed according to standard protocols following in situ or in-gel tryptic digestion (26Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6813) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins or Coomassie-stained gel slices were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 30 min to reduce disulfide bridges. Thiol groups were alkylated upon reaction with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 12.5 ng/μl of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted twice in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% (v/v) formic acid. The combined extracts were lyophilized and redissolved in 0.5% (v/v) formic acid and desalted using ZipTip (Millipore). Peptides were eluted in 50% methanol, 0.5% formic acid. The eluate was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 1:3 (v/v). Mass mapping of tryptic peptides was performed with a Bruker Biflex™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Data generated were processed with the Mascot program (www.matrixscience.com/) allowing a mass tolerance of ≤0.4 Da. Determination of the Substrate and Inhibitor Specificities of AOX1 and AOH1—For the determination of retinaldehyde oxidizing activity, we followed a slight modification of the method described by Tsujita et al. (27Tsujita M. Tomita S. Miura S. Ichikawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified AOX1 and AOH1 preparations (2 μg in 2–4 μl) were incubated in the dark for 10 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing all-trans-retinaldehyde. In these conditions, molecular oxygen acts as the final acceptor of the reducing equivalents generated by oxidation of the substrate. At the end of the reaction period, samples were extracted with 100 μl of butanol/methanol (95:5 v/v) containing 0.005% w/v of butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma). The organic phase was separated, and 10 μl were subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column (Spherisorb S5 ODS2 4.6 × 250 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) using a Beckman apparatus (System Gold) equipped with a flow cell and a spectrophotometer. All-trans-retinaldehyde and the corresponding oxidation product, all-trans-retinoic acid, were determined by integrating the specific high pressure liquid chromatographic peaks observed at 340 nm. The amounts of retinoic acid generated were quantitated by reference to appropriate calibration curves of the compound. Experiments were performed under conditions of linearity relative to the content of protein and the incubation time. The phthalazine, benzaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetaldehyde, 2-hydroxypyrimidine, and ethanol oxidizing activities of AOX1 and AOH1 were measured using potassium ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] as the electron acceptor. Briefly, the enzymes were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing an appropriate concentration of the substrate and 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide. The reaction was continuously monitored at 420 nm using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The inhibitory activity of menadione, norharmane, benzamidine, and allopurinol on AOX1, AOH1, and XOR (from bovine milk, Roche Applied Science) was assessed with the use of 2-hydroxypyrimidine as the substrate in th"

We report here that the so-called human immunodeficiency virus Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), a component of the 19 S regulatory subunit of the proteasome 26 S, also involved in transcriptional regulation and with a supposed role in the control of cell proliferation, specifically interacts with ARF, both in yeast and mammalian cells. We present evidence that the overexpression of TBP-1 in various cell lines results in a sharp increase of both transfected and endogenous ARF protein levels. Moreover, this effect depends on the binding between the two proteins and, at least in part, is exerted at the post-translational level. We also show that the ARF increase following TBP-1 overexpression results in an increase in p53 protein levels and activity.

Emerging evidence suggests that ARF can, although less efficiently, suppress the proliferation of cells that express mutant p53 or lack both MDM2 and p53, implying interactions with other regulators (13Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 14Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ARF can associate with certain members of the E2F family of transcription factors and induce their degradation through the 26 S proteasome pathway (15Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A. Livingston D.M. Grossman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, ARF is also able to associate with DP1, a functional, regulatory partner of the E2F family of factors, but, surprisingly, the E2F1-DP1 complex appears to be refractory to ARF regulation (16Datta A. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8398-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been demonstrated that ARF acts as an inhibitor of ribosomal RNA processing, highlighting a p53-independent role for p19ARF that couples the antiproliferative function of ARF to ribosome biogenesis (17Sugimoto M. Kuo M.L. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Other proteins that complex with ARF include spinophilin (18Vivo M. Calogero R.A. Sansone F. Calabro V. Parisi T. Borrelli L. Saviozzi S. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14161-14169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), topoisomerase I, MdmX, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1a, Pex19, p120E4F, and CARF (19Rizos H.

Although the extent to which all of these ARF-complexes modulate the cell cycle-inhibitory action of ARF is not well established, spinophilin, CARF, and p120E4F appear to cooperate with ARF in promoting growth arrest. In this paper, we report an interaction between the human p14ARF and the HIV 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TBP-1, Tat-binding protein; HPRT, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; aa, amino acid(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; nL, norleucine; ALLnL, acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO. Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1) (20Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Ohana B. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Rosen C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TBP-1 is a member of a large highly conserved gene family (AAA protein family) that contains two conserved domains, one resembling a nucleotide-binding motif (ATP-binding site) and the other resembling a motif common to proteins with helicase activity. Members of this protein family are the proteins MSS1 (or Rpt1), S4 (or Rpt2), TBP-7 (or Rpt3), SUG2 (or Rpt4), SUG1 (or Rpt6), and Rpt5 (TBP-1 itself), all components of the 19 S regulatory subunit of the proteasome 26 S (22Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The proteasome 26 S is the chief site of regulatory protein turnover in eukaryotic cells. It is also a component of the quality control machinery that selectively degrades proteins with abnormal structures or allows their refolding (23Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It thus participates in nearly all of the multiple roles played by intracellular protein degradation in cellular function. The proteasome 26 S comprises one 20 S catalytic complex and two axially positioned 19 S regulatory complexes that control substrate access to the catalytic chamber. Most known protein substrates of the proteasome are covalently modified with a polyubiquitin chain as a prerequisite for their proteolysis. Recognition of this signal is followed by substrate unfolding and translocation that are presumably catalyzed by one or more of the six nonredundant AAA ATPases located at the base of the 19 S regulatory subunit. Actually, TBP-1 is a member of this protein family and is likely to be involved in this process. An interesting aspect of the 19 S regulatory subunits is their apparent involvement in cellular events that do not require proteolysis. In fact, 19 S protein members have been shown to be involved in transcription regulation (24Ottosen S. Herrera F.J. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TBP-1 itself was originally described as a factor that binds to HIV-Tat protein and suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV gene expression (20Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TBP-1 binds to the HBx protein of HBV virus, stimulating HBx-specific transcription of the HBV genomic DNA (26Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and also potentiates the ligand-dependent transactivation by TRβ1 and TRα1 via thyroid hormone response elements (27Ishizuka T. Satoh T. Monden T. Shibusawa N. Hashida T. Yamada M. Mori M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1329-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that, although unable to bind DNA, TBP-1 is a strong transcriptional activator when brought into proximity of several promoter elements; it has been demonstrated that transcriptional activity depends upon the integrity of the nucleotide binding domain and the helicase domain (21Ohana B. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Rosen C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein members of the 19 S subunit have also been shown to play a role in nucleotide excision repair in the absence of proteasome activity (28Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that roles other than proteolysis could be features of 19 S AAA ATPase family members. An interesting aspect of TBP-1 regards its supposed role as a tumor suppressor, since TBP-1 mRNA levels were found to be elevated upon inhibition of the oncogenic phenotype of transformed cells expressing ErbB family receptors. Furthermore, TBP-1 overexpression diminished cell proliferation and strongly inhibited transforming efficiency in athymic mice when stably expressed in human tumor cells containing ErbB family receptors (29Park B.W. O'Rourke D.M. Wang Q. Davis J.G. Post A. Qian X. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6434-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, TBP-1 also possesses 46% identity to KAI I, a metastasis tumor suppressor gene for human prostate cancer (30Dong J.T. Lamb P.W. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. Vukanovic J. Ichikawa T. Isaacs J.T. Barrett J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and maps to chromosome 11p12–13, a region frequently deleted in cancers (31Bepler G. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5513-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we show that the overexpression of TBP-1 in various cell lines resulted in a dramatic increase in the ARF protein levels and, consequently, in an increase in p53 protein levels and activity, uncovering a functional role of TBP-1 through ARF stabilization. Interestingly, TBP-1 appears to inhibit proliferation with an efficiency similar to that exhibited by ARF, in different cell lines. Although our observations need further elucidations, they underline a clear involvement of TBP-1 in the control of cell proliferation. For Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—ARF constructs were as already described (18Vivo M. Calogero R.A. Sansone F. Calabro V. Parisi T. Borrelli L. Saviozzi S. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14161-14169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TBP-1 Constructs—pGAD10-TBP-1-(1–31), pGAD10-TBP-1-(1–61), and pGAD10-TBP-1-(61–404) were obtained by PCR amplification using the primers TBP-22F and TBP-31R, TBP-22F and TBP-61R, and TBP-62F and TBP-404R, respectively, and subsequent cloning in pGAD10-cut XhoI/BamHI. PCR Primers—Primers were as follows: TBP-22F, CGCTCGAGCG GCCGCGTCGACGGCAACCGTG; TBP62F, AACCTCGAGATGTTGATCCTAATGACCAAGAG; TBP31R, ACGGGATCCTTGGAGCTCATGGGTGACTCTCAACAC; TBP61R, ACGGGATCCGAGCTCGATGACGTTGGAGACAAG; TBP404R, ACGGGATCCTGCCTAGGCGTAGTATTGTAGGTT. Mammalian Expression Vectors—The 1.341-kb fragment containing the TBP-1 cDNA was retrieved by EcoRI digestion from pGADTBP-1 and ligated into the pcDNA3.1His-Invitrogen (pcDNATBP-1). The pGAD10-TBP-1 plasmid was cut with SmaI and religated in order to eliminate 372 bp (aa 202–326); the resulting plasmid was cut with EcoRI in order to excise the deleted TBP-1 fragment that was cloned in the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1His to give pcDNATBP-1[Δ202–326]. The EcoRI fragment from pGADTBP-1-(61–404) was cloned in the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1His (pcDNATBP-1-(61–404)). The PG13 artificial promoter, containing 13 repeats of a specific p53 binding site, was provided by G. Del Sal (originally from B. Vogelstein). The other plasmids have been already described (32Calabro V. Mansueto G. Parisi T. Vivo M. Calogero R.A. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2674-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The procedure was as already described (18Vivo M. Calogero R.A. Sansone F. Calabro V. Parisi T. Borrelli L. Saviozzi S. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14161-14169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, pBTM-ARF construct was used to screen a human muscle cDNA library cloned into the pGAD10 vector (Clontech). The yeast strain L40 (34Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) was sequentially transformed with the pBTM-ARF vector and the library. An estimated 107 transformants were screened. Yeasts containing interacting proteins were identified by growth on selective media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and confirmed by β-galactosidase activity. Isolated plasmids were retransformed into L40 with the negative control plasmid pBTM-galactin (a gift of L. Chiariotti) and with pBTM-ARF and tested again for growing on the selection media. Those that were negative for interaction with galactin were sequenced, and DNA sequences were used to search the nonredundant GenBank™ data base using the BLAST search algorithm available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. U2OS, Saos2, H1299, HeLa, and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The NIH3T3 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. U2OS cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen); H1299 and HeLa cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen); NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus; and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000, following the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA was brought up to 2 μg using the “empty” expression vector when necessary. For coimmunoprecipitation, U2OS cells (two 60-mm dishes) were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNAARF or 1 μg of pcDNATBP-1 and 1 μg of pcDNAARF. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in IBP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml)). Debris was removed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of lysates (0.8 μg of protein) were precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 8 h at 4 °C) and subsequently incubated with anti-ARF antibody (sc-8613; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution 1:40) or monoclonal anti-TBP-1 (clone 19; Affinity Research; dilution 1:200) for 4 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads (25 μl) and left for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IBP buffer (4 °C), solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, loaded on 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TBP-1 antibody (1:4000, 2 h at room temperature) or anti-ARF (1:500, 2 h at room temperature), followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences; 1:5000, 1 h at room temperature) or with horseradish peroxidase anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:5000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation of ARF and the TBP-1 mutants were carried out under exactly the same experimental conditions except for the Western blot analysis that was carried out with monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen 46-0528; 1:4000 dilution) to detect transfected wild type or mutant versions of TBP-1. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, H1299 cells (one 100-mm plate) were harvested and lysed as described above. Equal amounts of lysates (2 mg) were incubated with anti-ARF antibody (1:40) or polyclonal anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology I-19; 1:40 dilution) for 4 h at 4 °C. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated using the Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen), reverse transcribed (Superscript II; Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using the forward and reverse primers for ARF and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) genes at 63 °C for 28 cycles: ARF forward, ATGGTGCGCAGGTTCTTGGTGA; ARF reverse, GGGGTCGGCGCAGTTGGGCTCA; HPRT forward, CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG; HPRT reverse, CCTGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGG. Cells were seeded (8 × 105) into 60-mm plates and transfected with 1 μg of pcDNAARF using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for the H1299 and HeLa cell lines and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for the COS-7 cell line, under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. 12 h post-transfection, cells were split into two aliquots; one was treated with 30 μm ALLnL plus 0.1% Me2SO (Sigma), and the other was treated with 0.1% Me2SO as control. H1299 cells were also treated with 30 μm MG132 (Sigma) following the same schedule. 10 h later, cells were harvested, and total cell extract was prepared. 30 μg of cell lysates were probed in Western blot analysis with anti-ARF, anti-MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology smp14; 1:500 dilution) and anti-actin antibodies (1:500 dilution), followed by incubation, respectively, with the horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse or with horseradish peroxidase anti-goat antibodies. U2OS cells were seeded (8 × 105) in 60-mm diameter dishes and transiently transfected using Superfect (Quiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions with 0.5 μg of pG13 and either 1 μg of pcDNAARF or 1 μg of pcDNAARF with 1 or 3 μg of pcDNATBP-1 or with 3 μg of pcDNATBP-1. 24 h later, cells were collected; chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as described (32Calabro V. Mansueto G. Parisi T. Vivo M. Calogero R.A. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2674-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 50 μg of cell extract was used for Western blot analysis with anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology DO1; 1:1000 dilution), anti-p21WAF (Neomarkers Ab-11 CP-74; 1:200 dilution), and anti-actin and anti-ARF, as described above. U2OS cells (three plates, 60-mm dishes) were transfected using Superfect (Quiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions with pcDNAARF (1 μg) in the presence or absence of 1 μg of pcDNATBP-1. 12 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, and the cells from the same set were pooled and replated into six plates. After 24 h from transfection, cycloheximide (Calbiochem) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 80 μg/ml, and cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Total cell extract was prepared as described above. 30 μg of cell extract was probed, in Western blot, with anti-ARF antibody and, as control, with anti-actin. U2OS, H1299, HeLa (1 × 105 cells/well) and NIH3T3 (2 × 104 cells/well) cells were seeded into 6-well multiplates and transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA using the standard calcium phosphate method as described (32Calabro V. Mansueto G. Parisi T. Vivo M. Calogero R.A. La Mantia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2674-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Identification of TBP-1 as a Partner of p14ARF by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—In an attempt to identify p14ARF interacting proteins, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system. A Gal4 DNA-binding domain-p14ARF fusion protein was used as a bait to screen a human muscle cDNA library cloned into a Gal4 activation domain yeast two-hybrid plasmid. From a screen of ∼107 yeast transformants, 30 colonies were scored as positive for reporter gene activity (His+ LacZ+). Among 10 clones scored positive in secondary screening assays, a 1341-nucleotide clone was identified in a data base search as corresponding to a cDNA of TBP-1 (GenBank™ accession number M34079) (20Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TBP-1 was originally identified as a regulator of HIV-Tat-driven transcription. Its role in transcription was later confirmed and found to reside in the C-terminal portion of the protein that contains a 230-aa region, present in proteins belonging to the family of the AAA ATPases (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities). This domain contains a site of binding to ATP and a helicase domain and is typically present in proteins of the 19 S regulatory subunit of the proteasome (21Ohana B. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Rosen C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal portion of TBP-1 is characterized by the presence of a dimerization or heterodimerization domain. Inspection of the amino acid sequence by the program “COILS” (available on the World Wide Web at www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) identified a putative coiled-coil region of 29 aa between aa 11 and 40 (Fig. 1). This domain, rich in leucines, resembles features typical of leucine-zipper domains, commonly involved in protein-protein interactions. To define which parts of the ARF protein are required for the physical interaction with TBP-1, we assayed, by yeast two-hybrid assay, an ARF mutant expressing only exon 1β (aa 1–65) and two exon 1β deletion mutants (Fig. 1). We were able to show that the region 1–65 of ARF is sufficient for the interaction with TBP-1 (Fig. 1, lanes a and b). Actually, the interaction with TBP-1 appears also stronger when the exon 1β alone is present. Deletion of either aa 27–65 or aa 1–38 of the exon 1β-encoded region (Fig. 1, lanes c and d) impairs the interaction with TBP-1, suggesting that the entire region encompassing amino acids 1–65 is essential for the binding to TBP-1. To identify the minimal region of TBP-1 necessary for the TBP-1-ARF interaction, we constructed various mutants (details are given under “Experimental Procedures”) that were tested in yeast by two-hybrid assay. TBP-1-(1–31) and TBP-1-(1–61) are deletion mutants that maintain different portions of the N terminus of the protein, whereas TBP-1-(61–404) completely lacks all of the N terminus (see Fig. 1, lanes e, f, and g). As is shown in Fig. 1, lane e, TBP-1-(1–61), bearing all of the putative coiled-coil region, is the only mutant capable of interacting with exon 1β of p14ARF, whereas neither TBP-1-(1–31), containing only part of the coiled-coil region, nor TBP-1-(61–404), which completely lacks it, are able to bind to p14ARF. Analysis of TBP-1 Expression and Interaction with ARF in Mammalian Cells—TBP-1 is a widely expressed protein, conserved among different species from archaebacteria to humans. Before proceeding to further analysis in mammalian cells, we evaluated the level of expression of TBP-1 in different cell lines, using a commercially available antibody raised against TBP-1. As a control of the antibody specificity, full-length TBP-1 was cloned in pcDNA3.1His mammalian expression vector and transfected in U2OS cells; the cellular extracts were probed with anti-Xpress or anti-TBP-1 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Both antibodies reveal a band of roughly 50 kDa, representing the transfected TBP-1, whereas the anti-TBP-1 antibody recognizes also the endogenous TBP-1, as expected. Next, cell lysates were prepared from U2OS, COS-7, Saos2, and H1299 cell lines, and the level of expression of endogenous TBP-1 was assayed by using anti-TBP-1 antibodies. As it is possible to see in Fig. 2B, TBP-1 is abundantly expressed in all of the cell lines tested. By RT-PCR we could also observe comparable levels of TBP-1 mRNA among the different cell lines tested (data not shown). Finally, by indirect immunofluorescence, we verified that TBP-1 is localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a preferential distribution at the nuclear periphery (data not shown), according to Refs. 21Ohana B. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Rosen C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Barak O. Aronheim A. Shaul Y. Virology. 2001; 283: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, and 33Ghee M. Fournier A. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2221-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar. To confirm the ARF/TBP-1 interaction in intact cells, we decided to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments in various cell lines. For this purpose, U2OS cells (ARF-) were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding TBP-1 and/or ARF. The cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TBP-1 antibodies, and the immune complexes were blotted and probed with anti-ARF antibodies. Coimmunoprecipitation of TBP-1 (Fig. 2C, lane 3) occurred only when this protein was coexpressed with ARF, since the complexes were not found when the protein alone was expressed into the cells (Fig. 2C, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained when the cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ARF antibodies (Fig. 2D). The interaction was observed also in COS-7 cells using similar experimental procedures (data not shown). Moreover, to confirm the physiological relevance of the TBP-1-ARF complexes containing ectopic proteins, lysates of H1299, in which ARF is abundantly expressed, were analyzed for endogenous TBP-1-ARF complexes. 2 mg of total cellular extract of untreated H1299 cells were used for coimmmunoprecipitation with anti-ARF antibodies; the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by Western blots for their content of both TBP-1 and ARF. Both proteins were present in an anti-ARF immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2E, lane 2) but not in that of an irrelevant control immunoprecipitate of H1299 lysate (Fig. 2E, lane 1), suggesting an endogenous ARF-TBP-1 interaction. Our yeast two-hybrid data suggested that the first 61 amino acids of TBP-1 are sufficient for the interaction with ARF. To obtain an independent evaluation of the protein-protein interaction, we wanted to verify whether the deletion of the first 61 aa at the N terminus of TBP-1 could abrogate its capacity to bind to ARF also in human cells. We thus constructed the pcDNATBP-1-(61–404) expression vector (Fig. 2F) and used it to transfect the U20S cell line in combination with pcDNAARF (Fig. 2G, lane 3) or alone (Fig. 2G, lane 5). Wild type TBP-1 and a mutant TBP-1 lacking the helicase domain but retaining all of the N-terminal region (pcDNATBP-1[Δ202–326]) (Fig. 2F) were used, as controls, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2G, lanes 1 and 7, and lanes 2 and 6). The expression level of the various proteins was assayed in Western blot analysis with anti-Xpress and anti-ARF antibodies prior to subjecting them to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2G, upper panel). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ARF antibodies and prob"
https://openalex.org/W1976144828,"The interaction of ribosomes with specific components of membranes is one of the central themes to the co-translational targeting and import of proteins. To examine ribosome binding to mammalian mitochondria, we used ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) to follow the in vitro binding of ribosomes that correspond to the initial targeting stage of proteins. Mitochondria were found to contain a limited number of RNC binding sites on the outer membrane. It required more than twice the amount of non-translating ribosomes to inhibit RNC binding by one-half, indicating that RNCs have a competitive binding advantage. In addition, we found that RNCs bind mainly through the ribosomal component and not the nascent chain. RNCs bind via protease-sensitive proteins on the outer membrane, as well as by protease-insensitive components suggesting that two classes of receptors exist. We also show that binding is sensitive to cation conditions. Nearly all of the binding was inhibited in 0.5 m KCl, indicating that they interact with the membrane primarily through electrostatic interactions. In addition, disruption of RNC structure by removing magnesium causes the complete inhibition of binding under normal binding conditions indicating that it is the intact ribosome that is crucial for binding and not the nascent chain. These findings support the hypothesis that the outer mitochondrial membrane contains receptors specific for ribosomes, which would support the conditions necessary for co-translational import. The interaction of ribosomes with specific components of membranes is one of the central themes to the co-translational targeting and import of proteins. To examine ribosome binding to mammalian mitochondria, we used ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) to follow the in vitro binding of ribosomes that correspond to the initial targeting stage of proteins. Mitochondria were found to contain a limited number of RNC binding sites on the outer membrane. It required more than twice the amount of non-translating ribosomes to inhibit RNC binding by one-half, indicating that RNCs have a competitive binding advantage. In addition, we found that RNCs bind mainly through the ribosomal component and not the nascent chain.

These findings support the hypothesis that the outer mitochondrial membrane contains receptors specific for ribosomes, which would support the conditions necessary for co-translational import. Newly synthesized proteins are targeted to, and translocated across, membranes either post-translationally or co-translationally. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized by free cytosolic ribosomes, and translocated into mitochondria post-translationally (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar); however, evidence suggests that some proteins may be imported co-translationally (2Beddoe T. Lithgow T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The co-translational model of protein import into mitochondria was first put forth after in vivo studies in yeast found that cytosolic polysomes: 1) are associated with mitochondria; 2) the number bound is dependent on the metabolic state of the cells; 3) are translationally active; and 4) contain mRNA encoding mitochondrial proteins (3Kellems R.E.

In addition, fully synthesized, unprocessed proteins are not found under normal growth conditions in yeast and treatment with cycloheximide to inhibit translation disrupts mitochondrial protein import in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that proteins are translocated into mitochondria either rapidly after synthesis or co-translationally (9Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6841-6847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol.

The translation and import of some mitochondrial proteins have also been found to be tightly coupled in mammalian cells (12Nobumoto M. Yamada M. Song S. Inouye S. Nakazawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Ni L. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12685-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between ribosomes and mitochondria are central to the co-translational hypothesis and recent work in our laboratory and others has focused on the role that ribosomes, their associated nascent proteins, and cytosolic chaperones play in the import of mitochondrial proteins. For example, mutations in the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), 1The abbreviations used are: NAC, nascent chain associated complex; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Luc, luciferase; mMDH, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase; mMDH-Met6, mMDH-methionine fusion protein; RB, ribosome binding buffer; ribo-Luc, ribosome-luciferase complex; ribo-mMDH-Met6, ribosome-mMDH-Met6 complex; RNC, ribosome-nascent chain complex. which interacts with both the ribosome and the emerging nascent chain, lead to defects in protein targeting to both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast (14George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NAC has also been shown in vitro to be directly involved in the co-translational import of the mitochondrial matrix protein malate dehydrogenase (mMDH), where it has been hypothesized that NAC interacts with the nascent precursor protein and assists in the docking of ribosomes to the mitochondrial surface (15Funfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants lacking NAC do not have defects in translation, but do have a significant decrease in the number of ribosomes bound to mitochondria and although the levels of most mitochondrial proteins are unchanged, some of the proteins that are thought to be imported more efficiently co-translationally are decreased (17George R. Walsh P. Beddoe T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that there is a subclass of mitochondrial proteins that may be most efficiently imported co-translationally (18Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). We previously reported that ribosomes specifically bind mammalian mitochondria through a process that is controlled by a GTP-dependent step, which is similar to co-translational import in the ER (19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found that ribosome binding to mitochondria was not stable at physiological levels of GTP, whereas ATP and GDP only mildly affected binding. In addition, we found that a nascent chain containing a proper mitochondrial targeting sequence could stabilize ribosome binding in the presence of GTP, whereas nascent chains not containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence behaved like unprogrammed ribosomes. Also, the endogenous ability of mitochondria to hydrolyze GTP was greatly accelerated when GTPase-depleted ribosomes were added to mitochondria, whereas ribosome-mitochondria interactions had no effect on ATP hydrolysis. These findings indicated that ribosomes bind tightly to mitochondria through a process that involves a GTP-dependent step and the nascent chain bound to the ribosome. This is similar to what occurs at the ER membrane where GTP and the signal sequence are involved in ribosomes interacting with both signal recognition particle and the translocation apparatus at the ER membrane (20Bacher G. Lutcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ribosomes specifically interact with the proteins that make up the translocation pore at target membranes during co-translational import and this interaction has been evolutionarily conserved (21Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have developed binding assays using ribosome-nascent chain complexes to determine the conditions under which ribosomes bind mammalian mitochondria. We demonstrate that ribosomes bind mitochondria through electrostatic interactions with proteins on the outer membrane that are susceptible to proteolysis. We also present evidence that the ribosomal component of the ribosome-nascent chain complex is central to binding. These findings support the hypothesis that the outer mitochondrial membrane contains receptors that are specific for ribosomes. Preparation of High Salt-washed Mitochondria—Crude mitochondria were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat livers as previously described (22Chu T.W. Grant P.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12806-12811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were further purified by EDTA/high salt treatment using previously described methods to reduce ER contamination and to strip the mitochondria of endogenously bound ribosomes (19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Pickett C.B. Montisano D. Eisner D. Cascarano J. Exp.

Mitochondria were washed twice with mitochondria isolation buffer (MIB, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 70 mm mannitol, and 220 mm sucrose) to remove excess EDTA and high salt. Reduction of ER contamination was confirmed by assessing the activity of arylesterase and by electron microscopy of mitochondria preparations using previously described methods (19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Pickett C.B. Montisano D. Eisner D. Cascarano J. Exp.

Cytol. 1956; 2: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), brought to 10 mg/ml in MIB and used immediately. The intactness of all preparations was assessed by determining the respiratory control ratio using a Clark electrode and was between 3 and 6 (data not shown). Freshly isolated, high salt-washed mitochondria were used for all experiments. Construction of the “Mitochondrial Malate Dehydrogenase-Methionine 6” Plasmid—To add 6 methionines to the COOH terminus of the mMDH nascent chain, the “methionine insert” plasmid was first created, which allows for a DNA construct with EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites to be inserted so that 6 methionines are added to the COOH-terminus of the nascent chain. A 45-bp double-stranded DNA construct was synthesized by Wake Forest University School of Medicine DNA Synthesis Lab that contained restriction sites for EcoRI, KpnI, and XbaI, sequentially from 5′ to 3′ (sense: 5′-GGAATTCCGGGGTACCCCATGATGATGATGATGATGCTCTAGAGC-3′; antisense: 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGGGTACCCCGGAATTCC-3′). The construct was restricted at each end with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated into a pGEM vector (Promega) restricted with the same enzymes so that it is under the control of the SP6 promoter. Next, a mMDH-encoding plasmid under control of the SP6 promoter was modified using PCR core system I (Promega). A KpnI site was created 83 amino acids into the precursor mMDH protein using the primers 5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′ (SP6, sense primer) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGGGTACCCCGGAATTCC-3′ (antisense primer). Polymerase chain reaction products were restricted at the 5′ end with EcoRI and at the 3′ end with KpnI, and then ligated into the methionine insert vector cut with the same enzymes. All ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109 (Promega) and positive clones were isolated. The resulting “mMDH-Met6” plasmid, when digested with XbaI and used in the translation system described below, will produce ribosome-mMDH nascent chain complexes that consist of the first 83 amino acids of mMDH, followed by a 4-residue linker and finally the 6 extra methionines. The plasmid is designed so that when it is restricted with XbaI, the 3′ end of the coding sequence under the control of the SP6 promoter lacks a stop codon. This is required for the formation of stable ribosome-nascent chain complexes because the ribosome will not release the nascent chain in the absence of a termination codon (26Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Hanes J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Preparation of Ribosome-Nascent Chain Complexes—Truncated mMDH-Met6 mRNA lacking a stop codon was synthesized by in vitro transcription of the mMDH-Met6 insert plasmid linearized with XbaI. Cell-free translations were performed in a reticulocyte lysate system, as previously described, to produce ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) carrying polypeptides that were 93 amino acids in length (ribo-mMDH-Met6) (26Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Translations contained nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (70%, v/v) (Promega), 20 μm minus methionine amino acid mixture, 0.9 mCi/ml Redivue l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), the in vitro transcription reaction (12.5%, v/v), and 0.3 units/ml RNasin. The translation reaction was inhibited with 1 mm cyclohexamide, brought up in 8 volumes of isolation buffer to a final concentration of 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 4 mm dithiothreitol, layered over 2 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, and RNCs were isolated by centrifugation in a SW55 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 46,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. RNC pellets were resuspended in ribosome binding buffer (RB, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 units/μl RNasin) and then clarified by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble materials. Ribosome concentration was determined by using a micromolar extinction coefficient of 60.8 at 260 nm, calculated using 4.5 × 106 Da as the molecular mass for the 80 S ribosome and an A260 of 13.5 for a 0.1% solution of ribosomes (28Collins P.G. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ribosomes were brought to 1–2 mg/ml with RB. Ribosome-luciferase complexes (ribo-Luc) consisting of the first 86 residues of luciferase (Luc) were synthesized as above using the T7 luciferase control plasmid (Promega) that was restricted in the coding region with Cfr10I (19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RNCs were used immediately, or aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Binding reactions were nearly identical for fresh and previously frozen RNCs (data not shown). RNC preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gels were visualized using a Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager. Images were analyzed using ImageQuaNT 5.2 software and digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Non-translating ribosomes were isolated from untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the same manner as RNCs and were resuspended in RB at a final concentration of 3–4 mg/ml. RNC-Mitochondria Binding Assays—RNCs (70 nm final concentration) and mitochondria (2 mg/ml final concentration) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl for 10 min at 22 °C followed by 2 min on ice. The final conditions of the binding reactions were: 55 mm mannitol, 18 mm sucrose, 75 mm KOAc, 8 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (binding buffer). After the binding reaction, 100 μl of binding buffer was added and the RNC-mitochondria complexes were isolated by centrifuging in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was separated from the pellet containing RNC-mitochondria complexes, the pellets were washed with binding buffer, re-isolated, and the amount of RNC binding to mitochondria was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To examine if RNC binding is saturable, binding assays were performed as above except that the RNC concentration was varied from 13 to 424 nm while keeping all other conditions constant. The disintegrations/min of RNC-mitochondria complexes was measured and the number of moles of RNCs bound was calculated using the following assumptions: 1) each RNC was loaded with a complete nascent chain; 2) there are 7 methionines in the mMDH-Met6 nascent chain and 4 methionines in the Luc nascent chain; 3) the specific activity of the [35S]methionine was 1,000 Ci/mmol; 4) the radiolabeled methionine concentration in the translation reaction was 0.61 μm and the unlabeled methionine concentration was 3.79 μm; and 5) 85% the radioactivity in RNC preparations was contained within a ribosome-associated nascent chain (see Fig. 1C). The amount of unlabeled methionines in the translation reaction was determined using the concentration of unlabeled methionines in the Redivue [35S]methionine (4.9 μm at 1,000 Ci/mmol and 15 mCi/ml) and the endogenous methionine concentration in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (5 μm) (29Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). One-site binding analysis (y = a·x/(b + x)) was performed using Sigma Plot 5.0 software to calculate binding maximums and the effective concentration to achieve one-half binding. By omitting mitochondria from the binding assay, background binding was determined to be ∼1% of the total (data not shown). Effects of Various Treatments in the Binding of RNCs to Mitochondria—To determine the contributions of the ribosomal component of RNCs in binding, competition binding assays were performed where the RNCs were simultaneously added to mitochondria with increasing amounts of non-translating ribosomes (0–516 nm). Competition assays were also performed with mitochondria that were pretreated with 5 μg/ml proteinase K using non-translating ribosome concentrations of 0–483 nm. Hyperbolic decay analysis (y = (a·b)/(b + x)) was used to calculate the concentration necessary to inhibit one-half of RNC binding using Sigma Plot 5.0 software. Analysis involving a non-inhibitable function was calculated using (y = y0 + (a·b)/(b + x)). Ribosome binding to proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane was assessed by subjecting mitochondria to limited proteolysis and then assaying ribosome binding. Mitochondria (10 mg/ml) were treated with proteinase K (0.1–10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 22 °C, and the reaction was inhibited with 2 mm Pefablock (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 5 min. As a control, one sample of mitochondria was put through the same conditions, except that proteinase K was omitted. Mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice in MIB to remove excess proteinase K and Pefablock, and resuspended in MIB in a volume equal to the protease reaction. Mitochondria were immediately used for the binding assays described above. To determine the contribution of cations on RNC binding, RNC-mitochondria complexes were prepared under the conditions described above, except that the reaction was scaled up to a final volume of 280 μl. After forming RNC-mitochondria complexes, the reaction was separated into 12 20-μl samples and the complexes were pelleted at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To determine the effect of KCl on binding, the resulting pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of KCl (0–500 mm) and incubated at 22 °C for 5 min. The remaining RNC-mitochondria complexes were isolated by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended, and the remaining binding was determined. To determine the contribution of magnesium cations, RNC binding was assessed by performing the above assay for KCl, except that magnesium chloride was omitted from the resuspension buffer. Sucrose Gradient Analysis of RNCs under Various Conditions—Either ribo-mMDH-Met6 or ribo-Luc (30 μg) was diluted in normal RB or RB that was supplemented with either 300 mm KCl (high salt) or 20 mm EDTA (minus magnesium) in a final volume of 400 μl. The samples were incubated at 22 °C for 5 min followed by 10 min on ice, layered over 4.8 ml of a 10–40% linear sucrose gradient containing the same buffer as the incubation, and centrifuged in a SW55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 46,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. Ten 500-μl fractions were collected and the A260 and counts/min were measured for each fraction. The counts/min measurements between experiments were normalized by calculating the relative counts/min in each fraction compared with the total within each experiment. Creating Ribosome-mMDH-Methionine6 Complexes—The extensive studies investigating RNC targeting to ER were used as a guide in developing assays to investigate ribosome-mitochondria interactions. As these studies have shown, stable RNCs represent the initial targeting stages of proteins that are targeted to, and imported across, membranes co-translationally (26Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E.

Cell. 1998; 9: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). mMDH was used to make RNCs because we had previously shown that the mMDH nascent chain is sufficient to stabilize ribosome binding to mitochondria and others have suggested that mMDH may be imported co-translationally (15Funfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17George R. Walsh P. Beddoe T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nascent chains of ∼90 residues were used so that 50 residues will be exposed outside the ribosomal structure (33Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which is sufficient to span both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (34Rassow J. Hartl F.U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We enhanced the mMDH nascent chain signal by adding 6 methionines to the carboxyl terminus because wild-type mMDH produced a weak signal in our binding assays. Fig. 1A is a schematic of a wild-type mMDH nascent chain and a mMDH-Met6 nascent chain, which consists of the first 83 amino acids of mMDH, followed by a 4-residue linker and 6 methionines. Fig. 1B is a phosphorimage of ribo-mMDH-Met6 that was separated by SDS-PAGE. As predicted, there are primarily two radiolabeled species that appear when RNCs are analyzed by SDS-PAGE: the nascent chain (10 kDa) and the peptidyl-tRNA (34 kDa). When ribo-mMDH-Met6 was treated with 1 mm puromycin, the entire radioactive signal migrated at 10 kDa indicating that the 34-kDa band is because of the covalent linkage of the tRNA to the nascent chain. This is consistent with the finding that when ribosomes come to the end of a mRNA that lacks a stop codon, the tRNA remains covalently linked to the nascent chain (26Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Hanes J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Ribo-Luc behaved in the same manner (data not shown). It was not necessary to increase the Luc nascent chain signal because it contains 4 methionines that can be radiolabeled. To ensure that the radioactive signal of RNC preparations actually represented ribosomes loaded with a nascent chain, either ribo-mMDH-Met6 or ribo-Luc was sedimented through a sucrose gradient and the fractions were collected. The radioactivity and ribosome content of each fraction was assessed by liquid scintillation counting and measuring the A260, respectively (Fig. 1C). We found that ∼85% of the radioactivity tracked with fractions that represented either monosomes or some level of polysomes. Therefore, we have created stable RNCs that can be used to determine the binding of ribosomes to mitochondria under various conditions. RNC Binding to Mitochondria Is Saturable—In Fig. 2, RNC binding to mitochondria was examined by performing binding assays using increasing amounts of either ribo-mMDH-Met6 or ribo-Luc. The binding of both RNC species increases as the concentration is increased from 13 to 424 nm and begins to plateau around 175 nm (Fig. 2A). The data from Fig. 2A is from one experiment and is represented as the number of moles of RNCs bound per milligram of mitochondria as ribosome concentration is increased. Although there appears to be a difference in binding, with ribo-Luc having a greater binding maximum than ribo-mMDH-Met6, this is actually because of the variability that occurs in RNC preparations. We observed a variability between RNC preparations in the amount of ribosomes that are actually loaded with a nascent chain and that the difference in the amount of ribosomes loaded directly correlated with the difference in the calculated binding maximums; the binding maximum increased linearly as the amount of ribosomes carrying a nascent chain increased (r2 = 0.87; data not shown). This was observed between, and within, the different RNC species. When mitochondria were saturated with RNCs from preparations that contained the greatest number of ribosomes loaded with a nascent chain (0.24 mol of nascent chain/mol of ribosome), one-site binding analysis calculated that they bound 4.7 pmol of RNC/mg of mitochondria (r2 = 0.99; Fig. 2A). Considering that all of the ribosomes are not loaded with a nascent chain, this value is in good agreement with our previous finding that the binding maximum of non-translating ribosomes to freshly isolated mitochondria is 9.6 pmol/mg mitochondria (19Crowley K.S. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17278-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the difference in the calculated binding maximums between RNC preparations, the amount of ribosomes loaded with a nascent chain did not affect the amount of RNCs needed to achieve half-maximal binding. To better illustrate this, the amount of RNCs bound for each data point was divided by the calculated binding maximum for that particular experiment and this normalized binding index was plotted against ribosome concentration (Fig. 2B). One-site binding analysis indicated that there is no difference in the binding affinities of the two RNC species, with a calculated half-maximal binding occurring at 61 nm for ribo-mMDH-Met6 and 59 nm for ribo-Luc. At the lowest concentrations of RNCs tested (an excess of mitochondria compared with RNCs), roughly 60% of the RNCs added were found bound to mitochondria (data not shown). The finding that RNC binding is saturable demonstrates that mitochondria contain a limited number of RNC binding sites. Mechanism of RNC Binding to Mitochondria—Studies have shown that ribosomes actively translating proteins interact with both protein and lipid components of isolated microsomes. The signal sequence interacts with both membrane lipids and the proteins of the translocation machinery, and the ribosomes bind directly to the proteins of the translocon (35Kalies K.U. Gorlich D.

FhuA is also the receptor for phages T5, T1, Φ80, UC-1, for colicin M and for the antimicrobial peptide microcin MccJ21. Energy for transport is provided by the cytoplasmic membrane complex TonB·ExbB·ExbD, which uses the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to transduce energy to the outer membrane. To accomplish energy transfer, TonB contacts outer membrane receptors. However, the stoichiometry of TonB· receptor complexes and their sites of interaction remain uncertain. In this study, analyses of FhuA interactions with two recombinant TonB proteins by analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that TonB forms a 2:1 complex with FhuA. The presence of the FhuA-specific ligand ferricrocin enhanced the amounts of complex but is not essential for its formation. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that FhuA·TonB interactions are multiple and have apparent affinities in the nanomolar range. TonB also possesses two distinct binding regions: one in the C terminus of the protein, for which binding to FhuA is ferricrocin-independent, and a higher affinity region outside the C terminus, for which ferricrocin enhances interactions with FhuA.

Gram-negative bacteria have evolved efficient acquisition systems for the uptake of scarce nutrients. One of the most sought after nutrients is iron, an element whose bioavailability is limited at physiological conditions, because it forms insoluble ferric hydroxides. Escherichia coli satisfies its iron requirements by expressing high affinity receptors at its cell surface. These proteins bind and transport iron-chelating siderophores from the external milieu into the periplasm in an energy-dependent manner. One such high affinity uptake system relies upon FhuA, receptor for the hydroxamate siderophore ferricrocin (Fc). 1The abbreviations used are: Fc, ferricrocin; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, resonance units; CM, cytoplasmic membrane; OM, outer membrane; LDAO, N-lauryldimethylamine oxide; CT, C-terminal; Mb, buoyant molecular mass; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; vbar, partial specific volume. 1The abbreviations used are: Fc, ferricrocin; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, resonance units; CM, cytoplasmic membrane; OM, outer membrane; LDAO, N-lauryldimethylamine oxide; CT, C-terminal; Mb, buoyant molecular mass; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; vbar, partial specific volume.

Energy for siderophore transport is provided by the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) complex TonB·ExbB·ExbD, which exploits the electrochemical potential from the proton motive force of the CM and transduces energy to the outer membrane (OM) (4Braun V. Braun M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although many proteins involved in TonB-dependent siderophore transport have been identified and studied, the molecular mechanism of siderophore uptake from the external environment to the periplasm of the bacteria remains obscure. Evidence for conformational changes occurring in FhuA following siderophore binding was provided by differential recognition by monoclonal antibodies of ligand-free versus ligand-loaded receptor (5Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Ismail A.A. Turnbull J.L. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At the atomic level, x-ray crystallographic structures of FhuA (6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W.

Science. 2002; 295: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) displayed conspicuous structural changes upon ligand binding. A switch helix (residues 24–29) on the periplasmic face of FhuA unwound to a random coil, and there was a 17-Å translocation of the extreme N terminus, proximal to the Ton box of FhuA. This conformational change was proposed to be a signal reporting the ligand-loaded status of FhuA to TonB (6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 7Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D.

The unwinding of a switch helix is therefore not a common mechanistic feature for all OM receptors. In vivo cross-linking studies of TonB and FepA provided the first biochemical evidence of interactions between TonB and OM receptors (11Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results corroborated genetic analyses where point mutations in the Ton box of FhuA were suppressed by mutations in the tonB gene, suggesting a functional interaction near Gln160 of TonB (12Schoffler H. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Gunter K. Braun V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additional cross-linking studies demonstrated that specific ligands of the OM receptors enhance their association with TonB (14Moeck G.S. Coulton J.W. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28391-28397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J.

Detailed analyses of TonB·BtuB interactions by site-directed spin labeling revealed that TonB requires a specific orientation for functional contact with the Ton box. Changes in conformation in the Ton box region caused by proline substitutions abrogated transport of the ligand (17Cadieux N. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5954-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of C-terminal TonB (residues 164–239) provided first evidence that TonB forms a dimer (18Chang C. Mooser A. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27535-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To date, two models for TonB-OM receptor interaction have been proposed. In what has been termed the propeller model (19Postle K. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), two TonB monomers are intertwined, interacting with OM receptors. This model suggested that dimerized TonB undergoes rotary motion, similar to the mechanism described for the bacterial flagellar motor that is powered by MotA and MotB. ExbB and ExbD are homologous to MotA and MotB (20Zhai Y.F. Heijne W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An alternate model describes the shuttling of TonB between the CM and OM (19Postle K. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Larsen R.A. Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The shuttle model is supported by in vivo labeling experiments that demonstrate periplasmic accessibility of the extreme N terminus of TonB to the cysteine-specific marker Oregon Green 488 maleimide. According to this model, TonB in complex with ExbB and ExbD in the CM are in an unenergized conformation. ExbB·ExbD use the proton motive force to energize TonB, allowing its C-terminal portion to interact with the OM. This may cause the release of the N terminus of TonB from the CM and transfer of stored potential energy from TonB to OM receptors, thereby facilitating ligand import. To analyze interactions between FhuA and TonB, we selected two complementary biophysical methods. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was used to determine the buoyant molecular weights and stoichiometries of two genetically engineered, soluble derivatives of TonB: a hexahistidine-tagged full-length TonB (H6.′TonB) consisting of residues 32–239 of the mature protein; and a hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal TonB (H6.′TonB (CT)), residues 155–239, both purified to homogeneity. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted for the two TonBs and for FhuA, either individually or as protein·protein complexes. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical biosensors (Biacore) were used to derive thermodynamic parameters of the interacting proteins. Our results demonstrate that the TonB·FhuA stoichiometry is 2:1, that TonB interacts with FhuA in an Fc-independent manner, that, in addition to its C-terminal portion, the N-terminal region of TonB participates in binding to FhuA, and that Fc modulates interactions between FhuA and the N-terminal region of TonB. Strains—Escherichia coli AW740 harbors plasmid pHX405 and expresses recombinant FhuA with a hexahistidine tag at position 405 (22Ferguson A.D. Breed J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Coulton J.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1636-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). E. coli ER2566, transformed with pET28 plasmid containing H6.′TonB, was similar to the construct described by Moeck and Letellier (15Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was corrected to reflect the wild-type sequences of residues 32–239 of TonB. In addition, E. coli ER2566 was the host strain for pET28 into which was cloned the gene for the C terminus of TonB (residues 155–239). All plasmids were confirmed for their sequence fidelity by DNA sequencing at Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University. Protein Purification—FhuA was purified (6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 22Ferguson A.D. Breed J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Coulton J.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1636-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in N-lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO; Fluka) and detergent-exchanged using Q-Sepharose anion exchange media (Amersham Biosciences) into 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (Calbiochem), hence-forth designated Biacore running buffer. H6.′TonB and H6.′TonB (CT) were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) followed by cation exchange on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to SPR experiments, each TonB protein was dialyzed into Biacore running buffer. To remove the hexahistidine tag, H6.′TonB was incubated with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences): 1 unit of protease per mg of H6.′TonB. After 3 h at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, capturing uncleaved H6.′TonB; the flow-through was applied to an SP-Sepharose column. Eluted protein was assayed by Western blotting with an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Cedarlane Laboratories Limited, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for the absence of the hexahistidine tag. TonB-reactive protein was confirmed by a cross-reactive monoclonal antibody that was raised against Trypanosoma brucei procyclin (CLP001A, Cedarlane) and that recognizes the proline-glutamic acid repeat portion of TonB protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the protein dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) and BCA assay (Pierce). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Samples were prepared for AUC by extensive dialysis against an AUC buffer: 100 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. In some experiments, AUC buffer was supplemented with either LDAO at 0.3% or n-octyltetraoxyethylene (C8E4; Bachem) at 0.4%. Protein concentrations were adjusted between 0.3 and 0.9 mg/ml. Ligand-loaded receptor was prepared by mixing Fc and FhuA in a 10:1 molar ratio, 30 min at room temperature. Excess Fc was removed by dialysis against AUC buffer using a Spectrapor dialysis membrane (POR-6, 25-kDa cutoff). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on all protein samples using a Beckman XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge. The sample and the reference sectors of 1.2-cm path length double-sector ultracentrifuge cells were filled with 400 μl of protein and AUC buffer, respectively. All sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 40,000 rpm, with absorbance scans monitored at 280 nm in 10-min intervals over a total spin time of 4 h at 24.6 °C. Protein complexes were formed immediately prior to each spin by mixing H6.′TonB:FhuA at 1:1 and at 2:1 molar ratios, or by mixing H6.′TonB (CT):FhuA at 4:1 and at 8:1 molar ratios. In both cases, H6.′TonB and H6.′TonB (CT) were varied relative to a fixed concentration of FhuA or FhuA plus Fc. Analysis of AUC Data—Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed by the computer program SEDFIT (23Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Initial sedimentation profiles were obtained by fitting the data to the Continuous c(S) Model. Global frictional ratios determined by c(S) analysis were allowed to float to convergence. Buoyant molecular weight (Mb) and final s values were determined using the discrete non-interacting species model of SEDFIT. In sedimentation experiments involving LDAO, the detergent was modeled as a known sedimenting species with an s value of –0.1 and a micellar buoyant molecular mass of 2700 Da. Sedimentation coefficients of uncomplexed FhuA, H6.′TonB, and H6.′TonB (CT) were initially estimated from c(S) analyses and then refined by direct fitting to the Lamm equation using the non-interacting discrete species model of SEDFIT. Initial Mb values were obtained from the known molecular weights of each protein. Both s and Mb were allowed to float to convergence using the non-linear regression algorithms of SEDFIT. Sedimentation velocity data of mixtures of FhuA plus H6.′TonB and FhuA plus H6.′TonB (CT) were fit to the discrete non-interacting species model using constrained analysis. From spins of the individual species, initial sedimentation parameters (s and Mb) of uncomplexed components (s1 and s2) were entered. The initial sedimentation parameters of predicted complexes (s3) were input based on the predicted Mb as integral additions of the Mb values of s1 and s2; initial sedimentation coefficients of s3 were estimated from c(S) analyses. The sedimentation parameters of s3 were then floated to convergence, whereas s1 and s2 parameters remained constrained. Fits to the model were evaluated on the basis of the distribution of residuals and r.m.s.d. errors. Optimization of the fits was performed by varying stoichiometric combinations of s1, s2, and s3 and repeating the constrained analyses until random distributions of residuals and minimal r.m.s.d. errors were obtained. As an unbiased test, data from mixtures of FhuA plus H6.′TonB and FhuA plus H6.′TonB (CT) were fit to the non-interacting discrete species model, assuming the presence of species with sedimentation parameters equivalent to uncomplexed s1 and s2. The r.m.s.d. errors and residuals were compared with those obtained from optimized fits in which the presence of s3 was modeled. Immobilization of Recombinant TonB Proteins on Biacore Sensor Chips—Several sensor chip surfaces were assessed for binding of TonB proteins and for their regeneration, including CM4 (formerly B1), CM5, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), C1, and F1. Optimally, solutions of H6.′TonB (150 nm) and H6.′TonB (CT) (1.8 μm) in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) were used to covalently immobilize the proteins on CM4 sensor chips using amine coupling procedures via N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride; deactivation was accomplished with ethanolamine (24Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). To prepare control surfaces, activation and deactivation procedures were performed in the absence of TonB proteins. Preliminary and Steady-state Assays by SPR—SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore 2000 and a Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB) and were carried out in triplicate at 25 °C. The data collection rate was set to 10 Hz. Biacore running buffer was used to dilute FhuA. Steady-state experiments were conducted with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. To reach steady-state equilibrium, the injection time was 1200 s followed by injections of buffer for 240 s. Regeneration was achieved by three pulses (1 min) of 5 mm NaOH, 0.1% Tween 20, and a subsequent EXTRA-CLEAN procedure. Biacore Data Preparation and Analysis—Data were prepared using the double referencing method (25Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). For global analysis, the sensorgrams were transformed to concentration units using the molecular weights of injected proteins. All curves were reduced to 700 evenly spaced sampling points. For each set of individual curves corresponding to injections of various concentrations of FhuA over the same surface, global fitting was carried out using a simple Langmuirian model in the SPRevolution software package of De Crescenzo and colleagues (26De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Lortie R. Debanne M.T. O'Connor-McCourt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For steady-state analysis, the apparent thermodynamic dissociation constants were determined by plotting the control corrected plateau value (Req) versus the injected concentration of FhuA. In the case of H6.′TonB, the Kd values were derived by fitting the experimental Req values to a model of two independent population interactions, Req=Rmax1×(C/(C+Kd1))+Rmax2×(C/(C+Kd2)) where C corresponds to the injected FhuA concentration, Rmax1 and Rmax2 correspond to the maximal amount of FhuA that can be bound to each active H6.′TonB population, and Kd1 and Kd2 to their respective thermodynamic dissociation constants. Alternatively for H6.′TonB (CT), the experimental data were adequately fit with a simple interaction model in Equation 2 as follows. Req=Rmax×(C/(C+Kd))(Eq. 1) The fitting procedure was performed in Microsoft Excel by non-linear regression with Rmax values and Kd values as floating parameters. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments on FhuA, H6.′TonB, and H6.′TonB (CT), individually and in complex, were performed in buffers containing the neutrally buoyant detergent C8E4 such that actual molecular weight values of the protein components could be determined. In advance of determining the stoichiometry of FhuA·TonB complexes, sedimentation parameters of the individual uncomplexed species were determined and used as prior knowledge in the analysis of sedimenting complexes. To obtain the best Mr estimates of the sedimenting species, apparent vbar (Φ) values were determined from the known molecular weights of each protein, along with the buoyant molecular weights (Mb) determined by fitting to the non-interacting discrete species model of SEDFIT. As observed by Boulanger et al. (28Boulanger P. le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), their experimentally determined vbar of FhuA (0.776 ml/g) is significantly different from the value predicted from the amino acid sequence of the protein (29Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Similarly, using the known Mr of FhuA and the experimental Mb, we determine a Φ of 0.775 ml/g (Table I), in contrast to the sequence-predicted value of 0.735. The Φ values were also determined for H6.′TonB and H6.′TonB (CT), and these values (0.719 and 0.714 ml/g; Table I) also differ from vbars predicted from amino acid sequences (0.740 and 0.730 ml/g, respectively). The fits of the sedimentation velocity data of uncomplexed species to the non-interacting discrete species model were in all cases excellent with random distributions of residuals and least-squares (r.m.s.d.) errors of fit equal to or less than 0.0061.Table ISedimentation velocity parameters from uncomplexed FhuA, H6.′TonB, and H6.′TonB (CT)ProteinΦaΦ = (1 - Mb/Mseq)/r.MbbBuoyant molecular weight determined from fit to a non-interacting discrete species model.MrcMr = Mb/(1 - Φ).MseqdMseq = molecular weight calculated from primary amino acid sequence.sr.m.s.d.er.m.s.d. = least squares error of the fit to the non-interacting discrete species model.f/foff/fo = frictional ratio.ml/gDaFhuA0.77518,44081,95580,0003.500.00521.76FhuA plus Fc0.77518,43081,91180,0003.600.00611.76H6.′TonB0.7196,98927,43024,9001.400.00362.39H6.′TonB (CT)0.7146,80023,09011,9031.620.00351.96a Φ = (1 - Mb/Mseq)/r.b Buoyant molecular weight determined from fit to a non-interacting discrete species model.c Mr = Mb/(1 - Φ).d Mseq = molecular weight calculated from primary amino acid sequence.e r.m.s.d. = least squares error of the fit to the non-interacting discrete species model.f f/fo = frictional ratio. Open table in a new tab Given these Φ values, FhuA sedimented as a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of ∼80,000 Da; the presence of bound Fc resulted in a small yet reproducible increase in the sedimentation coefficient from 3.50 to 3.60 s, possibly due to structural rearrangements in the protein upon binding to ligand as has been observed in many of the crystal structures of bacterial OM receptors (6Ferguson A.D.

H6.′TonB (CT) sedimented as a dimer with a Mr of 23,090 (Table I). Using the same data sets, analyses modeling the presence of additional oligomeric states of either TonB species resulted in extremely poor fits to the data (data not shown). Of the three proteins analyzed, c(S) analysis indicates that H6.′TonB has the highest frictional ratio: f/fo = 2.39. This is consistent with H6.′TonB having an extended conformation in solution. H6.′TonB (CT) has a lower frictional ratio (f/fo = 1.96), because it is a truncated form of H6.′TonB; furthermore, H6.′TonB (CT) is dimeric, resulting in the protein having a globular shape as compared with the more extended H6.′TonB. FhuA and the two TonB species were then mixed together for sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and were analyzed for the formation of complexes: FhuA plus H6.′TonB (CT) and FhuA plus H6.′TonB, both in the absence and presence of Fc. Sedimentation data were analyzed by first fitting to a continuous c(S) model to obtain initial sedimentation parameters. This was followed (Table II) by direct fitting to the Lamm equation by a non-interacting discrete species model using the c(S)-derived sedimentation parameters and known molecular weights of individual proteins as prior knowledge (Table I). Refinement of c(S)-derived sedimentation parameters by the non-interacting species model resulted in converged s values similar to those obtained from the c(S) analysis, indicating a good correlation between the two models. However, unlike c(S) analysis, which employs a global frictional coefficient, the non-interacting species model resolves proteins of different diffusion coefficients, allowing for the calculation of buoyant molecular weight (Mb) for each sedimenting species. In the context of AUC, the term “non-interacting species” refers to sedimenting species that do not reversibly interact over the time frame of the experiment and can include stable protein complexes. In our case, a complex of FhuA and H6.′TonB (CT) or of FhuA and H6.′TonB is considered “non-interacting” if it is observed to sediment as a single species with a molecular weight that is additive of the uncomplexed components and with a sedimentation coefficient that does not significantly change as the ratio of the uncomplexed components is varied.Table IISedimentation velocity parameters of FhuA plus H6.′TonB and FhuA plus H6.′TonB (CT) complexes determined by fits to a non-interacting discrete species modelFhuAH6.′TonBH6.′TonB (CT)Fcs1Mb1s2Mb2s3Mb3ΦavgaΦavg = weight-averaged apparent vbar of complex.Mr3s1/s2/s3r.m.s.dDaDaDaml/gDa% ctot14-(3.50)bConstrained parameters are indicated by parentheses.(18,440)(1.62)(6,800)4.4724,1770.761101,15855/18/270.005718-(3.50)(18,440)(1.62)(6,800)4.5325,3360.761106,00829/31/330.004914+(3.60)(18,430)(1.62)(6,800)4.6924,0990.761100,83238/08/400.005118+(3.60)(18,430)(1.62)(6,800)4.4425,2500.761105,64837/21/420.006411-(3.50)(18,440)(1.40)(6,989)3.2433,4030.762140,34871/05/150.008012-(3.50)(18,440)(1.40)(6,989)3.2731,7360.762133,34466/17/170.005711+--1.90(13,978)3.5331,2010.762131,09600/10/520.004512+--1.90(13,978)3.4231,2980.762131,50400/20/500.0058a Φavg = weight-averaged apparent vbar of complex.b Constrained parameters are indicated by parentheses.

https://openalex.org/W2087876952,"Many members of the type II nuclear receptor subfamily function as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). A permissive heterodimer (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/RXR) allows for ligand binding by both partners of the receptor complex. In contrast, RXR has been thought to be incapable of ligand binding in a nonpermissive heterodimer, such as that of thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/RXR, where it has been referred to as a silent partner. However, we recently presented functional evidence suggesting that RXR in the TR/RXR heterodimer can bind its natural ligand 9-cis-RA in cells. Here we extended our study of the interrelationship of TR and RXR. We examined the potential modulatory effect of RXR and its ligand on the activity of TR, primarily using a Gal4-TR chimera. This study led to several novel and unexpected findings: 1) heterodimerization of apo-RXRα (in the absence of 9-cis-RA) with Gal4-TR inhibits T3-mediated transactivation; 2) the inhibition of Gal4-TR activity by RXRα is further enhanced by 9-cis-RA; 3) two different RXR subtypes (α and β) differentially modulate the activity of Gal4-TR; 4) the N-terminal A/B domains of RXR α and β are largely responsible for their differential modulation of TR activity; and 5) the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA appears to differentially affect T3-mediated transactivation from the Gal4-TR/RXRα (which is inhibited by 9-cis-RA) and TRE-bound TR/RXRα (which is further activated by 9-cis-RA) heterodimers. Taken together, these results further support our recent proposal that the RXR component in a TR/RXR heterodimer is not silent and, more importantly, reveal novel aspects of regulation of the activity of the TR/RXR heterodimer by RXR and RXR ligand.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar). The superfamily is generally divided into two groups. Type I receptors are classic steroid receptors that mediate the actions of steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids, progestins, androgens, and estrogens. TRs and RXRs belong to the type II group, whose additional members include the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), the receptor for 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (VDR), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and many orphan receptors whose ligands (if any) remain to be defined. Members of the superfamily exhibit similar domain structures. Typically, a receptor molecule consists of a highly variable N-terminal A/B domain, a highly conserved central DNA binding domain (DBD; region C) that is characterized by two signature zinc fingers, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD; regions D, E, and F) that is less conserved at the amino acid sequence level but exhibits remarkably similar overall structure (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar).Several distinct features exist in the actions of type I and type II receptors. For example, type I receptors are usually associated with heat shock protein chaperones in the absence of ligand and do not bind DNA (2Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 5Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The binding of a ligand dissociates the chaperones and allows for type I receptors to engage in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. In contrast, type II receptors are not known to be chaperone-associated and thus can constitutively bind to DNA with or without ligands (6Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol.

A functional consequence of constitutive DNA binding by certain type II receptors is that in addition to their ligand-mediated transactivation function, they can also mediate transcriptional repression in the absence of ligand (9Casanova J. Helmer E. Selmi-Ruby S. Qi J.-S. Au-Fliegner M. Desai-Yajnik V. Koudinova N. Yarm F. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol.

Greene M.E. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another difference among type I and type II receptors is that type I receptors primarily act as homodimers that bind to their palindromic hormone response elements (HREs) (2Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 5Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), whereas type II receptors can bind to DNA as monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers (7Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The corresponding HREs are also complex for type II receptors, which can be organized as direct repeats (DR), inverted repeats and everted repeats (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar).A particularly intriguing feature of type II receptors is that many of them function as heterodimers with RXR (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). In this regard, RXR appears to have a central role in the actions of those type II receptors, such as TRs, RARs, VDR, and PPARs, all of which are believed to function in the context of heterodimers with RXR (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). The primary dimerization interface lies in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptor partners, whereas a region from the DBD is also involved (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of recently identified orphan receptors (e.g. LXR, FXR, PXR, and BXR) were also found to heterodimerize with RXR, extending the partners for RXR heterodimerization (14Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is unclear why so many type II receptors engage RXR as their functional partner, although it has been proposed that this may reflect an ancient requirement for heterodimerization during the evolution of nuclear receptors (15Wan Y.J. An D. Cai Y. Repa J.J. Hung-Po Chen T. Flores M. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Chen J. Chien K.R. French S. Mangelsdorf D.J. Sucov H.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that whereas type II receptors that form partners with RXR can bind their ligands autonomously, their binding to specific HRE(s) usually requires or is facilitated by heterodimerization (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 14Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Aside from its role in facilitating DNA binding, heterodimerization between a type II receptor and RXR provides the potential for the resulting heterodimer as a functional entity to respond to the signaling by two different ligands. Indeed, this is the case in permissive heterodimers such as PPAR/RXR, which is activated by both PPAR and RXR ligands (16Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). In contrast, RXR heterodimers with TR, RAR, and VDR have been thought to be nonpermissive, since the treatment of the RXR ligand alone usually fails to elicit transactivation from these heterodimers (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 17Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K.

This observation had led to a silent partner model for RXR in these nonpermissive heterodimers, where it is proposed that the allosteric control by TR or RAR somehow prevents RXR from engaging in ligand binding. However, a number of studies over the last several years have provided evidence indicating that RXR in a RAR/RXR heterodimer can bind its ligand and mediate its functional or biological consequences (19Chen J.Y.

In a recent report, we presented functional evidence indicating that in the TR/RXR heterodimer, RXR can bind its natural ligand 9-cis-RA in cells and thus is not a silent partner (25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although ligand binding by RXR does not directly elicit transactivation from the apo-TR/liganded RXR heterodimer, it promotes the dissociation of a corepressor(s) from TR (25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This may in turn dynamically modulate the transcriptional output of the heterodimer by attenuating the repression function of apo-TR and/or enhancing the activation function of liganded TR.The notion that RXR is not a silent partner raises the possibility that RXR and/or its ligand may play more than a subordinate role in the activity of the TR/RXR heterodimer. TR clearly plays a major role in defining the transcriptional property of the TR/RXR heterodimer by directly mediating repression (in the absence of T3) and activation (in the presence of T3) (12Qi J.-S. Desai-Yajnik V. Greene M.E. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

In contrast, the role of RXR (other than facilitating DNA binding) and its ligand is not well characterized. This is in part due to the fact that the silent partner model for RXR in the TR/RXR heterodimer has been a rather prevalent notion in the field. Only recently have questions been raised about this model by any systematic study (25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An additional complexity is that by using a traditional TRE-based reporter assay, it is difficult to differentiate the relative contributions of several potential mechanisms by which RXR could affect reporter activity (which include, for example, facilitation of DNA binding by TR, competition with TR for the DNA binding site, and the potential direct contribution to transcriptional regulation). Thus, in this report, we examined the potential modulatory effect of RXR on the activity of TR, primarily using a Gal4-TR chimera model system. The results from these studies provide further support for our recent proposal that RXR is not a silent partner in the TR/RXR heterodimer and, more importantly, reveal novel roles of RXR and RXR ligand in regulating the activity of the TR/RXR heterodimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs for Transfection Studies—The Gal4-responsive reporters pMC110 and G5-tk-CAT were described previously (9Casanova J.

The Gal4-ER plasmid expressing a Gal4 fusion of the mERα LBD was obtained from Malcolm Parker (27Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M.A. Parker M.G. Mol.

The empty expression vector (referred to as pCMX) that contains no cDNA insert was used as the control. Plasmids expressing full-length cTRα, the LBD of cTRα (residues 120–408), the LBD of mRXRβ (residues 185–438), and the control empty expression vector pEX0, as well as plasmids expressing Gal4-TR-VP16 (GTV) and Gal4-TR(408)-VP16 (GT(408)V), have been described previously (7Forman B.M.

It contains a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the ΔMTV basal promoter linked to a synthetic direct repeat (separated by a 4-bp gap, or DR4) TRE sequence (AGGACAcaggAGGACA, where the core repeated sequence is shown in capital letters). The vector expressing cPSF, a dominant negative form of the DBD-interacting corepressor PSF, was described previously (30Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Vectors expressing RXRαΔA/B and RXRβΔA/B were generated by PCR-based cloning. The PCR primers were AU1 (5′-CGC GAC GTG AAG CTT TAT ACC ATG GCT TGC GCC ATC TGC GGG GAC CGC TC-3′), AD1 (5′-CGC GAC GTG GGT ACC CCG CAG GCC TAA GTC ATT TGG TG-3′), BU1 (5′-CGC GAC GTG AAG CTT TAT ACC ATG GCT TGT GCA ATC TGC GGG GAC AGA AG-3′), and BD1 (5′-CGC GAC GTG GGT ACC TCT GAG CTC AGG CCA GTT GAT GG-3′). The PCR templates were pCMV-hRXRα and pCMV-hRXRβ, respectively. Primer pairs AU1 + AD1, and BU1 + BD1, were used to PCR-amplify fragments encoding the entire DBD-LBD regions of hRXRα and hRXRβ, respectively, with their corresponding A/B domains removed. In each case, the resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and Acc65I, gel-purified, and ligated to a pEX-based vector digested with the same pair of enzymes. The resulting pEX-RXRαΔA/B and pEX-RXRβΔA/B vectors were confirmed by sequence analysis. Each vector contains a desired RXR expression unit linked to an optimized Kozak sequence originally present in pEX (28Forman B.M. Samuels H.H.

Primers XRA1 (5′-CGC GAC GTG CTC GAG ATC CCA TGG ACA CCA AAC ATT TCC TG-3′) and XRA2 (5′-CGC GAC GTG GGT ACC TCA GAT GTG CTT GGT GAA GGA AGC-3′) were used to PCR-amplify the region encoding the entire A/B domain of hRXRα (residues 1–134), using pCMV-hRXRα as the template. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and Acc65I, gel-purified, and ligated to a green fluorescent protein vector digested with the same pair of enzymes. The resulting green fluorescent protein-hRXRαA/B vector was confirmed by sequence analysis.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8371-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In some cases, cells were transfected using Geneporter 2 (Gene Therapy Systems) as described earlier (32Li D. Wang F. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8371-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The identity and amount of different plasmids used in transfection experiments are indicated in the figure legends. For each transfection, the final DNA mixture is evenly divided into four or six wells of cells in a 6-well plate. Due to higher transfection efficiency of Geneporter 2, generally about 5–10-fold less plasmids were used compared with similar studies using calcium phosphate coprecipitation. After transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C for about 45 h before being harvested. Ligands were included in the medium when indicated (final concentrations were 1 μm for T3 and 9-cis-RA and 100 nm for E2). CAT activities were then determined as previously described (25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with a typical CAT reaction mixture containing 50 μg of cell lysate proteins incubated at 37 °C for about 14 h. Transfections were done in duplicate or quadruplicate, with variations among duplicates or quadruplicates less than 15%. We found that inclusion of an internal control plasmid itself could at times influence the CAT reporter activity, and thus, it was not routinely employed. Instead, CAT activity was normalized to the amount of proteins assayed. To minimize potential variations in transfection efficiency, direct comparison was only made among samples within a single experiment performed at the same time using identically set up cells. Generally, an experiment was repeated three times to confirm that an observed pattern is reproducible.RESULTSApo-RXRα Negatively Modulates Gal4-TR-mediated Transactivation—RXR is generally believed to play a subordinate role in the TR/RXR heterodimer, where it facilitates the binding of TR to certain TREs such as the DR4 sequence (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Indeed, the transcriptional property of the TR/RXR heterodimer is mainly dictated by TR, since the presence or absence of T3 determines whether the heterodimer functions as an activator or a repressor (12Qi J.-S. Desai-Yajnik V. Greene M.E. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Zhang J. Zamir I. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, whether RXR makes any direct contribution to the transcriptional output of the TR/RXR heterodimer per se is largely undocumented.We utilized a Gal4-TR chimera and a Gal4 reporter model system to study the potential effect of RXR. In a classic TRE-based reporter assay system, the effect of RXR on TR-mediated reporter activation may occur through several mechanisms, including facilitation of DNA binding by TR, competition with TR for the DNA binding site, and the potential direct contribution to transcriptional regulation. In contrast, the use of a Gal4-TR system allows for a more direct assessment of the RXR contribution to the transcriptional output of the TR/RXR heterodimer independent of TRE binding. To this end, we transfected HeLa cells with the Gal4 reporter pMC110, and Gal4-TR. As shown in Fig. 1, Gal4-TR mediated potent activation of the reporter in the presence of T3. Surprisingly, cotransfection of RXRα led to a significant reduction of Gal4-TR-mediated transactivation (Fig. 1). The observed 2–3-fold inhibition of Gal4-TR activity by apo-RXRα was consistently observed in different experiments. This result suggests that apo-RXRα elicits a negative modulatory effect on the activity of liganded TR, at least under the described experimental conditions.9-cis-RA Further Enhances RXRα-mediated Inhibition of Gal4-TR Activity—We recently reported functional evidence suggesting that RXR in the TR/RXR heterodimer can bind its natural ligand 9-cis-RA in cells and thus is not a silent partner (25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In light of this, we further examined the effect of RXRα on the activity of Gal4-TR in the presence of 9-cis-RA. HeLa cells were transfected with pMC110 and Gal4-TR, along with either pCMX-RXRα or a control vector (pCMX), to examine T3-mediated transactivation. In the absence of exogenously expressed RXRα, Gal4-TR strongly activated the reporter in the presence of T3, and this activation was not affected by 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2A). Coexpression of RXRα led to several observations. First, incubation with 9-cis-RA alone did not activate the reporter (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with previous results from us and others suggesting that a TR/RXR heterodimer cannot be directly activated by the RXR ligand alone (18Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 25Li D. Li T. Wang F. Tian H. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, RXRα was found to inhibit T3-mediated transactivation by Gal4-TR in the absence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2A), confirming our earlier observations (e.g. in Fig. 1). Third, to our surprise, incubation with 9-cis-RA was found to further enhance RXRα-mediated inhibition of Gal4-TR activity (Fig. 2A). Thus, whereas apo-RXRα reduced the activity of Gal4-TR by about 2-fold, the treatment of 9-cis-RA led to a further reduction of about 3–4-fold. Overall, liganded RXRα down-regulated the activity of Gal4-TR by about 8-fold (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A, the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA further enhances RXRα-mediated inhibition of Gal4-TR activity. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of the pMC110 reporter and 50 ng of the Gal4-TR expression vector. The vector expressing RXRα or the control vector pCMX (350 ng each) was cotransfected as indicated. CAT activities were determined for cells without ligand (open columns), with 9-cis-RA only (hatched columns), with T3 only (filled columns), and with T3 + 9-cis-RA (wavy columns). B, liganded RXRα but not liganded TR mediates inhibition of Gal4-TR activity. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of the pMC110 reporter and 50 ng of the Gal4-TR expression vector to examine the activity of Gal4-TR in the presence of T3. At the left, an increasing amount of RXRα expression vector (from 100 to 1000 ng) or the control vector pCMX (at an equivalent amount) was included in the transfection (in the presence of 9-cis-RA) to examine liganded RXRα-mediated inhibition of Gal4-TR activity. At each data point, the -fold inhibition was determined by comparing the activities of Gal4-TR in the presence of liganded RXRα and in the presence of pCMX control. At the right, similar transfection experiments were performed, where instead of RXRα, an increasing amount of TR expression vector (from 100 to 1000 ng) or the control vector pEX0 (at an equivalent amount) was included in the transfection to examine the possibility of “squelching” (inhibition of Gal4-TR activity) by liganded TR. We detected no inhibition (squelching) of Gal4-TR activity even when 1000 ng of TR expression vector was transfected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One potential explanation for the inhibition of Gal4-TR-mediated transactivation by liganded RXRα is squelching (33Meyer M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2066883769,"FhuA belongs to a family of specific siderophore transport systems located in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. The energy required for the transport process is provided by the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane and is transmitted to FhuA by the protein TonB. Although the structure of full-length TonB is not known, the structure of the last 77 residues of a fragment composed of the 86 C-terminal amino acids was recently solved and shows an intertwined dimer (Chang, C., Mooser, A., Pluckthun, A., and Wlodawer, A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27535–27540). We analyzed the ability of truncated C-terminal TonB fragments of different lengths (77, 86, 96, 106, 116, and 126 amino acid residues, respectively) to bind to the receptor FhuA. Only the shortest TonB fragment, TonB-77, could not effectively interact with FhuA. We have also observed that the fragments TonB-77 and TonB-86 form homodimers in solution, whereas the longer fragments remain monomeric. TonB fragments that bind to FhuA in vitro also inhibit ferrichrome uptake via FhuA in vivo and protect cells against attack by bacteriophage Φ80.

TonB fragments that bind to FhuA in vitro also inhibit ferrichrome uptake via FhuA in vivo and protect cells against attack by bacteriophage Φ80. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two lipid bilayers, the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane enclosing the peptidoglycan layer. A number of different transport pathways regulate the uptake of essential compounds into the cell. One class of outer membrane transporters is connected to the cytoplasmic membrane by the TonB protein; therefore, they are called TonB-dependent receptors. The three-dimensional structure of a short C-terminal fragment of TonB is available in the literature (1Chang C. Mooser A. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27535-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One of these receptors in Escherichia coli is the ferric hydroxamate uptake system containing the integral outer membrane protein FhuA (2Coulton J.W. Mason P. Cameron D.R. Carmel G. Jean R. Rode H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 181-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which serves as a receptor for the iron siderophore ferrichrome (FC), 1The abbreviations used are: FC, ferrichrome; Cit, ferric dicitrate; NB, nutrient broth; LB, Luria-Bertani media; r.m.s.d., root-meansquare deviation. the antibiotics albomycin and rifamycin CGP 4832, colicin M, and microcin J25, and the phages T1, T5, and Φ80. Other TonB-dependent iron transporters of the outer membrane include FecA for ferric dicitrate (Cit) uptake (3Pressler U. Staudenmaier H. Zimmermann L. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FepA for enterobactin uptake (4Lundrigan M.D. Kadner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10797-10801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and BtuB for vitamin B12 uptake (5Heller K. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transport of all of these ligands requires energy, which is provided by the electrochemical potential of the proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (proton motive force) and is mediated by the protein complexes ExbB, ExbD, and TonB (6Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol.

ExbB/D is located in the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas TonB is attached to the membrane by an N-terminal hydrophobic anchor (9Postle K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar). The major part of TonB spans the periplasmic space to reach the outer membrane receptors. The crystal structure of FhuA reveals a two domain architecture (10Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 11Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar): a β-barrel consisting of 22-antiparallel strands and a globular domain at the N terminus (residues 1–160), called the cork or plug domain filling most of the interior of the barrel. Stability studies using differential scanning calorimetry experiments have shown the autonomous behavior of the cork and the β-barrel that unfold at different temperatures (12Bonhivers M. Desmadril M. Moeck G.S. Boulanger P. Colomer-Pallas A. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The interactions between the cork domain and the β-barrel consist of nine salt bridges and more than 60 hydrogen bonds (11Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Located at the periplasmic side of FhuA there is a short α-helix, the so-called “switch helix” (residues 24–29). This α-helix has been found to unwind during or following ligand binding, indicating that this structural change might be a signal for TonB to bind FhuA (10Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 11Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This unwinding was observed in the crystal structures of FhuA with bound ferrichrome (10Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or albomycin (13Ferguson A.D. Braun V. Fiedler H.P. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the crystal structure of FhuA with the rifamycin derivative CGP-4832 demonstrates that ligand binding causes destabilization rather than unwinding of the switch helix (14Ferguson A.D. Ködding J. Walker G. Bos C. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Braun V. Welte W. Structure. 2001; 9: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These structures present a specific ligand binding site that is exposed to the external medium and determined by specific hydrogen bonds between the substrate and residues of both the cork and the β-barrel domain. The crystal structures of FepA (15Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L. Palnitkar M. Chakraborty R. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), FecA (16Ferguson A.D. Chakraborty R. Smith B.S. Esser L. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 295: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and BtuB (17Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) show similar molecular architectures. The presence of a switch helix has only been observed in the structures of FhuA and FecA but not in FepA and BtuB, implying that this structure element is not essential for TonB recognition in general. The pathway of the ligand from the binding site to the periplasm and the mechanism of its transport have not yet been elucidated. Two possibilities are discussed in the literature: 1) conformational change of the cork domain opens up a channel large enough for the siderophore to slide through (18Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 318-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or 2) the cork domain leaves the barrel together with the bound siderophore (19Usher K.C. Ozkan E. Gardner K.H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10676-10681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A highly conserved motif among all TonB-dependent siderophore receptors is the TonB-box (residues 7–11: DTITV in FhuA), which plays an important role in the receptor-TonB interaction (20Larsen R.A. Foster-Hartnett D. McIntosh M.A. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The TonB-box is located at the periplasmic side of the cork domain close to the switch helix. Furthermore, the globular domains of FhuA and FepA are exchangeable without loss of substrate specificity. For example, a mixed mutant consisting of an FhuA-barrel and an FepA-cork retains the specificity for ferrichrome, the natural substrate for FhuA (23Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Different cork-barrel combinations from several bacterial strains led to the same results (24Killmann H. Braun M. Herrmann C. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3476-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Complexes between wt FhuA or wt FepA with the periplasmic domain of TonB were characterized in vitro (25Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, up to now there has been no in vitro evidence for interactions between the receptor lacking the cork domain and the TonB protein, and new investigations of FepA indicated that the barrel domain alone could not behave as an active transporter (26Vakharia H.L. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5508-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The TonB protein of E. coli is composed of 239 amino acids of which 17% are proline residues. Most of these are located between residues 75 and 107, spanning the periplasmic space to link the outer membrane receptor with the cytoplasmic membrane (27Postle K. Skare J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11000-11007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elongated conformation of this proline-rich region has been demonstrated by NMR studies (28Evans J.S. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Dorman C.J. Higgins C.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This region is not essential for the process of energy transduction (29Larsen R.A. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 857Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Two other significant regions can be distinguished: 1) a hydrophobic region at the N terminus (residues 1–32) anchoring TonB to the cytoplasmic membrane. The amino acids between Ser-16 and His-20 were found to be essential for the interaction with the membrane-embedded proteins ExbB and ExbD (30Larsen R.A. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8111-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and 2) a C-terminal domain that forms the contact to the outer membrane receptor. The three-dimensional structure of a C-terminal fragment (residues 155–239) reveals a cylinder-shaped dimer (1Chang C. Mooser A. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27535-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each monomer contains three β-strands and a short α-helix arranged in a dimer so that the six β-strands build a large antiparallel β-sheet. The first 10 N-terminal amino acids of this fragment are not visible in the electron density map because of their flexibility. The structure of another energy transducing protein, TolA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been solved recently (31Witty M. Sanz C. Shah A. Grossmann J.G. Mizuguchi K. Perham R.N. Luisi B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite a sequence identity of only 24% (Lalign server) the crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of TolA shows a similar structure and topology, however without dimer formation. The importance of the dimer formation for the mechanism of energy transduction is thus not yet understood. However, it has been shown that a region of TonB contributing the critical interaction with the receptor is located around amino acid 160 (32Günter K. Braun V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by the observation that synthetic nonapeptides with sequence identity to the amino acid region between residues 150 and 166 of TonB are able to inhibit the capacity of wt FhuA to transport siderophores (33Killmann H. Herrmann C. Torun A. Jung G. Braun V. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3497-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the C-terminal domain of TonB in the interaction with FhuA, we have investigated FhuA-TonB interactions using purified C-terminal TonB fragments of different lengths shown in Fig. 1 (consisting of 77, 86, 96, 106, 116, or 126 amino acid residues, respectively). All TonB fragments except TonB-77 were able to form a complex with FhuA. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and tryptophan fluorescence measurements also showed that the fragments with 86 or more amino acid residues behave differently than TonB-77. In parallel, we analyzed the ability of these TonB fragments to inhibit ferrichrome (FC) and ferric citrate (Cit) uptake in vivo and to protect cells against attack by bacteriophage Φ80. Construction of Plasmids Encoding TonB Proteins—All constructions, with the exception of pBADTonB118, were created using PCR, and the products were first cloned into an intermediate vector (pSKII+ or pKSII+). The oligodeoxynucleotides used are listed in Table I. The plasmid pCSTonB30 (34Howard S.P. Herrmann C. Stratilo C.W. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which encodes residues 33–239 of the periplasmic domain of TonB cloned into pET30a (Novagen), was used as a template to generate the four smaller tonB fragments. Standard PCR conditions were used, with US10–US12 and US26 being the forward primers unique for each fragment as indicated, each one giving a PstI cut site on the 5′-end of the fragment, and US5 as the return primer, creating a HindIII restriction site on the 3′-end of the fragment. In combination with US5, oligonucleotide US10 was used to create pBADTB86, oligonucleotide US11 for pBADTB77, oligonucleotide US12 for pBADTB96, and oligonucleotide US26 for pBADTB106. Each fragment encodes the final number of amino acids of the periplasmic domain of TonB as specified by the TonB fragment number, i.e. pBADTB77 encodes the final 76 amino acids of the periplasmic TonB domain plus a methionine as the first amino acid. The PstI-HindIII-digested product was then electrophoresed, and the TonB fragment isolated and cloned into PstI-HindIII-digested pBAD/gIII. The construct pBADBTB118 was obtained by digesting pMFTLP (34Howard S.P. Herrmann C. Stratilo C.W. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with PstI and HindIII and cloning the fragment into PstI-HindIII-digested pBAD/gIII. Each of these recombinant clones codes for an 18-amino acid (54-bp) signal sequence provided by the vector. Cloning the TonB fragment into the PstI site of pBAD/gIII downstream of this sequence also adds an 8-amino acid linker at the N-terminal side. For pTB77 to pTB126, UR134, UR135, and UR141 through UR144 were the forward primers for each fragment as indicated, each one creating an NdeI site on the 5′-end of the fragment, and UR136 was the return primer, which hybridizes to the pET30a vector just downstream of the multiple cloning site and contains a Bpu1102I site. Cloning of the resulting PCR fragment back into pCSTonB30 created the plasmids pTB77–pTB126, which in each case expresses the indicated TonB fragment without a signal sequence.Table IOligodeuxynudeotides used in creation of pBADTonB and pTB recombinant clonesOligodeoxy nucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′)US5GAA TTC AAG CTT TTA CCT GTT GAG TAA TAG TCAUS10CTG CAG CAT TAA GCC GTA ATC AGC CUS11CTG CAG CAC CGG CAC GAG CAC AGG CAUS12CTG CAG CAC CGG TTA CCA GTG TGG CTT CAUS26CTG CAG TCA AGT ACA GCA ACG GCT GCA ACC AUR134CAT ATG GCA TTA AGC CGT AAT CAG CCUR135CAT ATG CCG GCA CGA GCA CAG GCAUR136GCT AGT TAT TGC TCA GCG GUR141CAT ATG CCG GTT ACC AGT GTG GCT TCAUR142CAT ATG TCA AGT ACA GCA ACG GCT GCAUR143CAT ATG TTT GAA AAT ACG GCA CCG GCA CUR144CAT ATG AAA CCC GTA GAG TCG CGT C Open table in a new tab Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table II.

Ravi T.S. Ratcliffe M.J. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4250-4259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was purified as described in the literature (38Ferguson A.D. Breed J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Coulton J.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1636-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with the following changes: for binding experiments the purification was stopped before the detergent exchange from LDAO to DDAO. Fractions containing FhuA were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm ammonium acetate pH 8.0 with 0.05% LDAO (N,N-dimethydodecylamine-N-oxide/FLUKA). Purification of the C-terminal TonB Fragments—C-terminal fragments of TonB (77, 86, 96, 106, 116 and 126 residues, respectively) were over-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids pTB77 to pTB126 (shown in Table II) and induced at OD600 = 0.7 by addition of 0.4 mm IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, BioVetra). Protein expression was maintained at 37 °C for 2 h. The pellets from 4 × 500 ml cell culture (2xYT/Kan50) were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0/100 mm NaCl/1 mm EDTA) and the cells were broken by french press (4000 PSIG/3 passes). After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min the supernatant was loaded on an SP Sepharose cation-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and was then washed with buffer A. TonB was eluted from the column with a NaCl gradient at a salt concentration of about 300 mm NaCl. The eluate was then desalted on a Sephadex G25 column (Amersham Biosciences) before loading onto another strong cation-exchange column (Source 15s/Amersham Biosciences). The eluted TonB protein containing about 250 mm NaCl was again desalted on a Sephadex G25 column with buffer A (no EDTA) and yielded protein at a concentration of ca. 4 mg/ml. The mobility of the fragments on 15% SDS-PAGE corresponded to their theoretical molecular masses (Fig. 2). The purification was carried out within 1 day to avoid protein degradation. For analytical ultracentrifugation and crystallization experiments an additional gel filtration step was added. The protein was concentrated up to 10 mg/ml (Amicon spin-column with YMCO 5,000) and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. The TonB sample was then loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superose 12 HR 60/10, Amersham Biosciences). Binding experiments with FhuA were done with TonB fragments that were purified without this gel filtration step but mixed with 0.05% LDAO immediately before the incubation with FhuA. Purification of the FhuA405.H6/TonB Complexes—Protein solutions containing FhuA (10 mg/ml) and TonB fragment (4 mg/ml), respectively, were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:2 resulting in a large molar excess of TonB in the samples. The protein mixture was then incubated overnight in the presence of 60 μm ferrichrome (Mr = 740, Biophore Research). Glycerol was subsequently added to the protein solution to a final concentration of 10%. The sample was then applied to a Superose 12 HR 60/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with the following buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0/50 mm NaCl/0.05% LDAO. The flow rate was kept at 0.1 ml/min. The protein-containing fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue (Fig. 3). For Western blots to detect TonB we used anti-TonB antiserum from rabbit as previously described (34Howard S.P. Herrmann C. Stratilo C.W. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—The C-terminal TonB-77 fragment was crystallized under the following conditions: TonB-77 was purified as described above and concentrated to 20 mg/ml (Centricon YM 5,000). Hanging drop crystallization plates were used with 1-ml reservoir solution containing 2.0 m sodium formate and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, mixing 2 μl of reservoir solution with 2 μl of protein solution in the drop. Crystals of the size 120 × 120 × 120 μm3 grew at 18 °C within 2 weeks (Fig. 4). For diffraction data collection single TonB-77 crystals were soaked in cryobuffer: reservoir solution with 20% glycerol for 1 min and were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline ID14-4 at the Electron Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 Å. Raw data were processed with the program package XDS (39Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3240) Google Scholar) to a final resolution of 2.7 Å. Higher resolution shells were omitted from the refinement process because of very high R values (>50%). The space group was determined to be P6422 with the following unit cell parameters: a = 61.58 Å, b = 61.58 Å, c = 121.95 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, and γ = 120°. The structure of TonB-77 was solved using molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (40Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4173) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The program LSQCAB from CCP4 (42Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the r.m.s.d. for the Cα atoms between TonB-77 and the existing structure 1IHR of TonB-86. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The purified C-terminal fragments of TonB (77, 86, 96, and 116, respectively) were analyzed by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments using an AN 60-Ti rotor 316 in a Beckman XL-A Optima equipped with an optical absorbance system (Ariel Lustig, Biozentrum Basel, Switzerland). All protein solutions were freshly purified and gel-filtrated. The buffer was 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl in all experiments. Velocity sedimentation data were obtained from 0.5 mg/ml protein solutions and a rotor speed of 54,000 rpm at room temperature obtaining the sedimentation coefficient (s20,w). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done at different concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mg/ml and a rotor speed of 24,000 and 28,000 rpm at room temperature. The partial specific volume (ν) of the proteins was calculated on the basis of the amino acid distribution (45Edelstein S.J. Schachman H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was near the mean value of globular proteins 0.73 cm3/g. These experiments were used to determine the molecular mass (Mr), hydrodynamic radius (RH), and the frictional ratio (f/f0) (46Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) of the purified TonB fragments. The calculations were done with the computer program SEGAL 3SEGAL program description. Analytical Ultracentrifugation at Biozentrum Basel. Available at www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/personal/jseelig/AUC/software00.html. based on the numerical fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium pattern to one or two exponential functions. Tryptophan Fluorescence of the C-terminal TonB Fragments—Fluorescence spectra were measured from TonB-77, TonB-86, TonB-96, and TonB-116, respectively, at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm over the range from 320 to 400 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, L550B). The fragments were purified as described above and used at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Assay of Bacteriophage Susceptibility—Susceptibility to bacteriophage φ80λi21 was measured by dropping 5-μl aliquots of 10-fold dilutions of the phage onto freshly poured overlays (100 μl containing ∼108 cells of the various strains added to 3 ml of LB soft agar and poured onto LB plates). The LB soft overlay, LB plates, and bacterial cultures each contained the indicated concentration of arabinose when measuring the effect of the arabinose induction level on the susceptibility of the cells to bacteriophage. The susceptibility was recorded as the –log of the highest dilution of phage that gave a confluent lysis zone of the bacterial lawn. Assay of Siderophore-dependent Growth and Iron Transport—The ability of the strains to gain iron from either ferrichrome (FC) or ferric citrate (Cit) was assayed on NB agar plates (34Howard S.P. Herrmann C. Stratilo C.W. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To limit the free iron available to the cells, dipyridyl was added to both the agar plates and NB soft overlay at a final concentration of 250 μm. When measuring the effect of the arabinose induction level on the ability of the cells to transport iron, the various indicated levels of arabinose were added. Sterile paper discs (6-mm diameter) were saturated with 10 μl of either 1 mm FC, 10 mm sodium citrate, or 100 mm sodium citrate and left to dry. The discs were then placed onto the overlays, which consisted of ∼108 bacteria added to 3 ml of NB soft agar. The plates were i"

Previous results have indicated that residues in the D1D2 domains are crucial for high affinity interaction with human interleukin 5 (IL5). Yet, it is the D2D3 domains that have sequence homology with the classic cytokine recognition motif that is generally assumed to be the minimum cytokine-recognizing unit. In the present study, we used kinetic interaction analysis of alanine-scanning mutational variants of IL5Rα to define the residues involved in IL5 recognition. Soluble forms of IL5Rα variants were expressed in S2 cells, selectively captured via their C-terminal V5 tag by anti-V5 tag antibody immobilized onto the sensor chip and examined for IL5 interaction by using a sandwich surface plasmon resonance biosensor method. Marked effects on the interaction kinetics were observed not only in D1 (Asp55, Asp56, and Glu58) and D2 (Lys186 and Arg188) domains, but also in the D3 (Arg297) domain. Modeling of the tertiary structure of IL5Rα indicated that these binding residues fell into two clusters. The first cluster consists of D1 domain residues that form a negatively charged patch, whereas the second cluster consists of residues that form a positively charged patch at the interface of D2 and D3 domains. These results suggest that the IL5·IL5Rα system adopts a unique binding topology, in which the cytokine is recognized by a D2D3 tandem domain combined with a D1 domain, to form an extended cytokine recognition interface.

Interleukin 5 (IL5) 1The abbreviations used are: IL5, interleukin 5; IL5Rα, interleukin 5 receptor α chain; sIL5Rα, soluble form of IL5Rα; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; CRM, cytokine recognition motif; FnIII, fibronectin type III; RU, resonance unit(s). is a T cell-derived cytokine that plays a central role in maturation and proliferation of eosinophils (1Karlen S.

IL5 exerts biological functions through recruitment of a cell surface receptor composed of two polypeptide chains (2Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Fache I. Tuypens T. Fischkoff S. Fiers W. Devos R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), α and β. The α chain is IL5-specific and is called IL5 receptor α (IL5Rα), whereas the β chain is shared with IL3 and GM-CSF (3Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W.

Today. 1992; 13: 495-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and is called common β chain (βc). The α chains for IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5Rα also share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity and constitute a distinct subgroup within the cytokine receptor family (5Goodall G.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because IL5 has been implicated in the pathology of eosinophil-related inflammatory diseases, designing specific antagonists for IL5Rα may offer therapeutic benefits in the treatment of such diseases (6Mckinnon M. Banks M. Solari R. Robertson G. Sanderson C. Interleukin-5: From Molecule to Drug Target for Asthma. Marcel Dekker. Inc., New York1999: 299-320Google Scholar, 7Foster P.S. Hogan S.P. Yang M.

IL5 initially binds to IL5Rα with high affinity, and the resulting complex recruits βc to induce cytoplasmic signal transduction. Human IL5Rα alone binds IL5 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.3-0.6 nm when expressed in COS cells (8Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The binding affinity is increased only 2- to 5-fold when human α and β chains are co-expressed (3Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In other words, IL5Rα provides most of the IL5 binding energy, whereas βc is essentially for signaling. IL5Rα consists of an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region. A soluble form of IL5Rα (sIL5Rα) containing only the extracellular region was cloned and expressed (9Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetink G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This form has provided a convenient tool for biochemical and biophysical characterizations of the receptor, showing that stoichiometry of interaction between IL5 and IL5Rα is 1:1, and the Kd value is 0.6 nm (10Devos R.

Extensive studies have been carried out on human IL5 to identify epitopes important for receptor α and βc recruitment. Crystallographic analysis has revealed that IL5 is a symmetric homodimer in which each helical bundle domain is composed of three helices (A-C) from one chain and one (D) from the other (13Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E. Graber P. Wells T.N. Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis analyses have shown the importance of charged residues in helix B (His38, Lys39, and His41), CD turn (Glu88, Glu89, Arg90, and Arg91), and helix D (Glu110) for IL5Rα binding (14Morton T.

Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has led to identification of a functionally active IL5 mimetic containing the CD turn sequence 88SLRGG92, instead of the native sequence 88EERRR92. In the CD turn of this IL5 mutant, the only charged residue is the Arg90. Regarding βc binding epitope, Glu13 in helix A is thought to be a key residue for βc recruitment (16Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Verhee A. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. Oefner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, structure-function relationships for IL5Rα are less delineated. IL5Rα is a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (18Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar), which is characterized by the presence of the so-called cytokine recognition motif (CRM). The CRM is composed of two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, each consisting of ∼100 residues with four conserved Cys residues in the first FnIII domain and a conserved WSXWS (Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser, where X is any amino acid residue) sequence in the second FnIII domain. The FnIII domain forms a β-sandwich where seven β-strands (A-G) are arranged in the Greek key topology. As found in immunoglobulin (Ig) folds, the β-sheet of FnIII is folded between strands D and E. In the first FnIII domain of CRM, one disulfide bond links the neighboring strands A and B and another disulfide bond links strands D and E, cross-linking the two sheets of the sandwich. The WSXWS sequence is located between strands F and G in the second FnIII domain and plays a structural role in correctly positioning the second domain (19Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). There are two kinds of domain architecture in the class I cytokine receptor superfamily: one consists of a single CRM, like growth hormone, erythropoietin, and IL4 receptors; another contains extra FnIII and/or Ig-like domains in addition to one or more sets of CRM, like gp130, IL12 p70, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. In either case, it is a general rule that a cytokine is recognized by its receptor CRM. Structures of complexes of these receptors have been solved using x-ray crystallography, demonstrating that the two FnIII domains of CRM form an L shape, and a cytokine is bound to the elbow region, which is constituted by several loops connecting the β-strands (reviewed in Ref. 20Walter M.R. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 46-57Google Scholar). As Bazan has proposed (18Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar), the conserved residues in CRM appear to contribute to a skeletal framework, which would be enriched by cytokine-specific residues in these loops. The extracellular region of IL5Rα is composed of three FnIII domains, D1, D2, and D3 (domain numbering from the N terminus). Previously, chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis analyses have demonstrated the importance of D1D2 domains, in which Asp55, Asp56, Tyr57, Glu58, and Arg188 residues play a crucial role in the specific interaction of IL5Rα with IL5 (21Cornelis S. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Sanderson C.J. Guisez Y. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this previous mutagenesis was not targeted to elucidate the entire binding sites on IL5Rα molecule. Indeed, it is the D2D3 domains that have sequence homology with the classic CRM that is assumed to be the minimum cytokine-recognizing unit. From these standpoints, a wider-ranging binding site analysis seemed potentially useful to more fully elucidate the IL5 recognition mechanism of IL5Rα. A major starting point of this work was the realization that electrostatic interactions may be dominant in the IL5·IL5Rα system, because the important binding residues on the human IL5 molecule are mostly charged amino acids, and some residues already identified in IL5Rα as important for IL5 binding also are charged. In the present study, therefore, we selected 43 charged amino acid resides from D1, D2, and D3 domains of human IL5Rα for site-directed mutagenesis. We performed kinetic interaction analysis of alanine-scanning mutational variants of sIL5Rα in an attempt to expand the definition of the mechanism of molecular recognition of the IL5·IL5Rα interaction. Mutations that diminished the high affinity binding were found to be located in the D3 (Arg297) domain as well as in D1 (Asp55, Asp56, and Glu58) and D2 (Lys186 and Arg188) domains. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that mutagenic changes of Asp55 and Arg188 appear to have the greatest impact on the fast association rate of IL5·IL5Rα interaction. The effects of mutation can be rationally interpreted in terms of tertiary structure. The homology-deduced IL5Rα structure indicated that the IL5 binding interface of receptor α comprises a cluster of negatively charged residues from D1 domain and a cluster of positively charged residues from D2D3 domains. Together, the results suggest the possibility that the IL5·IL5Rα system adopts a unique interaction topology, in which the cytokine is recognized by a D1 domain and a D2D3 tandem domain. Materials—Human IL5 protein was prepared as described previously (22Scibek J.J. Evergren E. Zahn S. Canziani G.A. Van Ryk D. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The anti-human IL5Rα monoclonal antibody, α16 (23Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Verhee A. Brusselle G. Van Ostade X. Vandekerckhove J. North J. Rankin S.M. Kay B. Robinson D.S. Blood. 2000; 95: 1600-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. J. Tavernier (University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium). All the enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). All the oligonucleotide DNA primers, anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody, Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells, cell culture media, and l-glutamine solution (200 mm) were purchased from Invitrogen Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). For surface plasmon resonance measurements, the sensor chip CM5, surfactant P20, N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5), and 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) were purchased from Biacore Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). S2 Cell Expression of IL5Rα and Mutagenesis—pMTAL-IL5Rα (12Johanson K. Appelbaum E. Doyle M. Hensley P. Zhao B Abdel-Meguid S.S. Young P. Cook R. Carr S. Matico R. Cusimano D. Dul E. Angelichio M. Brooks I. Winborne E. McDonnell P. Morton T. Bennett D. Sokoloski T. McNulty D. Rosenberg M. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9459-9471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template for generating a DNA fragment containing the soluble form of human IL5Rα (sIL5Rα). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and ApaI and ligated into the NcoI and ApaI sites of the Drosophila expression vector, pMT/Bip/V5-His A plasmid (Invitrogen), yielding pMT-sIL5Rα-V5-His. In this construct, the gene for sIL5Rα was placed behind the Drosophila metallothionein promoter and the Bip secretion signal sequence. The C terminus of sIL5Rα was linked to a V5 epitope sequence and a hexahistidine sequence (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence of final product is RSPW-sIL5Rα1-315-GPFEGKPIPNPLLGLDSTRTGHHHHHH (V5 epitope sequence is underlined). For the alanine substitution variants, mutations were introduced into pMT-IL5Rα-V5-His using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Presence of the desired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Mutation sites are shown in Fig. 1B. Each plasmid was amplified in DH5α cells and purified for the subsequent transient transfection by using an S.N.A.P. midi prep kit (Invitrogen). Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with the vector pMT-IL5Rα-V5-His using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) and grown in serum-free medium supplemented with 20 mml-glutamine. Protein expression was induced by addition of 600 μm copper sulfate 3 days after transfection. Cell-free supernatant was collected after 2 days and stored at -20 °C for the following binding analysis. The same procedure was used to obtain mutant proteins. Levels of expression were measured for both cell cultures and precipitants by Western blot using anti-human IL5Rα polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) and anti-histidine tag polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To obtain the precipitants, cells were lysed using CytoBuster (Novagen) and centrifuged 5 min at 15,000 × g. Surface Plasmon Resonance Interaction Analysis—The kinetic interaction assay was performed using a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). All the experiments were conducted at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) with 0.005% P20. Immobilization of antibodies on a CM5 sensor chip was carried out according to the standard protocol of the amine coupling method (BIAapplication handbook; Biacore). Briefly, ∼1 mg/ml protein solution was diluted 100 times in 10 mm acetate (pH 4.5) and injected onto a biosensor surface that had been pre-activated with a 1:1 mixture of 200 mm N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, followed by the injection of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5). Flow cell 1 was used to immobilize 17b (anti-human immunodeficiency virus gp120 monoclonal antibody (24Dowd C.S. Leavitt S. Babcock G. Godillot A.P. Van Ryk D. Canziani G.A. Sodroski J. Freire E. Chaiken I.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7038-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) as a negative control, whereas the other three flow cells were used to immobilize, respectively, anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), α16 (non-neutralizing anti-human IL5Rα monoclonal antibody (23Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Verhee A. Brusselle G. Van Ostade X. Vandekerckhove J. North J. Rankin S.M. Kay B. Robinson D.S. Blood. 2000; 95: 1600-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and 2B6R (non-neutralizing anti-human IL5Rα monoclonal antibody (22Scibek J.J. Evergren E. Zahn S. Canziani G.A. Van Ryk D. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). Typically, the amounts of immobilization were around 2000 resonance units (RUs). The expressed sIL5Rα was captured tightly by the antibodies immobilized on flow cells 2-4. On the other hand, other cell culture components passed through the sensor chip flow cells without binding (analogously as one would expect for affinity chromatography or other affinity capture). Subsequently, the real-time interaction of IL5 with the antibody-captured sIL5Rα was measured without detecting the large bulk effect caused by the cell culture components. To regenerate chip surfaces, both captured and bound proteins were removed from the antibody surfaces with 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5. For this sensor assay, all procedures were automated to create repetitive cycles of injection of cell-free culture (10 μl/min), 0-50 nm of IL5 (50 μl/min), and the regeneration buffer (100 μl/min). Injection time for the variants was varied to achieve a similar extent of capturing (300-600 RU, depending on the experiment). For the low-affinity variants (D55A, D56A, and R188A), the binding assay was repeated using up to 250 nm IL5. Non-linear least-squares analysis was used to calculate the association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff, respectively). Prior to the calculation, the binding data were corrected for nonspecific interaction by subtracting the negative control surface data (flow cell 1) from the reaction surface data (flow cells 2-4) and further corrected for buffer effect by subtracting the signal from buffer injections from those of protein sample injections (double referencing (25Myszka G.D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)). The interaction curves thus obtained were globally fit using a model for Langmuir 1:1 binding with mass transfer (BIAevaluation software, Biacore). The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as Kd = koff/kon. Individual kon, koff, and Kd values were obtained from at least three separate experiments. Homology Modeling—The D1 and D2D3 domains of human IL5Rα were modeled separately using the crystal structure of the D2 and D1D2 domains of the rat prolactin receptor (26Elkins P.A. Christinger H.W. Sandowski Y. Sakal E. Gertler A. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which were identified with a low E value by PSI (Position-specific Iterative) BLAST search (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). The Cartesian coordinate of chain B in Protein Data Bank ID 1F6F, which corresponds to the high affinity receptor of rat prolactin receptor, was used as a template. The sequence alignments obtained with PSI BLAST search were manually modified by considering the conserved residues and the alternating pattern of hydrophobic residues in the class I cytokine superfamily (18Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). The final sequence alignments showed 21% identity and 42% similarity for D1 domain and 25% identity and 43% similarity for D2D3 domains of IL5Rα (Fig. 1B). These sequence alignments were used to build tertiary structures of D1 and D2D3 domains by means of a comparative homology modeling method. An ensemble of 50 structures was generated by the program MODELLER (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar). In the initial modeling process, we noticed that sulfhydryl groups of Cys249 and Cys296 residues in D3 domain are close in three-dimensional space, supporting the prediction of the disulfide bridge between them (29Devos R. Guisez Y. Plaetinck G. Cornelis S. Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Foley L.H. Scheffler J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the disulfide bond between Cys249 and Cys296 was added as a restraint condition. Basic steric principles such as close contacts or violation of stereochemistry were examined using the PROCHECK program (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional profiles of the models were examined using the program ProsaII (31Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Based on these quality checks, the best modeled structures were chosen. To interpret the result of mutational analysis, IL5 (crystal structure (13Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E. Graber P. Wells T.N. Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)) and IL5Rα D2D3 domain (modeled structure) were superimposed on the crystal structure of the placental lactogen complex with prolactin receptor (26Elkins P.A. Christinger H.W. Sandowski Y. Sakal E. Gertler A. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, the structure of D1 domain of IL5Rα was manually aligned to the structure of D2D3 domain, because there is no information on the relative orientation between D1 and D2 domains. The final model (Fig. 2A) exhibited good stereochemistry and showed that no residues fell into disallowed regions of phi-psi space (a Ramachandran plot is shown in Fig. 2B). The accuracy of the modeled structures was also assessed by using the ProsaII program, which is based on Eisenberg’s three-dimensional profile method (32Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar). The combined Z-scores (ProsaII terminology) for D1 and D2D3 domains were -4.12 and -4.88, respectively, which are low enough to consider the predicted structures reliable. The Z-scores of template structures were -4.96 and -6.98, respectively. The higher Z-score of D2D3 domains than that of the template was attributed to the long loop insertion between strands A and B in D2 domain, judging from the ProsaII energy plot (data not shown). Modeled structures of D1 and D2D3 domains appear reasonable in several important ways. First, the modeled structures had the basic features, such as disulfide bonds in D2 domain and the spatial alignments of conserved tryptophan and arginine residues in D3 domain, which are commonly seen in the structures of class I cytokine receptors (Fig. 2A). It may be noted that three of four N-glycosylation sites in human IL5Rα were conserved with rat prolactin receptors. The modeled structures showed that the amide groups of Asn15, Asn111, Asn196, and Asn224 in the estimated N-glycosylation sites were exposed to solvent and seem to have enough space for post-translational modification by bulky carbohydrate moieties. Expression and Antibody Capture of sIL5Rα Mutational Variants—We systematically replaced the charged amino acid residues (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, and histidine) of human sIL5Rα singly or doubly to alanine. To reduce the number of the mutants that had to be made, we chose the residues in the predicted loop regions, which are generally employed to bind a ligand in class I cytokine receptors (Fig. 1B). Almost all of the mutational variants made in this study were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and secreted into the cell culture in roughly equal amounts (30-40 nm), as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Expression of secreted proteins was taken as an indicator that these molecules were stably folded. Six variants failed to secrete into the culture media (Fig. 3B). Alanine substitutions in these variants (H71A, K167A/D168A, R172A, D189A, R260A, and D279A/D280A) might have caused unstable structure or reduction of solubility. It cannot be ruled out from our current data that these residues could be involved in ligand binding. All of the non-secreted variants were found to be remote from the deduced epitope for IL5 binding (see “Discussion”). Five of these variants are for residues in D2 (K167A/D168A, R172A, and D189A) or in D3 (R260A and D279A/D280A). These residues may well stabilize the structure through internal interactions. We examined the ability of anti-V5 tag antibody, α16, and 2B6R to capture wild type sIL5Rα. Cell-free culture supernatant containing sIL5Rα was injected onto all the flow cells. The three antibodies could capture sIL5Rα selectively, while few nonspecific components were bound to the positive control surface. The optimal regeneration condition, for removing sIL5Rα from anti-V5 tag antibody and α16, was 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5. This condition was effective in both removing all sIL5Rα and preserving the capturing capacity of the antibodies (less than 1% loss of capacity per cycle). However, the conditions we tested for 2B6R caused a more than 5% loss of the capturing capacity after each cycle of capture and regeneration, and therefore we omitted use of 2B6R in further experiments. Next, we compared the capture of the secreted sIL5Rα variants using anti-V5 tag antibody and α16. Anti-V5 tag antibody captured all the variants as much as wild type sIL5Rα. As expected, these alanine substitutions did not affect the interaction between C-terminal V5 tag and anti-V5 tag antibody. On the other hand, α16 could not capture three variants, D142A, E145A/D146A, and K200A/H201A. Fig. 4A shows real-time sensorgrams during the capturing process when wild type sIL5Rα and the variants were injected onto the α16 immobilized surface. Alanine substitutions of Glu145 and Asp146 completely impaired the interaction with α16, indicating that these two residues are crucial for α16 binding. Interestingly, Glu145 and Asp146 residues are located at the top of D2 domain and are surrounded by Asp142, Lys200, and His201 (Fig. 4B), whose alanine substitution diminished α16 capturing. IL5 Binding Activity of sIL5Rα Variants—The kinetics of interaction between human IL5 and sIL5Rα was measured by using a sandwich surface plasmon resonance biosensor method (Fig. 5A (14Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Although IL5 is a homodimeric protein, it has been shown that the stoichiometry of IL5·IL5Rα interaction is 1:1 (10Devos R. Guisez Y. Cornelis S. Verhee A. Van der Heyden J. Manneberg M. Lahm H.W.

In order to directly evaluate the importance of cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in epithelial transport, bovine PDE5 (a bona fide cGMP-PDE), was ectopically expressed in vivo. Transgenic UAS-PDE5 Drosophila were generated, and PDE5 expression was driven in specified tubule cells in vivo by cell-specific GAL4 drivers. Targeted expression was verified by PCR and Western blotting. Immunolocalization of PDE5 in tubule confirmed specificity of expression and demonstrated localization to the apical plasma membrane. GAL4/UAS-PDE5 tubules exhibit increased cG-PDE activity and reduced basal cGMP levels compared with control lines. We show that wild-type and control tubules are sensitive to the PDE5-specific inhibitor sildenafil and that GAL4/UAS-PDE5 tubules display enhanced sensitivity to sildenafil, compared with controls. cGMP content in GAL4/UAS-PDE5 tubules is restored to control levels by treatment with sildenafil. Thus bovine PDE5 retains cGMP-degrading activity and inhibitor sensitivity when expressed in Drosophila. Expression of PDE5 in tubule principal cells results in an epithelial phenotype, reducing rates of basal and cGMP-/Cardioaccelatory peptide2b(CAP2b)-stimulated fluid transport. Furthermore, inhibition of PDE5 activity by sildenafil restores basal and cGMP-stimulated fluid transport rates to control levels. However, corticotrophin releasing factor-like-stimulated transport, which is activated by cAMP signaling, was unaffected, confirming that only cGMP-stimulated signaling events in tubule are compromised by overexpression of PDE5. Successful ectopic expression of a vertebrate cG-PDE in Drosophila has shown that cG-PDE has a critical role in tubule function in vivo and that cG-PDE function is conserved across evolution.

The transgene also provides a generic tool for the analysis of cGMP signaling in Drosophila. An important role of cGMP in epithelial fluid transport has been demonstrated in the insect equivalent of the vertebrate renal system, the Malpighian tubules (1Davies S.-A. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 1123-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Malpighian tubules are fluid-transporting, osmoregulatory organs that are critical for insect life (2Dow J.A.T. Davies S.A. Adv. Insect Physiol. 2001; 28: 1-83Crossref Google Scholar). Drosophila tubules, which constitute an important genetic model for transporting epithelia (3Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), display elevated rates of fluid transport when stimulated by either exogenous cGMP, which enter tubule cells via a cyclic nucleotide transporter (4Riegel J.A.

Davies, unpublished data. have been described previously in tubules. Furthermore, genetic modulation of cGK activity (2Dow J.A.T. Davies S.A. Adv. Insect Physiol. 2001; 28: 1-83Crossref Google Scholar) and pharmacological inhibition of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cG-PDE) activity (5Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar) both result in an epithelial phenotype. cG-PDE has also been shown to be important in regulating physiological responses of the tubule to transgenic modulation of NO production (10Broderick K.E. MacPherson M.R. Regulski M. Tully T. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1207-C1218Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). NO/GMP signaling is compartmentalized to principal cells in the main fluid-secreting segment of tubules, containing the electrogenic vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) pump (11Dow J.A.T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which energizes fluid transport. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies suggest that cGMP signaling modulates V-ATPase activity (6Davies S.A. Huesmann G.R. Maddrell S.H.P. O'Donnell M.J. Skaer N.J.V. Dow J.A.T. Tublitz N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that cGMP signaling may regulate ion transport in tubules. A role for cGMP signaling in ion transport processes in vertebrate kidney has also been shown, where NO inhibits sodium/potassium/chloride co-transport as well as sodium/potassium V-ATPase activity in the macula densa (12Welch W.J. Wilcox C.S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). cGMP has also been shown to influence insertion of aquaporins in vertebrate kidney cells (13Bouley R. Breton S. Sun T. McLaughlin M. Nsumu N.N. Lin H.Y. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given the importance of cGMP in fluid transport, homeostasis of cGMP must be critical to tubule function. Previous work (7Davies S.A. Stewart E.J. Huesmann G.R. Skaer N.J.V. Maddrell S.H.P. Tublitz N.J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: R823-R827Google Scholar, 8Kean L. Cazenave W. Costes L. Broderick K.E. Graham S. Pollock V.P. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) has shown that inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase reduces cGMP-stimulated fluid transport and that cG-PDE activity modulates fluid transport (5Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). However, as the biochemical characteristics of Drosophila PDEs have not yet been established, and we wished to investigate the role of cGMP-specific PDEs in tubule function, we used a transgenic method to ectopically express a well characterized vertebrate cG-PDE, bovine PDE5, in Drosophila. The recent annotation of the Drosophila genome shows that PDE5 is not encoded (flybase.bio.indiana.edu/genes/). As such, the targeting of a bona fide cG-PDE to Drosophila may be a valuable approach. PDE5 is a 100-kDa cGMP-binding and cGMP-specific PDE, which acts as a homodimer. cGMP binds with high specificity at two allosteric cGMP-binding sites found in the regulatory region of the enzyme (14Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PDE5 is expressed in lung epithelial tissue (15Pyne N.J. Burns F. Agents Actions. 1993; 43 (suppl.): 35-49PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in modulating NO-induced vasopressin release in rat small intestine (16Kurjak M. Fritsch R. Saur D. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 827-836Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PDE5 has also been found in kidney, where cG-PDE activity is high in glomeruli and in tubules (17Dousa T.P. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 29-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In particular, PDE5 activity is the dominant cG-PDE in glomeruli; increased PDE5 activity in this region of the kidney is associated with pathogenicity in rat kidney (18Lee E.Y. Humphreys M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F3-F6PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests the importance of cG-PDE in renal tissue. Only one PDE5 gene is known so far, PDE5A, from which there are two major splice variants, PDE5A1 and PDE5A2 (19Loughney K. Hill T.R. Florio V.A. Uher L. Rosman G.J. Wolda S.L. Jones B.A. Howard M.L.

Phillips S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PDE5 is selectively inhibited by zaprinast, dipyridamole, and sildenafil. Sildenafil acts to occupy the same sites within the catalytic domain as cGMP and is the most potent inhibitor of PDE5 (21Turko I.V. Ballard S.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the in vivo roles of specific gene products, targeted expression of transgenes is a useful approach. Targeting genes of choice to designated regions and to cells in vivo is achieved in Drosophila by using the GAL4/UAS enhancer trap system (22Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To target expression of the PDE5 gene to different cell types of the tubule, two cell type-specific P{GAL4} enhancer trap lines (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were used to direct cell-specific expression of the GAL4-responsive PDE5 transgene. In tubules, successful targeting of aequorin and green fluorescent protein transgenes (3Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vertebrate receptors (25Kerr M. Davies S.A. Dow J.A.T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 126: 77Crossref Google Scholar) to specified cell types has been achieved using the c42 GAL4 line, which targets expression to the principal cells of the main segment in tubules (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the c724 GAL4 line, which targets expression to tubule stellate cells (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we describe the targeting of bovine PDE5A to Drosophila tubules and show that expression of functional vertebrate cG-PDE occurs in specified tubule cells. Furthermore, modulation of cGMP signaling via PDE5 results in a transport phenotype. Given the functionality of a vertebrate cG-PDE in Drosophila cells, this demonstrates a conserved role for cGMP signaling in renal function. Generation of PDE5 Transgenic Lines—The bovine PDE5A gene was provided as a 2.6-kb cDNA cloned into between the ApaI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-). This was a kind gift of J. Corbin, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In order to sub-clone PDE5A into the Drosophila pP{UAST} vector, a PCR mutagenesis strategy was used to amplify a 2.6-kb fragment from the cDNA clone. This resulted in the PDE5A open reading frame with a 5′ NotI site upstream of the ATG and the removal of a NotI site 30 bp downstream of the ATG. The PCR product was gel-purified and sub-cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned fragment was sequenced before being cloned between the 5′ XbaI and 3′ NotI sites in pP{UAST} and then sequenced again to confirm directional cloning of the open reading frame (Fig. 1). pP{UAST} containing the PDE5A open reading frame was used to transform Drosophila embryos. Germ Line Transformation of Drosophila—This was performed according to standard protocols using an Eppendorf Micromanipulator InjectMan connected to an Eppendorf FemtoJet® pressure modulator. Briefly, more than 30 embryos from dechorionated eggs from 500 3–7-day-old flies (w1118) were used for each round of microinjection. Glass micropipettes were pulled on a Campden Instruments moving-coil microelectrode puller from borosilicate glass capillary tubes with an internal filament (Clark Genetic Instruments) of 1.0 mm (outer diameter) × 0.78 mm (inner diameter). Embryos were injected with a mixture of pP{UAST} containing the PDE5A open reading frame (400 ng) and the helper plasmid pP{D2-3} (100 ng), which had been diluted in injection buffer (0.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.8). Embryos were viewed under a Zeiss inverted stage microscope. Slides containing injected embryos were placed on a fresh grape juice agar plate. The embryos were left to recover for 1–7 days at 18 °C and any hatched larvae transferred to standard food. Surviving adults were mated individually back to the host strain (w1118) and the progeny scored for eye color transformation. Red-eyed transformants were crossed again to w1118, and transformed progeny of this cross were mated to siblings. Selection against flies with white eyes through generations in most cases allowed homozygous lines to be generated for each P-element insertion. Resultant transgenic lines were designated UAS-PDE5. The chromosomal location of each insertion was determined by standard crossing schemes. Drosophila Stocks—All strains were maintained on standard Drosophila diet at 25 °C and 55% humidity, on a 12:12 photoperiod. Drosophila lines used in this study are as follows: w1118 (parental strain used for transformation of embryos); UAS-PDE5 (described in this study); c42, GAL4 enhancer trap line used to drive expression of UAS constructs in only tubule principal cells (24Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); c724, GAL4 enhancer trap line (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) used to drive expression of UAS constructs in only tubule stellate cells (26Terhzaz S. O'Connell F.C. Pollock V.P. Kean L. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3667-3676PubMed Google Scholar, 27Radford J.C. Davies S.A. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38810-38817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); c42/UAS-PDE5, progeny of crosses between c42 and UAS-PDE5; and c724/UAS-PDE5, progeny of crosses between c724 and UAS-PDE5. Various balancer lines were also used to establish chromosomal location of transgene in UAS-PDE5 lines (not shown). Reverse-transcriptase PCR—Expression of bovine PDE5A was determined by performing reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) on control and transgenic fly tubule cDNA preparations and from progeny of GAL4/UAS-PDE5, in which expression of the gene should occur. Twenty tubules were dissected, and poly(A)+ RNA was extracted (Dynal mRNA direct kit) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction, corresponding to cDNAs derived from 1 tubule (∼160 cells), was used as a template for PCR containing PDE5a gene-specific primer pairs based on published sequences. Additionally, to control against genomic contamination in cDNA preparations, primers were used that had been designed around intron/exon boundaries of genes known to be expressed in tubule, for example PKC53e (28Pollock V.P. Radford J.C. Pyne S. Hasan G. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Use of such primers verified the cDNA quality used in PCRs. Sequences of primers used are as follows: BovPDE5 Forward, 5′-TGCTGGAGAACAAGAGAAATCAGG-3′, and BovPDE5 Reverse, 5′-CATCGTTGCGGTTGAAAGCC-3′; PKC53e Forward, 5′-AGACCACAAAGACTTTCTGCGG-3′, and PKC53e Reverse, 5′-GGCTTAAATGGCGGTGCAC-3′. PCR cycle conditions were as follows: 94 °C (1 min), 36 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s), 72 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min). PCR products obtained from such RT-PCR experiments were cloned using the Invitrogen topoisomerase (TOPO TA Cloning) system. Cloned plasmids were purified using Qiagen kits and sequenced using U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase kits to confirm their identity. The cloned PCR products shared 100% sequence identity with PDE5A (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were prepared from tubules from each line (described under “Drosophila Stocks”) homogenized in ice-cold Tris/lysis buffer (2% w/v SDS, 70 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min to remove debris. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentration (Bradford), and 10–30 μg of protein was run on 4–15% pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad). Western blots using rabbit anti-PDE5 antibody (Calbiochem) (1:1000 dilution) were performed according to standard protocols, using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean blotting system. Loading uniformity was assessed by Ponceau S staining after blotting. Immunolabeling was visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) after treatment with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Diagnostics Scotland). Immunocytochemistry—Experiments were performed using standard protocols as described previously (29MacPherson M.R. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.B. Kean L. O'Connell F.C. Dow J.A.T. Davies S.-A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C394-C407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on fixed, intact tubules from control and GAL4/UAS-PDE5 tubules, as described in Fig. 2 legend. Antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-PDE5 antibody (Calbiochem), 1:100 dilution; fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Diagnostics Scotland), 1:250 dilution. Counterstaining of stellate cells in tubule stained for PDE5 was achieved by visualization of tubule cell nuclei, as differently sized nuclei from either principal or stellate cells can be used as cell-specific markers (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Staining of nuclei was achieved using 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) at 1 μg/ml for 2.5 min on c42/UAS-PDE5 after immunocytochemistry for PDE5. Stained tubules were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). Staining of whole-mount tubules was detected by immunofluorescence (Zeiss) using an Axiocam imaging system. Assay for Tubule cG-PDE Activity—Assays for cG-PDE activity in tubules were performed essentially as described for tubule cA-PDE assays (30Cabrero P. Radford J.C. Broderick K.E. Veenstra J. Spana E. Davies S. Dow J.A.T. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 3799-3807PubMed Google Scholar). For each sample, 50 tubules (20–30 μg of protein) from each line, treated as defined in Fig. 3 legend, were dissected into 50 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and homogenized. 50 μl of tritiated cGMP working stock (0.185 kBq/ml in 10 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added to each sample on ice. Final cGMP (substrate) concentrations used in assays as shown in Fig. 3 were derived by adjusting the concentration of unlabeled cGMP in the working stock. Blank samples were prepared using 50 μl of PBS and 50 μl of working stock; positive control was made as blanks except that PBS was replaced by bovine PDE5-transformed cell lysates (31Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and reactions were terminated by boiling for 2 min. Samples were chilled on ice and incubated for 10 min with 25 μl of 1 mg/ml Crotalus atrox 5′-nucleotidase (Sigma) to allow conversion of guanosine monophosphate to guanosine. 400 μl of resuspended Dowex 1-Cl resin (Sigma, 1:2 v/v, in water) was added to each sample, and samples were vortexed every 5 min for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and 150 μl of the supernatant was removed and added to 2 ml of Optiflow scintillant. Samples were counted for 60 s and PDE activities calculated. Final activity was expressed per mg of protein by dividing by amount of protein in each sample assayed. Protein concentrations were assayed according to standard protocols (Lowry). Tubule Cyclic GMP Assays—Cyclic GMP levels were measured in pooled samples of 20 tubules by radioimmunoassay (Biotrak Amerlex M, Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (5Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, tubules were pre-incubated with the PDE inhibitor, sildenafil (10-6m), for 10 min. Incubations were terminated with ice-cold ethanol and homogenized. Samples were dried down and resuspended in 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and processed for cGMP content according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transport Assays—Malpighian tubules were isolated from control and GAL4/UAS-PDE5 flies into 10-μl drops of Schneider's medium under liquid paraffin, and fluid secretion rates were measured in tubules as detailed elsewhere (32Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Gortz A. Skaer N.J. Brogan S. Kaiser K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 197: 421-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under various conditions as described in the text. Basal rates of fluid transport were measured for 30 min and either cardioacceleratory peptide2b, (CAP2b) (10-7m) (6Davies S.A. Huesmann G.R. Maddrell S.H.P. O'Donnell M.J. Skaer N.J.V. Dow J.A.T. Tublitz N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar), cGMP (10-4m) (5Dow J.A. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar), or Drosophila CRF-like peptide (10-6m) (30Cabrero P. Radford J.C. Broderick K.E. Veenstra J. Spana E. Davies S. Dow J.A.T. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 3799-3807PubMed Google Scholar) was added as indicated. Where indicated, sildenafil was used to pre-treat tubules for 30 min prior to measuring basal rates of transport. Expression of Bovine PDE5A in Drosophila Tubules—By using the cloning strategy outlined in Fig. 1A, flies transgenic for bovine PDE5 were successfully obtained. Expression of the PDE5A transgene by the appropriate GAL4 driver was confirmed by RT-PCR, using cDNA prepared from w1118, parental UAS-PDE5, and c42/UAS-PDE5 tubules. Results shown in Fig. 1B confirm that expression of bovine PDE5 is observed in only c42/UAS-PDE5 tubules (Fig. 1B, lane 7) and not the parental (referred to as “control”) lines. Insertion of PDE5A into transgenic Drosophila was confirmed by RT-PCR off genomic template from c42/UAS-PDE5, using primers to PDE5A (Fig. 1B, lane 6). By using intron-flanking primers to PKC53e, differently sized PCR products in lanes 4 and 5 show that cDNA preparations are not contaminated with genomic DNA and that genomic preparations are of good quality. This is essential, as use of PDE5A primers to an intronless transgene will be expected to result in identically sized products from both cDNA and genomic templates from c42/UAS-PDE5 tubules. However, by having verified the cDNA and genomic template quality, the results shown for lanes 6 and 7 cannot occur as a result of contamination of templates. Other experiments showed that faint band indicating a PCR product of the expected size was observed using cDNA template prepared from c724/UAS-PDE5 (data not shown). Western blotting by using anti-PDE5 antibody in tubule protein samples confirms expression of bovine PDE5 only when a GAL4 driver is used in conjunction with UAS-PDE5. Fig. 1C shows that only in c42/UAS-PDE5 is there significant expression of a 100-kDa protein, which correlates with the established molecular weight of bovine PDE5 monomer (33Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13729-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). A faint band of ∼80 kDa is also detected in lane 1, which could represent some proteolytic degradation of PDE5. Low molecular weight products are observed in all samples, which are probably because of nonspecific interactions of the anti-PDE5 antibody in Drosophila homogenates. It is unlikely that these low molecular weight bands are due to recognition of endogenous Drosophila PDEs by the anti-PDE antibody because analysis of the closest homologue of vertebrate PDE5, Drosophila PDE6, 3J. P. Day, M. D. Houslay, and S. A. Davies, unpublished observations. shows a significantly higher molecular weight compared with the bands in question. Furthermore, the likelihood that the antibody recognizes nonspecific products is low, given the specific staining observed in c42/UAS-PDE5 compared with UAS-PDE5, in the immunocytochemical evidence shown in Fig. 2. Expressed protein was not detected in c724/UAS-PDE5 tubule preparations. As there are only 22 stellate cells in tubule main segment (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), expression of PDE protein in such a small number of cells is not detectable by Western analysis, with transcript expression being only barely detectable (see above). PDE5 Is Localized to the Apical Membrane in Tubule Principal Cells—Immunocytochemistry of whole mount tubules using commercial anti-PDE5 antibody was used to resolve the spatial and cellular localization of GAL4-driven PDE5A expression in tubules. Fig. 2 shows that the control UAS-PDE5 line does not express PDE5 protein in tubules (B), as data shown in Fig. 1 would lead us to expect. By contrast, the c42 GAL4 driver, which confers expression only in principal cells in tubule main segment, confers spatial expression of PDE5 in this tubule region (Fig. 2A) and in only principal cells (Fig. 2, C–E). Targeted expression of PDE5 in only the principal cells is supported by the use of the c42 GAL4 driver in previous work (24Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which an aequorin transgene was targeted to specified cells in tubules. Furthermore, counterstaining of cell nuclei with DAPI (Fig. 2E) clearly shows the presence of a small nucleus in a black, unstained stellate cell (see yellow arrow in Fig. 2E and compare with the larger principal cell nuclei as indicated by red arrows. Note also unstained stellates, yellow arrows, in C and D). Cell nuclei are known markers for stellate cells and have been documented previously (23Sozen H.A. Armstrong J.D. Yang M.Y. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5207-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as being smaller than the polyploid nuclei of principal cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that bovine PDE5 is expressed at apical membranes in principal cells (blue arrows (Fig. 2, D and E). This site of expression is identical to that marked by expression of the vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit, vhaSFD (10Broderick K.E. MacPherson M.R. Regulski M. Tully T. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1207-C1218Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which is known to be targeted to the tubule apical membrane. Thus, targeting of PDE5 to specified membranes in polarized tubule cells occurs in vivo. Increased cG-PDE Activity Is Associated with"

Autoreactive receptors undergo negative selection and can be replaced by receptor editing. In addition, the process of maturation of non-self B cells and migration to the spleen, referred to as positive selection, is limited by the signaling competence of the BCR. Using 3-83Tg mice deficient of CD19 we have shown that signaling incompetence not only blocks positive selection but also activates receptor editing. Here we study the role of ligand-independent BCR tonic tyrosine phosphorylation signals in activation of receptor editing. We find that editing, immature 3-83Tg B cells deficient of CD19 have elevated BCR tonic signals and that lowering these tonic signals effectively suppresses receptor editing. Furthermore, we show that elevation of BCR tonic signals in non-editing, immature 3-83Tg B cells stimulates significant receptor editing. We also show that positive selection and developmental progression from the bone marrow to the spleen are limited to cells capable of establishing appropriate tonic signals, as in contrast to immature cells, splenic 3-83Tg B cells deficient of CD19 have BCR tonic signals similar to those of the control 3-83Tg cells. This developmental progression is accompanied by activation of molecules signaling for growth and survival. Hence, we suggest that ligand-independent BCR tonic signals are required for promoting positive selection and suppressing the receptor-editing mechanism in immature B cells.

Hence, we suggest that ligand-independent BCR tonic signals are required for promoting positive selection and suppressing the receptor-editing mechanism in immature B cells. Formation and expression of the antigen receptor are hallmarks of T and B lymphocyte development. During early stages of development the expressed receptor signals for both positive and negative selection, whereas in mature cells it signals for activation (1Rajewsky K. Nature. 1996; 381: 751-758Google Scholar, 2Melchers F. ten Boekel E. Seidl T. Kong X.C. Yamagami T. Onishi K. Shimizu T. Rolink A.G. Andersson J. Immunol.

Continuous receptor expression and signaling are also critical for cell survival, as ablation of the antigen receptor results in death of the lymphocytes, which occurs more rapidly in B cells (4Polic B.

This salvage mechanism allows extended survival and multiple V(D)J recombination attempts for self-reactive B cells and was found to contribute in generating the B cell repertoire (9Melamed D.

Several studies have utilized signaling mutated mice to show that expression of a non-self receptor is not sufficient for B cell maturation.

These studies have supported the general thought that positive selection signals in B lymphocytes are derived from autonomous “tonic” tyrosine phosphorylation generated by the antigen receptor and regulate developmental progression and maturation from the BM to the spleen (3Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 379-385Google Scholar, 12Reth M. Wienands J. Schamel W.W. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 10-18Google Scholar, 18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar). Co-receptors in B lymphocytes function to set BCR-signaling threshold. Thus, while CD19 elevates BCR-signaling threshold, CD22 lowers it (21Fujimoto M. Bradney A.P. Poe J.C. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 191-200Google Scholar). Several studies in gene-targeted mice have shown that these molecules are important in determining signaling threshold for negative selection as well as functional responsiveness to antigenic stimulation (for review, see Ref. 22Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Google Scholar). While most of the published data has probed the role of these co-receptors only upon BCR ligation, little is known about their function in regulating the ligand-independent BCR tonic signals in unstimulated cells. In an earlier study we showed that immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells fail positive selection and undergo intensive receptor editing in an attempt to express a new receptor (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). These studies raised the hypothesis that CD19 expression is important to set BCR tonic signaling for positive selection and provided a possible link between failure of positive selection and activation of receptor editing in immature B cells. The possibility that receptor editing is stimulated by BCR signals that are too high or too low has been suggested (24Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. Pape K. Retter M. Nemazee D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7435-7439Google Scholar), but no directly supporting data is available. Using our experimental model of immunoglobulin-transgenic B cells (3-83Tg) that are expressing or deficient of CD19, we directly assess the role of ligand-independent BCR tonic signals in activating the receptor-editing mechanism. We show here that modification of tonic tyrosine phosphorylation signals is capable of stimulating or suppressing receptor editing in immature B cells and that positive selection and developmental progression from the BM to the spleen are limited to cells capable of establishing appropriate tonic signals. Hence, we propose that appropriate BCR tonic signals promote positive selection and establishment of allelic exclusion and allow cells to migrate from the BM to the spleen. In contrast, cells that fail to establish appropriate tonic signals are arrested in the BM and activate receptor editing. Experimental Mice—The mice in all experiments were 3-83Tg B10.D2nSn/J expressing IgM/IgD BCR specific to class I major histocompatibility complex antigens Kk and Kb and 3-83Tg B10.D2nSn/J CD19–/– mice (CD19-deficient mice were generated at the laboratory of Klaus Rajewsky (25Rickert R.C. Rajewsky K. Roes J. Nature. 1995; 376: 352-355Google Scholar)). Mice were housed and bred at the animal facility of the Technion, Faculty of Medicine (Haifa, Israel), and used at 4–10 weeks of age. Cell Culture and B Cell Purification—Immature B cells were generated from IL-7-driven bone marrow cultures as we have described previously (26Melamed D. Kench J.A. Grabstein K. Rolink A. Nemazee D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1233-1239Google Scholar). Briefly, BM was obtained from 4–10-week-old mice and cultured for 5 days in the presence of 50–100 units of IL-7 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments B220+ splenic B cells were purified from 4–10-week-old mice using MACS magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). In some experiments the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Sigma) or a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, was added to BM cultures. Pervanadate stock solution was composed of 10 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and 5 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide, which were buffered with 20 μg/ml catalase (Sigma). Cell viability was determined by the MTT oxidation method as described previously (27Melamed D. Friedman A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 935-942Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells grown in BM cultures were incubated for 18 h with different concentrations of wortmannin or pervanadate in 96-well plates. Cultures were pulsed with 10 μl of MTT solution (Sigma, 5 mg/ml) for 4 h followed by addition of 150 μl of isopropanol, 0.04 n HCl. Plates were read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 570–630 nm. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation in B cells was performed as described previously (28Buhl A.M. Pleiman C.M. Rickert R.C. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1897-1910Google Scholar). Briefly, B cells from BM cultures or purified from spleen were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH = 7.5), 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm antitrypsin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or used as total cell lysate for phosphorylation analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). In some experiments, cells grown in culture were stimulated with anti-BCR antibody (F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light), Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 3 min before lysis. For immunoprecipitation of Igα (CD79a) and Dok, we used polyclonal rabbit antisera, generously provided by Prof. John C. Cambier (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO). Blots were probed with antiphosphotyrosine (4G10), followed by protein-specific antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Lyn was performed using rabbit antiphospho-Erk1/2 and rabbit antiphospho-Lyn (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), followed by rabbit anti-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-Lyn (kindly provided by J. C. Cambier). Visualization of bound antibodies was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. To determine levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of specific signaling intermediaries, densitometry analysis was performed using the UVIdoc gel documentation system and UVIdoc analysis software (UVItec, Cambridge, UK), and the ratio between the phosphorylated band and the corresponding total band was calculated. Flow Cytometry and Sorting—Antibodies used for cell staining were as follows: anti-mouse λ-fluorescein isothiocyanate; anti-mouse IgM-phycoerythrin (PE); anti-B220-PE, RA3–6B2 (CALTAG, Burlingame, CA); anti-IgDa-biotin, AMS 9.1; and anti-3-83 idiotype 54.1-biotin. Biotinylated antibodies were visualized with streptavidin SPRD (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). In some experiments cells were sorted based on their surface markers and collected for further analysis. Cell sorting and data collection were performed using FACSCalibur™ and CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences, Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). RNA and cDNA Analysis—RNA preparation and RT-PCR amplification for RAG-2, B220, and actin were performed as we have described previously (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar, 26Melamed D. Kench J.A. Grabstein K. Rolink A. Nemazee D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1233-1239Google Scholar). PCR conditions and primer sequences were as described previously (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar, 26Melamed D. Kench J.A. Grabstein K. Rolink A. Nemazee D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1233-1239Google Scholar). The PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose and quantified using the UVIdoc gel documentation system and UVIdoc software (UVItec) as we have described previously (29Leider N. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2446-2452Google Scholar). The results are expressed as a semiquantitative estimate, where signal intensity of RAG-2 product was normalized to that of B220 (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). Ongoing Receptor Editing in 3-83Tg CD19–/– BM Cultures—We have shown previously that immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells undergo receptor editing in BM in vivo and in BM cultures in vitro (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). To determine the extent of receptor editing in 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells developing in vitro, V(D)J recombination markers (RAG-2 and λ light chain expression) were measured at various times throughout the culture period. In 3-83Tg and 3-83Tg CD19–/– BM cultures immature B cells grow equally well as reflected by absolute numbers (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar) and their relative proportion reaching 90–95% purity after 5 days (% B220+ cells, Fig. 1A, top). However, in contrast to the 3-83Tg cultures, receptor editing is activated in 3-83Tg CD19–/– cultures as revealed by the accumulation of cells expressing endogenous λ light chain (Fig. 1A, middle) and RAG-2 expression (Fig. 1A, bottom). Despite the increasing B cell numbers, levels of RAG-2 expression did not significantly change during the 3-83Tg CD19–/– culture period, suggesting that ongoing V(D)J recombination is a general characteristic in this cell population. To support this, RAG-2 was determined in sorted 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cell populations differing by BCR level of expression. Sorting gates were set as we have described previously (9Melamed D. Benschop R.J. Cambier J.C. Nemazee D. Cell. 1998; 92: 173-182Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, RAG-2 is significantly expressed in all sorted IgMlo/IgDneg, IgMmed/IgDneg, IgMhi/IgDneg, and IgM+/IgD+ B cell populations, but levels of expression dropped with developmental progression as determined by BCR expression. The detection of RAG-2 in all sorted cell populations may suggest that developmental progression in vitro is not sufficient for termination of V(D)J recombination in 3-83Tg CD19–/– BM cultures. Immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– Cells Have Increased Tonic Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Because 3-83Tg CD19–/– BM cultures lack the 3-83 cognate antigen, we hypothesize that ongoing receptor editing results from generation of inappropriate ligand-independent tonic signals. To test this we measured tyrosine phosphorylation in unstimulated immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells grown in BM cultures relative to control 3-83Tg cultures. Initial tyrosine phosphorylation analysis in total cell lysates clearly showed increased tonic phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when analysis was performed on gels loaded with equal amounts of proteins rather then cell equivalent (data not shown). To further assess tyrosine phosphorylation of specific signaling intermediaries that are proximal to the BCR, immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting were performed. We found that immature 3-83Tg cells deficient of CD19 have an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Igα and Lyn (Fig. 2B). Quantitation analysis revealed that tonic Igα phosphorylation is increased by 1.7–2-fold, whereas that of Lyn is increased by 30–50% (Fig. 2C). Finally, to confirm that both cell populations can elevate tyrosine phosphorylation levels in response to BCR ligation, cells were stimulated with anti-BCR antibodies. The results in Fig. 2D show that anti-BCR antibodies stimulated significant tyrosine phosphorylation in 3-83Tg and in 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells as measured in total cell lysates. Hence, we conclude that immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells have increased tonic phosphorylation of signaling intermediaries. Elevation of Tonic Tyrosine Phosphorylation Stimulates Receptor Editing in 3-83Tg Cells—To study whether increased tonic tyrosine phosphorylation can stimulate receptor editing, we treated the non-editing 3-83Tg cells with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate to elevate tonic signals. Immature 3-83Tg cells, which were grown 5 days in culture, were incubated for an additional 18 h in the presence of pervanadate. Early experiments were performed to determine the pervanadate concentration that both will be effective in elevating tonic tyrosine phosphorylation and have minimal cell toxicity. As shown in the survival curve (Fig. 3B) the pervanadate working concentration of 20 mm is non-toxic. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation in total cell lysates showed that this treatment was effective in elevating tonic phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximum phosphorylation at concentrations of 15–20 mm (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR assay for RAG-2 expression clearly showed that elevating tonic tyrosine phosphorylation by treatment with 20 mm pervanadate stimulated a significant 4-fold induction in RAG-2 mRNA synthesis relative to the non-treated 3-83Tg cells (Fig. 3, C and D). The possibility that the pervanadate treatment mimicked signals stimulated upon BCR ligation by antigen is unlikely as the pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation appears different from that induced upon BCR ligation in both level of phosphorylation and pattern of phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 3A). Similar observations for showing that pervanadate elevates ligand-independent tonic signals in B cells have been reported (18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar). Thus, elevation of tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg cells stimulated receptor editing. Lowering the Tonic Tyrosine Phosphorylation in 3-83Tg CD19–/– Cells Suppresses Receptor Editing—To confirm that ongoing receptor editing results from increased tonic tyrosine phosphorylation, we treated the editing 3-83Tg CD19–/– immature B cells with a signaling inhibitor to lower tonic tyrosine phosphorylation. To do so, we applied the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to the cultured cells for 18 h. Initial experiments revealed that the lowest effective dose with minimal toxicity is 10 μm. As shown in Fig. 4, this dose effectively lowered the tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in total cell lysates (Fig. 4A), and the survival curve indicated that cell viability in cultures treated with 10 μm wortmannin was over 75% (Fig. 4B). Analysis for RAG-2 expression clearly showed that lowering the tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in editing 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells by treating with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin effectively suppressed RAG-2 gene expression by 3-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, we concluded that elevated tonic tyrosine phosphorylation stimulates ongoing receptor editing in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells and that lowering these tonic signals by using signaling inhibitors can effectively restrain receptor editing. Immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– Cells Have Reduced Tonic Phosphorylation of Dok—BCR inhibitory signals are thought to contribute to maintaining the autonomous tonic tyrosine phosphorylation required for B cell selection and survival (19Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16Google Scholar, 20Brauweiler A.M. Tamir I. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 69-74Google Scholar). To test whether increased tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells could result from reduced activation of the BCR-signaling inhibitory molecules, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Dok. Immunoprecipitation and tyrosine phosphorylation blots confirmed that the level of Dok phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells is reduced by 1.8–2-fold relative to the control 3-83Tg cells (Fig. 5). Hence, it is possible that the reduced activated Dok contributes to the elevated tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells. Establishment of Appropriate Tonic Tyrosine Phosphorylation Signals in 3-83Tg CD19–/– Splenic B Cells—Despite the impaired development, a significant population of 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells is able to suppress RAG expression and to migrate from the BM to the spleen, suggesting that these cells are capable of compensating for CD19 deficiency and undergoing positive selection. This suggests that appropriate tonic tyrosine phosphorylation signals are established in these cells to facilitate such developmental progression. To test this splenic B cells were sorted and analyzed for tonic tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that 3-83Tg CD19–/– splenic B cells effectively lowered tonic signals to levels that are not significantly different relative to the control 3-83Tg splenic B cells, as revealed in both total tyrosine phosphorylation and specific Igα phosphorylation (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). Establishment of appropriate tonic signals that promote positive selection should also be revealed in downstream BCR-signaling molecules. As Ras/MEK/Erk is a major pathway linked to the BCR and was shown to signal for growth and survival of B cells (30Fleming H.E. Paige C.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 521-531Google Scholar, 31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar), we studied Erk phosphorylation in immature and splenic 3-83Tg and 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells. Interestingly, our results clearly show that editing 3-83Tg CD19–/– immature B cells have significantly reduced tonic levels of phosphorylated Erk (Fig. 6C, left), but this is in agreement with the fact that efficient Erk phosphorylation depends on CD19 (31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 32Li X. Carter R.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5901-5908Google Scholar). In contrast, tonic Erk phosphorylation in splenic B cells from 3-83Tg CD19–/– mice was indistinguishable from that of the control 3-83Tg splenic B cells (Fig. 6C, right). Thus, splenic B cells from 3-83Tg CD19–/– that effectively compensated for the lack of CD19 by establishing appropriate tonic tyrosine phosphorylation for positive selection could also activate Erk to signal for growth and survival in the periphery. These experiments lead us to conclude that positive selection and developmental progression from the BM to the spleen are limited to cells capable of fulfilling appropriate tonic signaling requirements. This, however, may still not be sufficient for extended survival in the periphery. Autonomous, or tonic, tyrosine phosphorylation signals that are generated upon expression of BCR are critical for B cell development, selection, and survival (3Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 379-385Google Scholar, 12Reth M. Wienands J. Schamel W.W. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 10-18Google Scholar, 18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar). These signals are ligand-independent and therefore may have profound differences relative to ligand-dependent signaling cascade in B cells, which is well described in the literature. The nature and function of these tonic signals are poorly described. In the present study we show that establishment of appropriate tonic signals is important in promoting B cell development as tonic signals that are too high activate receptor editing in immature B cells and block the process of positive selection and developmental progression from the BM to the spleen. Receptor editing is a salvage mechanism allowing B cells to escape deletion by rearranging and expressing a new receptor (7Nemazee D. Weigert M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1813-1817Google Scholar, 8Nemazee D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 19-51Google Scholar). Although this mechanism has so far been applied to negative selection and central tolerance, the data presented here implicate receptor editing with immature B cells that fail to establish appropriate BCR tonic signals. Several studies have shown that signaling-incompetent BCR fails to promote B cell development and maturation in vivo (13Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Muller S. Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. et al.Immunity. 1995; 3: 283-299Google Scholar, 14Chan V.W. Meng F. Soriano P. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 69-81Google Scholar, 15Jumaa H. Wollscheid B. Mitterer M. Wienands J. Reth M. Nielsen P.J. Immunity. 1999; 11: 547-554Google Scholar, 16Reichlin A. Hu Y. Meffre E. Nagaoka H. Gong S. Kraus M. Rajewsky K. Nussenzweig M.C. J. Exp.

This failure has been attributed to a process of positive selection (2Melchers F. ten Boekel E. Seidl T. Kong X.C. Yamagami T. Onishi K. Shimizu T. Rolink A.G. Andersson J. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 33-46Google Scholar, 3Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 379-385Google Scholar, 11Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar, 12Reth M. Wienands J. Schamel W.W. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 10-18Google Scholar), which is thought to be regulated by ligand-independent BCR tonic signals (11Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar, 18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar, 33Martin F. Kearney J.F. Immunity. 2000; 12: 39-49Google Scholar, 34Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Google Scholar). Thus, signaling-incompetent BCR fails to promote positive selection, and such B cells undergo developmental arrest. In mature B cells failure to generate these signals as a result of BCR ablation results in rapid death (5Lam K.P. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Google Scholar). However, unlike mature B cells, developmentally arrested immature B cells are competent to undergo receptor editing (35Monroe R.J. Seidl K.J. Gaertner F. Han S. Chen F. Sekiguchi J. Wang J. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Kelsoe G. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1999; 11: 201-212Google Scholar, 36Yu W. Nagaoka H. Jankovic M. Misulovin Z. Suh H. Rolink A. Melchers F. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Nature. 1999; 400: 682-687Google Scholar). A recent study by our laboratory has shown that 3-83Tg immature B cells expressing signaling-incompetent BCR, deficient of CD19, fail positive selection and undergo developmental arrest. These cells undergo intensive receptor editing both in vivo and in vitro (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that in positive selection, receptor editing allows secondary recombination to express a new receptor that can compensate for the insufficient positive selection signal. Thus, receptor editing in developing B cells is a major mechanism in both negative and positive selection. Earlier studies suggest that these ligand-independent signals are necessary to promote developmental progression (18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar, 34Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Google Scholar) and may be generated by the constitutive activity of CD45, which is able to activate Src proteins (37Penninger J.M. Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 389-396Google Scholar), and balanced by positive and negative BCR regulators (18Bannish G. Fuentes-Panana E.M. Cambier J.C. Pear W.S. Monroe J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1583-1596Google Scholar). The absence of CD19 results in elevated tonic tyrosine phosphorylation signals in immature 3-83Tg cells (Fig. 2) and increased tonic PI3K activity in non-transgenic cells (38Fujimoto M. Poe J.C. Hasegawa M. Tedder T.F. Immunol. Res. 2001; 22: 281-298Google Scholar). In addition immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells fail positive selection and undergo rapid apoptosis in the periphery (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). The possibility that increased tonic signals are a result of elevated levels of BCR is unlikely because unlike in the spleen, immature 3-83Tg and 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells developing in the BM or in BM cultures have indistinguishable levels of surface BCR (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar, 39Buhl A.M. Nemazee D. Cambier J.C. Rickert R. Hertz M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 141-153Google Scholar). We have also considered the possibility that the elevated tonic signals may result from increased responsiveness to IL-7 stimulation because both CD19 receptor signaling and IL-7 receptor signaling have been shown to play an important role in modulating RAG gene expression and repertoire diversification in human B cell development (40Billips L.G. Nunez C.A. Bertrand III, F.E. Stankovic A.K. Gartland G.L. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 973-982Google Scholar). Although we have not specifically monitored phosphorylation of proteins linked to the IL-7 receptor signaling, this possibility is unlikely because elevation in total tyrosine phosphorylation and in Igα phosphorylation was obtained in 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells cultured for 24–48 h in the absence of IL-7 without significant increase in cell death (data not shown). These observations suggest that failure of positive selection and activation of receptor editing in these cells are due to inappropriately increased tonic signals. It is difficult to define what should be the appropriate levels of tonic signals. As 3-83Tg cells have normal development and establish efficient allelic exclusion, we postulated that these cells do produce appropriate levels and therefore can be used as a reference. Indeed, elevation of the tonic signals by treatment with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate stimulated receptor editing in these cells (Fig. 3). This notion was further confirmed in the reciprocal experiment when lowering the tonic signals in 3-83Tg CD19–/– cells (using the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin) effectively down-regulated receptor editing (Fig. 4). We currently have no direct explanation of how PI3K inhibition suppresses tonic tyrosine phosphorylation. Although the canonical signaling cascade of PI3K in many cells has been characterized, the signaling events upstream and downstream of PI3K in B lymphocytes are not well known (31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 41Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Google Scholar). Clearly, in B lymphocytes PI3K activation is a central event in BCR signaling and is directly linked to CD19 (28Buhl A.M. Pleiman C.M. Rickert R.C. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1897-1910Google Scholar). Evidence from several studies shows that through multiple cross-talk mechanisms the PI3K activation is integrated directly or indirectly, via adaptor proteins, with other BCR-signaling pathways such as Ras-Raf and PLCγ2 (31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar, 41Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Google Scholar, 42Han A. Saijo K. Mecklenbrauker I. Tarakhovsky A. Nussenzweig M.C. Immunity. 2003; 19: 621-632Google Scholar, 43Niiro H. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 143-149Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that inhibition of PI3K results in reduced activation of kinases that are linked to these pathways, effectively lowering tonic tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. This may be further clarified in current experiments using specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Similar to the CD19 deficiency, Lyn deficiency alters BCR-signaling threshold and activates receptor editing in 3-83Tg Lyn–/– mice (44Meade J. Fernandez C. Turner M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1029-1034Google Scholar). Hence, immature B cells expressing receptors that generate signals that are too high or too low will fail to develop and may activate receptor editing in an attempt to express a new receptor. This, however, is difficult to show in a polyclonal repertoire but becomes apparent in a monoclonal repertoire that is restricted by an immunoglobin transgene such as 3-83. In addition, binding self-antigen may elevate signals that are too low to promote positive selection, thereby rescuing autoreactive cells and promoting autoimmunity, as has been suggested for CD22- and SHIP-deficient mice (22Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Google Scholar). In these studies, however, tonic signals have not been measured directly. In contrast, lack of CD45 has no effect on B cell development and positive selection (45Shivtiel S. Leider N. Melamed D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2264-2273Google Scholar). Although the role of CD19 in mediating BCR signaling upon receptor ligation has been studied intensively, its contribution in maintaining appropriate tonic signals for selection and survival has not been shown. Clearly, analysis of tonic signaling should be different from analysis of signals generated upon stimulation. For example, in CD19-deficient B cells, tonic activity of PI3K is elevated relative to control cells (38Fujimoto M. Poe J.C. Hasegawa M. Tedder T.F. Immunol. Res. 2001; 22: 281-298Google Scholar), but upon stimulation, PI3K activity in CD19–/– cells is remarkably reduced (28Buhl A.M. Pleiman C.M. Rickert R.C. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1897-1910Google Scholar, 38Fujimoto M. Poe J.C. Hasegawa M. Tedder T.F. Immunol. Res. 2001; 22: 281-298Google Scholar). Thus, in unstimulated cells appropriate tonic signals should continuously be generated and balanced due to the function of stimulatory and inhibitory signaling intermediaries. It is possible that the increased tonic signaling in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells is due to inefficient activity of the CD22 inhibitory pathway as optimal CD22 inhibitory function depends on CD19 expression (21Fujimoto M. Bradney A.P. Poe J.C. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 191-200Google Scholar). Studies by Tedder and colleagues suggest that the reciprocal function and the appropriate balance of CD19 and CD22 activity are important for B cell signaling (46Sato S. Jansen P.J. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13158-13162Google Scholar). The CD22 activity is mediated by the recruitment of activated SHIP (22Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Google Scholar, 38Fujimoto M. Poe J.C. Hasegawa M. Tedder T.F. Immunol. Res. 2001; 22: 281-298Google Scholar). The inhibitory function of SHIP has been shown to be mediated by association with Dok (19Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16Google Scholar, 20Brauweiler A.M. Tamir I. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 69-74Google Scholar), and this interaction correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok and inhibition activity (20Brauweiler A.M. Tamir I. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 69-74Google Scholar). In addition, Dok is colocalized to the BCR together with CD19 and CD22 (47Phee H. Rodgers W. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8615-8625Google Scholar). In agreement with this we find reduced levels of activated Dok in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that increased tonic signals in these cells result from reduced CD22-mediated inhibitory balancing activity. This hypothesis implies that in resting cells, CD19 functions not only to generate tonic signals but also to be involved in activation of inhibitory molecules that can balance these signals, as has been suggested previously (21Fujimoto M. Bradney A.P. Poe J.C. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 191-200Google Scholar). Despite the impaired development, a significant number of CD19–/– B cells are found in spleens of 3-83Tg and non-transgenic mice (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells express a BCR that can signal for positive selection and developmental progression. We find that tonic tyrosine phosphorylation signals in these cells were effectively lowered to levels that are not different relative to control. This supports our previous study showing that elevated BCR level of expression, or expression of an endogenous BCR composed of λ light chain, is able to promote positive selection and developmental progression of 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells in vivo and in vitro (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). Such compensating mechanisms may increase tonic activation of the BCR-signaling inhibitory molecules, such as Dok, that function to lower tonic signals and to promote positive selection of immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells. Establishing appropriate tonic signals and positive selection is also revealed in downstream signaling molecules. Thus, while the editing, immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells have significantly reduced phosphorylated Erk, positively selected splenic B cells from 3-83Tg CD19–/– mice establish normal levels of tonic Erk phosphorylation. The Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase also signals for growth and survival and is primarily activated through the PLCγ2 and Ras-Raf pathways (30Fleming H.E. Paige C.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 521-531Google Scholar, 31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar). As efficient Erk activation depends on CD19 (32Li X. Carter R.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5901-5908Google Scholar), it is not surprising to find significantly reduced Erk phosphorylation in immature 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells (Fig. 6), and these cells undergo rapid apoptosis in adoptive transfer experiments (23Shivtiel S. Leider N. Sadeh O. Kraiem Z. Melamed D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5596-5604Google Scholar). In contrast, splenic 3-83Tg CD19–/– B cells that are able to compensate for CD19 deficiency have normal levels of phosphorylated Erk, suggesting that positive selection of immature B cells is also associated with generation of survival signals. This, however, does not agree with recent data showing that CD19-deficient B cells have inappropriate Akt activation (48Otero D.C. Omori S.A. Rickert R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1474-1478Google Scholar), reduced survival in vivo, and a more transitional phenotype (39Buhl A.M. Nemazee D. Cambier J.C. Rickert R. Hertz M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 141-153Google Scholar, 49Otero D.C. Anzelon A.N. Rickert R.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 73-83Google Scholar). Because final stages of B cell maturation take place in the spleen (11Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Google Scholar), it is possible that BCR tonic signals that promote positive selection and migration from the BM are not sufficient for complete maturation and selection into the long-lived pool. Data showing that survival signals and selection into the follicle and marginal zone are CD19-dependent support this hypothesis (33Martin F. Kearney J.F. Immunity. 2000; 12: 39-49Google Scholar). Hence, positive selection and migration from the BM to the spleen are regulated by appropriate ligand-independent tonic signals. However, further selection into the long-lived pool may depend on additional cellular functions, such as appropriate responsiveness to chemokines (50Okada T. Ngo V.N. Ekland E.H. Forster R. Lipp M. Littman D.R. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 65-75Google Scholar), which may require effective activation of the PI3K pathway and Akt phosphorylation (31Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Google Scholar). This can explain the ability of CD19–/– cells to migrate from the BM and their failure to survive in the periphery. The interrelationship between all these survival pathways and their regulation during positive selection is yet to be determined."

Chem. 1967; 242: 82-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the overall redox state is not changed, the enzyme has an absolute requirement for a reduced FMN cofactor, as shown in Scheme 1. This latter finding gave rise to intense mechanistic studies on the putative functional role of reduced FMN in catalysis (reviewed in Refs. 4Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and 5Macheroux P. Schmid J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Planta. 1999; 207: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). From these studies, it has become evident that reduced FMN plays a pivotal role in the chorismate synthase catalyzed reaction (6Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35825-35830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This conclusion has received further support by the first high resolution x-ray structure of chorismate synthase from the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae (10Maclean J. Ali S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1499-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the reported structure of the ternary complex, comprising FMN and EPSP as ligands, EPSP is stacked above the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring in an average distance of 3.3 Å. This close juxtaposition of FMN and EPSP supports earlier suggestions for a direct role of reduced FMN in the elimination reaction, such as a radical mechanism, in which electron transfer from the reduced cofactor to the substrate initiates C-O bond breakage of the phosphate group to yield a substrate-derived neutral radical (6Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Macheroux P. Bornemann S. Ghisla S. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol.

Flavins and Flavoproteins 1996. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 113-122Google Scholar). Since no net redox change occurs in the reaction, a reverse transfer of the transiently donated electron is required to complete the catalytic cycle. In this mechanism, which is unique among flavin-dependent enzymes, the flavin environment in the active site is thought to play a key role in tuning the flavin cofactor to such a radical transfer mechanism. Two classes of chorismate synthases are distinguished by their ability to use NADPH for the reduction of oxidized FMN. Those enzymes possessing this additional catalytic activity are called “bifunctional,” whereas those lacking it are called “monofunctional.” Bifunctional enzymes have only been found in yeasts (Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with all other species apparently harboring monofunctional chorismate synthases. In contrast to the mode of flavin reduction, the two classes of chorismate synthases show no apparent difference in the mechanism of the elimination reaction. Multiple sequence alignments of chorismate synthases from bacterial, fungal, plant, and protozoan origin have revealed a number of invariant amino acid residues in monofunctional as well as bifunctional chorismate synthases, suggesting a pertinent role in catalysis in both classes of enzymes (12Macheroux P. Schönbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Koch M.H.J. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among these are two histidine residues, His17 and His106, in the bifunctional N. crassa enzyme, which are both found in the active site of chorismate synthase within 2.7 and 3 Å of the C(2) = O position of the flavin ring (His106) and the substrate phosphate group (His17), respectively, as shown in Scheme 2. The structural proximity of the imidazole ring of His17 to the substrate phosphate group as well as its suitable properties as an acid-base catalyst suggest that this residue protonates the leaving group upon C-O bond cleavage. The role of His106 is less clear; however, recent studies have provided evidence that the monoanionic form of reduced FMN (pKa = 6.7 free in solution (13Dudley K.H. Ehrenberg A. Hemmerich P. Müller F. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1964; 47: 1354-1383Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) is protonated upon binding of EPSP to the active site. Thus, His106 may be the general acid that protonates the N(1)-C(2) = O locus of the isoalloxazine moiety. The rationale behind the protonation of the reduced flavin is the assumption that a neutral reduced flavin has a more negative redox potential and therefore may promote the initial electron transfer to the substrate more readily. Another remarkable feature of the active site is the lack of an amino acid base in the vicinity of the C-(6proR) hydrogen. Instead, the flavin N(5)-position is close to this hydrogen, arguing that the nitrogen is directly involved in C-H bond breakage. To probe the role of His17 and His106 in the catalysis of chorismate synthase, we have prepared two single histidine to alanine mutant proteins (H17A and H106A) by site-directed mutagenesis. Here we describe the effects of these amino acid replacements on binding of oxidized and reduced FMN, binding of the substrate EPSP, the generation of a flavin-derived catalytic intermediate, and enzymatic activity. The results of our experiments clearly demonstrate that both residues are important for catalytic activity and influence the spectral characteristics of the flavin intermediate. Based on our results, we propose a mechanism in which both residues function as general acid catalysts. Reagents—All chemicals were of the highest grade available and obtained from Sigma or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).

DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PCR primers were from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). EPSP was synthesized from shikimate-3-phosphate using recombinant Escherichia coli 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Molecular Techniques—Basic molecular manipulations were performed using standard techniques (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Purification of Neurospora crassa Chorismate Synthase (NcCS)—Both histidine to alanine mutant proteins were purified as described for wild-type enzyme (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—A continuous enzyme assay was employed as described previously (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Phosphate release from EPSP as a measure of enzyme activity was determined using a colorimetric assay as described by Ref. 16Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Remack P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Amino acid replacements were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The construct pET21a-NcCS served as the template. The following oligonucleotides containing the appropriate codon exchange were used for the procedure (the changed codon is underlined): H17A, forward primer, 5′-CGACCTATGGCGAGTCGGCCTGCAAGTCGGTCGGCTGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCAGCCGACCGACTTGCAGGCCGACTCGCCATAGGTCG-3′; H106A, forward primer, 5′-CATCTACCCCCGCCCTTCCGCCGCCGACTGGACCTACCTCGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TCGAGGTAGGTCCAGTCGGCGGCGGAAGGGCGGGGGTAGATG-3′. All manipulations were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Microsynth). UV-visible Absorbance Spectrophotometry—Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Uvikon 933 double-beam spectrophotometer (Kontron Instrument AG, Zürich, Switzerland). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra were monitored with a Kontron spectrofluorimeter (model SFM-25).

Stopped-flow Spectrophotometry—Rapid reaction kinetics were performed using a stopped flow spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted 1-cm path length cell and a diode array detector (SI Spectroscopy Instruments GmbH, Gutach, Germany). When necessary, enzyme and substrate solutions were made anaerobic by exchanging the dissolved oxygen with argon by several cycles of evacuation and flushing. Analysis of the data was performed using the program Specfit/32 (Dr. R. A. Binstead, Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA). Redox Titrations—The redox potential of oxidized FMN/reduced FMN in the presence of wild-type NcCS and the two histidine mutant proteins was determined by the method described in Ref. 17Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Como, Italy1991: 581-584Google Scholar. Details of the experimental conditions are given in Ref. 8Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (E°′ = -0.184 mV) was used as a reporter dye. Molecular Orbital Calculations—Electron density calculations of reduced FMN in its N(1) protonated and deprotonated form were performed using the program MacSpartan, Version 1.1, from Wavefunction, Inc. Inactivation of NcCS by Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC)—The imidazole ring of accessible histidine residues reacts specifically with DEPC, incapacitating its function as an acid-base catalyst (18Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Incubation of NcCS with DEPC resulted in a time- (data not shown) and concentration-dependent inactivation of enzyme activity (Fig. 1). The enzyme activity of NcCS was completely inhibited by a 60-fold excess of DEPC after 1 h of incubation. Tryptic digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass analysis revealed that several histidine residues were labeled following incubation with DEPC (data not shown). Among the labeled histidine residues were the two invariant histidine residues His17 and His106 (numbering according to the N. crassa chorismate synthase sequence). Although it is not feasible to assign the inactivation of the enzyme specifically to one of the modified invariant histidines, the fact that both of these histidines are located in the active site and that DEPC inactivates the enzyme gave a first indication that the two invariant histidines play an important role in catalysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of an H17A and H106A Single Mutant Protein—Both invariant histidine residues (His17 and His106) were replaced by alanine residues using site-directed mutagenesis. The two single histidine mutant proteins (H17A and H106A) were expressed and purified from crude extracts in a two-step chromatographic procedure as described for wild-type enzyme (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both mutant proteins exhibited similar expression levels and were successfully purified by the method developed for wild-type protein (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Yields and stability of the H17A and H106A mutant proteins were comparable with wild-type NcCS. Activity of the H17A and H106A Mutant Protein—Both histidine mutant proteins were first tested for activity in a continuous enzyme assay under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2A). In this assay, the activity of the H17A and H106A mutant protein was 0.1 and 0.25%, respectively, as compared with wild-type enzyme. Since the continuous assay is based on the intrinsic FMN:NADPH-oxidoreductase activity of NcCS (bifunctionality), which may also be affected by the mutation, we also determined the activity in an anaerobic assay where FMN was reduced prior to mixing with EPSP; thus, chorismate synthase activity can be determined independently from the oxidoreductase activity. The formation of chorismate was monitored spectrophotometrically at 300 nm in a stopped-flow apparatus (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, the H17A and H106A mutant protein showed 5 and 10% of the wild-type enzyme activity, respectively. The higher activities of both mutant proteins in the absence of dioxygen indicate that the intrinsic oxidoreductase activity is also affected by the histidine to alanine replacement. To check whether C-O bond breakage (phosphate elimination) is affected by the amino acid replacement, a third assay was employed that measures the release of phosphate from EPSP (Fig. 2C). As before, the activity decreased in the order wild-type > H106A > H17A with the same relative ratio between the two histidine mutant proteins. As phosphate release occurs early during catalysis and before C-(6proR) hydrogen abstraction (6Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this result indicates that both histidine residues are involved in chemical steps leading directly to the initial C-O bond cleavage. It should be noted that the reaction with wild-type enzyme is well in the range of saturation at the experimental conditions used, and thus, the activity of the mutant proteins is overestimated by a factor of 2-3-fold for the H106A and H17A mutant protein, respectively. FMN:NADPH-oxidoreductase Activity of the Mutant Proteins—In contrast to the monofunctional chorismate synthases from bacterial and plant sources, fungal chorismate synthases have an intrinsic “secondary” activity in that they can utilize NADPH to reduce FMN to its catalytically active reduced form (bifunctionality) (19Henstrand J.M. Amrhein N. Schmid J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As the activity of the two histidine mutant proteins was higher in the anaerobic (Fig. 2B) than in the aerobic assay (Fig. 2A), an additional effect of the amino acid replacements on the capacity to use NADPH was indicated. This was confirmed by measuring the rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of oxygen and absence of EPSP (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, both histidine mutant proteins showed a lower rate of NADPH oxidation amounting to 90 and 30% for the H17A and H106A mutant protein, respectively, as compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). Km values for NADPH were also affected by the mutation, increasing from 43 μm for wild-type NcCS to 110 and 280 μm for the H17A and H106A mutant protein, respectively. In previously reported experiments, we have provided evidence that NADPH and EPSP compete for the same binding site. As a consequence, high concentrations of EPSP cause a decrease in the rate of NADPH oxidation (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of EPSP is relieved upon conversion of EPSP to chorismate, resulting in a pronounced acceleration of NADPH oxidation (Fig. 4B, wild-type). As the two histidine mutant proteins are basically inactive under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2A), they cannot remove EPSP through conversion to chorismate, and thus, the inhibitory effect of EPSP remains constant in contrast to wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4B). Binding of Oxidized FMN to the Histidine Mutant Proteins—Binding of oxidized FMN to both histidine mutant proteins was determined by difference UV-visible spectrophotometry and ultrafiltration assays as described recently (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both histidine mutant proteins possess dissociation constants similar to wild-type protein (Table I) suggesting that neither histidine residue is involved directly in binding of the oxidized FMN.Table IDissociation constants for NcCS and FMN or EPSPLigandKdMethodWild-type NcCSNcCS H17ANcCS H106AμmFMN30 ± 8aValues taken from Ref. 15.34 ± 9aValues taken from Ref. 15.38 ± 5aValues taken from Ref. 15.Ultrafiltration39bAverage of three independent measurements.9.535UV/visible difference spectroscopyFMN (in presence of EPSP)16 ± 5cAverage of four independent measurements.12 ± 4cAverage of four independent measurements.10 ± 1cAverage of four independent measurements.UltrafiltrationEPSP (in presence of FMN)12bAverage of three independent measurements.67—d—, not determined.Flavin fluorescence quenching17 ± 4bAverage of three independent measurements.83 ± 5aValues taken from Ref. 15.28 ± 8aValues taken from Ref. 15.UV/visible spectroscopya Values taken from Ref. 15Kitzing K.

Open table in a new tab Moreover, the spectral changes observed upon binding of oxidized FMN to the histidine mutant proteins were identical to those seen with wild-type enzyme, indicating that the mutation does not affect the environment of the flavin in the active site (Fig. 5). Even in the presence of EPSP, binding of oxidized FMN to the histidine mutant proteins is unchanged (Table I), implying that neither of the two residues plays a role in binding of FMN in the ternary complex. Binding of EPSP to the Histidine Mutant Proteins in the Presence of Oxidized FMN—Binding of EPSP to the H17A and H106A mutant protein in the presence of FMN was first monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The observed spectral changes were used to calculate the dissociation constant for EPSP. In the case of the His106 mutant protein, it is similar to the one determined for wild-type protein, whereas it is increased 5-fold for the H17A mutant protein (Table I and Fig. 6). This indicates that His17 is involved in EPSP binding, whereas His106 is not. Qualitatively, the spectral changes observed when titrating the H17A mutant protein with EPSP are very similar to those reported earlier with the wild-type protein (Fig. 6A). In contrast to the H17A mutant protein, the H106A mutant protein exhibited strikingly different spectral changes (Fig. 6B). This finding provides spectroscopic evidence that His106 is in close proximity to the flavin ring system, whereas His17 is not. This result contrasts to the binding of oxidized FMN alone, which is not affected by either histidine replacement (Fig. 5), suggesting that binding of EPSP affects the spatial arrangement in the active site such that the flavin ring system and the His106 interact with each other in the presence of substrate. These findings received further support from fluorescence quench experiments where flavin emission is measured as a function of EPSP concentration. Although the H17A mutant protein exhibited changes similar to those observed with wild-type enzyme, the H106A mutant protein completely failed to show this effect (Fig. 7, A and B), corroborating the findings obtained by UV-visible absorbance spectrophotometry. Binding of Reduced FMN to NcCS—Since the fully reduced (dihydroquinone) form of FMN is the catalytically relevant form in the chorismate synthase catalyzed reaction, we have also investigated its binding to NcCS. It has been shown previously that the reduction of FMN by NcCS leads directly to the fully reduced dihydroquinone form without the occurrence of a radical species (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reduction of the flavin in the presence of a reporter dye of known redox potential allows the determination of the redox potential for the oxidized FMN/reduced FMN redox couple using UV-visible absorbance spectrophotometry (8Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Massey V. Curti B. Zanetti G. Ronchi S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Como, Italy1991: 581-584Google Scholar). In the presence of stoichiometric concentrations of wild-type NcCS, the redox potential of the FMNox/FMNred couple was determined to -167 mV, i.e. 40 mV more positive than that of the free couple in solution (-207 mV, (21Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)). This indicates a 23-fold tighter binding of the reduced form to wild-type enzyme as compared with oxidized FMN, amounting to a stabilization of 1.85 kcal/mol or a Kd for reduced FMN of 1.7 μm (39 μm for oxidized FMN (15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42658-42666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). Both histidine mutant proteins showed more negative redox potentials of -175 mV and -182 mV for the H17A and H106A replacement, respectively. This translates into a weaker binding of reduced FMN to the two histidine mutant proteins, yielding dissociation constants of 3.3 μm (H17A) and 5.6 μm (H106A). Observation of a Transient Flavin Intermediate—When anaerobic solutions of chorismate synthase-bound reduced FMN and EPSP are mixed in the stopped-flow instrument, a characteristic flavin-intermediate is transiently formed (6Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9907-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Kitzing K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. J. Biol.

Soc. 1991; 113: 8566-8567Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This species is generated very rapidly within a few milliseconds and disappears when all substrate has been consumed. Although the process leading to this intermediate is thought to be the protonation of the N(1) position of the anionic, reduced form of FMN (pKa of N(1)-H = 6.7 in free solution), its exact role in catalysis is not fully understood. To evaluate the effect of the histidine residues 17 and 106, both histidine mutant proteins were investigated with regard to their ability to form this typical flavin-derived intermediate. As shown in Fig. 8, the intermediate was observed with both histidine mutant proteins. With the H17A mutant protein, the intermediate is similar to the one observed with wild-type enzyme, having an absorbance maximum at 390 nm with a long wavelength absorbance in the range of 400-550 nm, albeit much less pronounced as for wild-type enzyme (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the spectrum for the H106A mutant protein showed, in addition to the peak at 390 nm, a peak at shorter wavelength at 370 but hardly any absorbance in the long wavelength range (Fig. 8C). Again, the decay of the intermediate is considerably slower than with wild type and corresponds to the diminished rate of product formation (Fig. 2B). Thus, these observations show that both histidine residues affect the spectral characteristics and the lifetime of the transient flavin intermediate, with the H106A mutant protein exhibiting the most fundamental spectral changes in terms of absorbance maxima and the long wavelength band. Molecular Orbital Calculations of Reduced Lumiflavin—The proposed protonation of the N(1) position of the anionic, reduced flavin in the process, leading to the formation of the transient flavin intermediate observed during the chorismate synthase catalyzed reaction, raises the following question: Why this would be required for efficient catalysis? To investigate this question, we were interested in the effect of N(1)-protonation on the electron distribution in the isoalloxazine ring. Earlier quantum mechanical calculations have shown that deprotonation of N(1) in the reduced form have different effects on the atoms in the ring; although N(1) and the carbonyl oxygens gain negative charge, C(2), C(5a), N(5), and C(10a) lose electron density (24Hall L.H. Orchard B.J. Tripathy S.K. Int. J. Quant. Chem. 1987; XXXI: 217-242Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A reinvestigation of the electron density distribution in the HOMO of reduced lumiflavin (with a methyl group in position 10 instead of a ribitylphosphate side chain) confirmed this differential effect of the protonation state of N(1) on the electron distribution in the isoalloxazine ring system. As shown in Fig. 9, protonation of N(1) causes a shift of electron density from the N(1) position (Fig. 9A) to C(10a), N(5), and C(4a) of the pyrazine ring. In view of the possibility that a transient electron transfer from reduced FMN to EPSP initiates C-O bond breakage, the location of the highest electron density in the isoalloxazine ring may be a decisive factor in catalysis. The conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate to chorismate by chorismate synthase is certainly one of the most intriguing flavin-dependent reacti"
https://openalex.org/W2009828573,"The mechanistic basis of control of replication initiation of plasmid R6K was investigated by addressing the following questions. What are the biochemical attributes of mutations in the π initiator protein that caused loss of negative control of initiation? Did the primary control involve only initiator protein-ori DNA interaction or did it also involve protein-protein interactions between π and several host-encoded proteins? Mutations at two different regions of the π-encoding sequence individually caused some loss of negative control as indicated by a relatively modest increase in copy number. However, combinations of the mutation P42L, which caused loss of DNA looping, with those located in the region between the residues 106 and 113 induced a robust enhancement of copy number. These mutant forms promoted higher levels of replication in vitro in a reconstituted system consisting of 22 purified proteins. The mutant forms of π were susceptible to pronounced iteron-induced monomerization in comparison with the WT protein. As contrasted with the changes in DNA-protein interaction, we found no detectable differences in protein-protein interaction between wild type π with DnaA, DnaB helicase, and DnaG primase on one hand and between the high copy mutant forms and the same host proteins on the other. The DnaG-π interaction reported here is novel. Taken together, the results suggest that both loss of negative control due to iteron-induced monomerization of the initiator and enhanced iteron-initiator interaction appear to be the principal causes of enhanced copy number.

Ever since the publication of the landmark “Replicon Model” 40 years ago by Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin (1Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1964; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar), molecular analyses of the regulation of copy control of plasmid DNAs have been and continue to be instrumental in providing key insights into the mechanisms of regulation of replication initiation. There are at least two principal mechanisms of copy control of plasmid chromosomes. In ColE1 type plasmids, negative regulation of initiation is exercised through RNA-RNA interaction between the primer RNA and an antisense RNA. A small basic protein called Rom enhances the RNA-RNA interaction that negatively controls copy number by preventing the processing of the primer precursor into a functional primer (2Dasgupta S.

A second, more ubiquitous mechanism of copy control is by interaction of the plasmid encoded initiator protein with short tandemly repeated sequences called iterons, which are present at the replication origins of bacterial and plasmid chromosomes (6Germino J.

The synthesis of the initiator protein π of R6K and other initiator proteins are autoregulated at the transcriptional level (13Kelley W.L. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Davis G. Greener A. Helinski D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, autoregulation of initiator synthesis by itself cannot adequately explain copy control simply because an increase in chromosome copy number would titrate out the initiator and derepress the synthesis of the initiator thereby causing further increase in copy number (16Chattoraj D.

Cell. 1985; 52: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Helinski and independently Chattoraj were the first to point out that the initiator protein-mediated pairing of plasmid DNA at the iterons in vivo either in cis or in trans causes turning off of replication initiation, and this mechanism of repression is called “handcuffing” (17Chattoraj D.K.

A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas normal amounts of initiator positively control initiation, an excess of initiator can down-regulate replication presumably by (i) handcuffing origins and (ii) sequestering host-encoded replication proteins by protein-protein interaction (16Chattoraj D. Cordes K. Abeles A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6456-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18McEachern M. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the region has two DnaA binding sites, an AT-rich region, and an ihf site that binds to the host-encoded DNA-bending protein called integration host factor (IHF) 1The abbreviations used are: IHF, integration host factor; ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild type; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; DR, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CD, circular dichroism; TM, triple mutant; SOS, DNA damage-induced inhibition of cell division.

DNA looping, promoted by π bound to the γ iterons, the single iteron at α, or the half iteron at β, is a determinative event in the activation of these two distantly located origins (25Miron A.

We postulate that activation of β (or α) not only requires a single dimeric π but also monomeric π proteins that are bound to the remainder of the γ iterons and are involved in the formation of a preinitiation complex that includes DnaA (see Fig. 1B). Many high copy number mutants of the π initiator protein of R6K have been isolated (24Miron A. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because chaperones appear to mediate conversion of inactive dimeric initiator to active monomers and because one does not know at this time the identity of the chaperones involved in R6K replication, the in vitro analysis needs to be carried out with a replication system reconstituted from highly purified proteins that strictly excludes any chaperons. We have recently developed such systems for R6K (12Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and for the F factor. 2S. Zzaman, M. Abhyankar, and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. We wished to investigate the biochemical properties of the π protein that were altered by high copy mutations by asking the following questions. Is the high copy number (enhanced initiation frequency) solely due to altered interactions of the mutant forms of the π protein with the ori DNA and altered π-π interaction (changing the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the cell) or does it also involve altered interactions of π with the host-encoded replication proteins DnaA, DnaB, and DnaG that are known to be required for R6K replication? We have investigated the above-mentioned questions in vivo and in vitro using a reconstituted replication system that lacked chaperones (12Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is important to use a replication system without chaperones that might introduce structural alterations (in oligomeric status) in the π protein(s). Our observations show that (i) the high copy mutations reduced negative control not only by reducing or eliminating handcuffing (looping) but also by enhancing the interaction of the protein with ori DNA; (ii) the enhanced binding was probably caused by DNA-ligand-induced monomerization of the high copy mutant forms of π as contrasted with the WT protein that did not monomerize upon DNA binding; and (iii) there was no measurable differences in binary interactions between the wt π with host-encoded DnaA, DnaB helicase, and DnaG primase on one hand and between the mutant forms with the same host proteins on the other. Thus the principal control of replication initiation appears to be effected by the interaction of the π protein with ori DNA and by interaction of π with itself. The data suggest that initiator-ori interaction is the primary mechanistic step in copy control.

The PCR profile was 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4 min. A total of 25 cycles were carried out with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was digested with DpnI restriction enzyme for 3 h and used to transform DH5α-competent cells. The transformants were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The resultant plasmids were called pRSβ-R6, pRSβ-113, pRSβ-R6–113, pRSβ-DM, pRSβ-R6DM, pRSβ-TM, and pRSβ-R6TM for different mutants, respectively. Expression of π Protein—The π protein was expressed in the vector pTXB1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) under the control of T7 promoter using E. coli BL21(DE3) as the host strain. The resultant plasmids were designated as pTXB1-WT, pTXB1-R6 etc. for respective mutants. Upon induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) π protein was expressed as a fusion with the chitin binding peptide separated by an intein sequence, which can be used to cleave off the fusion partner in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). The ORFs of WT and different mutant π proteins were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide pairs, PiFPNde and PiIntSalRP. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI, ligated between the NdeI and XhoI sites to pTXB1 vector, and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). This strain was used for production of π protein as well as for complementation of replication of γ ori in trans. Replication of γ ori in Vivo—BL21(DE3)-competent cells containing the pTXB1-Pi (for all the mutants) were co-transformed with pγ-Kan and plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The culture medium was supplemented with IPTG and DTT to final concentrations of 5 μm and 1 mm, respectively. The transformants were counted for each set and verified for presence of the plasmids. Activation of ori β (Looping Assay)—The rationale for the assay is that ori γ, but not ori α and β, needs the DNA-bending protein IHF for efficient replication. Therefore, in an IHFΔ host α and β, which depend on DNA looping with γ (but not localized DNA bending), are active, whereas ori γ replicons are inactive and form no colonies. The competent cells of E. coli HN356 (IHF) and HN840 (IHFΔ) were transformed with different pRSβ plasmids (containing ori β-γ and various forms of π) and plated on LB agar containing ampicillin (for HN356) or ampicillin and tetracycline (for HN840). Colony formation in an IHFΔ host was a measure of the efficiency of β-γ looping. The average numbers of colonies from three separate experiments are shown in Table IV.Table IVLooping activities of π mutantsType of πNumber of colonies growing in IHFIHFΔWT16481088R611763113146410R6-11311525DM10720R6-DM10163TM7920R6-TM8140 Open table in a new tab Determination of Relative Copy Number—The competent DH5α cells containing different pRSβ-π plasmids were transformed with pA-CYC184 (New England Biolabs) and plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Individual double transformants were grown in 5 ml of LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm containing the above antibiotics to same density. Plasmids were prepared using the Qiaspin™ Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and finally eluted in the same volumes. Equal volumes of DNA samples were digested for 3 h with BamHI, which linearizes both the pRSβ and pACYC184 plasmids, and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed by the Quant1™ gel document system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The percent weight of the pRSβ (R6K) band in total DNA was calculated after normalizing the WT π band intensity with respect to the pACYC184 internal standard. Purification of π Protein—Different forms of π proteins were expressed using the expression vector pTXB1 as described above. Because WT π protein tends to aggregate upon overexpression, we co-transformed the pTXB1-π plasmids with pGKJE8 (35Nishihara K. Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) for co-expression of chaperone proteins. A single colony of the transformants selected on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking in 10 ml of LB broth with appropriate antibiotics. This was diluted in 500 ml of fresh LB medium containing the antibiotics and grown to an optical density (A600 nm) of 0.7. Then IPTG (400 μm), l-arabinose (0.5 g/liter), and tetracycline (20 ng/ml) were added for the expression of π proteins and the chaperones. The culture was further grown for 3 h, and the cells were harvested. All the further steps were carried out at 4 °C unless mentioned otherwise. The cells were re-suspended in 10 ml of column buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were freeze-thawed two times and sonicated for 15 s using a microtip probe to shear the DNA. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of chitin beads (New England Biolabs) and gently mixed for 30 min. The beads were loaded in an empty column that was allowed to drain. The column was washed with 30 ml of column buffer. The beads were extracted with 4 ml of elution buffer (30 mm DTT in column buffer) at 16 °C for 4 h to elute the protein. This was repeated two more times, and the eluates were collected and pooled. The pooled fraction was mixed with an equal volume of buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and loaded onto a Amersham Biosciences FPLC™ Q-Sepharose FF column. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B and eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer B. The positive fractions were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against storage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol) for 2 h. This was subjected to further purification by gel filtration on a superose-12 column in buffer B containing 300 mm sodium chloride. The purified fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer for 2 h, and frozen in aliquots at –70 °C. The purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Substrate for DNA Binding Assays—The binding sites for the π proteins were cloned in pUC18 as follows. Two complementary oligonucleotide pairs were designed containing the sequence for either the iteron number VII (DR) of the R6K γ ori (36Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar) or the inverted repeat (IR) from the π promoter region with XbaI overhangs. Fifty picomoles of each oligonucleotide pair was mixed and kinased in a 50-μl reaction using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped by heating the mixture at 94 °C for 10 min, and the oligonucleotide pairs were allowed to anneal by incubation at 55 °C for 2 h followed by spontaneous cooling to room temperature. An aliquot of the above mixture representing 2 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides was ligated into pUC18 linearized with XbaI and dephosphorylated using Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences). DH5α-competent cells were transformed with the above ligation mixes and the transformants were selected by blue/white screening on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and IPTG. The plasmid DNA from the white colonies was verified by sequencing. The clones containing the single iteron sequence and the inverted repeat were pUC18-DR and pUC18-IR. The DR and IR DNA fragments were then excised out from the pUC18-DR and pUC18-IR, respectively, by double digestion with restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. The fragments were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA fragments (2 pmol) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in a 50-μl reaction at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 20 min and passed through a 1-ml G-25 spin column to eliminate free radiolabel. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Binding assays of the different π mutants to a single iteron (DR) and to the inverted repeat (IR) DNA fragments were carried out by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. 10 pmol of DNA substrate (DR or IR) was incubated with increasing concentrations of different Pi mutants in a 15-μl reaction in 1× reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) for 10 min at room temperature. Immediately after the incubation, the reactions were loaded onto 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 3 h at 100 Vin1 × TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm Boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The gels were analyzed and quantified with a PhosphorImager™ (Amersham Biosciences), and the percent binding was calculated from the amount of radiolabeled DNA shifted as a function of protein concentration. The relative binding constants (Kd values) were calculated as the concentration of protein required for half-maximal binding. ELISA for Protein-Protein Interactions—Protein-protein interactions between π and DnaA, DnaB, and DnaG were carried out as previously described (37Lu Y. Ratnakar P.V.A.L. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Sharma R. Kachroo A. Bastia D.

Reconstitution of R6K DNA Replication in Vitro—The details of reconstitution of R6K replication in vitro using 22 purified proteins have been described (12Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The template DNA pMA1 contained ori γ of R6K cloned in pUC19 vector. The in vitro reaction did not include DNA polymerase I, and the primosomal proteins priA, -B, and -C and DnaT. The absence of these proteins prevented any initiation taking place from the pUC19 ori. CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra were acquired using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter at a resolution of 0.2 nm and a bandwidth of 2 nm. WT π protein or its mutant forms were dissolved in buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) at a concentration of 0.083 mg/ml using a cell of 0.02 cm path length. Ten spectra/experiment were averaged, and three experiments were pooled to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm in the same buffer using a calculated specific absorbance coefficient of 0.62 mg–1 cm–2. Molar ellipticity was calculated using the mean residual mass of 114.7. In Vivo Characterization of High Copy Number Single Mutants and Combinations of Mutants of π—During the course of the last several years, we and others have isolated several copy up mutants in the π open reading frame (ORF) that individually but modestly enhance the copy number of the plasmid (24Miron A. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Kruger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol.

We have previously isolated a mutant form of π, P42L, that is defective in DNA looping and fails to activate α and β origins without having a negative impact on initiation from ori γ. In fact the copy number of the γ replicon is enhanced 2- to 3-fold by the mutation (25Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other high copy number mutations (e.g. P106L, F107S, and P113S) have been isolated in the region spanned by the residues 106–113, and each mutation caused a relatively modest enhancement of copy number (24Miron A. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Kruger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol.

The mutant genotypes are shown in Table I. First, we wished to investigate the effect of these mutations individually and in various combinations on the copy number in vivo and to investigate possible gross changes induced in the protein structure by the mutations. Second, we also wished to characterize biochemically the mutant forms of the π protein in vitro using a reconstituted replication system (12Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), to gain additional insights into the initiation control mechanism. The replication efficiency in vivo of the WT and the various mutant forms is shown in Table II. The data show that all of the various forms of π are almost equall"
https://openalex.org/W2019390366,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG is a heme-containing catalase-peroxidase responsible for activation, through its peroxidase cycle, of the front line antituberculosis antibiotic isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide). Formation of Compound I (oxyferryl heme-porphyrin π-cation radical), the classical peroxidase intermediate generated when the resting enzyme turns over with alkyl peroxides, is rapidly followed by production of a protein-centered tyrosyl radical in this enzyme. In our efforts to identify the residue at which this radical is formed, nitric oxide was used as a radical scavenging reagent. Quenching of the tyrosyl radical generated in the presence of NO was shown using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and formation of nitrotyrosine was confirmed by proteolytic digestion followed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the NO-treated enzyme. These results are consistent with formation of nitrosyltyrosine by addition of NO to tyrosyl radical and oxidation of this intermediate to nitrotyrosine. Two predominant nitrotyrosine-containing peptides were identified that were purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. Both peptides were derived from the same M. tuberculosis KatG sequence spanning residues 346–356 with the amino acid sequence SPAGAWQYTAK, and both peptides contained nitrotyrosine at residue 353. Some modification of Trp-351 most probably into nitrosotryptophan was also found in one of the two peptides. Control experiments using denatured KatG or carried out in the absence of peroxide did not produce nitrotyrosine. In the mutant enzyme KatG(Y353F), which was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis, a tyrosyl radical was also formed upon turnover with peroxide but in poor yield compared with wild-type KatG.

KatG enzymes have little sequence homology with typical catalases but high homology to yeast cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, other Class I peroxidases (3Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 141-142Google Scholar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG is of special interest to us because of its importance in the activation of isoniazid (INH), the first and still most important antituberculosis antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. The catalytic mechanism of M. tuberculosis KatG is under investigation in the context of the activation of this prodrug and because of widespread resistance to INH that arises due to point mutations in the katG gene (4Zhang Y. Young D. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1994; 34: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S.

Our recent work demonstrated that the catalytic cycle of M. tuberculosis KatG includes a classical Compound I (oxyferryl [Fe(IV)=O] porphyrin π-cation radical) (8Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that is catalytically competent, being reduced by a number of substrates including INH without evidence for stabilization of Compound II (8Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that KatG Compound I decays quickly in the absence of exogenous substrates, consistent with an endogenous electron transfer pathway producing a tyrosyl radical (9Chouchane S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results of kinetic studies suggested that a unique radical is generated in a rate-limiting step presumably through oxidation of the phenolic ring of tyrosine by Compound I (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional evidence in favor of this reaction pathway came from study of the KatG(Y229F) mutant in which formation of Compound II from Compound I is kinetically coupled to formation of tyrosyl radical (10Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar pathway is responsible for initiation of the cyclooxygenase activity of prostaglandin-H synthase (PGHS) (11Tsai A. Wu G. Palmer G. Bambai B. Koehn J.A. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 62: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl radicals are formed in other heme and non-heme proteins and enzymes such as myoglobin (13Gunther M.R. Sturgeon B.E. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), photosystem II (14Barry B.A. el-Deeb M.K. Sandusky P.O. Babcock G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20139-20143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ribonucleotide reductase (15Larsson A. Sjoberg B.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2037-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), bovine catalase (16Ivancich A. Jouve H.M. Sartor B. Gaillard J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9356-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), turnip peroxidase (17Ivancich A. Mazza G. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6860-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and prostaglandin-H synthase (18Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) from endogenous electron transfers to hypervalent metal centers. The tyrosyl radicals of PGHS, ribonucleotide reductase, and photosystem II are directly involved in their catalytic processes (19Stubbe J. van Der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar), while in the other examples, functional roles may be provided by the radical, but these have not yet been elucidated. The finding that in M. tuberculosis KatG the yield of tyrosyl radical upon turnover of the resting enzyme with a small excess of alkyl peroxide is great enough to suggest a potential functional role along with the evidence for a rapid reaction of the radical with small molecules, including the antibiotic INH (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggests that this radical might contribute to INH activation and or production of the bactericidal molecule known to require KatG activity in M. tuberculosis treated with the antibiotic. Identification of the tyrosine residue that forms a radical in M. tuberculosis KatG is necessary for a more complete understanding of the catalytic cycle of this enzyme. We have approached this issue by application of a radical scavenging technique that takes advantage of the very rapid reaction between tyrosyl radical and nitric oxide, which has a rate near the diffusion limit (1–2 × 109m–1 s–1) (20Eiserich J.P. Butler J. Van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide has been shown to quench the tyrosyl radicals formed during turnover of photosystem II (21Petrouleas V. Diner B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenerg. 1990; 1015: 131-140Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and in the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase (22Lepoivre M. Flaman J.M. Bobe P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8903-8909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore an initial reversibly formed nitrosyltyrosine intermediate is further oxidized to the stable product 3-nitrotyrosine in the case of PGHS due to the peroxidase activity of this enzyme (24Goodwin D.C.

The potential for similar reactions in KatG led to the present study. A nitric oxide donor, proline NONOate (PROLI/NO), was used here to scavenge the tyrosyl radical during turnover of the resting enzyme with peroxide. Radical quenching as well as formation of nitrotyrosine was confirmed in these experiments. Peptide mapping and subsequent sequencing analysis demonstrated that nitrotyrosine was produced at tyrosine 353, a unique tyrosine found in the M. tuberculosis enzyme but not in other catalase-peroxidases. Materials—PROLI/NO was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Proteinase K, TPCK-treated trypsin, trifluoroacetic acid, 3-nitrotyrosine, and HPLC grade acetonitrile were all purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were the highest purity grade available. Peroxyacetic acid (20%) was treated with catalase, as previously described, to remove hydrogen peroxide (10Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis KatG Preparation—Wild-type and mutant M. tuberculosis KatG were prepared from an overexpression system in Escherichia coli strain UM262 that contains the M. tuberculosis katG gene in the vector pKatII (a gift from Stewart Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Enzyme purification and quantification were carried out according to previously published procedures (8Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S.

Enzyme Activity Assay—Peroxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH = 5.5, using tert-butyl hydroperoxide with o-dianisidine following color development at 460 nm (25Marcinkeviciene J.A.

One unit of peroxidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of o-dianisidine/min. Catalase activity was measured according to a previously reported method (25Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reaction of KatG with NO—NO donor PROLI/NO was dissolved in cold 10 mm NaOH immediately before use and is stable under alkaline conditions. At neutral pH, decomposition of 1 mol of PROLI/NO will yield 2 mol of NO. The concentration of PROLI/NO stock solution was evaluated based on the absorbance at 252 nm (ϵ = 8400 m–1·cm–1). For experiments designed to follow the quenching of the EPR signal of tyrosyl radical, 50 μl of 100 μm KatG solution (pH 7.2) was injected into an EPR tube followed by addition of 2 μl of 2.5 mm alkaline PROLI/NO. PROLI/NO was allowed to decompose in the KatG solution for one half-life (∼2 s at pH 7.2 and 25 °C) after which 50 μl of 300 μm peroxyacetic acid (PAA) was added to initiate turnover of the resting (ferric) enzyme to Compound I, which is followed by tyrosyl radical formation (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The samples were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and frozen. EPR spectra were subsequently recorded at 77 K using a Varian X-band spectrometer (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed under identical conditions but without addition of PROLI/NO. Protein Nitration and HPLC Analysis of Nitrotyrosine-containing Peptides—A molar ratio of KatG:PAA:PROLI/NO = 1:6:3 was used to get maximum yields of nitrated protein. Briefly 150 μl of 100 μm KatG was mixed with a 3-fold excess of PROLI/NO in an Eppendorf tube; after2sof incubation at 37 °C, 150 μl of PAA (600 μm) was added to the mixture. The resulting reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Ultrafiltration using a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off Centricon centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was used to separate the enzyme from other components (five washes of retentate with 2 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Preliminary experiments were performed using Proteinase K for complete digestion of the NO-treated enzyme to ensure that optical detection of nitrotyrosine would not be compromised by interference from absorbance due to the presence of heme-containing peptide(s). The 3× ultrafiltered NO-treated KatG was subjected to proteolysis (in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 at 37 °C for 16 h) by the addition of 1:50 (w/w) Proteinase K. The digests were ultrafiltered (10-kDa cut-off Microcon centrifugal filter device) prior to HPLC separation. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC over a Zorbax SBC-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm). Buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0 to 60% B over 60 min and then 60% B to 100% B over 10 min followed by a series of washing steps. Absorbance was simultaneously monitored at 280 and 360 nm; the latter wavelength corresponds to an absorbance maximum of nitrotyrosine in acidic solution (26Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize peptides, fragments with strong absorbance at 360 nm were collected and dried using a Speed-Vac centrifuge and redissolved in either 0.1 n HCl or 0.1 n NaOH. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a 14NT UV-visible spectrophotometer (AVIV Biomedical, Inc.). Tryptic Digestion of KatG and Peptide Mapping—TPCK-treated trypsin, which cleaves specifically at Arg–X and Lys–X bonds, was used to obtain reproducible peptide mapping results from the NO-treated enzyme. M. tuberculosis KatG was found to require denaturation to achieve complete digestion with trypsin. A solution of KatG in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, was made 6 m in urea. After a 10-min incubation at 55 °C, the protein solution was diluted with buffer to lower the concentration of urea to 1.0 m. Proteolysis was started by the addition of 1:30 (w/w) TPCK-treated trypsin and allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the removal of trypsin through ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa cut-off filter. The tryptic fragments were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above except that the linear gradient was 0–50% B over 90 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peaks that showed strong absorbance at 360 nm were collected, concentrated, and further purified on a Zorbax SBC-8 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a shallow gradient of 20–30% B over 40 min, which removed a small amount of co-eluted peptides that have no absorbance at 360 nm. Peptide Sequencing and Mass Analysis—N-terminal Edman sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencing system, and MALDI-mass spectrometry was performed on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager DE Pro in positive reflection mode, both at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) carrying pKatII was used for overexpression of both wild-type and mutated KatG proteins. Mutagenesis was performed on pKatII using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Pairs of complementary oligonucleotides 5′-1043-CTGGCGCTTGGCAATTCACCGCCAAGGACGG1073-3′ and 5′-1073CCGTCCTTGGCGGTGAATTGCCAAGCGCCAG1043-3′ (synthesized and purified by Qiagen) were designed to introduce the required mutation indicated in boldface to produce KatG(Y353F) (A to T mutation, Tyr-Phe replacement). Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reaction products were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain (Stratagene) for selection and amplification. Sequencing (Gene Wiz, Inc.) of the mutated katG gene confirmed that only the desired nucleotide substitution was present, and the mutated plasmid was then transformed back into E. coli strain UM262 for protein expression. Overexpression and purification of mutant KatG(Y353F) were achieved as previously described for WT-KatG (8Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RFQ-EPR and Optical Stopped-flow Spectrophotometry of KatG(Y353F)—Rapid freeze-quench EPR samples were prepared as previously reported using a System 1000 chemical/freeze quench apparatus (Update Instrument, Inc.) (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Specifically wild-type or mutant KatG (50 μm final concentration) was mixed with 3-fold excess peroxyacetic acid and aged for varying time periods. Frozen samples were packed into quartz EPR tubes in an isopentane bath at –130 °C. EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K using a Bruker ElexSys E-500 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band. Spin quantitation was performed by double integration of EPR signals and comparison to a Cu(II)EDTA standard in 50% ethylene glycol also examined at 77 K. The dilution of KatG by isopentane in the frozen samples was also taken into account (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Optical stopped-flow experiments were performed at 25 °C using a HiTech Scientific Model SF-61 DX2 apparatus equipped with a rapid scanning diode array spectrophotometer as published previously (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of KatG(Y353F) mutant enzyme (50 μm) and PAA (150 μm) were the same as those used in the RFQ-EPR studies. Quenching of KatG Tyrosyl Radical by Nitric Oxide—EPR spectroscopy was used to first monitor whether the tyrosyl radical formed upon reaction of resting KatG with alkyl peroxides could be quenched by NO generated from a donor such as PROLI/NO. Fig. 1 shows the results of an experiment in which a 3-fold excess of peroxyacetic acid was added to KatG in the presence and absence of the NO donor. Previous rapid freezequench EPR results demonstrated the formation of tyrosyl radical on a millisecond time scale under conditions similar to those used here with the maximum yield of radical achieved after ∼5 s (16Ivancich A. Jouve H.M. Sartor B. Gaillard J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9356-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here the tyrosyl radical signal detected in the absence of NO (Fig. 1A) was completely quenched in the presence of NO. In the first protocol, peroxide was added to a mixture of the enzyme plus PROLI/NO that had been incubated for 2 s (Fig. 1B). The 2-s time interval corresponds to approximately one half-life of the donor decomposition rate when it is exposed to neutral pH. Therefore, the concentration of NO in the mixture upon addition of peroxide was estimated to be equal to 1 eq/KatG subunit. The time interval during which enzyme was incubated with PAA was the same for both samples. Similar results were found when reversing the order of addition such that the same total amount of PROLI/NO was added immediately after the addition of a 3-fold excess of PAA to KatG. Detection of Nitrotyrosine—Having demonstrated the quenching of the tyrosyl radical EPR signal, we proceeded to seek evidence for nitrotyrosine in the treated enzyme. The HPLC profile of Proteinase K digests of KatG treated with PROLI/NO and PAA showed several peptides with optical absorbance peaks both at 280 and 360 nm (Fig. 2A). The absorbance at 360 nm provided clues that nitrotyrosine was present. The fragment eluting at 30 min, which had the highest absorbance at 360 nm, also exhibited an optical spectrum similar to that of authentic nitrotyrosine. Furthermore, when this sample was examined at pH 10, an absorbance maximum was found at 430 nm. The shift in absorbance maximum is expected upon deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of nitrotyrosine (Fig. 2B) (26Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the other major fractions having an optical absorbance peak at 360 nm (data not shown). These results are consistent with the presence of nitrotyrosine in multiple peptides. Since Proteinase K is a nonspecific proteolytic enzyme, there is no specific information available from these HPLC profiles as multiple peptides could contain the same labeled residue. In an effort to understand the specificity of the NO scavenging approach and to rule out nitrotyrosine formation in KatG that could occur due to reactions that do not involve tyrosyl radical, a series of control experiments were carried out. First of all, native or active enzyme was shown to be required for the formation of nitrotyrosine. For example, the protocol described above in which NO donor was added to KatG plus PAA was repeated using KatG that had been denatured either by heating for 5 min at 100 °C (Fig. 3A) or by treatment with 6 m urea (data not shown). No nitrotyrosine was detected in the proteolytic digests of these samples. Likewise tryptic digests of KatG reacted with PAA in the absence of NO donor or with NO donor in the absence of PAA did not contain nitrotyrosine (Fig. 3, B and C). Nitrotyrosine was not observed in digests of KatG to which PROLI/NO was added 5 min after the addition of PAA during which time tyrosyl radical will have completely decayed (11Tsai A. Wu G. Palmer G. Bambai B. Koehn J.A. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results demonstrate that nitrotyrosine is found only when catalytically active KatG, PAA, and NO are present (Fig. 3D). To test the effect of the concentrations of nitric oxide and PAA on the yield of protein nitration, varying amounts (3-, 6-, and 10-fold excess) of PROLI/NO in combination with 3-, 6-, and 10-fold excess of PAA were used in similar protocols. The labeling, tryptic digestion, and HPLC separation were carried out as described above. The same two major nitrotyrosine-containing peaks (as in Fig. 3D) were consistently detected in all digests (data not shown). Although 3-fold excess of PAA has been previously shown to be sufficient to generate a maximum yield of tyrosyl radical from resting KatG (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in our labeling experiment, a maximum yield of nitrotyrosine was achieved using a 6-fold molar ratio of PAA and a 3-fold molar ratio of PROLI/NO (6-fold molar ratio of NO upon fully decomposing). Since the use of large excesses of NO did not produce any new significantly nitrated peptides, these results strongly suggested that a specific reaction, although possibly not at a unique tyrosine residue, was responsible for nitrotyrosine formation. Using authentic 3-nitrotyrosine as an HPLC standard, we estimate that the maximum yield of nitrotyrosine was around 0.1–0.2 mol/mol of KatG protein subunit. The estimated yield of tyrosyl radical by direct measurement using quantitative RFQ-EPR was around 0.19 spin/heme, 2The maximum yield of tyrosyl radical previously reported based on RFQ-EPR experiments on the wild-type enzyme (9Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was re-evaluated during the course of this work and had been overestimated by a factor of approximately 2. Here we have compared the maximum yield of tyrosyl radical in KatG(Y353F) with the corrected values for the WT enzyme. which was considered low due to rapid decay of the radical. This yield of nitrotyrosine then reflects a highly efficient scavenging of tyrosyl radical and conversion of the proposed nitroso intermediate to nitrotyrosine. Identification of the Nitrated Tyrosine Residue—As shown in Fig. 4, the fractions eluting at 71 and 75 min showed absorbance maxima at both 280 and 360 nm, which indicated peptides containing nitrotyrosine. These peptides were collected, concentrated, and subjected to further purification using a C8 reverse-phase HPLC column. The twice purified peptides were subjected to sequencing analysis by automated Edman degradation. The results of a typical analysis are shown in Table I: peak 1 and peak 2 refer to the HPLC fractions eluted at 71 and 75 min, respectively. Surprisingly both nitrotyrosine-containing peptides had the same sequence, SPAGAWQYTAK, which represents residues 346–356 of M. tuberculosis KatG.Table IThe Edman sequence analysis of nitrated peptidesCyclePeak 1, residuePeak 2, residue1SerSer2ProPro3AlaAla4GlyGly5AlaAla6Trp?7GlnGln8TyrnitaTyrnit, nitrotyrosine.Tyrnit9ThrThr10AlaAla11LysLysa Tyrnit, nitrotyrosine.

The protein was present in cytoplasmic granules and punctate nuclear bodies. Isolation of the human cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that the gene was located on chromosome 8p21, a region implicated in numerous leukemias and solid tumors. Enforced expression of Hls5 in HeLa cells inhibited cell growth, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity.

Lineage-restricted structural/functional genes are gradually expressed as cells display the phenotype of mature cells. Although the process of lineage commitment was once considered irrevocable, data over the past decade indicate that the hemopoietic system may be more plastic than previously thought (4Graf T. Blood. 2002; 99: 3089-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Leukemic cells apparently committed to one lineage can be “reprogrammed” or undergo “lineage switching” and develop the appearance of another cell type (5Klinken S.P. Alexander W.S. Adams J.M.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 517-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The recent data with Pax5-/- mice are particularly noteworthy as committed B cells lacking the Pax5 gene could develop into macrophages, osteoclasts, dendritic cells, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and T cells upon appropriate stimulation (14Nutt S.L.

Indeed, by manipulating the levels of transcription factors, the plasticity of the hemopoietic system has been demonstrated, e.g. increasing the concentration of GATA-1 in myelomonocytic cells produced thrombocytes, eosinophils, and erythroblasts (6Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Gene Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1988; 8: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The human HLS5 gene mapped to chromosome 8p21, a locus involved in numerous leukemias and cancers (31Knuutila S. Aalto Y. Autio K. Bjorkqvist A.M. El-Rifai W. Hemmer S. Huhta T. Kettunen E. Kiuru-Kuhlefelt S. Larramendy M.L. Lushnikova T. Monni O. Pere H. Tapper J. Tarkkanen M. Varis A. Wasenius V.M. Wolf M. Zhu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Significantly, expression of exogenous Hls5 suppressed the tumorigenic phenotype of HeLa cells. Therefore, it is plausible that Hls5 is one of the tumor suppressor genes postulated to reside at 8p21. Cell Culture—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum, and cell viability was determined by eosin exclusion (22Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 412-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA and protein isolated from various tissues and cell lines were analyzed by Northern blotting and immunoblotting as described previously (23Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). cDNA RDA—The RDA used was based on the method of Hubank and Schatz (33Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and modified as described previously (23Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from J2E driver and J2E-m2 tester cell lines was converted to double-stranded DNA, digested with Sau3AI, and subjected to three cycles of subtraction. Fragments enriched by this procedure were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) for further analysis. cDNA and Genomic Library Screening—A cDNA library from the murine lymphohematopoietic progenitor cell line EML C.115 (34Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was screened for full-length Hls5 using the RDA fragment as a probe. To confirm that the 5′ end of the cDNA had been isolated, a rapid analysis of the cDNA ends (RACE) strategy was adopted using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A 129 SvJ murine genomic library in Lambda DASH™ II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened for clones containing the Hls5 gene. The complete genomic sequence was obtained from two independent clones. The human HLS5 cDNA was isolated from a human fetal liver cDNA library (Clontech BD Biosciences), and two independent clones were sequenced. Hls5 Constructs and Infection of HeLa Cells—A Myc epitope tag was introduced at the C terminus of Hls5 and HLS5 and then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pBabe-puromycin (35Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) to generate the pcDNA3-Hls5-Myc, pcDNA3-HLS5-Myc, and pBabe-Hls5-Myc, respectively. The PA317-packaging cell line (36Mann R. Mulligan R.C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) was transfected with linearized pBabe-Hls5-Myc, and viral supernatants were used to infect HeLa cells as described previously (32Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Individual clones were isolated, and unique viral integration sites were determined by Southern blotting. Myc-tagged Hls5 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies as described elsewhere (23Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-Hls5-Myc using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibodies (9E10) before application of Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After washing, coverslips were mounted in 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]-octane (DABCO, Fluka, New South Wales, Australia) containing 0.00005% Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem). Fluorescence was visualized on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 UV-laser scanning confocal microscope. Clonogenicity and Tumorigenicity Assays—For clonogenicity assays, a layer of 0.8% agar was placed in 6-cm dishes and then 104 HeLa cells were seeded in a 0.3% agar layer as described above (37Mu Z.M. Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Colonies were counted 3 weeks after initial plating. Tumorigenicity was determined by injecting 106 cells subcutaneously into 6–8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor volume was determined twice a week using calipers. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analyses—HeLa cells transfected with vector alone, pcDNA3-Hls5-Myc, or pcDNA3-HLS5-Myc using LipofectAMINE 2000 were cultured for 24–72 h and then stained with propidium iodide before analysis on a FACScanII instrument (BD Biosciences) as described in detail elsewhere (22Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 412-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Quignon F. De Bels F. Koken M. Feunteun J. Ameisen J.C. de The H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). TUNEL (transferase dUTP nick and label) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Transfected HeLa cells or those treated with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) were incubated overnight before Cdk1 immunoprecipitation (anti-Cdc2 p34; sc-54, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and assayed for kinase activity as we have described previously (32Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1. Phosphorylated protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and analyzed by phosphorimaging device. In Situ Hybridization and Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization on mouse embryos was performed as described previously (39Christiansen J.H. Dennis C.L. Wicking C.A. Monkley S.J. Wilkinson D.G. Wainwright B.J. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe was prepared by transcription of a 903-bp fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of Hls5. For fluorescent in situ hybridization, a 2.4-kb fragment of the human HLS5 gene was generated by PCR, labeled with biotin-14-dATP and hybridized to metaphase spreads from two normal males using a modification of the previously described technique (40Callen D.F. Baker E. Eyre H.J. Chernos J.E. Bell J.A. Sutherland G.R. Ann. Genet. 1990; 33: 219-221PubMed Google Scholar). Images of metaphase preparations were captured by a cooled CCD camera using the ChromoScan image collection and enhancement system (Applied Imaging International Ltd.). Isolation of Hls5, a Novel RBCC Family Member—In an attempt to identify genes that were activated when J2E cells became monocytoid, an RDA was conducted between the erythroid and myeloid cell types. Fig. 1A shows the representations from J2E and the myeloid variant J2E-m2. Following three rounds of PCR-based subtraction, eight clones were isolated, which were termed Hls1–8 (Fig. 1B). Hls1 and Hls6 represented previously characterized myeloid genes, whereas Hls7 is the murine homologue of MLF1 (23Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P.

Hls3, Hls4, and Hls8 were not studied further because they included a mitochondrial contaminant, a known signaling molecule and a concatamer. When originally isolated, Hls2 was a novel molecule. Full-length Hls2 was represented by a 1,716-bp cDNA and contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 433 amino acids (GenBank™ accession numbers AF009513 and AAC17945). However, overexpression and underexpression studies of Hls2 in a variety of hemopoietic cell lines failed to alter their phenotype. A yeast two-hybrid screen did not identify any binding partners for Hls2. This gene was subsequently shown to have 88% identity and 92% homology with the secreted protein, human plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (41Gingras R. Richard C. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11742-11750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and was not analyzed further. The 361-bp Hls5 fragment (GenBank™ accession number AF009514) was used to screen a murine cDNA library, and then RACE was employed to delineate the 5′ end of the cDNA. These approaches generated a 3,687-bp cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF145374) with a 501 amino acid open reading frame (Fig. 2A). The putative translation initiation site contained a consensus Kozak (42Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar, 43Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) sequence. Data base searches revealed that the predicted protein had significant homology with several members of the RBCC family of proteins (Fig. 2B). The highest similarity was found with the Rfp (30Takahashi M. Inaguma Y. Hiai H. Hirose F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 44Cao T. Borden K.L.

Invest. 1991; 87: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and Herf1 proteins (29Harada H. Harada Y. O'Brien D.P. Rice D.S. Naeve C.W. Downing J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3808-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, these molecules contained an SPRY/B30.2/NHL domain (46Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Hls5 also displayed structural similarities to Pml (27Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and Tif1-α (28Le Douarin B. You J. Nielsen A.L. Chambon P. Losson R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the exception that these molecules have two B-box domains and lack the SPRY region. KIAA1098 and TRIM35 represent Hls5-related expressed sequence tags (47Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 48Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). While this paper was in preparation, Kimura et al. (49Kimura F. Suzu S. Nakamura Y. Nakata Y. Yamada M. Kuwada N. Matsumura T. Yamashita T. Ikeda T. Sato K. Motoyoshi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25046-25054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of a cDNA induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor they named MAIR, which is identical to Hls5. Isolation of genomic clones revealed that the gene contained six exons and five introns ranging in size from 728 bp to 5.6 kb (Fig. 2C). Potential binding sites for numerous transcription factors were identified within the putative promoter region (Fig. 2D). Expression of Hls5 and Intracellular Localization—Northern blotting was used to determine the organs in which Hls5 was expressed. Fig. 3A shows that Hls5 mRNA, ∼4 kb in length, was detected in a wide variety of adult organs. Abundant mRNA was present in brain, heart, kidney, spleen, skeletal muscle, and thymus with lower levels found in stomach, large intestine, and bone marrow. Interestingly, Hls5 was not detectable in adult liver, whereas it was present in fetal liver. As Hls5 was isolated from an erythroid to myeloid lineage switch, the expression pattern of Hls5 was examined in a panel of hemopoietic cell lines (Fig. 3B). Although the levels varied considerably, Hls5 mRNA was present in most erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lines tested; however, the transcript was not detected in J2E cells or the pre-B cell line 1-Bra. The difference in Hls5 expression between J2E cells and other erythroleukemic lines (F4N, 707) could be attributed to immortalization of these cells at different stages of red cell maturation in which J2E cells displayed a more mature phenotype than the other erythroid lines (23Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of the Hls5 protein was 59 kDa; however, immunoblotting of transfected COS cells identified a 66-kDa protein (Fig. 3C). The endogenous protein could not be detected in a variety of cell lines, presumably because of low levels of expression. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were then employed to determine the intracellular location of Hls5 protein. As the antisera produced to Hls5 were unable to detect the subcellular localization of the endogenous protein, COS and HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a Myc-tagged Hls5 construct. Fig. 3D shows that Hls5 protein was detected in discrete cytoplasmic granules as well as punctate nuclear bodies. The cytoplasmic localization did not coincide with markers for Golgi, mitochondria, or lysosomes, and the nuclear spots were not PML bodies (data not shown). In cells expressing higher levels of Hls5, the protein also concentrated in the perinuclear region. Similar subcellular compartmentalization of Hls5 was observed in NIH3T3 and 293T cells (data not shown). Expression of Hls5 during Embryogenesis—To pursue the expression profile of Hls5 during embryogenesis, whole mount in situ hybridization analysis was performed over a range of embryonic stages. At 10.5 days post-coitum (dpc), Hls5 expression was detected in branchial arches 1 and 2 and the frontonasal process, limb buds, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 4). There was also evidence of relatively weak somite-associated staining. Hemi-sectioning of the embryo confirmed staining in the dorsal root ganglia and revealed that neural expression was predominantly in the dorsal half of the spinal cord, although weaker expression was also detected in the ventral region (data not shown). At 12.0 dpc, Hls5 was expressed primarily in the limbs and transiently in the developing eye. By 13.5 dpc, expression in the limb was restricted to the interdigital regions and expression was evident in the telencephalic region of forebrain. This analysis suggests that expression of Hls5 in the developing embryo is far more restricted than that seen in adult organs. Human HLS5 Localizes to Chromosome 8p21—A full-length human cDNA was isolated (GenBank™ accession number AF492463), and low levels of mRNA were detected in a number of human organs and tissues (Fig. 5A). A 2.4-kb human genomic fragment (GenBank™ accession number AF494189) was used for fluorescent in situ hybridization, which showed that the gene was located on chromosome 8p21.1 (Fig. 5B). An analysis of the DNA databases and chromosome maps showed that expressed sequence tag KIAA1098 (47Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which is identical to human HLS5, resided between markers D8S137GT and D8S131 (Fig. 5C). These data confirm that HLS5 is located at 8p21.1, a region that has been implicated in numerous leukemias and solid tumors, and is thought to contain at least one tumor suppressor gene (31Knuutila S. Aalto Y. Autio K. Bjorkqvist A.M. El-Rifai W. Hemmer S. Huhta T. Kettunen E. Kiuru-Kuhlefelt S. Larramendy M.L. Lushnikova T. Monni O. Pere H. Tapper J. Tarkkanen M. Varis A. Wasenius V.M. Wolf M.

Hls5 Suppresses HeLa Cell Growth and Tumorigenicity—As HLS5 resides within a tumor suppressor locus and is related to the known tumor suppressor gene Pml, which restricts cell growth (27Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 37Mu Z.M. Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the effects of ectopic Hls5 expression were investigated in HeLa cells. Using a retroviral vector, Hls5 protein expression was increased in several independent HeLa transfectants (Fig. 6A). Each clone expressing Hls5 grew slower (Fig. 6B) and generated fewer colonies in soft agar (Fig. 7, A and B). Significantly, the development of tumors in nude mice was reduced substantially in cells transfected with Hls5 (Fig. 7C). Together, these data indicate that Hls5 is capable of inhibiting the growth and tumorigenic phenotype of HeLa cells and is therefore a candidate tumor suppressor gene within the 8p21 locus.Fig. 7Hls5 suppresses HeLa clonogenicity and tumorigenicity.A, the clonogenicity of various HeLa cell transfectants was determined using soft agar.

Studies with tyrosyl group-modifying reagents support the involvement of tyrosine residues in Na+ binding by sodium-coupled transporters. Here we report two new patients with carnitine deficiency caused by mutations affecting tyrosyl residues (Y447C and Y449D) close to a residue (Glu-452) previously shown to affect sodium stimulation of carnitine transport. Kinetic analysis indicated that the Y449D substitution, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, increased the concentration of sodium required to half-maximally stimulate carnitine transport from 14.8 ± 1.8 to 34.9 ± 5.8 mm (p < 0.05), whereas Y447C completely abolished carnitine transport. Substitution of these tyrosine residues with phenylalanine restored normal carnitine transport in Y449F but resulted in markedly impaired carnitine transport by Y447F. This was associated with an increase in the concentration of sodium required to half-maximally stimulate carnitine transport to 57.8 ± 7.4 mm (p < 0.01 versus normal OCTN2). The Y447F and Y449D mutant transporters retained their ability to transport the organic cation tetraethylammonium indicating that their effect on carnitine transport was specific and likely associated with the impaired sodium stimulation of carnitine transport. By contrast, the Y447C natural mutation abolished the transport of organic cations in addition to carnitine. Confocal microscopy of OCTN2 transporters tagged with green fluorescent protein indicated that the Y447C mutant transporters failed to reach the plasma membrane, whereas Y447F, Y449D, and Y449F had normal membrane localization. These natural mutations identify tyrosine residues possibly involved in coupling the sodium electrochemical gradient to transmembrane solute transfer in the sodium-dependent co-transporter OCTN2.

Primary carnitine deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 212140) is a recessively inherited disorder of fatty acid oxidation due to defective carnitine transport (1Scaglia F. Longo N. Semin. Perinatol. 1999; 23: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Carnitine is essential for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation, and the lack of carnitine impairs the ability to use fat as fuel during periods of fasting or stress. This can result in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, Reye syndrome, and sudden infant death in younger children or in skeletal or cardiac myopathy with insidious onset later in life (1Scaglia F. Longo N. Semin. Perinatol. 1999; 23: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These clinical manifestations can be prevented by lifelong pharmacological carnitine treatment (1Scaglia F. Longo N.

The molecular bases of its multispecificity are not known, and there is no information on the domains involved in recognizing carnitine, organic cations, or sodium. The study of natural mutations in this transporter is uncovering domains potentially important for function. The P478L substitution identified in a patient with primary carnitine deficiency markedly impaired carnitine transport but retained normal transport of tetraethylammonium (TEA), 1The abbreviations used are: TEA, tetraethylammonium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein. a prototypic organic cation (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the transport of carnitine is sodium-dependent whereas that of organic cations is not, it was thought that this mutation could affect the sodium stimulation of carnitine transport (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of sodium stimulation of carnitine transport were comparable between the normal and the mutant transporter, negating this hypothesis (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar properties were observed with another natural mutation, S467C, located close to P478L (9Ohashi R. Tamai I. Inano A. Katsura M. Sai Y. Nezu J. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that transmembrane domain 11, which contains both substitutions, is involved in the recognition of the negative charge of the zwitterion carnitine, whereas the positive charge of organic cations is recognized by another portion of the transporter (9Ohashi R. Tamai I. Inano A. Katsura M. Sai Y. Nezu J. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The S467C mutation, as P478L, did not affect sensitivity of the residual carnitine transport to sodium, indicating that it was not involved in the sodium stimulation of carnitine transport (9Ohashi R. Tamai I. Inano A. Katsura M. Sai Y. Nezu J. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By contrast, the study of a mutation identified in a patient with cardiomyopathy (10Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has identified a domain located around glutamic acid 452 of OCTN2, which is important for transmembrane sodium/solute transfer (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this case, the mutant transporter retained a normal membrane localization and a normal affinity toward carnitine (10Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of the E452K mutant transporter toward carnitine was significantly decreased with an increase in KNa from 12 to 187 mm (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the Km toward carnitine changed similarly in the normal and E452K mutant transporters as the concentration of extracellular sodium was decreased, it was concluded that the E452K mutation was not located close to the carnitine binding site (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, the current modeling of the OCTN2 carnitine/organic cation transporter places the E452K mutation in an intracellular loop located between transmembrane domains 10 and 11 (2Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 3Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20378-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), an unlikely carnitine binding site. It is not known whether the E452K substitution also impairs the transport of organic cations (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on studies with tyrosyl group-specific reagents, it is believed that tyrosyl residues are potential sodium binding sites in sodium/substrate cotransporters (12Peerce B.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14105-14112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Peerce B.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6026-6031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kulanthaivel P.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of selected tyrosine residues in the OCTN2 transporter, however, failed to identify residues involved in sodium stimulation of carnitine transport (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) Substitution with phenylalanine of tyrosines 239, 251, 426, 479, 482, and 492, all located in predicted extracellular or transmembrane domains, had no effect on carnitine or organic cation transport (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Substitution of tyrosines 358 and 486 impaired both carnitine and organic cation transport, although the underlying mechanism was not defined (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, Y211F impaired carnitine but not organic cation transport. However, as in the case of P478L, there was no difference in the kinetics of sodium stimulation of carnitine transport in the Y211F mutant (8Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identified mutations in the tyrosine residues associated with defective carnitine transport in cells from patients with abnormal fatty acid oxidation. These tyrosine residues were located close to the E452K mutation previously found to affect the sodium stimulation of carnitine transport. Kinetic studies confirmed that these tyrosines affected sodium stimulation of carnitine transport. Patients—Patient AL-1 is a 5-year-old Saudi female with a normal birth history and development who presented at 22 months of age with bronchiolitis. A chest x-ray performed at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly. An echocardiography indicated left ventricular hypertrophy with poor contractility. A metabolic evaluation demonstrated low plasma carnitine levels. She was started on carnitine with good improvement of the ventricular function. The parents of this child are first cousins and have six other healthy children. Patient 8 presented with a fever at 3 months of age. He suffered a cardiac arrest during a lumbar puncture performed to exclude sepsis (see patient 8 in Ref. 16Vockley J. Rinaldo P. Bennett M.J. Matern D. Vladutiu G.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At autopsy, liver steatosis was identified in addition to lung colonization by Gram-positive bacteria. This patient was heterozygous for a carnitine transport defect and variations in other genes. Synergistic heterozygosity between genes encoding different enzymes/transporters in the carnitine cycle and fatty acid oxidation was proposed as the cause for defective fatty acid oxidation by his fibroblasts and for his clinical presentation (16Vockley J. Rinaldo P. Bennett M.J. Matern D. Vladutiu G.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). DNA Analysis—Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent from the parents of the patients was obtained for DNA studies. Genomic DNA was extracted either from fibroblasts or peripheral blood by standard methods and amplified using PCR and primers flanking each of the 10 exons of the SLC22A5 gene (4Wang Y. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Korman S.H. Ye J. Gargus J.J. Gutman A. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Genet.

A. 1999; 96: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by a Qiagen column, and sequenced directly without subcloning using an ABI automated DNA sequencer (4Wang Y. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Korman S.H. Ye J. Gargus J.J. Gutman A. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Genet.

A. 1999; 96: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing in both directions in two independent PCR products. The Y449D mutation abolished a RsaI restriction site, and restriction analysis was used to confirm heterozygosity for this mutation. Cell Culture and Carnitine Transport—Human fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of patients with carnitine deficiency after informed consent. Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. l-[3H]Methylcarnitine (81 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) transport in human fibroblasts was measured as previously described (10Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum. Carnitine and TEA transport were measured at 37 °C with the cluster tray method as described previously (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. Ye J. Ganapathy V. Longo N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (Costar) and depleted of intracellular amino acids by incubation for 90 min in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 5.5 mmd-glucose and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Carnitine (0.5 μm, 0.5 μCi/ml) or TEA (10 μm, 0.25 μCi/ml) was then added to the cells for 20 min. Nonsaturable carnitine and TEA transport was measured in the presence of 2 or 20 mm cold substrate, respectively. The transport reaction was stopped by rapidly washing the cells 4 times with ice-cold 0.1 m MgCl2. Intracellular carnitine and TEA were extracted from the cells with 0.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol and added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid for counting. Intracellular carnitine and TEA were normalized for the protein content of each well and intracellular water content and were expressed as nanomoles per ml of cell water (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Saturable carnitine and TEA transport was calculated by subtracting transport in the presence of excess cold substrate from total transport, and values are reported as means ± S.E. of 3-6 independent determinations. Initial experiments on CHO cells either transfected or not with OCTN2 indicated that carnitine (0.5 μm) accumulation was linear up to 30 min, whereas TEA (1 μm) accumulation was linear up to 90 min (not shown). Kinetic constants for carnitine (0.5-100 μm) transport were determined by nonlinear regression analysis according to a Michaelis-Menten equation (10Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonsaturable carnitine transport, measured in the presence of 2 mm carnitine, was subtracted from total transport to obtain saturable carnitine transport prior to nonlinear regression analysis (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Carnitine transport in the absence of sodium was measured substituting methylglucamine for sodium, so that the sum of methylglucamine and sodium remained constant at 150 mm (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nonlinear parameters are expressed in the text and figures as means ± S.D. In previous studies, we used multiple carnitine concentrations to define the Km of OCTN2 toward sodium (KNa) (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, we noted that the value obtained from the intercept of multiple regressions was identical to the value obtained at the lowest concentration of carnitine (0.5 μm, Refs. 10Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is because, in a random bireactant system such as the carnitine/sodium cotransporter, the apparent Km toward the cosubstrate (KNa) approaches the true Km (KNa) as the concentration of the substrate (carnitine) decreases to near zero (19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 274-345Google Scholar). Because our previous studies (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) indicated experimentally that a concentration of 0.5 μm carnitine provided values of apparent KNa indistinguishable from those calculated from the intersection of multiple curves, in this study we used an even lower concentration of carnitine (0.1 μm) to obtain an apparent KNa that closely approaches true KNa. As shown in the results below, the values obtained with this system are similar or identical to those previously published in these cells (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and other cells expressing the OCTN2 transporter (18Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). OCTN2 Expression Vectors—The vector containing the OCTN2 cDNA fused in-frame with the green fluorescent protein was described previously (11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This plasmid and the corresponding mutants were transfected into CHO cells by LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks, and a mass culture comprising several independent clones of transfected cells was isolated. Mutant OCTN2 cDNAs were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The final plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the absence of PCR artifacts. The plasmids obtained were then transfected into CHO cells as above. Expression of the recombinant plasmids was monitored by Northern blot analysis (4Wang Y. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA extracted from transfected cells was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to nylon, and hybridized in high stringency conditions to the full-length OCTN2 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (4Wang Y. Taroni F. Garavaglia B. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Meadows T.A. Longo N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Bands were then visualized by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands was quantified by the program NIH Image and the subtraction of lane-specific background. OCTN2 mRNA was then normalized to the intensity of the 28 S RNA visible by ethidium bromide staining. Confocal Microscopy—Subcellular distribution of normal and mutant OCTN2 carnitine transporters conjugated with green fluorescent protein was analyzed with confocal microscopy (Olympus FVX laser scanning confocal IX70 microscope using a 60× 1.4NA PLANAPO oil objective). Cells were seeded on glass bottom (no. 0 cover glass) microwell dishes (P35G-0-14-C, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA), covered with medium, and evaluated in vivo. Images of the cells were obtained at 1 μm sections. Multiple cells were scanned, and the ones shown in the figures are representative of the fields observed. Contrast microscopy was used on the same cells to define cell borders and intracellular structures. The two images were then digitally superimposed using Adobe PhotoShop. Identification of Mutations in Patients with Carnitine Deficiency—To confirm a defect in the carnitine transporter, carnitine transport was measured in fibroblasts obtained from patients AL-1 and 8 (Fig. 1A). Carnitine transport was negligible in fibroblasts from patient AL-1 confirming a diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency. By contrast, carnitine transport was reduced to about 50% of normal in fibroblasts from patient 8 and in the range measured in fibroblasts from known heterozygotes for primary carnitine deficiency, consistent with heterozygosity for a mutation in the carnitine transporter gene (SLC22A5). To identify the causative mutations, the 10 exons of the SLC22A5 gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Two significant variations were identified in DNA from the patients. Patient AL-1 was homozygous (and both parents were heterozygous, not shown) for a single bp change converting the codon for tyrosine 447 (TAC) to cysteine (TGC, Y447C) (Fig. 1B). Patient 8 was heterozygous for a single bp change converting the codon for tyrosine 449 (TAC) to aspartate (GAC, Y449D) (Fig. 1C). This mutation removed a RsaI restriction site from exon 8 (Fig. 1C). PCR amplification of exon 8 and digestion with RsaI confirmed that this patient was heterozygous for the Y449D mutation and had both the normal 151- and 112-bp DNA fragments and the undigested 263-bp DNA fragments (Fig. 1D). Expression of Mutant Transporters in CHO Cells—To confirm the causative role of the mutations identified, the Y447C and Y449D mutations were created in the OCTN2 cDNA and stably expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 2A). Carnitine transport was completely abolished by the Y447C substitution and was reduced to about 10% of the normal OCTN2 in cells expressing the Y449D, confirming a causative role of these mutations in reducing carnitine transport in the fibroblasts of the patients. To verify the expression of normal and mutant plasmids in CHO cells, the levels of OCTN2 mRNA were measured by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). All transfected cells had a visible band size of about 3500 nucleotides corresponding to the OCTN2 mRNA. Y447C and Y449D had OCTN2 mRNA levels that were reduced compared with the cells expressing the wild type OCTN2 plasmid. After normalization for OCTN2 mRNA levels, carnitine transport remained absent in cells expressing Y447C-OCTN2 and was reduced to about 18% of wild type OCTN2 in cells expressing Y449D-OCTN2. Role of Tyrosines 447, 449, and 454 of OCTN2 in Carnitine Transport—Based on the current model of the carnitine transporter OCTN2 (2Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), both tyrosine 447 and 449 that mutated in our patients were located in an intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 10 and 11 (Fig. 4). These substitutions were in the same domain containing the E452K mutation previously identified in another patient with primary carnitine deficiency and shown to impair coupling of the sodium electrochemical gradient to carnitine transfer (10Wang Y.

After two decades of extensive studies, significant progresses have been achieved in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating various actions of these regulatory proteins. Particular attention has been paid to two of them, Tat and Rev. The first potently activates transcription of the integrated provirus by establishing contacts with both transcription factors and the transactivation-responsive element motif located at the 5′ end of the viral RNA (for reviews see Refs. 1Jeang K.T.

It has also been shown that Tat is able to interact simultaneously with transactivation-responsive element and the CDK9/cyclin T complex (10Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H.

Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Besides its transcriptional activation power, Tat exhibits other properties that are likely to intervene in the onset of the immunodeficiency resulting from HIV-1 infection (17Chen D. Wang M. Zhou S. Zhou Q. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6801-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Izmailova E. Bertley F.M. Huang Q. Makori N. Miller C.J. Young R.A. Aldovini A. Nat.

Virol. 2003; 77: 6700-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rev also has the dual ability to interact with RNA, the Rev response element motif present in intronic position in the 3′ part of the viral RNA in this case, as well as with cellular nuclear factors (for a review see Ref. 20Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This viral protein includes both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export sequence (NES) and, by shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, allows export and hence translation of unspliced or partially spliced viral RNAs (21Malim M.H. McCarn D.F. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4248-4254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Malim M.H. Cullen B.R.

Cell. 1995; 82: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Fritz C.C. Zapp M.L. Green M.R.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and recently, it has been shown that a kinesin-like protein binds to the NES of Rev and stimulates the activity of the protein (33Venkatesh L.K. Gettemeier T. Chinnadurai G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7236-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although several cofactors are likely to intervene in the RNA export process mediated by Rev, hCRM1 and Ran have been shown to be sufficient to induce translocation to the cytoplasm of incompletely spliced HIV mRNAs (34Yi R. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2036-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Yi R. Bogerd H.P. Wiegand H.L. Cullen B.R. RNA. 2002; 8: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By considering that both Tat and Rev are small proteins that act through protein-protein interactions, we reasoned that it should be feasible to inhibit their function, which is absolutely necessary to viral replication, with peptide ligands competitively interfering with the associations in which they are engaged. Because it has the interest of reporting the interaction in the intracellular environment, especially the nucleus, the two-hybrid approach (36Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) represented the method of choice for selection of such peptides from a library of random sequences (37Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An important problem with peptides is their intracellular penetration. To avoid utilization of complex gene therapy procedures, this property was added at the screening step through adjunction of a protein transduction domain (PTD), the Tat basic domain in this case. In this report, we present data showing that this method led to identification of short peptide sequences that bind to Tat or Rev. Association of these peptide motifs with SUMO-1 for their stabilization led to small proteins named SUMO-1 heptapeptide protein transduction domain (SHP) that efficiently penetrate within lymphocytes and inhibit, for some of them, the function of Rev. These proteins, which were also observed to inhibit viral replication, in both lymphocytes and macrophages might represent new therapeutic agents useful for impairing generation of new viral particles. Construction of the Library of Peptides of Random Sequence—As a first step, the sequence coding for the Tat PTD was inserted in plasmid pGAD424 (Clontech). The phosphorylated sense, 5′-AATTGGGTGGTGGCGGATCCGGTTTGCCCGGGAGAAAGAAGCGTAGACAAAGAAGACGTGGTTA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCTTAACCACGTCTTCTTTGTCTACGCTTCTTTCTCCCGGGCAAACCGGATCCGCCACCACCC-3′, oligonucleotides were hybridized and inserted between the EcoRI and BglII restriction sites of pGAD424, giving plasmid pGAD-CR. DNA fragments coding for heptapeptide motifs of random sequence were generated as follows. The 5′-biotinylated sense, 5′-ACTCGGATCCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCGGGGTCGCAGTG-3′ (N representing any of the four nucleotides A, G, C, or T), and antisense, 5′-CACTGCGACCCCGG-3′, oligonucleotides were hybridized, and the 3′-recessed end was filled-in using the Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The DNA fragments were digested by BamHI and XmaI restriction enzymes, and the digestion products were incubated with streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Promega) to remove the biotinylated ends. The unbound fragments were inserted between the BamHI and XmaI restriction sites of plasmid pGAD-CR, giving plasmids pGAD-CR-Ps. The ligation products were transformed in the E. coli strain XL1-blue and streaked on LB agar plates containing ampicillin. 2 × 106 independent colonies were recovered and grown for 1 h in LB medium containing ampicillin. Plasmids were extracted and purified according standard PEG procedure. Two-hybrid Screening—Plasmid pLex-Tat was constructed as follows. The pSG-Tat mammalian expression vector (5Veschambre P. Simard P. Jalinot P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was digested by the NcoI restriction enzyme, and the 3′-recessed ends were filled-in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The vector was further digested by BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragment corresponding to the Tat coding sequence was inserted between the SmaI and BamHI restriction sites of plasmid pLex9 (32Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For Rev, the pLex-Rev and pLex-NES constructs were used as baits (32Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid screens with pLex-Tat, pLex-Rev, or pLexNES as bait and pGAD-CR-P as prey were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c strain, and colonies that grew on minimal medium lacking histidine were analyzed for β-galactosidase expression by the filter assay as described previously (38Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The pGAD-CR-P plasmid from positive colonies was recovered, and the heptapeptide motifs were characterized by DNA sequencing. Mammalian Expression Constructs—For two-hybrid assay in mammalian cells, the prey plasmids were constructed by inserting the sequence coding for the heptapeptide motif fused to the Tat PTD in the pSG-FNV mammalian expression vector, which includes sequences coding for the FLAG epitope as well as for a NLS and for the VP16 activation domain (39Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Amplification from pGAD-CR-P constructs was performed using the sense, 5′-TGAAGGTCGACCACCAAACCCAAAAAAAGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCTGAGAAAGCAACCTGACC-3′, oligonucleotides, and the amplified fragment was digested with the SalI and BglII restriction enzymes. The digestion product was inserted between the XhoI and BglII restriction sites of pSG-FNV, giving plasmid pSG-FNV-P. Vectors expressing the LexA-Rev and LexA-Tat fusion proteins were pSG5-LexA-Rev (32Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and pSG5-LexA-Tat, respectively. This latter construct was generated by inserting the NcoI (filled-in)-BamHI restriction fragment of pSG-Tat between the SmaI and BamHI restriction sites of pSG5-LexA (32Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing the SHP proteins were generated in two steps. The human SUMO-1 sequence was amplified from an expressed sequence tag using the following sense and antisense primers, 5′-GGGTCGACGTCCATATGTCTGACCAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-ATCAGATCTGAATCTCGAGCCGTTTGTTCCTGATAAAC-3′, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment was cut by SalI and BglII restriction enzymes and inserted between the XhoI and BglII restriction sites of pTL1, which is a pSG5 derivative, giving plasmid pTL1-SUMO-CP. The heptapeptide-PTD modules were amplified from pGAD-CR-P as described above and after digestion with SalI and BglII restriction enzymes inserted between the XhoI and BglII restriction sites of pTL1-SUMO-CP, giving vectors pTL1-SHP. Cell Culture and Transfection—All of the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. HeLa and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. For mammalian two-hybrid assay, transfections were done in 6-well plate seeded with 80,000 HeLa cells. The DNA mixture included 125 ng of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter construct, 25 ng of vectors expressing Tat or Rev fused to LexA along with the amount determined as optimum for the prey-expressing plasmids, i.e. 250 ng for motifs selected against Tat and 25 ng for motifs selected against Rev with the exception of clones 142 and 190 (50 ng). SEAP activity was measured using the SEAP reporter gene assay chemiluminescent kit (Roche Applied Science). Tat functional assay was performed by transfecting 300,000 HeLa cells in 60-mm Petri dish with the LTR HIV-CAT reporter construct (50 ng) (40Emerman M. Guyader M. Montagnier L. Baltimore D. Muesing M.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3755-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), pSG-Tat (2 ng), and SUMO-1 or SHPT expression vectors (0.5 and 2 μg). Rev functional assay was performed similarly by transfecting the pDM128 reporter plasmid (50 ng) (41Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Klein N.P. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6001-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSG-Rev (5 ng), and SUMO-1 or SHPR expression vectors (0.5 and 2 μg). CAT activity was measured using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocytes were isolated from the blood of healthy seronegative donors by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque (Eurobio) and adherence. Human PBMC were 3-day-activated with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P, Difco) and 5 IU/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (rHuIL-2, Roche Applied Science). PBMC then were dispensed into 96-well microplates (100,000 cells/well) in 200 μl of medium A (RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Bio West), and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 IU/ml rHuIL-2). Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were differentiated from monocytes for 7 days by adherence. At day 3, 300,000 cells were dispensed/well into 48-well plates in 1 ml of cell culture medium. Monocyte differentiation and MDM cultures were performed in cell culture medium A′ (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium Glutamax™ supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin mixture). Production in Bacteria and Purification of SHP—SHP sequences were cloned between the HindIII and BglII restriction sites in the bacterial expression vector pFLAG.MAC (IBI). Vectors were used to transform E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™-RP (Stratagene), which were cultured in 2 liters of LB medium up to an optical density of 0.9. After 30 min at 18 °C, 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures that were pursued overnight at 18 °C. Bacteria were sonicated in lysis buffer (200 mm NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2), which was completed with Complete antiprotease (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 20 units/ml Benzonase (Sigma). After centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml column of Heparin HyperD (Biosepra). Elution was done with DE 600 buffer (600 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The eluate was fractionated through a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing the SHP were pooled, and after dialysis against DE 50 buffer (same composition as DE 600 with the exception that KCl concentration was 50 mm), fractions were loaded on a 5-ml Mono Q HyperD (Biosepra) column. The flow-through was dialyzed against 0.1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), concentrated 10 times by lyophilization, and sterile-filtered. Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence—Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblots were carried out using the M2 monoclonal antibody directed against FLAG (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 and revealed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation with the SHPs, Jurkat cells were added to slides coated with polylysine (1 mg/ml solution added for 5 min). Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, incubated for 10 min in 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and then permeabilized for 5 min in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The antibody to FLAG was used at 1:500 dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) diluted at 1:1000 was further added to the cells for 1 h. Slides were mounted in medium containing Mowiol (Calbiochem) and observed with a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Virus and Antiviral Assays—PBMC were infected with the reference lymphotropic HIV-1-LAI strain (42Barre-Sinoussi F. Chermann J.C. Rey F. Nugeyre M.T. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Dauguet C. Axler-Blin C. Vezinet-Brun F. Rouzioux C. Rozenbaum W. Montagnier L. Science. 1983; 220: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar), and MDM was with the reference macrophage-tropic HIV-1/Ba-L strain (43Gartner S. Markovits P. Markovitz D.M. Kaplan M.H. Gallo R.C. Popovic M. Science. 1986; 233: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). These viruses were amplified in vitro with PHA-P-activated umbilical blood mononuclear cells. Cell-free supernatants were ultracentrifugated at 360,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate soluble factors such as cytokines, and pellets were resuspended in cell culture medium. Viral stocks were titrated using PHA-P-activated PBMC, and 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) were calculated using Kärber’s formula (44Kärber G. Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmak. 1931; 162: 956-959Crossref Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). PBMC were pretreated for 30 min by five concentrations of each molecule and infected with 75 TCID50 of the HIV-1-LAI strain. AZT (1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 nm) and indinavir (1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 nm) were used as control. SHPT-8, SHPR-15, SHPR-190, and SHPR-142 were tested at 31, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 nm. Molecules were maintained throughout the culture, and cell supernatants were collected at day 7 postinfection and stored at -20 °C to measure viral replication by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity dosage. MDM were pretreated for 30 min by five concentrations of various molecules and infected with 30,000 TCID50 of the HIV-1/Ba-L strain. AZT (0.8, 4, 20, 100, and 500 nm) and indinavir (0.8, 4, 20, 100, and 500 nm) were used as control. SHPT-8, SHPR-15, SHPR-190, and SHPR-142 were tested at 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 nm. Molecules were maintained until 7 days after infection, and cell supernatants were collected at days 7, 14, and 21 and stored at -20 °C to measure viral replication by RT activity dosage. Both PBMC and MDM were microscopically observed before supernatant harvest to assess possible drug-induced cytotoxicity. RT activity was measured in supernatants using the RetroSys RT kit (Innovagen). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were expressed as the mean of RT activity ± S.D. 50, 70, and 90% effective doses (ED50, ED70, and ED90) were calculated using percents of untreated controls and microcomputer software (Biosoft). Identification of Peptide Sequences Binding to Tat and Rev—A search for short peptide sequences, which bind the regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, was performed by two-hybrid screening in yeast. Baits consisted of the LexA sequence fused to the entire sequence of Tat, Rev, or the NES of Rev (Fig. 1A). The prey included three different parts: 1) the GAL4 activation domain; 2) a random sequence of seven amino acids; and the PTD of Tat (Fig. 1B). The random sequence was selected of restricted length to limit the occurrence of stop codons and the presence of unnecessary sequences. The various domains were separated by proline and glycine residues to allow some flexibility between the different functional parts. The library of prey expression vectors was constructed by the cloning of DNA fragments prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides including a series of 21 degenerate positions (see “Experimental Procedures”). This library was used in three different screens with Lex-Tat, Lex-Rev, or Lex-NES as baits (see Supplementary Table 1a). Prey vectors present in clones, which grew on histidine minus medium and which expressed β-galactosidase, were isolated and tested again. None of these vectors triggered β-galactosidase expression when LexA alone was used as bait (see Supplementary Table 1, b–d). Four vectors selected against Tat were found positive again (see Supplementary Table 1b). This was also the case for 3 and 19 vectors obtained after screening against Rev and NES, respectively (see Supplementary Table 1, c and d). The peptide motifs of these Tat- and Rev-positive clones along with those of three of the NES clones were analyzed further by the two-hybrid assay in mammalian cells. The heptapeptide-PTD modules were inserted in a mammalian expression vector downstream of a NLS linked to the Vp16 activation domain (Fig. 1C). When LexA, either alone or together with these prey proteins, was transiently expressed, no expression of SEAP under the control of LexA binding sites was observed (data not shown). Both Lex-Tat and Lex-Rev were by themselves able to trigger some expression of SEAP, but cotransfection of the prey vectors increased this production. This was the case for the peptides selected against Tat (Fig. 2A) with the Lex-Tat bait and for those issued from either the Rev or NES screens when Lex-Rev was used as bait (Fig. 2B). These results showed that the sequences selected in yeast also bind Tat and Rev proteins in the nucleus of human cells.Fig. 2Analysis of heptapeptide-Tat PTD modules selected against Tat and Rev by mammalian two-hybrid assay.A, HeLa cells were transfected with the pSEAP LEX5X reporter construct and pSG5-LexA-Tat, alone or with pSG-FNV-P-T8, pSG-T9, pSG-T10, or pSG-T24. The amount of SEAP was measured, and the mean of the values obtained for two independent point of transfection is represented. The error bar corresponds to half of the difference between the two values.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of the Tat and Rev Function—Considering the binding properties of the isolated peptide sequences, it was anticipated that they might antagonize the activity of Tat and Rev by impairing association with cellular effectors. To examine this point, functional assays were performed. As small peptides are often instable, they were fused to a stabilizing protein. Expected properties for this latter one were to be small, abundant, ubiquitously expressed, and of human origin. For these reasons, we selected members of the ubiquitin family. Constructs were made with both ubiquitin itself and SUMO-1 (45Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 46Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Because better results were obtained with it, SUMO-1 was chosen (data not shown). The entire coding sequence including a mutation of the carboxyl-terminal diglycine motif was inserted upstream of that coding for the heptapeptide-PTD module (Fig. 3A). As stated earlier, the resulting artificial proteins were named SUMO-1 heptapeptide protein transduction domain, abbreviated SHPT or SHPR for those binding Tat or Rev, respectively. The effect of the four different SHPTs on the transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter by Tat was evaluated by transient expression experimen"
https://openalex.org/W2111662398,"Detailed stopped-flow studies in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry data and x-ray crystallographic knowledge have revealed that the biphasic pre-equilibrium fluorescence changes reported for a single Ig-binding domain of protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus binding to kappa light chain are due to the binding of the kappa light chain at two separate sites on the protein L molecule. Elimination of binding site 2 through the mutation A66W has allowed the K(d) for kappa light chain binding at site 1 to be measured by stopped-flow fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques, giving values of 48.0 +/- 8.0 nM and 37.5 +/- 7.3 nM respectively. Conversely, a double mutation Y53F/L57H eliminates binding at site 1 and has allowed the K(d) for binding at site 2 to be determined. Stopped-flow fluorimetry suggests this to be 3.4 +/- 0.8 microM in good agreement with the value of 4.6 +/- 0.8 microM determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The mutation Y53F reduces the affinity of site 1 to approximately that of site 2."
https://openalex.org/W2012331146,"We have characterized the primary structure of a new sea urchin fibrillar collagen, the 5α chain, including nine repeats of the sea urchin fibrillar module in its N-propeptide. By Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, we have shown that 5α is co-localized in adult collagenous ligaments with the 2α fibrillar collagen chain and fibrosurfin, two other extracellular matrix proteins possessing sea urchin fibrillar modules. At the ultrastructural level, the 5α N-propeptide is detected at the surface of fibrils, suggesting the retention of this domain in mature collagen molecules. Biochemical characterization of pepsinized collagen molecules extracted from the test tissue (the endoskeleton) together with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis allowed us to determine that 5α is a quantitatively minor fibrillar collagen chain in comparison with the 1α and 2α chains. Moreover, 5α forms heterotrimeric molecules with two 1α chains. Hence, as in vertebrates, sea urchin collagen fibrils are made up of quantitatively major and minor fibrillar molecules undergoing distinct maturation of their N-propeptide regions and participating in the formation of heterotypic fibrils.

Hence, as in vertebrates, sea urchin collagen fibrils are made up of quantitatively major and minor fibrillar molecules undergoing distinct maturation of their N-propeptide regions and participating in the formation of heterotypic fibrils. Among the components of extracellular matrix, collagens are the most abundant of the glycoproteins. In vertebrates, 27 collagen types have been identified (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann.

All of them consist of three identical or different α chains that contain at least one collagenous or triple helical segment, consisting of repeating Gly-Xaa-Xaa triplets. The collagen domains of the three α chains coil around each other into a triple helical structure. The fibrillar collagens, including types I-III, V, and XI, are the best known, and their precursor α chains consist of a main triple helix made up of ∼338 Gly-Xaa-Xaa triplets flanked by two non-collagenous regions containing the N- and the C-propeptides. During maturation of procollagens into collagen molecules, the two propeptide domains are generally removed by the action of specific proteinases (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The resulting collagen molecules participate in the formation of supramolecular structures called fibrils. The invertebrate fibrillar α chains so far described present the same overall structure as that of their vertebrate counterparts (5Exposito J.Y. Cluzel C. Garrone R. Lethias C. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In different sea urchin species, studies have indicated the presence of two fibrillar α chains (1α and 2α) involved in the formation of heterotrimeric molecules [(1α)2-2α] (6Trotter J.A. Koob T.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 107: 125-134Google Scholar, 7Omura Y. Urano N. Kimura S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115: 63-68Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Cluzel C. Lethias C. Garrone R.

The complete primary structure of these two fibrillar collagen chains has been characterized in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (10Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J.

The 2α chain presents a large N-propeptide region including 12 repeats of an 140–145 amino acid module that we have named SURF 1The abbreviations used are: SURF, sea urchin fibrillar; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. for sea urchin fibrillar module (14Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deleage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). During sea urchin embryogenesis, collagen fibrils show a uniform diameter of 25 nm and present at their surface periodically distributed extensions corresponding to the 2α N-propeptide (16Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In adults, the collagen fibrils are thicker and have been found in various tissues such as the sutural ligament of the test, the spine ligament, the peristomial membrane that bridges the Aristotle’s lantern or Echinoid jaw to the test, jaw, and tube feet (17Burke R.D. Bouland C. Sanderson A.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 94: 41-44Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Shimizu K. Amemiya S. Yoshizato K. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some of these tissues have been defined as mutable collagenous tissues that exhibit a property specific to echinoderms (20Wilkie I.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 159-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, mutable collagenous tissues have the ability to modulate their tensile properties in a time scale of seconds under nervous control without the requirement of muscle cells. In sea urchin, we have previously characterized an interfibrillar component of the spine collagenous ligament, fibrosurfin (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This extracellular matrix protein consists of a series of epidermal growth factor-like and SURF modules. It is worth noting that the two sea urchin proteins that include SURF modules (2α and fibrosurfin) are almost exclusively distributed in adult collagenous ligaments. Moreover, we have also partially characterized in the sea urchin S. purpuratus a genomic region that could potentially encode an N-propeptide domain evolutionarily related to the 2α N-propeptide (14Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deleage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The putative protein encoded by this genomic region includes nine repeats of the SURF module and has been given the name 5α. In this report, we present data concerning the P. lividus 5α chain. This fibrillar α chain presents the same expression pattern as both the 2α chain and fibrosurfin in adult tissues. From its structure, its maturation, and its involvement in the formation of heterotypic fibrils, this new fibrillar α chain might be of importance in the unique properties of mutable collagenous tissues. Embryo Culture and Nucleic Acid Purification—P. lividus were purchased from the Arago laboratory (Banyuls-sur-mer, France). Gamete collection, fertilization, and embryo culture were done according to standard protocols (21Leahy P.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA from embryonic and adult tissues was purified as described previously (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). cDNA Synthesis and PCR—For all of the RT-PCR experiments, 500 ng of test RNA were reverse-transcribed using random primers and the reverse Expand kit (Roche Applied Science) used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For RACE experiments, the 5′- and 3′-RACE kit from Invitrogen were used. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I and were synthesized by Isoprim (Toulouse, France). For PCR, 35 amplification cycles of target single-stranded cDNA were usually carried out using the Taq Expand polymerase kit (Roche Applied Science). PCR conditions, purification, cloning, and sequencing of PCR fragments were carried out as described previously (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol.

The 5′ primer (5′-ATAGATCTAGTGCTGTTGCCACCGATGTTG-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-TATCTGCAGACCTCTACACTTCTGCTC-3′) contained a BglII and a PstI site, respectively. The DNA insert was cloned between the BamHI and PstI sites of a derivative of pT7/7 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In this overproducing plasmid, six His codons had been included between the PstI and HindIII sites with a stop codon following the last His codon (22Cortay J.C. Negre D. Scarabel M. Ramseier T.M. Vartak N.B. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14885-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Production in the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain and purification of the recombinant module R8 were carried out as described previously (16Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody production, titration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and characterization by immunoblotting were done using established protocols (23Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Garrone R. van der Rest M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 92-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Generally, SURF modules shared a 20–30% identity, but each SURF module of the 5α chain had its 2α counterpart. Hence, the R8 module of the 5α chain presented 69% identity with the R8 motif of the 2α chain. The specificities of the 41 monoclonal antibodies made against the 5α chain were tested, and only 7 of them cross-reacted with the 2α chain SURF module R8, whereas none of them cross-reacted with SURF module 8 of fibrosurfin. Among the 34 monoclonal antibodies that did not cross-react with the 2α chain, the one designated number 27-7F10 was chosen for use in the experiments described here. Protein Detection—Different tissues from adult P. lividus (test, spine, Aristotle’s lantern, peristomial membrane, and tube feet) and embryos at different stages were crushed and extracted overnight with 8 m urea at 4 °C together with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Supernatants were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, St-Quentin en Yvelines, France) overnight at 4 °Cin10mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 5% methanol. Blots were incubated with 27-7F10 antibody (0.4 μg/ml, anti-SURF module R8, 5α chain) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) secondary antibody and developed using the substrate kit from Bio-Rad. Isolation of Pepsin-solubilized Fibrillar Collagen—To obtain fibrillar collagen molecules, we used the method described by Omura et al. (7Omura Y. Urano N. Kimura S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115: 63-68Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. All of the preparations were done at 4 °C. Test tissue overlaid by epithelia was crushed (40 g wet weight) and partially demineralized overnight in 0.5 m EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The tissue was treated with disaggregating solution (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 0.2 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 3 days, centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and washed three times with distilled water. The disaggregated collagen molecules then were solubilized by limited pepsin digestion. The pellet was suspended in a pepsin solution with a collagen/pepsin ratio of 100/0.3 (wet weight) in 0.5 m acetic acid, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Pepsin was immediately inhibited by the addition of pepstatin A (1 μg/ml, Sigma). The viscous solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was submitted to sequential dialysis in acidic or neutral solvent with a high salt concentration to resolve all of the fibrillar collagen molecules present in the initial solution (24Miller E.J. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 41-81Google Scholar). First, the supernatant was dialyzed against 1.5 m NaCl in 0.5 m acetic acid for several days. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 h), the precipitate was suspended in 0.1 m acetic acid and frozen. The supernatant was submitted to a second dialysis with 4 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for several days. The small amount of precipitate was centrifuged and suspended in 0.1 m acetic acid and frozen. Bovine type I collagen was purchased from Colética (Lyon, France). Collagen samples were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by staining with Coomassie Blue or by Western blotting, the latter after electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 5% methanol. Blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody made against the N-telopeptide and the N terminus of the triple helix of the 2α chain (1/55 dilution, Ref. 16Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and then visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) secondary antibody developed using the substrate kit from Bio-Rad. The “1.5 m NaCl/acetic acid precipitate” was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad Protean isoelectric focusing cell. The precipitate, suspended in 0.1 m acetic acid, was dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and resuspended in the sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Bio-lyte ampholytes). The sample was applied to a ReadyStrip pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient strip by active loading and focused in the isoelectric focusing cell. Separation in the second dimension was carried out by loading the IPG strip onto a 6% SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF)—Spots of interest were excised from the polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were cleaved in-gel using trypsin. For MALDI-TOF sample preparation, dry tryptic peptide extracts were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The matrix was a 1 mg/100 μl solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (LaserBiolabs, Sophia-Antipolis, France) in CH3CN/H2O (50/50, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. We used the dried-droplet method for sample deposition. In this method, 1 μl of sample solution and 1 μl of matrix solution were mixed on the target and allowed to dry. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) in the 700–5,000 Da mass range using 300–400 shots of laser/spectrum. Delayed extraction source and reflector equipment permitted sufficient resolution to consider monoisotopic peptide masses of [M+H]+ ions. Internal calibration was done using trypsin autolysis fragments at m/z 842.5100 and 2211.1046 Da. Theoretical masses were predicted using the PeptideMass program at www.expasy.org/tools/peptide-mass.html (25Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and the 5α sequence and the available P. lividus sequences of the 1α and 2α chains (GenBank™ accession numbers M25282 and J05422). Furthermore, we took into account hydroxylation of proline residues in position Xaa. To validate the identity of the tryptic peptides, we used a stringent 0.001% maximum deviation between theoretical and experimental masses. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence analysis, tissues were prepared as described previously (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Spine bases were dissected, rinsed with artificial sea water (480 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 26 mm MgCl2, 29 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.0) and fixed for 4 h at 4 °C in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in artificial sea water. Tissues were demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA at 4 °C and then rinsed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin sections were cut on a Cryostat (Leitz) and immunolabeled with 27-7F10 and 11-4E11 (anti-SURF module R2, 2α chain, Ref. 16Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) antibodies (1 μg/ml) or without antibody for negative controls. Sections were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1/400, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and observed on a Zeiss AxioPlan microscope. For electron microscopy, tests were dissected from individual P. lividus, rinsed with artificial sea water, and fixed at room temperature for 12 h in 3% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.8). Samples were rinsed in the same buffer and post-fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide in PIPES buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4). After rapid washing in water, sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in London Resin White at 60 °C. Blocks were cut to the surface of the tissue and demineralized in 0.5 m EDTA for several days. After reembedding in London Resin White, ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut ultramicrotome and then immunolabeled with 27-7F10 and 11-4E11 monoclonal antibodies (1 μg/ml) and anti-N-telopeptide rabbit polyclonal serum antibody (1/100). Negative controls were carried out by omitting the primary antibody. The secondary antibodies used were a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 5-nm gold particles and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (1/30, British Biocell International, Cardiff, United Kingdom), respectively. Sections were contrasted with methanolic uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a CM120 Philips electron microscope at the “Centre Technique des Microstructures” (Université Claude-Bernard, Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France). Using a probe coding for SURF module R8 of the 2α chain, we had previously isolated from a P. lividus genomic DNA library 54 positive clones exhibiting variable labeling intensities. Hence, shotgun analysis of two weakly positive overlapping genomic clones coupled to RT-PCR and RACE approaches led us to characterize fibrosurfin, an extracellular matrix protein that contains 13 SURF modules (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using the same strategy, we analyzed two moderately positive overlapping genomic clones (Fig. 1A). Shotgun sequence analysis revealed that we had identified part of a gene that corresponded to the P. lividus ortholog of the S. purpuratus COLP5α gene (14Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deleage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, as for the 1α and the 2α chains, comparable domains of the 5α chain characterized in these two sea urchin species presented 86–95% identity (Fig. 1A). Using the available coding sequences, RT-PCR and 5′-RACE were carried out using RNA extracted from test tissue (Fig. 1B; RT-PCR fragments 5-1 to 5-5 and 5′-RACE clone). This permitted us to characterize the first 1,788 residues of the 5α chain. At this point, the sequence revealed that 5α probably represented a new sea urchin fibrillar collagen chain evolutionarily related to the 2α chain. The sequence included 1 putative signal peptide (residues 1–31), 1 large N-propeptide made up of a Tsp-2 module, 9 SURF modules and 1 minor interrupted triple helix, 1 N-telopeptide region, and 90 Gly-Xaa-Xaa triplets. Comparable domains of the 2α and the 5α chains presented an average of 69% identity (Fig. 1B). To determine the C-terminal sequence of the 5α chain, two properties of the 5α chain were used to generate a set of 3′ primers, i.e. the strong similarity between the 2α and 5α chains, and the presence of highly conserved stretches of amino acids in the C-propeptides of all known fibrillar α chains. This led to the synthesis of two RT-PCR products encoding the major triple helix and the N-terminal region of the C-propeptide (RT-PCR products 5-6 and 5-7 in Fig. 1B). This RT-PCR approach, coupled to a 3′-RACE, led us to complete the primary structure of the 5α chain, confirming that we had identified a new sea urchin fibrillar collagen chain (Fig. 1B). It is worth indicating that the N-telopeptide region represents the least conserved region between these two fibrillar collagen chains (Fig. 1C). To investigate the nature of the 5α chain, we first prepared monoclonal antibodies against a recombinant protein consisting of SURF module R8 of this chain. These antibodies were tested for their cross-reactivity (see “Experimental Procedures”) with the SURF module R8 of the 2α chain because these comparable domains presented 69% identity, whereas the identity with other SURF modules of 2α,5α, and fibrosurfin was <35%. The specificity of these antibodies was also confirmed by the absence of cross-reactivity with recombinant proteins built of SURF modules of 2α and fibrosurfin (data not shown). The presence of the 5α chain was analyzed by Western blot experiments during embryogenesis and in different adult tissues. Similar to fibrosurfin (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the 5α chain is not detectable during the embryogenesis (data not shown). In adults, immunoreactive bands for the 5α chain were detected in the test, peristomial membrane, Aristotle’s lantern, the base of the spine, and the tube feet (Fig. 2). The same positive adult tissue pattern has previously been defined for both 2α and fibrosurfin (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Two clusters of immunoreactive bands for the 5α chain were detected in these adult tissues. Cluster A included bands of molecular mass higher than 200 kDa, whereas cluster B comprised bands of 100–180 kDa (Fig. 2). The significance of the two clusters will be discussed later in the light of the next results. The identification of multiple bands in the cluster A and of the lowest apparent molecular mass bands in cluster B might result from proteolytic events during urea extraction from the mineralized tissues. A similar degradation pattern has previously been shown for proteins that include SURF modules, i.e. fibrosurfin and the 2α chain (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows immunostaining of the catch apparatus using monoclonal antibodies specific for the N-propeptide of both the 2α and 5α chains. These two α chains were co-localized to the spine collagenous ligament of the catch apparatus (Fig. 3, A and B) and were also present under the epithelium surrounding the muscle layer at the base of the spines (Fig. 3, D and E). A background of autofluorescence was detected within cells in these regions, resulting from a brown pigmentation (Fig. 3, C and F). Co-localization of these two α chains was also demonstrated in the peristome and in the sutural ligaments of the test (data not shown).Fig. 3Immunofluorescence analysis of 5α and 2α chain expression in spine ligament (A–C) and dermis (D–F) using anti-5α N-propeptide (SURF-R8) 27-7F10 antibody (A and D), anti-2α N-propeptide (SURF-R2) 11-4E11 antibody (B and E), or no antibody as control (C and F) is shown. cp, calcite plate of the spine base; sl, spine ligament; e, epidermis; d, subepidermal connective tissue; m, muscle.

Moreover, Edman degradation analysis of pepsinized fibrillar collagens extracted from test after SDS-PAGE separation reveals only sequences specific to the 1α and 2α chains (8Cluzel C. Lethias C. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To clarify the discrepancy between our immunological and biochemical studies, we first used immunoelectron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies specific for the N-propeptide of the 2α or 5α chain or polyclonal antibodies made against the N-telopeptide and the N terminus of the triple helix of the 2α chain. For 5α, 5-nm gold particles were detected on the surface of all of the collagen fibrils in sutural ligaments (Fig. 4, A–C), indicating that its N-propeptide was either unprocessed or closely associated with these fibrils. For the 2α chain (Fig. 4D), its N-propeptide was not present on the surface of those fibrils that contained the 2α chain as shown in Fig. 4, E and F, where 10-nm gold particles coupled to antibodies specific for the 2α N-telopeptide were used. This agrees with a previous study (19Cluzel C. Lethias C. Humbert F. Garrone R. Exposito J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18108-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicating the processing of the 2α N-propeptide in adult tissues and its localization at the periphery of the bundles made of collagenous fibrils aligned in parallel. The low number of gold particles in Fig."
