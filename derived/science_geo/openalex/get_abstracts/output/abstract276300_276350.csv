https://openalex.org/W1987098602,The inversion of Rayleigh wave dispersion data for the Pacific Ocean shows that lithospheric thickness increases systematically with age. The lid to the low-velocity channel is very thin or absent near the ridge crest; the low-velocity channel may be absent in the oldest parts of the ocean.
https://openalex.org/W2028083106,"Radioactive D- and L-alanine hydrochloride in 10(-5) molar dimethylformamide solution was adsorbed by d- and 1-quartz to the extent of 20 to 30 percent, as shown by radioactivity loss. d-Quartz preferentially adsorbs D-alanine and 1-quartz adsorbs L-alanine. The extent of asymmetric preferential adsorption is about 1.0 to 1.8 percent, at the 99.9 percent confidence level."
https://openalex.org/W1990639641,Formal and functional analyses of bone artifacts from a Clovis burial in southwestern Montana suggest that they were constructed to serve as (detachable or nondetachable) foreshafts for attaching fluted projectile points to lance shafts.
https://openalex.org/W2061391765,"Rayleigh wave phase velocities on paths crossing the Pacific Ocean show variations which are well correlated with some ""average"" lithospheric age of the region traversed. The seismic velocities in the upper mantle are highest in the oldest parts of the Pacific and lowest in the youngest parts."
https://openalex.org/W2031242665,Deep-sea drilling in the Southern Ocean south of Australia and New Zealand shows that the Circum-Antarctic Current developed about 30 million years ago in the middle to late Oligocene when final separation occurred between Antarctica and the continental South Tasman Rise. Australia had commenced drifting northward from Antarctica 20 million years before this.
https://openalex.org/W2084730279,"Sulfonamide-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus produce greater amounts of p-aminobenzoic acid than do their parent strains. This synthesis occurs both in the absence and in the presence of sulfonamides. The quantity of p-aminobenzoic acid synthesized by resistant strains appears sufficient to account for their resistance to sulfonamide drugs. On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that the development of ability to synthesize p-aminobenzoic acid in excess of the normal metabolic requirements, as a result of continued exposure to sulfonamides, explains the phenomenon of sulfonamide fastness in Staphylococcus aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2008457899,"Densities of 26 submergent macrophyte species were determined in situ regularly for 3 years by individuals using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba). Although most of these species grew only during the summer, ten maintained high population densities and productivity throughout the winter. Maximum winter photosynthetic activity was 10 to 20 percent of summer rates. Extensive productivity of submergent aquatic plants under winter ice cover has not been well documented."
https://openalex.org/W2009149692,"Behavioral differences between the sexes include methods of carrying books. Females clasp books against their chests; males carry them at their sides. In kindergarten and the first grade, both sexes carry like mature males. Sex-typical carrying appears before adolescence. Behavioral differences seem to be primarily a consequence of morphological differences and social modeling."

https://openalex.org/W2000260760,"The sciences and technologies of computers, automation, and electronics are comparatively new. They differ in many respects from older sciences. Major confrontations can be expected -- and are already occurring -- as the domain of these new sciences overlaps that of individuals."
