https://openalex.org/W2003044806,"Specific protein-protein interactions are involved in a large number of cellular processes and are mainly mediated by structurally and functionally defined domains. Here we report that the nuclear phosphoprotein p73 can engage in a physical association with the Yes-associated protein (YAP). This association occurs under physiological conditions as shown by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of complexes from lysates of P19 cells. The WW domain of YAP and the PPPPY motif of p73 are directly involved in the association. Furthermore, as required for ligands to group I WW domains, the terminal tyrosine (Y) of the PPPPYmotif of p73 was shown to be essential for the association with YAP. Unlike p73α, p73β, and p63α, which bind to YAP, the endogenous as well as exogenously expressed wild-type p53 (wt-p53) and the p73γ isoform do not interact with YAP. Indeed, we documented that YAP interacts only with those members of the p53 family that have a well conserved PPXY motif, a target sequence for WW domains. Overexpression of YAP causes an increase of p73α transcriptional activity. Differential interaction of YAP with members of the p53 family may provide a molecular explanation for their functional divergence in signaling.

Soussi T. Thomas G. von-Brevern M. Bartsch H. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1997; 143: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The wild type (WT)1 p53 protein is apparently latent under normal conditions but becomes activated in cells exposed to DNA damage as well as to other types of stress (2Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). As a consequence of such stimuli, the level of p53 protein increases suddenly and correlates a variety of antiproliferative effects, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation (3Levine A.J.

These biological effects are achieved mainly through the activation of a plethora of specific target genes. For instance, p21waf1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is mainly responsible for p53-induced G1 arrest (6Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Lees S.J. Tisty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elldge S.J. Reed S.

Furthermore, several apoptotic proteins including Bax, are involved in the p53-induced apoptosis (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional activity of p53 is crucial for p53-induced cell cycle arrest as well as programmed cell death. Two p53 homologues, p73 and p63, that share a remarkable homology in DNA sequence as well as in protein structure have recently been identified (11Oren M.

As expected for p53-like proteins, p73 and p63 are nuclear proteins that can bind to canonical p53 DNA binding sites and can activate transcription from p53-responsive promoters in transiently transfected cells. Furthermore, overproduction of p73 as well as p63 can induce apoptosis, growth arrest, and differentiation in p53+/+ and p53−/− tumor cells (10Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.

Viral oncoproteins such as large T antigen, E6, and E1Bp55, which are known as inactivators of p53, are unable to promote the inactivation of p73 (21Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A.

Similarly, Mdm2, a key regulator of p53 stability does not induce degradation of p73α, although it binds to it and interferes with its transcriptional activity (25Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A.

Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanisms underlying p73α stability are distinct from those known to regulate p53 stability. Recently, a growing number of proteins have been identified as p73 binding partners (30Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. von der EB A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol.

It was originally reported that human tumor-derived p53 mutants (m-p53) bind to p73 and markedly decrease its ability to transactivate target genes as well as to induce apoptosis (32Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It was subsequently reported that m-p53 can associate in vivo with all of the isoforms of p73 (33Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Brooks L.A. Irwin M.S. O'Nions J. Tidy J.A. James N. McGregor J.M. Harwood C.A.

Unlike UV irradiation, cisplatin as well as γ-radiation cause stabilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of p73 (35Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G.J. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

These post-translational modifications of p73 occur through the physical interaction with kinase-active c-Abl and result in the enhancement of the apoptotic activity of p73 (35Gong J.G. Costanzo A.

The proline-rich region of p73α and p73β mediates the association through the interaction with the SH3 domain of c-Abl (36Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y.

In an attempt to identify new proteins interacting with p73, we looked at the ability of various SH3 as well as WW domains to bind to p73α in pull-down assays. Although structurally distinct, SH3 and WW domains are functionally related due to their ability to bind to proline-rich ligands. WW domains are small protein modules composed of 38–40 amino acids and characterized by two conserved tryptophan residues that are 20 residues apart (38Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 39Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 40Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). WW domains can be grouped into four classes according to their ligand binding preference (39Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 40Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Class I includes WW domains binding to the core sequence PPXY (41Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 42Schild L. Lu Y.

Biol. 2000; 8: 634-638Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Class II WW domains prefer ligands containing a stretch of prolines interrupted by a leucine (45Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Class III includes WW domains interacting with proline-rich sequence that contains arginines or lysines (47Bedford M.T.

WW domains binding phosphoserine or phosphothreonine followed by a proline residue are grouped in class IV (50Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 51Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P.

YAP was originally identified as a protein binding to the SH3 domain of the Yes proto-oncogene product that belongs to the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases. The interaction between p73 and YAP occursin vitro as well as under physiological conditions in the cell. It involves the WW domain of YAP and the PPPPY proline-rich region of p73α and p73β. In contrast to p73α and p73β and p63α, p53 does not associate with YAP. The binding with YAP enhances transcriptional activity of p73α. Phage library construction was according to Santi et al. (53Santi E. Capone S. Mennuni C. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Luzzago A. Nicosia A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with minor modification. The p73α monkey gene was amplified from plasmid pCDNA3-HA p73α (15Jost C.A. Marin C.M. Kaelin W.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) using a primer annealing to region encoding the first 6 amino acids of the protein (ATCGCGGATCCATGGCCCAGTCCACCACCAC), and a second primer annealing to the region encoding the last 6 amino acids (GACCGGATATCTCAGTGGATCTCGGCCTCCG). The PCR product was electrophoresed on an agarose gel (1%) and purified using a NucleoSpin column (Clontech). To generate first-strand cDNA copies, 1 μg of this purified fragment was mixed with an SpeI-tagged random primer (ACGCGGACTAGTN6), 5 μl of dNTP (25 mm each) and 7 μl of Klenow buffer (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 70 μl, boiled for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. Afterward, 10 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs) were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. This mixture was purified through a Quiaquick column (Qiagen) and used to generate the second-strand cDNA with a NotI tagged random primer (TCGGCGGCCGCN6) in the same way as described above. The resulting double-stranded inserts were amplified usingSpeI (CTGCTGACGCGGACTAGT) and NotI primers (TGGATCTCGGCGGCCGC) in order to generate fragments in the three possible reading frames. Products were purified and digested withSpeI and NotI (Promega). The λ display 3 vector was digested by SpeI andNotI, purified, and concentrated by isopropanol precipitation. The ligation of the vector (2 μg) and the inserts (15 ng) was performed by adding 2000 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and incubating overnight at 16 °C. The ligation mixture wasin vitro packaged by using a λ packaging kit, Gigapack (Stratagene), and plated by infection of BB4 cells onto 10 plates (15-cm diameter). Phage elution was achieved with the standard method (54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.64-2.66Google Scholar). The complexity of the libraries calculated as total independent clones obtained after plating was 1 × 105 plaque-forming units (the average length of the insert was 150 base pairs). Affinity selection was performed using the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-YAP/WW bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Approximately 10 μg of protein bound to resin were mixed with 400 μl of the p73α phage library (1 × 1010 plaque-forming units) with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times with 1 ml of TBST and then once with 1 ml of λ buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. Selected phages were recovered by adding 200 μl of BB4 cells in 10 mmMgSO4 at A600 = 2 and incubating for 20 min at 37 °C. Infected cells were collected and plated onto one plate (15 cm). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, plaque-forming phage were collected with the standard method (54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.64-2.66Google Scholar). The phages that specifically bound to YAP/WW were evidenced with an immunoscreening assay performed as described by Zucconi et al. 2A. Zucconi, G. Cesareni, manuscript in preparation. λ plaques that were found to be positive in a plaque-screening assay were isolated and eluted into 50 μl of λ buffer, and 1 μl of the suspension was PCR-amplified for sequencing of the DNA insert. The H1299 cell line is derived from a human large cell lung carcinoma. H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Before transfection, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. H1299 cells stably overexpressing inducible WT p53 were produced as previously reported (34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Induction of WT p53 was achieved by the addition of ponasterone A (2.5 μm/ml). P19 mouse embryo-carcinoma cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) without ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides supplemented with 7.5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2.5% fetal calf serum. Overexpression of p73 was achieved by transfection of pcDNA3-HA-p73α (kindly provided by Dr. W. Kaelin) and pcDNA3-HA-p73γ (kindly provided by Dr. G Melino). pCDNA3-HA-p73α,Y99-F, pCDNA3-HA-p73α,Y121-F, pCDNA3-HA-3α, Y99/121-F, pcDNA3-HA-p73α,P338A, and pcDNA3-HA-p73α,Y487P were obtained by site-directed PCR mutagenesis followed by subcloning into pCDNA3-HA vector. Sequences of the oligonucleotides and primers are available on request. Overexpression of GFP-YAP and GFP was achieved by transfection of the plasmids pEGFP-YAP and pEGFP-C2. The parental vectors pCMVneo or pEGFP were used to keep the amount of the transfected DNA constant among samples. Transient transfections were done by the calcium phosphate method in the presence of BES (Sigma). The precipitates were left for 12 h, after which the medium was changed again to RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were harvested 36 h posttransfection. H1299 cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 10 μg of total DNA and harvested at 36 h after the transfection. Cells were lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors), and the extracts were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad) assay. After preclearing for 1 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 2 mg of whole-cell extract with 1.5 μg/sample of anti-p73 mAb (Ab4) (Neomarkers Inc.) with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (KPL). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of wash NET-gel buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The excess liquid was aspirated, and 40 μl of 5× sample buffer was added. Immunoprecipitates as well as 1% of each extract were resolved by SDS-9% PAGE. Protein gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius). For GFP-YAP detection, a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) was used at 1:5000 dilution; for p73 detection, an anti-p73 polyclonal serum was used at 1:3000. For Bax detection, a polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used at 1:500 dilution. P19 cells were lysed as previously described. Aliquots of cell extracts containing 5 mg of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-YAP affinity-purified polyclonal IgG (56Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar), with anti-p73 polyclonal serum, with anti-p53 mAb 421, or with a mixture of anti-p53 mAbs DO1 and 1801. For p73 detection, an anti-p73 polyclonal serum was used at 1:3000 dilution; for YAP detection, an anti-YAP polyclonal serum was used at 1:3000 dilution. Western blot analysis was performed with the aid of the enhanced chemiluminescence Supersignal West Pico Stable Peroxidase Solution (Pierce). GST fusion proteins containing lengths p73α, p73β, p63α, and p53 were obtained by PCR amplification of the appropriate fragment from monkey p73, mouse p63, and mouse p53 followed by cloning in the pGEX-2KT expression vector in frame with the GST moiety. The p73α mutant Y487F was obtained by site-directed PCR mutagenesis followed by cloning in the pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). YAP/WW was obtained by PCR amplification followed by cloning in the pGEX-2KT. Sequences of the oligonucleotides and primers used are available on request. Purification of the GST fusion proteins by glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) was performed following standard procedures (34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L.

H6-p73α was obtained by PCR amplification followed by cloning in the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). Purification and elution of H6-p73α protein were performed following standard procedures. Pull-down assays were performed using 20 μg of immobilized purified GST fusion proteins or wild-type GST that was incubated with 2.5 mg of total cellular proteins prepared from H1299 cells transiently transfected with the following plasmids encoding p73α-HA, p73α-HA (Y99F), p73α-HA (Y121F), p73α-HA (Y99F/Y121F), p73α-HA (P338A), p73γ-HA, GFP-YAP, or GFP. The lysates were first precleared with glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Following three consecutive washes with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), excess liquid was aspirated, and 40 μl of 5× sample buffer was added. Immunoprecipitates and 1% of each extract were resolved by SDS-9% PAGE. The immunoblots were probed with anti-p73, anti-GFP, or anti-YAP polyclonal serum. Detection was performed with the aid of the enhanced chemiluminescence Supersignal West Pico Stable Peroxidase Solution. (Pierce). H1299 cells transiently transfected with the indicated combination of plasmids were first incubated for 5 min at room temperature with a solution containing 10% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in 1× PBS (PAT solution) and then fixed in 3.75% PBS-paraformaldeyde plus 0.1% Triton-100 for 10 min on ice. After rehydration with PAT for 5 min, the cells were incubated in 50% PAT and then stained for 1 h with anti-p73 polyclonal serum used at 1:100 dilution. Staining with the secondary antibody and with Hoechst was performed as described before (57Blandino G. Levine A.J. Oren M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), followed by visualization under a fluorescence microscope. H1299 cells were transfected with reporter plasmid together with the indicated expression plasmid combinations. 36 h later, cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in cell lysis buffer (Promega), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (34Strano S.

Insoluble material was spun down, and luciferase activity was quantified using a commercially available kit (Promega) with the aid of a TD-20E luminometer (Turner). In a search for new p73-binding proteins, we checked whether various SH3 as well as WW domains associate with p73α in pull-down assays. To this end, H1299 cells were transiently transfected either with an empty vector (H1299) or with a vector encoding a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of p73α (H-p73α) (15Jost C.A. Marin C.M. Kaelin W.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein lysates were first precleared with glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with GST fusions of SH3 or WW domains (listed in TableI). The pulled down proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis on an SDS-9% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-p73 polyclonal serum (34Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, p73α was pulled down by human YAP WW domain (lanes 5 and 6) only when incubated with protein lysates of H-p73α cells. No p73α protein was pulled down when lysates of H1299 cells transfected with an empty vector were incubated with GST-YAP/WW or with GST alone (lanes 2 and3). 1% of unprocessed cell lysates derived from either H1299 or H-p73α cells were concomitantly run on the gel (lanes 1 and 4).Table IInteractions between SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins and p73α.Figure 1p73α associatesin vitro and in vivo with YAP.A, H1299 cells were transiently transfected either with a vector encoding p73α-HA or with an empty vector.

Here we report the biochemical characterization of AIF's redox activity. Natural AIF purified from mitochondria and recombinant AIF purified from bacteria (AIFΔ1–120) exhibit NADH oxidase activity, whereas superoxide anion (O2−) is formed. AIFΔ1–120 is a monomer of 57 kDa containing 1 mol of noncovalently bound FAD/mol of protein. ApoAIFΔ1–120, which lacks FAD, has no NADH oxidase activity. However, native AIFΔ1–120, apoAIFΔ1–120, and the reconstituted (FAD-containing) holoAIFΔ1–120 protein exhibit a similar apoptosis-inducing potential when microinjected into the cytoplasm of intact cells. Inhibition of the redox function, by external addition of superoxide dismutase or covalent derivatization of FAD with diphenyleneiodonium, failed to affect the apoptogenic function of AIFΔ1–120 assessed on purified nuclei in a cell-free system. Conversely, blockade of the apoptogenic function of AIFΔ1–120 with the thiol reagent para- chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid did not affect its NADH oxidase activity. Altogether, these data indicate that AIF has a marked oxidoreductase activity which can be dissociated from its apoptosis-inducing function.

In contrast to cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, AIF is a caspase-independent death effector, which translocates via the cytosol to the nucleus, where it causes chromatin condensation and large scale (50 kilobase pairs) DNA fragmentation (12Daugas E.

Neutralization of the AIF protein by microinjection of a specific antibody into the cytoplasm of intact cells has revealed AIF to be rate-limiting for apoptotic chromatin condensation and, in some cases, for mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (11Susin S.A.

Conversely, microinjection of AIF may cause full-blown apoptosis with nuclear condensation, dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochromec, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane leaflet (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

The protein is synthesized in cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where the mitochondrial localization sequence is cleaved off (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of AIF (last 485 amino acids) shares significant homology with oxidoreductases from other vertebrates (Xenopus laevis), non-vertebrate animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster), plants, fungi, eubacteria, and archaebacteria (16Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The mature AIF protein purifies as a flavoprotein, both from mitochondria and from Escherichia coli used to produce recombinant AIF (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). This fact prompted us to investigate the putative electron transfer (redox) function of AIF, in relation to its apoptogenic activity. Indeed, apoptosis is accompanied by a general shift of the redox balance characterized by a depletion of NADH, NADPH, glutathione, as well as by an increase of free radicals, including superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation products (such as 4-hydroxynonenal), and oxidative damage of membranes and DNA (17Kroemer G. Petit P.X. Zamzami N. Vayssière J.-L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In several paradigms of apoptosis, culture in anoxic conditions, treatments with cell-permeable antioxidants, or overexpression of anti-oxidant enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, the thioredoxin system) have profound inhibitory effects on cell death (18Zhang P.

It appears that the respiratory chain is a prime source for the generation of oxygen radicals (presumably derived from uncoupling and/or interruption of electron transfer due to the release of cytochrome c) (21Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitochondrial targeting of anti-oxidant enzymes is particularly efficient in blocking apoptosis in several models (19Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19241-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Coulter C.V. Kelos G.F. Lin T.K. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 15: 1547-1554Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we report the detailed biochemical characterization of the redox function of AIF, which turns out to be an FAD-containing oxidase capable of oxidizing NAD(P)H while generating superoxide anion. Interestingly, the electron transfer function of AIF can be dissociated from its apoptogenic activity, both in cell-free systems and in intact cells. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 mmHepes, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were used for the purification of nuclei- and cell-free system experiments, as described (23Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Larochette N. Dallaporta B. Marzo I. Brenner C. Hirsch T. Petit P.X.

AIF deletion mutant (Δ1–120) and AIF deletion mutant (Δ1–351) (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N.

The proteins were stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Molecular mass was measured by means of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization system from Applied Biosystems at the Services Cientifico-Técnicos, Barcelona University. Sinapinic acid was used as matrix, and bovine serum albumin was used as standard protein. For the experimental analysis, AIFΔ1–120 (1.8 mg/ml) was mixed with sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in H2O:CH3CN 1:1 + 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid), using a 1:6 ratio. Gel filtration on a Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was also used for molecular weight determination. The protein was eluted using 0.3 ml/min of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and 200 mm NaCl. Semiquantitative detection of metals was performed in an ELAN 6000 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and semiquantitative determination of calcium was performed in a multicanal Thermo Jarred Ash 61E Polyscan following standard protocols. Proteins were run in a Phast System from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, following the manufacturer's instructions. Free thiols' content of AIFΔ1–120 preparations was determined by using a 50-fold molar excess of Ellman's reagent, 5.5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate-(Nbs2) (DTNB) (24Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). The total thiol content was confirmed in the presence of 8 m urea and excess NaBH4 (25Cavallini D. Graziani M.T. Drupe S. Nature. 1966; 212: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). AIF was quantified spectrophotometrically on the basis of the extinction coefficient calculated in this work. Absorption spectrometry studies were carried out using a Kontron Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient of bound FAD at 450 nm was determined based on the absorption changes detected after releasing the bound FAD from the enzyme by heating (5 min at 90 °C) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. An extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm−1 cm−1at 450 nm was assumed for the free FAD (26Whitby L.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Reductive titrations were performed under anaerobic conditions at 25 °C. The anaerobic enzyme sample, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was prepared in an anaerobiosis cuvette by sequential air evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon. Anaerobic NAD(P)H was prepared identically, introduced by means of the titration syringe. Identical amounts of NAD(P)H were added to the reference cuvette. HPLC for identification and quantification of FAD was performed using a C18 Vydac column. A linear gradient 0–100% of 0.1m ammonium acetate, pH 6, and methanol in 40 min was performed using 1 ml/min flow rate. FMN, riboflavin, and FAD were used as standards. 1 mg of AIFΔ1–120 in 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, maintained in the dark, was heated for 10 min at 90 °C. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were injected into the HPLC, and flavins were detected at 445 nm. Phosphorylated residues were determined by dot-blot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Sigma) and an antimouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). The method used was based on the procedure previously described (27Ternynck T.H. Avrameas S. Tecnicas de Inmunologia: Tecnicas Inmunoenzimaticas. Grupo Editorial Iberoamericana, Mexico City, Mexico1989Google Scholar), using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P from Millipore). Visible redox titrations of AIF were performed under anaerobic conditions. Appropriated mediators that covered a potential range from +11 mV to −450 mV (1 mm) (28Bes M.T. Parisini E. Inda L.A. Saraiva L.R. Peleato M.L. Sheldrick G. Structure. 1999; 7: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were added to the protein solution (10 μm) in 50 mm Bis-Tris for pH 6.5 or 100 mm Tris-HCl for pH values 7.5 and 9. Injection of small volumes of air-free sodium dithionite allowed the reduction of the protein. A Crison 2002 digital potentiometer was used, and spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer. The reduction potential was determined by following the absorbance changes at 450 nm. Potential involvement of cysteinyl redox centers in electron transfers was tested at 25 °C, under anaerobic conditions, following the NADH-DTNB oxidoreductase assay described by Ohnisni et al.(29Ohnisni K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki K. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishimo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 18 μm AIFΔ1–120 in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7, containing 0.5 mm EDTA was mixed with 0.5 mm NADH, 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The reaction was started adding 0.4 mm DTNB, and the nitrothiobenzoate anion production was monitored at 412 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13.6 mm−1cm−1. Apoprotein preparation and holoprotein reconstitution AIFΔ1–120 apoprotein was prepared following the protocol described by Chapman and Reid (30Zanetti G. Cidaria D. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by exhaustive dialysis against 0.1 m Hepes, 2.5m CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m guanidine chloride, 17% glycerol (v/v) at pH 7.5, concentration on Centricon 30 K (Amicon) membranes, and a second round of dialysis against 50 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol at pH 7.9. The yield of this preparation was ∼15%. Reconstitution of the holoprotein was performed by incubation with 1000-fold molar excess of FAD, acetone precipitation, and repeated ultracentrifugation on Centricon 30 K membranes to remove non-bound FAD. Initial velocity studies of the NAD(P)H oxidase activity of the flavoprotein followed assay procedures described previously (31Ahmed S.A. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19856-19863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NAD(P)H oxidase activity was measured at 25 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml containing 0.25 mm NAD(P)H in air-saturated 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Steady-state kinetic data were obtained by varying NADH concentration.

This latter reaction was carried out coupled with NADH oxidase in a mixture containing 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, 2.34 mg/ml phenol, 1 mg/ml 4-aminoantipyrine, and 0.02 units of horseradish peroxidase in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The absorbance was measured at 505 nm, and the concentration of H2O2 was calculated from a calibration curve (36Green M.J. Hill A.O. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 15-16Google Scholar). DCPIP (85 μm) or ferricyanide (2 mm) reduction were assayed as described (37Sancho J. Peleato M.L. Gomez-Moreno C. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem.

The electron transfer between NADH-AIF-ferredoxin/adrenodoxin-cytochrome c was assayed as described (37Sancho J. Peleato M.L. Gomez-Moreno C. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem.

Supernatants obtained from mitochondria undergoing permeability transition were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred (100 V, 75 min at room temperature) to a nitrocellulose membrane. AIF immunoblot analysis was performed using a rabbit antiserum generated against a mixture of three peptides derived from the mouse AIF amino acids 151–200 (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

In situ detection of 2, 2′-Di-p-nitrophenyl-5–5′-diphenyl-3,3′ (3–3′-dimetoxy-4–4′difenilen) tetrazolium chloride (NBT) reduction on native-PAGE was done using the reaction mixture described by Pez-Huertas et al. (32Pez-Huertas E.L. Corpas F.J. Sandalio L.M. Del Roeo L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples obtained from mitochondria undergoing permeability transition were loaded onto a 10% native-PAGE. The gel was incubated 20 min in the dark with 2 mm NBT solution. Then, 1 mm NADH was added to reduce NBT and the reaction was stopped with water after the appearance of the blue band. Purified HeLa cell nuclei (103/μl) were exposed 90 min at 37 °C to AIFΔ1–120 preincubated (15 min at 37 °C) with or without NADH, NADPH, para-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, superoxide dismutase, or diphenyleneiodonium. For the standard assessment of chromatin condensation, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μm, 15 min, room temperature) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM IRB). DNA content was determined by staining with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) followed by analysis in a Vantage fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson). A minimum of 2500 events were scored. Rat-1 fibroblasts were microinjected using a computer-controlled microinjector (pressure 150 hPa; 3 s; Eppendorf) with buffer only, 7.5 μm AIFΔ1–120, apoAIFΔ1–120, FAD-reconstituted holoprotein, and AIFΔ1–351. After microinjection, cells were cultured at 37 °C for 180 min and stained with the ΔΨm-sensitive dye CMXRos (100 nm, 15 min) and the DNA-intercalating dye Hoechst 33342 (1.5 μm, 15 min) (11Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Microinjected viable cells (100/session, three independent sessions of injections) were identified by inclusion of 0.25% (w:v) FITC-dextran (green fluorescence) in the injectate. Only the blue and the red fluorescence were recorded. All chemical reagents used in this work were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant AIFΔ1–120 was found to elute as a single peak on a gel filtration column, with a calculated mass weight of 57 kDa, which corresponds to its theoretical molecular mass (57,046), indicating that, at near-physiological salt concentrations (200 mm NaCl), AIFΔ1–120 is a monomer. This result was confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis (data not shown). It is in contrast with its apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE (67.5 kDa, about 10 kDa more than expected), a migration behavior reported for other proteins such as ferredoxins (38Böhme H. Schrautemeier S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 981: 1-7Google Scholar). AIFΔ1–120 does not contain significant amounts of metals including Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Se2+, and Zn2+. However, it contains phosphogroups among serine and threonine residues, as revealed by immunoblotting (data not shown). AIFΔ1–120 has 3 cysteins in its sequence, and it was found to contain 3.2 accessible thiol groups per molecule, as determined by derivatization with the Ellman's reagent. Total thiol content was confirmed after unfolding in 8 m urea. This suggests that none of the three cysteines contained in the AIF amino acid sequence engages in disulfide links. The flavin moiety of AIFΔ1–120 is non-covalently bound and was identified by HPLC as FAD (data not shown). FAD is the only identified prosthetic group present in AIFΔ1–120, at a molar ratio of 1:1. The absorption spectrum of AIF (Fig. 1) shows the typical features of an oxidized FAD flavoprotein, with the visible maximum at 378 nm and 450 nm and a shoulder at 467 nm. The ratioA270 nm/A450 nm was 7 in pure preparations, and the extinction coefficient for oxidized AIF at 450 nm was calculated to be 12.12 mm−1cm−1. The addition of an equimolar amount of NADH to AIFΔ1–120 in anaerobic conditions leads to complete flavin reduction, without intermediate semiquinone formation (Fig. 2). Similar titration curves were obtained using NADPH as reductant, and in both cases the spectral changes are similar to the reduction of AIFΔ1–120 with dithionite (data not shown). The reduced form was stable over several hours, and admission of air to the sample did not lead to the immediate appearance of the oxidized AIF spectrum. Upon addition of an increasing molar excess of NADH or NADPH over AIFΔ1–120, the appearance of long wavelength absorbance bands was observed (Fig.3). These long wavelength absorbances of the reduced enzyme were stable at 25 °C for hours, even upon exposure to air. They exhibit the blue-green and green color described for other electron transfer complexes (31Ahmed S.A. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19856-19863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to other enzymes (31Ahmed S.A. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19856-19863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these long wavelength absorptions are likely to correspond to charge transfer complexes between the reduced FAD and tightly bound NAD+ or NADP+.Figure 3Anaerobic titration of AIF Δ1–120 with an excess of NAD(P)H. A, long wavelength absorbance changes observed in oxidized AIFΔ1–120 (22 μm) without (a) or after addition of NADH (b and c; molar excess NADH/AIF was 3:1 (b) and molar excess was 6:1 (c), with maxima at 637 nm and 774 nm, respectively).

Assuming a two-electron reduction step, midpoint redox potentials were determined to be −264 ± 15 mV at pH 6.5 (Fig. 4 A), −308 ± 15 mV at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4 B), and −373 ± 15 mV at pH 9.0 (Fig. 4 C). Neither semiquinone formation nor long wavelength absorbing bands were detected upon reduction by dithionite. A plot of AIF's redox potential (FAD/FADH2) versus pH has a slope of −44 mV (data not shown). This slope deviates from that expected for a two-electron reduction involving two protons (58 mV/pH unit) or one proton (29 mV/pH unit). The deviation from theoretical values indicates the possible presence of other dissociable groups whose pKa values are linked to the redox state of the enzyme. Even though titrations with dithionite and NAD(P)H showed an uptake of two electrons, it was considered important to discard the involvement of cysteinyl residues as active redox acceptors; in the NADH:DTNB oxidoreductase assay, no involvement of cysteinyl residues in redox transferences was detected (data not shown). AIFΔ1–120 was found to exhibit NADH and NADPH oxidase activities (Fig.5 A). NAD(P)H oxidation in presence of AIF was followed measuring initial rates of ΔA340 nm. The apparent Kmfor NADH was calculated as 99.4 ± 10 μm and the turnover number 2.09 min−1. When NADPH was used as electron donor, the apparent Km was 52.9 ± 12 μm and the turnover number 2.8 min−1 (Table I). These kinetic parameters are very similar to previous values described for other superoxide forming NADH oxidases (39Glass G.A. DeLisle D.M. DeTogni P. Gabig T.G. Magee B.H. Marker M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13247-13251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the steady-state kinetic data may be interpreted taking into account the possible formation of relatively stable charge-transfer complexes. Addition of exogenous FAD did not stimulate the NADH oxidase activity of AIFΔ1–120 (data not shown), in contrast to several NADH oxidases from bacteria (29Ohnisni K. Niimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M.

https://openalex.org/W2042561434,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors (R) are highly specific physiological mediators of apoptotic signaling. We observed earlier that a number of FasR-insensitive cell lines could redirect the proapoptotic signal to an anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 signal resulting in inhibition of caspase activation. Here we determine that similar mechanisms are operational in regulating the apoptotic signaling of other death receptors. Activation of the FasR, TNF-R1, and TRAIL-R, respectively, rapidly induced subsequent ERK1/2 activation, an event independent from caspase activity. Whereas inhibition of the death receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation was sufficient to sensitize the cells to apoptotic signaling from FasR and TRAIL-R, cells were still protected from apoptotic TNF-R1 signaling. The latter seemed to be due to the strong activation of the anti-apoptotic factor NF-κB, which remained inactive in FasR or TRAIL-R signaling. However, when the cells were sensitized with cycloheximide, which is sufficient to sensitize the cells also to apoptosis by TNF-R1 stimulation, we noticed that adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active MKK1 could rescue the cells from apoptosis induced by the respective receptors by preventing caspase-8 activation. Taken together, our results show that ERK1/2 has a dominant protecting effect over apoptotic signaling from the death receptors. This protection, which is independent of newly synthesized proteins, acts in all cases by suppressing activation of the caspase effector machinery."

In the same experimental conditions ox-LDL also induced O⨪2 generation (p < 0.001). In the presence of radical scavengers and anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody, O⨪2formation induced by ox-LDL was reduced (p < 0.001) with a contemporary rise in intracellular NO concentration (p < 0.001). ox-LDL did not significantly modify the ability of endothelial nitric oxide synthase to metabolizel-arginine to l-citrulline.

In particular functional alterations of the endothelial cells may be involved in the reduction of vasodilation, in response to stimuli that induce NO release, in isolated arteries exposed to ox-LDL (13Noll G. Luscher T.F. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74 Suppl. 1: S45-S54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, an endothelial receptor for ox-LDL, called lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was cloned from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Alba Y. Tnaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar).

In this context we recently reported that ox-LDL binding to LOX-1 determined a significant increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial cells (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol.

In this report we investigated the relationship between the intracellular production of ROS and in particular of O⨪2and the intracellular concentration of NO in cultures of BAECs exposed to ox-LDL. Whole blood, obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteers after 12 h of fasting, was collected into Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Meylan, France) containing EDTA (1 mg/ml) and processed for LDL separation within 1 day by sequential flotation in NaBr solution (16Havel R.J. Eder M.A. Bragdon J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) containing 1 mg/ml EDTA. Cu2+-modified LDL (1.7 mg of protein/ml) was prepared by exposure of LDL to 5 βm CuS04 for 18 h at 37 °C as described previously (17Cominacini L. Garbin U. Davoli A. Micciolo R. Bosello O.

Hermanson G.T. Mallia A. Gartner F.H. Provenzano A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 105: 293-299Google Scholar). Malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) was prepared according to a previously described method (20Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Intracellular ROS production was monitored by following the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate in flow cytometry as described by Royall (25Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem.

Intracellular O⨪2 generation was detected using a previously established flow cytometry technique based on the O⨪2-induced conversion of the oxidant-sensitive dye, hydroethidine (HE) to ethidium (27Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). BAECs were also tested for the production of H2O2 and superoxide radicals induced by ox-LDL. The amount of H2O2 released into the culture medium was determined fluorimetrically (28Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panhuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 15: 162-168Crossref Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) and, that of O⨪2 was determined photometrically by reduction of cytochrome c(29McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Confluent BAECs in 24-well plates were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 βm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), or 1 βm HE (Kodak) for 20 min. Increasing concentrations (50–150 βg of protein/ml) of ox-LDL, native LDL (n-LDL), acetyl-LDL (Ac-LDL), and MDA-LDL were then added to the medium for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mmarginine and 3 βm tetrahydrobiopterin (TB4). The incubation time was chosen on the basis of previous data showing that in these experimental conditions the ROS generation induced by ox-LDL increased rapidly in the first 5–6 min and then plateaued for longer ox-LDL incubations (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol.

Furthermore the short incubation time was chosen to avoid interferences derived from ox-LDL internalization. Samples were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin and analyzed with 7000 cells per sample by flow cytometry (Coulter Electronics GmBH, Germany). To test the response specificity, some radical scavengers such as vitamin C, trolox, and probucol (at a concentration of 5 βm; Sigma), anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Alba Y. Tnaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar), or comparable amounts of nonimmune mouse IgG (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Alba Y. Tnaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar) were incubated with BAECs, CHO-K1, and BLOX-1-CHO cells under the experimental conditions specified above. To determine which oxidative systems contribute to the release of O⨪2 after ox-LDL exposure, BAECs were also preincubated with different amounts of l-N-monomethyl arginine (l-NMMA; 200 βm),l-N-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 200 βm), allopurinol (500 βm), aspirin (100 βm), and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 5 βm) for 30 min at 37 °C in presence of 5 mm arginine and 3 βm TB4. In our conditions, after incubation with n-LDL, ox-LDL, Ac-LDL, and MDA-LDL cell viability was always greater than 95%. DAF-2 DA is a fluorescent indicator that enables the direct detection of NO under physiological conditions by flow cytometry (30Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Higuchi T. Tanaka J. Kudo Y. Nagano N. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 3345-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Confluent BAECs in 24-well plates were incubated in KRP (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.54 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 15.9 mmNa3PO3, pH 7.2) containing 10 βmDAF-2 DA for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with 100 nm bradykinin and 150 mm thrombin for 5 min in presence of 5 mm arginine and 3 βm TB4. To verify whether the fluorescent signal obtained after the addition of DAF-2 DA was dependent on the presence of NO, l- andd-NMMA (200 βm) were preincubated with BAECs for 30 min before the addition of DAF-2 DA and NO agonists. Samples were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin and analyzed with 7000 cells per sample in flow cytometry (Coulter Electronics GmBH, Germany). In the same experimental conditions we also evaluated NO production by measuring levels of nitrite in the cell media by Griess reaction as described previously (31Schneider N.R. Yeary N.A. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1973; 34: 133-135PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of ox-LDL on intracellular NO concentration, increasing amounts (50–150 βg of protein/ml) of ox-LDL, n-LDL, Ac-LDL, and MDA-LDL were incubated with BAECs for 0.5–15 min after the addition of DAF-2 DA and NO agonists, in the presence of 5 mm arginine and 3 βm TB4. To verify whether the effect of ox-LDL on intracellular NO concentrations was dependent on ROS production and to test the response specificity, vitamin C, anti-LOX-1 mAb (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Alba Y. Tnaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar), or comparable amounts of nonimmune mouse IgG (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Alba Y. Tnaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar) were also used under the experimental conditions specified above. The effect of ox-LDL on eNOS metabolism of3H arginine to 3H citrulline was determined as described previously (32Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Luthin D.R. Pollock J.S. Lynch K.R. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The assay was performed under apparent Vmax conditions (32Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Luthin D.R. Pollock J.S. Lynch K.R. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly BAECs lysates were suspended in cold lysis buffer (0.3 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 βg/ml leupeptin, 2 βg/ml aprotinin, 10 βg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 50 βm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and vortexed. Cell lysates (150 to 250 βg of protein) were combined with NADPH (2 mm), CaCl2 (230 βm), TB4 (3 βm), and 3H-arginine (0.2 βCi, 10 βm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The assay volume was kept constant at 100 βl. To determine whether ox-LDL altered inducible NOS activity, the assay was repeated with EDTA (1.7 mm) replacing calcium in the assay buffers. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and subsequently by post hoc analysis, using the SYSTAT program and statistical software manual (SYSTAT Inc., Evanston, IL) for Macintosh. In our experimental conditions the incubations of BAECs with 10 βm DAF-2 DA for 10 min at 37 °C followed by stimulation with bradykinin or thrombin for 5 min generated a sharp increase of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). This increase was dose-dependently suppressed by the NO synthase inhibitorl-NMMA whereas d-NMMA, the optical isomer ofl-NMMA, was inactive. Fig. 1shows the effect of 200 βml-NMMA andd-NMMA on basal and stimulated NO production in BAECs. Also the cumulative production of NO as evaluated by measuring levels of nitrite in the media was significantly increased after stimulation of BAECs with bradykinin or thrombin for 10 min at 37 °C (basal = 110 ± 7 pmol/well/h; after bradykinin = 370 ± 14 pmol/well/h, p < 0.001; after thrombin = 410 ± 12 pmol/well/h, p < 0.001). The exposure of 1.7 mg of protein/ml of n-LDL to 5 βmCu2+ for 18 at 37 °C resulted in a significant increase of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (11.9 ± 1.1 nmol/mg of LDL protein) compared with native LDL (0.24 ± 0.04 nmol/mg of LDL protein; p < 0.001). The incubation of BAECs with increasing amounts of ox-LDL for 5 min in the presence of DAF-2 DA, dose-dependently reduced basal and bradykinin- or thrombin-induced intracellular NO formation (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2) whereas n-LDL did not (data not shown). Similarly Ac-LDL and MDA-LDL, even at the highest concentration (200 βg of protein/ml), had no effect (data not shown). The preincubation of BAECs with 200 βg of ox-LDL protein also significantly reduced the basal and stimulated levels of nitrite (basal from 102 ± 6 pmol/well/h to 44 ± 4 pmol/well/h, p < 0.01; after bradykinin from 352 ± 15 pmol/well/h to 121 ± 12 pmol/well/h, p < 0.01; after thrombin from 401 ± 14 pmol/well/h to 184 ± 9 pmol/well/h, p < 0.01). From the evaluation of the time course of nonstimulated and stimulated BAECs, it is evident that the effect of ox-LDL on intracellular NO production was already present after less than 60 s of incubation (Figs.3, a–c).Figure 3Effect of ox-LDL on the time-course of NO concentration in basal (A) and stimulated (B and C) BAECs. BAECs were incubated for the indicated times with ox-LDL (100 βg of protein/ml) after the addition of DAF-2 DA and NO agonists. Results are expressed as MFI and are the means ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate on six separate occasions. *, p < 0.001versus time 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The incubation of BAECs with ox-LDL for 5 min also induced a sharp and dose-dependent increase in intracellular concentration of ROS and O⨪2 (data not shown). The intracellular concentration of ROS and O⨪2 were slightly but not significantly increased by incubation with bradykinin and thrombin. In our experimental conditions, ox-LDL also triggered a strong and dose-dependent production of H2O2after 5 min of incubation. With 50 βg of protein/ml of ox-LDL the mean value of H2O2 was 1.19 ± 0.3 nmol/106 cells. An almost identical response was seen for the production of extracellular O⨪2 as measured by cytochrome C with mean values of 5.9 ± 0.4 nmol/106 cells for 50 βg of protein/ml of ox-LDL. To test the specificity of ROS and O⨪2 increase induced by ox-LDL in BAECs, we preincubated the cells with different antioxidants, known to work as radical scavengers. As shown in Fig.4, trolox, probucol, and vitamin C significantly reduced the ox-LDL-induced ROS and O⨪2 production in BAECs (p < 0.001). Furthermore to verify whether the O⨪2 increase was dependent on ox-LDL binding to LOX-1 we preincubated BAECs, BLOX-1-CHO, and CHO-K1 cells with anti-LOX-1 mAb. For comparison the effect of vitamin C on ox-LDL-induced O⨪2generation was also considered. As shown in Fig.5, the O⨪2 concentration was markedly reduced in BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells preincubated with anti-LOX-1 mAb (p < 0.001), whereas control CHO-K1 cells were not affected.Figure 5Effect of vitamin C (Vit. C) and anti-LOX-1 mAb ( LOX-1 Ab) on ox-LDL-induced variations of O⨪2 in BAECs, BLOX-1-CHO, and CHO cells.Vitamin C (5 βm), anti-LOX-1 mAb (30 βg/ml), and comparable amounts of nonimmune mouse IgG were preincubated with BAECs, BLOX-1-CHO, and CHO cells for 30 min. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with ox-LDL (100 βg of protein/ml) after the addition of HE. Results are expressed as MFI and are the means ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate on six separate occasions. *,p < 0.001 versus ox-LDL alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the basis of the results described above, to test whether the reduction of intracellular NO concentration induced by ox-LDL was dependent on O⨪2 generation, we preincubated BAECs with vitamin C and anti-LOX-1 mAb. Fig. 6 shows that the preincubation of BAECs with vitamin C and anti-LOX-1 mAb significantly counteracted the effect of ox-LDL on basal and stimulated generation of NO (p < 0.001). The effect of ox-LDL on eNOS activity was examined by the3H citrulline assay. ox-LDL did not significantly modify the ability of eNOS to metabolize l-arginine tol-citrulline (native LDL = 64.6 ± 9.4 pmol citrulline/mg protein/min; ox-LDL = 58.7 ± 8.9 pmol citrulline/mg protein/min, p = not significant). In presence of EDTA, the activity of inducible NOS was almost undetectable. We also analyzed which oxidative systems may contribute to the release of O⨪2 after ox-LDL exposure (Fig.7). We found that allopurinol did not affect O⨪2 whereas aspirin slightly but insignificantly reduced O⨪2 generation in BAECs. In contrast, l-NAME andl-NMMA but not d-NAME and d-NMMA significantly increased whereas DPI drastically reduced O⨪2production in BAECs. Using a novel fluorescence indicator, DAF-2 DA, for direct detection of NO (30Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Higuchi T. Tanaka J. Kudo Y. Nagano N. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 3345-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), in this study we examined the relationship between the intracellular production of ROS and in particular of O⨪2 and the intracellular concentration of NO in culture of BAECs exposed to ox-LDL. In our experimental conditions the incubations of BAECs with 10 βm DAF-2 DA for 10 min at 37 °C generated an increase in fluorescence intensity both in basal and agonist-stimulated cells, which was dose-dependently suppressed by the NO synthase inhibitor l-NMMA. These results are consistent with several lines of evidences suggesting that NO is generated under basal conditions by endothelial cells (35Palmer R.M.J. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. Nature. 1988; 336: 664-666Crossref Scopus (4127) Google Scholar) and are in agreement with published results showing that 5-min exposure of BAECs to thrombin or bradykinin results in a sharp increase of NO (36Luscher T.F. Diederich D. Siebermann R. Lehmann K. Stulz P. Yang Z.H. Turina M. Gradel E. Weber E. Buhler F.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We found that ox-LDL, but not n-LDL or other forms of modified LDL, reduced in a dose-dependent fashion and very rapidly the intracellular NO concentration in basal and stimulated endothelial cells. Our results agree with a series of studies addressing the effects of ox-LDL on arterial rings (37Plane F. Kerr P. Bruckdorfer K.R. Jacobs M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1177-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Tanner F.C. Noll G. Boulanger C.M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and on cultured endothelial cells (39Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects have been seen to occur when vascular segments or cultured cells are placed in contact with LDL for long periods suggesting inhibition of NO synthesis by ox-LDL. Even if there is no agreement regarding interpretation of this phenomenon (38Tanner F.C. Noll G. Boulanger C.M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 39Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 66: 18-27Google Scholar), in our experimental conditions ox-LDL did not significantly alter the ability of eNOS to metabolize l-arginine tol-citrulline. Because the conversion of 3H arginine into 3H citrulline, under apparentVmax conditions (32Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Luthin D.R. Pollock J.S. Lynch K.R. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson J.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), is a measure of eNOS levels, the results of this study show that ox-LDL did not alter, at least quantitatively, the ability to produce NO. Interestingly and in agreement with very recent data published by our group (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12633-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), the results of this study also demonstrate that the rapid decrease in NO induced by ox-LDL was parallelled by a specular fast increase in ROS and O⨪2 formation. The increased cellular production of ROS and O⨪2 in particular was prevented by preincubating BAECs with different antioxidants known to work as radical scavengers. These data confirm that the incubation of ox-LDL with BAECs is associated with an increased intracellular production of ROS and O⨪2 (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12633-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Furthermore the fact that in this study the generation of ROS was prevented by anti-LOX-1 mAb and the fact that the formation of ROS was reported to persist for longer ox-LDL incubations (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12633-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), strongly support that the ox-LDL ligation to LOX-1 plays a role in intracellular ROS generation (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12633-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The decrease of intracellular NO concentration was prevented by preincubating BAECs with different antioxidants known to work as radical scavengers and with anti-LOX-1 mAb. The data support the conclusion that the incubation of ox-LDL with BAECs is associated with a receptor-dependent, abnormally increased intracellular production of ROS and in particular of O⨪2. NO decrease therefore may be secondary to O⨪2 formation, which is known to inactivate NO in a chemical reaction during which the cytotoxic radical peroxynitrite is formed (9Ignarro R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 10Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because in our experimental conditions the effect of ox-LDL on intracellular NO concentration was receptor-mediated and consequently very fast, the signal of NO reduction being clearly visible even after 30 s, it is unlikely that the effect on NO is secondary to its reaction with intracellularly internalized ox-LDL lipid peroxyl radicals. There are many enzymatic sources for ROS in almost all cell types (41Lander H.M FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and several findings have indicated an increase in ROS upon receptor ligation (42Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 43Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3033-3038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (381) Google Scholar). As for the potential sources of ROS induced by the binding of ox-LDL to LOX-1, we found that allopurinol and aspirin did not significantly affect O⨪2 generation in BAECs. Because the levels of allopurinol and aspirin used in this study have already been shown to completely block xantine oxidase activity (47Maclouf J. Sors H. Rigaud M. Biomedicine. 1977; 26: 362-375PubMed Google Scholar) and arachidonic acid metabolism by cycloxygenase (48Berry C. Hamilton C.A. Brosnan M.J. Magill F.G. Berg G.A. McMurray J.J. Dominikzac A.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2206-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the results of this study indicate that the generation of O⨪2 induced by the ligation of ox-LDL to LOX-1 is not related to the activity of these enzymes. Furthermore the fact that l-NAME andl-NMMA did not reduce O⨪2 generation by BAECs reasonably excludes that, in our experimental conditions, eNOS is involved in O⨪2 generation. Our results agree with the findings of Pou et al. (49Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who found that l-NMMA blocked neuronal brain NOS O⨪2 production only under uncoupling conditions. Because we worked in excess of l-arginine and TB4, our results are also consistent with the results of Vergnaniet al. (50Vergnani L. Hatrik S. Ricci F. Passaro A. Manzoli N. Zuliani G. Brovkovych V. Fellin R. Malinski T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1261-1266Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) who showed that l-arginine drastically reduced the ox-LDL-induced O⨪2 generation by endothelial cell under uncoupling conditions. Our findings thatl-NAME and l-NMMA increased and not decreased intracellular O⨪2 concentration further support the conclusion that in our study eNOS is not involved in ox-LDL-induced O⨪2generation. Even if this phenomenon is not completely clear, one hypothesis could be that in the presence of eNOS inhibitors, less O⨪2 is quenched by the reduced intracellular NO. Finally the results of this study clearly show that DPI drastically reduced O⨪2 generation in BAECs stimulated by ox-LDL. Of course, on the basis of this result we cannot draw any conclusive assumption on which oxidative system contributes to the release of O⨪2 after ox-LDL exposure. DPI, a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (51Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), also inhibits mitochondrial O⨪2 production by NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) (52Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and eNOS (53Salvemini D. Radziszewsky W. Mollace V. Moore A. Willoughty D. Vane J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 199: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, because in our experimental conditions it is unlikely that eNOS is involved in O⨪2 generation, another conclusion of this study is that the generation of O⨪2 after ox-LDL exposure may be related to the increased activity of NADPH oxidase and/or mitochondrial complex 1. The reduction in intracellular NO concentration as a result of O⨪2 generation may also have implications in vivo. In fact, it has been recognized for a long time that atherosclerotic blood vessels are very susceptible to the development of vasospasmin vivo (4Cooke J.P. Andon N.A. Girerd X.J. Hirsh A.T.

Circulation. 1984; 69: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and the current weight of evidence suggests that impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is the predominant mechanism underlying inappropriate constriction leading to ischemic manifestations (57Vita J.A. Treasure C.B. Nabel E.G. McLenachan A. Fish R.D. Yeung A.C. Vekstein V.I. Selwyn A.P. Ganz P. Circulation. 1990; 81: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 58Vanhoutte P.M. Shimokawa H.

Increased oxidative stress within the vascular wall facilitates oxidation of LDL (60Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The ROS produced by the ligation of ox-LDL to LOX-1 could facilitate the oxidation of native LDL or partially oxidized LDL, which in turn could up-regulate LOX-1 expression (61Kume N. Murase T. Moriwaki H. Aoyama T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Circ. Res. 1998; 81: 322-327Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and contribute to further O⨪2 generation, which could finally inactivate NO in a chemical reaction during which peroxynitrite is formed. The phenomenon could be amplified in pathological situations characterized by higher plasma concentration of LDL like hypercholesterolemia. Of course this conclusion is limited by the fact that in this study we measured only the rapid response of ROS and O⨪2 induced by ox-LDL. However, because ROS generation was reported to persist for longer ox-LDL incubations (15Cominacini L. Fratta Pasini A. Garbin U. Davoli A. Tosetti L. Campagnola M. Rigoni A. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12633-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we are tempted to speculate that this oxidative stress would continue to inactivate NO. In conclusion the results of this study show that one of the pathophysiological consequences of ox-LDL binding to LOX-1 may be the inactivation of NO through an increased cellular production of O⨪2."
https://openalex.org/W2159460252,"The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein-binding module that mediates the assembly of CARD-containing proteins into apoptosis and NF-κB signaling complexes. We report here that CARD protein 11 (CARD11) and CARD protein 14 (CARD14) are novel CARD-containing proteins that belong to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a class of proteins that functions as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. CARD11 and CARD14 have homologous structures consisting of an N-terminal CARD domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite domain comprised of a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 domain, and a GUK domain with homology to guanylate kinase. The CARD domains of both CARD11 and CARD14 associate specifically with the CARD domain of BCL10, a signaling protein that activates NF-κB through the IκB kinase complex in response to upstream stimuli. When expressed in cells, CARD11 and CARD14 activate NF-κB and induce the phosphorylation of BCL10. These findings suggest that CARD11 and CARD14 are novel MAGUK family members that function as upstream activators of BCL10 and NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2070881916,"Cognitive impairment is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease and is accompanied by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. Transgenic animal models that overexpress Aβ exhibit learning and memory impairments, but neuronal degeneration is not a consistent characteristic. We report that levels of Aβ-(1–42), which do not compromise the survival of cortical neurons, may indeed interfere with functions critical for neuronal plasticity. Pretreatment with Aβ-(1–42), at sublethal concentrations, resulted in a suppression of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, induced by exposure to either 30 mm KCl or 10 μm N-methyl-d-aspartate. The effects of Aβ-(1–42) seem to involve mechanisms unrelated to degenerative changes, since Aβ-(25–35), a toxic fragment of Aβ, at sublethal concentrations did not interfere with activity-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Furthermore, caspase inhibitors failed to counteract the Aβ-(1–42)-evoked suppression of CREB activation. Aβ-(1–42) also interfered with events downstream of activated CREB. The Aβ-(1–42) treatment suppressed the activation of the cAMP response element-containing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exon III promoter and the expression of BDNF exon IIII mRNA induced by neuronal depolarization. In view of the critical role of CREB and BDNF in neuronal plasticity, including learning and memory, the observations indicate a novel pathway through which Aβ may interfere with neuronal functions and contribute to cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease before the stage of massive neuronal degeneration.

Because of the protractive and progressive nature of the disease, Aβ may be present in the brain at sublethal concentrations for extended periods. Although at these levels Aβ does not compromise neuron survival, it may affect critical signal transduction processes that mediate plastic neuronal changes, including those involved in learning and memory. The transcription factor CREB, which regulates expression of cAMP response element (CRE)-containing genes, plays an essential role in learning and memory processes in a variety of species ranging from Drosophila to mammals (12Yin J.C.

Neuronal activity-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-133 of CREB has been well documented, and in cultured neurons, both NMDA receptor activation and membrane depolarization can lead to the activation of CREB (17Shieh P.B.

Disruption of CREB function specifically interferes with activity-dependent synaptic plasticity ranging from long term potentiation (LTP) to long term memory (13Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4239-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Abel T. Kandel E. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 360-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). It is expected, therefore, that mechanisms that interfere with CREB activation would compromise CREB activity-dependent neuronal function through disruption of downstream gene expression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the target genes of CREB (17Shieh P.B. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 18Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, enhances survival, differentiation, and growth of certain neuronal populations, modulates synaptic activity, and acts as an effector of neuronal plasticity both during development and in the adult (20Lu B. Chow A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Black I.B. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). BDNF participates in LTP, is up-regulated in the hippocampus during learning (22Kesslak J.P. So V. Choi J. Cotman C.W. Gomez-Pinilla F. Behav. Neurosci. 1998; 112: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and deficits in BDNF compromise LTP and learning and memory (20Lu B. Chow A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). BDNF mRNA and protein are reduced in the hippocampus in AD (23Phillips H.S. Hains J.M. Armanini M. Laramee G.R. Johnson S.A.

Brain Res. 1997; 49: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), a reduction proposed to contribute to cognitive decline observed in AD. Thus, examination of BDNF transcription provides a means of assessment of effects on CREB regulation, which may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we report that levels of Aβ-(1–42), which do not affect the survival of cortical neurons, may indeed interfere with functions critical for neuronal plasticity, by eliciting a reduction of the activity-dependent phosphorylation of CREB and the expression of BDNF, one of the important target genes of this transcription factor. Cultures greatly enriched in cortical neurons from embryonic day 18 rat fetuses were prepared as described previously (26Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2were cultured in poly-l-lysine-treated multiwell plates and maintained in serum-free optimal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with B-27 components (Life Technologies). When cells were exposed to Aβ, the medium was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/B27 containing Aβ. Cultures were maintained for 5 days before treatments. Neuronal survival was assessed by trypan blue exclusion (26Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in select experiments using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (27Ivins K.J. Ivins J.K. Sharp J.P. Cotman C.W. J. Biol.

Bui E.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); these methods gave comparable results. Tetrodotoxin (1 μm) was added 2 h before treatments to reduce endogenous synaptic activity. Cells were stimulated using either 30 mm KCl (high K+) for 15 min or 10 μm NMDA for 10 min. Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (100 μm) was added to the cultures 30 min before the high K+ exposure. Aβ peptides were synthesized by solid-phase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (26Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J.

A stock solution of Aβ-(1–42) (1 mm) was prepared in distilled water and used after one freeze-thaw cycle. We have documented previously that Aβ-(1–42) peptides prepared this way assemble into β-sheet fibrils as determined by thioflavin staining, circular dichroism, electron microscopy, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are toxic to nerve cells (26Pike C.J.

To facilitate comparisons, preparations of Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDL) were obtained from the same lot of Aβ-(1–42) peptides as the β-sheet containing Aβ-(1–42) preparations described above. Solutions of ADDLs were prepared as described previously (31Oda T. Wals P. Osterburg H.H. Johnson S.A. Pasinetti G.M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A.

In brief, Aβ-(1–42)-containing solutions (0.34 mg/ml) were incubated with clusterin (0.17 mg/ml) at 22 °C for 24 h. Solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove large aggregates, and the supernatant was used for all assays. In agreement with the published features of these preparations, microscopic examination indicated that the supernatant contained no large aggregates. Cortical neurons were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated at room temperature in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk for 60 min to block the nonspecific binding. Following incubation with the primary antibodies specific for either Ser-133 phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) (1:2,000) or total CREB (T-CREB), which recognize both phospho- and dephospho-CREB (1:1,000) (both antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), the blots were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and then incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories), at 1:8000 dilution in the blocking solution for 60 min. Blots were then washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween. Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the recommended conditions. Immunoreactivity was quantified using densitometric analysis. Cultures were initially treated with a solution of 3% aqueous H2O2 for 3 min, then briefly rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 0.05 m Tris in 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated in TBS containing 5% normal goat serum. The cultures were then incubated at 4 °C in TBS, 5% serum containing the rabbit polyclonal IgG against P-CREB (1:2000). Cultures were then rinsed in buffer and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After a buffer rinse, cultures were incubated in the presence of avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for 90 min. They were then rinsed in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6, and incubated in Tris-HCl containing 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide for 5–10 min. Reactions were stopped by rinsing the cultures with PBS. Quantitative analysis was performed by Image Pro-Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Cortical neurons were transfected with plasmid pIII(170)Luc (a kind gift of Dr. Michael E. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School) at 3 DIV using a procedure described previously (33Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, all transfections were conducted in 6-well 35-mm dishes with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One well was transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV (Promega), a cytomegalovirus-luciferase control plasmid to normalize BDNF exon III promoter activity. Forty hours after transfection, cultures received 30 mm KCl for 9 h and then plates were washed twice with cold PBS, and cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Twenty μl of cell extract were used for a dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BDNF exon III and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA contents were estimated using RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cultures at 5 DIV by a spin column kit (Promega), and RT-PCR was carried out using a one-tube RT-PCR kit (Amersham Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of total RNA was used, and the single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR with exon-specific primers. The primers for BDNF exon III and GAPDH were described previously (18Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). BDNF exon III primers were as follows: reverse primer E5R, 5′-GAGAAGAGTGATGACCATCCT-3′ and forward primer E3F (exon III-specific), 5′-TGCGAGTATTACCTCCGCCAT-3′. GAPDH primers were 5′-TCCATGACAACTTTGGCATCGTGG-3′ and 5′-GTTGCTGTTGAAGTCACAGGAGAC-3′. The amount of total RNA in the samples was normalized to the amount of GAPDH. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels and stained using Vistra Green (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The products were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. β-Amyloid peptides, such as Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(25–35), are known to compromise neuronal survival both in vitro and in vivo (8Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 34Cotman C.W. Ivins K.J. Anderson A.J. Terry R.D. Katzman R. Bick K.L. Sisodia S.S. Alzheimer's Disease. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 347-358Google Scholar). The effect of Aβ-(1–42) on cultured neurons is concentration-dependent, and significant cell loss was detected after treatment at concentrations of >20 μm. We also observed that under our experimental conditions there was a threshold for the effect of Aβ-(1–42) on cell viability. Twenty four-hour exposure of cortical neurons to Aβ-(1–42) at ≥20 μm with the lot of peptide used in this study resulted in significant cell loss, whereas survival was not affected at ≤10 μm (not shown). A concentration range of 1–10 μm was therefore chosen for the exploration of the influence of Aβ-(1–42) on neuronal function. It should be noted that no studies to date have assessed the effect of sublethal levels of Aβ on the regulation of gene expression that is mediated by activity-dependent signal transduction. Cognitive dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the AD phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated that synaptic plasticity, including certain forms of LTP and memory, depends critically on the activation of the transcription factor CREB (13Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4239-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Abel T. Kandel E. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the influence of sublethal concentrations of Aβ-(1–42) on activity-dependent CREB phosphorylation. K+-induced depolarization of neurons is known to elicit the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133, an event that is essential for its transcription-activating function (16Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 17Shieh P.B. Hu S.C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Therefore, the level of activated CREB was examined with Western blotting using a specific antibody against Ser-133-phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB). Pretreatment with 5 or 10 μm Aβ-(1–42) for 1 h decreased high K+-induced elevation of the amount of P-CREB (Fig.1, A and B). Pretreatment with 5 or 10 μm Aβ-(1–42) for 1 h on unstimulated cells had no significant effect on the basal level of P-CREB (as a percentage of control the values after exposure to 5 or 10 μm Aβ-(1–42) 115 ± 33 and 120 ± 21%) (Fig. 1 C). The main effect of Aβ-(1–42) on the depolarization-induced elevation of P-CREB occurred within the 1st h, and in cultures exposed to high K+ for 15 min the P-CREB level was, as a percentage of that in the untreated controls, 50 ± 3.0 or 40 ± 2.0% after treatment with 5 μm Aβ-(1–42) for 1 or 24 h (Fig.1 D; n = 3). In contrast, the effect of Aβ-(1–42) with random sequence (Aβ-(1–42)(R)) failed to influence the high K+-induced increase of P-CREB levels (Fig.1 E). After a 1-h treatment with 10 μmAβ-(1–42)(R) the estimates were, as a percentage of those in the untreated controls, 91 ± 6.7% compared with less than 40% observed after exposure to 10 μm Aβ-(1–42) (Fig.1 B). None of the treatments had significant effects on total CREB levels (e.g. Fig. 1 B). We examined further CREB activation using immunocytochemistry and observed that membrane depolarization induced by exposure to elevated K+ resulted in almost all cells in a pronounced increase in P-CREB immunoreactivity, which was markedly attenuated by treatment with Aβ-(1–42) (Fig. 2). There is evidence that neurotoxicity in primary cultures is related to the ability of Aβ-(1–42) to form fibrillary assemblies (3Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Aβ may form small diffusible oligomers (referred to as ADDLs, for Aβ-derived diffusible ligands), which are highly neurotoxic (31Oda T. Wals P. Osterburg H.H. Johnson S.A. Pasinetti G.M.

A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). In the ADDL preparation used in the present study the formation of large Aβ assemblies was reduced using clusterin, and the large assemblies that did form were removed by centrifugation,according to the procedure of Lambert et al. (32Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Most importantly, ADDLs cause degeneration of neurons at lower concentrations than conventionally assembled preparations (32Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar) and may share properties with soluble Aβ that is present in the AD brain. Also under our experimental conditions, ADDLs compromised neuronal survival at concentrations lower than those needed to effect neurotoxicity with conventional fibrillar Aβ-(1–42) preparations, causing significant cell loss (23%), already at a concentration of 1 μm after 24 h of exposure. Furthermore, at the sublethal concentrations of 100 nm, ADDL elicited a marked suppression of the high K+-induced increase in P-CREB content to 62 ± 13.6% (n = 3) of the levels in the untreated controls (Fig.3). To determine whether the observed effects were specific to Aβ-(1–42), the influence of Aβ-(25–35), a toxic fragment of Aβ, was examined. This fragment also elicited neuron loss at ≥25 μm but, importantly, did not interfere with CREB phosphorylation at the sublethal concentration of 10 μm(Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, both the fibrillar Aβ-(1–42) and the diffusible Aβ-(1–42) oligomers (ADDLs) interfere at sublethal concentrations with neuronal activity-induced signal transduction via CREB, whereas the potent toxic fragment Aβ-(25–35) is inactive. CREB phosphorylation can also be elicited by nerve cell activation through the stimulation of NMDA receptors that play an important role in neuronal plasticity, including certain types of LTP (35Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 521-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 36Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9607) Google Scholar). A short exposure to NMDA in our cultures also evoked a marked increase in P-CREB levels, and this effect was suppressed by sublethal concentrations of Aβ-(1–42) (Fig.5). As a percentage of P-CREB levels in the NMDA-treated cultures, pretreatment with 5 μmAβ-(1–42) reduced P-CREB levels to 59 ± 7.2% (n = 3). None of the treatments had significant effects on total CREB levels (Fig. 5). Although neurons remained viable in the presence of 1–10 μmAβ-(1–42) during the experimental period, sublethal Aβ-(1–42) may have triggered early apoptotic events that affect CREB signaling. Previous studies suggested that caspase activation plays an important role in Aβ-(1–42)-induced apoptosis in neurons (37Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 38Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Friedman W.J. Frappier T.F. Brown K. Shelanski M.L. J.

In chelicerates, the oxygen carrier hemocyanin seems to function as the phenoloxidase. Here, we show that hemocyanins from two ancient chelicerates, the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus and the tarantulaEurypelma californicum, exhibitO-diphenoloxidase activity induced by submicellar concentrations of SDS, a reagent frequently used to identify phenoloxidase activity. The enzymatic activity seems to be restricted to only a few of the heterogeneous subunits. These active subunit types share similar topological positions in the quaternary structures as linkers of the two tightly connected 2 × 6-mers. Because no other phenoloxidase activity was found in the hemolymph of these animals, their hemocyanins may act as a phenoloxidase and thus be involved in the primary immune response and sclerotization of the cuticle. In contrast, hemolymph of a more recent arthropod, the crab Cancer magister, contains both hemocyanin with weak phenoloxidase activity and another hemolymph protein with relatively strong phenoloxidase activity. The chelicerate hemocyanin subunits showing phenoloxidase activity may have evolved into a separate phenoloxidase in crustaceans.

They are involved in several biological functions. They initiate the synthesis of melanin, are responsible for the browning of fruits, vegetables, and fungi, and are crucial for sclerotization of arthropod exoskeleton. Their central role in a common defense cascade for Deuterostoma and Prostoma has been reviewed (1Smith V.J. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1996; 23: 75-114Crossref Google Scholar). Phenoloxidases catalyze the O-hydroxylation of monophenols (cresolase) or oxidation of O-diphenols to quinones (catecholoxidase) or both (tyrosinase) (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 3Sanchez-Ferrer A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Garcia-Canovas F. Garcia-Carmona F. Biochim. Biophys.

Both melanin and phenoloxidase are considered to be integral parts of the arthropod immune system (5Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 6Terwilliger N.B. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 589-599Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among the Arthropoda, prophenoloxidases and their activated form, phenoloxidases, have been well characterized in insects and crustaceans but not in chelicerates. Hemocyanin, which is closely related to crustacean phenoloxidase based on sequence data (7Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Durstewitz G. Terwilliger N.B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Hughes A.L. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is the major constituent of the hemolymph of crustaceans and chelicerates but is absent in insects. Interestingly, the clotting system of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, an ancient chelicerate, bears several functional and biochemical similarities to the prophenoloxidase system in insects and crustacea, including activation induced by lipopolysaccharides or β-1,3-glucans (10Söderhäll K. Levin J. Armstrong P.B. Biol. Bull. 1985; 169: 661-674Crossref Google Scholar, 11Söderhäll K. Thornqvist P.-O. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1997; 90: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar). A marked difference from insects and crustaceans, however, is that L. polyphemus amoebocyte lysate supernatant lacks phenoloxidase activity (10Söderhäll K. Levin J. Armstrong P.B. Biol. Bull. 1985; 169: 661-674Crossref Google Scholar). Recently Nellaiappan and Sugumaran (12Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a prophenoloxidase in the hemolymph of L. polyphemus. Although other prophenoloxidases are often easily activated by limited proteolysis, the prophenoloxidase of L. polyphemus could be only weakly activated by proteolysis, but activity could be induced by detergents such as SDS or cetylpyridinium chloride (12Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on gel electrophoresis and substrate specificities they determined that the enzyme is an O-diphenoloxidase with a molecular mass of about 70 kDa. Our experiments suggest that this prophenoloxidase is hemocyanin, which is present in high concentrations in the hemolymph of L. polyphemus. Hemocyanins are large multisubunit copper proteins composed of different subunit types and found freely dissolved in the hemolymph of arthropods and molluscs (13van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1982; 15: 1-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 14van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Salvato B. Beltramini M. Life Chem. Rep. 1990; 8: 1-47Google Scholar, 16Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). Their primary biological function is the transport of oxygen. Several physicochemical properties of hemocyanins are very similar to those of phenoloxidases (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 15Salvato B. Beltramini M. Life Chem. Rep. 1990; 8: 1-47Google Scholar, 17van Gelder C.W.G. Flurkey W.H. Wichers H.J.

Based on x-ray structures, dioxygen is bound in a μ − η2:η2side-on coordination in hemocyanins (19Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Hol W.G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which should also hold for phenoloxidases because of the very similar spectroscopic properties of the two proteins (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 20Solomon E.I. Tuczek F. Root D.E. Brown C.A. Chem.

The high degree of similarity between the active sites of phenoloxidases and hemocyanins of arthropods and molluscs is also supported by the capability of hemocyanins to exhibitO-diphenoloxidase activity after exposure to chaotrophic salts, SDS, or low pH values (22Zlateva T. di Muro P. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Salvato B. Santamaria M. Beltramini M. Alzuet G. Casella L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14065-14077Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The hemocyanin from a chelicerate, the tarantula Eurypelma californicum, has shown phenoloxidase activity after proteolysis (24Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). E. californicum hemocyanin is sequentially and structurally closely related to the hemocyanin from L. polyphemus (25Lamy J. Lamy J. Weill J. Markl J. Schneider H.J. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In another chelicerate, Tachypleus tridentatus, it has recently been shown that the naturally occurring coagulation cascade is linked to prophenoloxidase activation with hemocyanin functioning as a prophenoloxidase (26Nagai T. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 24264-29267Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that hemocyanins from two ancient species of chelicerate, L. polyphemus and E. californicum, develop O-diphenoloxidase activity in response to submicellar concentrations of SDS, a reagent commonly used to identify phenoloxidase activity (12Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Nellaiappan K. Vinayakam A. Biotech. Histochem. 1993; 68: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The functional conversion of hemocyanin may indicate an induced conformational change. This activation is restricted to only a few of the various subunit types of each hemocyanin. We compare the enzymatic activities of these chelicerate hemocyanins with that of Cancer magister, a crustacean. L. polyphemus was purchased through Carolina Biological Supply. The hemolymph was withdrawn from the pericardial cavity and immediately centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C using a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was chromatographed at 4 °C on a BioGel A5m (400-mesh) column (120 × 2.5 cm) that was equilibrated with a 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. The purification of hemocyanins from E. californicum and C. magister has been described elsewhere (24Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Terwilliger N.B. Terwilliger R.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1982; 221: 181-191Google Scholar). The purified proteins were stored at 4 °C. The concentrations of the proteins were determined spectroscopically using the molar extinction coefficient at 278 nm, ε278 = 1.1 ml mg−1 cm−1 for chelicerate hemocyanin. Concentrations were expressed on a molar basis using the value of 75 kDa for an arthropod hemocyanin subunit (16Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). Native PAGE1 of hemolymph and hemocyanin was carried out at pH 7.4 using a 3% gel (see Ref. 29Davis B. Anal. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar, as modified by Ref. 28Terwilliger N.B. Terwilliger R.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1982; 221: 181-191Google Scholar). Dissociating, non-denaturing PAGE at pH 8.9 in EDTA was done on a 7.5% gel. Prior to pH 8.9 PAGE, hemocyanins were dissociated into subunits by overnight dialysis at 4 °C in 0.05m glycine/OH− buffer, pH 9.5, 5 mmin EDTA. According to electrophoresis results, more than 90% of the hemocyanin was dissociated under these conditions. Phenoloxidase activity after electrophoresis on both pH 7.4 and pH 8.9 gels was demonstrated using dopamine as substrate (27Nellaiappan K. Vinayakam A. Biotech. Histochem. 1993; 68: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The essential part of this assay is the activation of the phenoloxidase by SDS. After the phenoloxidase assay, the gels were photographed and then stained with Coomassie Blue to identify the proteins. The time course of the phenoloxidase activity of the hemocyanins was followed by monitoring the formation of dopachrome and its derivatives by the absorbance at 475 nm. The substrate was added to the hemocyanin solution in 0.2m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was then initiated by injection of a concentrated SDS stock solution to a final SDS concentration of 0.085 ± 0.005% and mixing briefly. The dead time was less than 10 s. Substrates and reaction mixtures were maintained in the dark because of their light sensitivity. The condition of the chemically unstable substrates was checked spectroscopically. Substrates dl-dopa, dopamine, and catechol were purchased from Sigma. Two of the four peaks of L. polyphemus hemolymph separated by BioGel A5m chromatography (Fig. 1) showed phenoloxidase activity when subjected to pH 7.4 PAGE and then incubated in the presence of dopamine and SDS (Fig.2). These same peaks, A and B, had 280/340-nm absorbance ratios of 4.2, indicative of copper oxygen-binding proteins. Peak B corresponded to the native 8-hexamer hemocyanin with a molecular mass of 3.6 MDa, whereas peak A was a higher molecular mass aggregate of hemocyanin (7.3 MDa) as determined by light scattering (data not shown). The two lower molecular mass peaks, C and D, showed neither 340-nm absorbance nor phenoloxidase activity. To determine whether other hemolymph proteins besides hemocyanin exhibit phenoloxidase activity, we tested the unpurified hemolymph with the same assay for phenoloxidase activity. Only those bands containing hemocyanin were stained by the activity assay.Figure 2SDS-induced phenoloxidase activity of hemolymph proteins and hemocyanins from L. polyphemus,E. californicum, C. magister, andH. aspersa.

When intact 8 × 6-mer L. polyphemus (peak B) and 4 × 6-merE. californicum hemocyanins were assayed by pH 7.4 PAGE, both hemocyanins showed phenoloxidase activity (Fig. 2). As in the case of L. polyphemus, no bands other than the hemocyanin bands showed phenoloxidase activity in E. californicum hemolymph (data not shown). The absence of a unique phenoloxidase protein in chelicerate hemolymph is in agreement with the literature (10Söderhäll K. Levin J. Armstrong P.B. Biol. Bull. 1985; 169: 661-674Crossref Google Scholar). Thus it is unclear what enzyme participates in vivo in the essential biological processes, sclerotization of the cuticle after molting and the immune response, in chelicerates. To compare the phenoloxidase activities of chelicerate hemocyanins with other hemocyanins, we tested the activity of crustacean (C. magister) and molluscan (Helix aspersa) hemocyanins by pH 7.4 PAGE (Fig. 2). The C. magister hemolymph contained a slowly migrating molecule with strong phenoloxidase activity (30Terwilliger N. Dangott L. Ryan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Purified 25 S hemocyanin of C. magister also showed phenoloxidase activity but only after extended incubation with dopamine and SDS. The quaternary structure or the subunit structure of the crustacean hemocyanin, compared with chelicerate hemocyanin, may hinder the access of substrates to the active site sterically. Other studies on crustacean hemolymph have reported the presence of a hemocyte prophenoloxidase (31Summers N.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1967; 23: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Aspan A. Huang T.S. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 122: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we report the presence of two different hemolymph molecules with phenoloxidase activity; one is hemocyanin. The activity of crustacean hemocyanin is rather weak in comparison to the slowly migrating phenoloxidase (Fig. 2). Qualitative spectroscopic studies confirmed the results of the phenoloxidase activity staining of the PAGE (Fig.3). Hemocyanins of L. polyphemus and E. californicum converteddl-dopa, dopamine, and catechol after activation by SDS.C. magister hemocyanin showed activity only with dopamine and catechol and lacked activity with dl-dopa. No activity was observed when the above assay was applied usingl-tyrosine as a substrate to test the monophenoloxidase activity of these hemocyanins. Thus, these hemocyanins seem to behave like catecholoxidases when activated by SDS. When the hemocyanins were dissociated into monomers, subjected to pH 8.9 PAGE, and tested for phenoloxidase activity, not all subunit types showed a reaction (Fig. 4). Three of the eight bands of dissociated L. polyphemus hemocyanin appeared to be capable of O-diphenoloxidase activity. Several authors have detected heterogeneous subunit types of Limulushemocyanin (25Lamy J. Lamy J. Weill J. Markl J. Schneider H.J. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Bonaventura J. Gianazza E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 748-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), theLimulus hemocyanin bands showing phenoloxidase activity are assigned to subunits LpII, II', II“ (all three belong to the same subunit II), V, and VI. The quaternary structure of the 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin from E. californicum is comparable with the 4 × 6-mer half-molecule of L. polyphemus hemocyanin (41van Heel M. Dube P. Micron. 1994; 25: 387-418Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). InE. californicum hemocyanin, only subunits b andc showed SDS-activated O-diphenol oxidase activity (Fig. 4). The latter two subunits also showed phenoloxidase activity after activation by limited proteolysis (24Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two of the four subunits from L. polyphemus that exhibit phenoloxidase activity, LpV and LpVI, and subunits b and c fromE. californicum hemocyanin have the same topological positions within the quaternary structure and can even be exchanged without losing the quaternary structure or the functional properties of the oligomeric hemocyanins (Fig. 5) (42van Bruggen E.J.F.

H. aspersa hemocyanin was included as a positive control and demonstrates strong phenoloxidase activity on both pH 7.4 and pH 8.9 PAGE. This finding confirms the catecholoxidase activity of molluscan hemocyanin as observed previously (45Salvato B. Jori G. Piazzese A. Ghiretti F. Beltramini M. Lerch K. Life Sci. Res. Rep. 1983; 1 (suppl. 1): 313-317Google Scholar, 46Nakahara A. Suzuki S. Kino J. Life Sci. Res. Rep. 1983; 1 (suppl.): 319-322Google Scholar). Could these observations be of physiological importance for the animals? In the case of the horseshoe crab L. polyphemus, no O-diphenoloxidase activity in hemolymph cells has been observed so far. The defense mechanism has been described to be similar to other arthropods, however, and all parts of the immune response cascade are found in the hemolymph (1Smith V.J. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1996; 23: 75-114Crossref Google Scholar, 10Söderhäll K. Levin J. Armstrong P.B. Biol. Bull. 1985; 169: 661-674Crossref Google Scholar). Nellaiappan and Sugumaran (12Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) recently detected an O-diphenoloxidase with a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa in the hemolymph of L. polyphemus. For several reasons, we suggest that hemocyanin is responsible for this enzymatic activity. First, the observed molecular mass is comparable with hemocyanin subunits of L. polyphemusas determined by sequence and x-ray analysis (47Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Second, we found that the purified hemocyanin is capable of phenoloxidase activity when activated by SDS. Our hypothesis is supported by the lack of any other protein with O-diphenoloxidase activity in the hemolymph of L. polyphemus. It is also supported by our findings that we were not able to detect any phenoloxidase activity in L. polyphemus and E. californicum when centrifuged hemocytes were tested with the same assay (data not shown). Therefore we think that the O-diphenoloxidase activity of the purified protein in L. polyphemus observed by Nellaiappan and Sugumaran (12Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is exhibited by hemocyanin. The physiological significance of the phenoloxidase activity of chelicerate and crustacean hemocyanins has recently been addressed. In the horseshoe crab, T. tridentatus, the coagulation cascade has been linked to prophenoloxidase activation through non-enzymatic interactions of specific coagulation factors with hemocyanin (26Nagai T. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 24264-29267Google Scholar). This leads to the functional conversion of hemocyanin to phenoloxidase, most probably because of a conformational change of the hemocyanin. In bothT. tridentatus (26Nagai T. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 24264-29267Google Scholar) and L. polyphemus, SDS in submicellar concentrations mimics the function of hydrophobic and/or polar effectors by inducing conformational conversion without denaturation. Similarities in phenoloxidase activity in the hemocyanins of these ancient arthropods L. polyphemus, E. californicum, and T. tridentatus suggest the following hypothetical scenario: In the hemolymph of these chelicerates, certain subunits of the hemocyanins are still involved in the cascade of the immune response by converting them to phenoloxidases. This is not the case in more recent arthropods, the crustaceans, and insects. WhereasC. magister hemocyanin shows some phenoloxidase activity, the primary phenoloxidase is a separate protein. The sequences of crustacean phenoloxidases are closely related to hemocyanins (7Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Hughes A.L.

These crustacean O-diphenoloxidases may have evolved from those hemocyanin linker subunits that exhibitO-diphenoloxidase activity in chelicerates. Further sequence or structural information should clarify this idea. In crustacean hemocyanins that aggregate only to the two-hexamer level, the interhexamer linker subunits that allow four and eight hexamer aggregates are not present. One hypothesis is that these subunit types evolved to O-diphenoloxidases in crustaceans."

This process involves the recruitment of human βTrCP (TrCP), a key member of the SkpI-Cdc53-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that specifically interacts with phosphorylated Vpu molecules. Interestingly, Vpu itself, unlike other TrCP-interacting proteins, is not targeted for degradation by proteasomes. We now report that, by virtue of its affinity for TrCP and resistance to degradation, Vpu, but not a phosphorylation mutant unable to interact with TrCP, has a dominant negative effect on TrCP function. As a consequence, expression of Vpu in HIV-infected T cells or in HeLa cells inhibited TNF-α-induced degradation of IκB-α. Vpu did not inhibit TNF-α-mediated activation of the IκB kinase but instead interfered with the subsequent TrCP-dependent degradation of phosphorylated IκB-α. This resulted in a pronounced reduction of NF-κB activity. We also observed that in cells producing Vpu-defective virus, NF-κB activity was significantly increased even in the absence of cytokine stimulation. However, in the presence of Vpu, this HIV-mediated NF-κB activation was markedly reduced. These results suggest that Vpu modulates both virus- and cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB in HIV-1-infected cells.

Most if not all of the viral accessory proteins exert multiple independent functions. This includes Vpu, which not only regulates virus release from infected cells (1Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also induces degradation of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (3Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The best characterized function of Vpu is its ability to induce the degradation of CD4 (for reviews, see Refs. 4Bour S. Strebel K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 75-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Strebel K. Bour S. J. AIDS. 1999; 13: S13-S24Google Scholar). Structurally, this activity is dependent on sequences present in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu and, in particular, requires the phosphorylation by casein kinase II of two highly conserved serine residues at positions 52 and 56 (6). CD4 degradation is initiated by physical interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of Vpu and CD4 (7Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of the two serine residues in Vpu, while critical for CD4 degradation, is not required for this initial binding (7Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the phosphoserine residues are involved in the recruitment of human βTrCP (TrCP). TrCP is a key component of a recently characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates protein degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (8Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This finding was of particular significance, since there is evidence for the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery in Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation (9Fujita K. Omura S. Silver J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of TrCP in the SkpI-Cdc53-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex is to select and recruit the proper substrate for polyubiquitination by the SCF. This is achieved by the modular organization of TrCP, which allows for simultaneous interactions with the target protein on the one hand through its C-terminal WD repeats and the SCF on the other hand through interactions between its F-box domain and SkpI (reviewed in Ref.11Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).Recent studies have confirmed the important role of TrCP in the regulated degradation of cellular proteins. Indeed, the SCFTrCP was shown to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasome targeting of β-catenin as well as the NF-κB-inhibitory molecule IκB-α (12Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y.

Similar to the TrCP-binding domain in Vpu (15Margottin F. Benichou S. Durand H. Richard V. Liu L.X. Gomas E. Benarous R. Virology. 1996; 223: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the signal for recognition of both β-catenin and IκB by TrCP includes a pair of conserved phosphorylated serine residues that are arranged in a consensus motif, DS[PO3]GψXS[PO3] (where ψ represents a hydropholic residue) present in all three proteins. Serine phosphorylation plays a major role in regulating the stability of SCF target proteins. In the case of IκB-α, activation of the IκB kinase complex following stimulation by cytokines such as TNF-α results in the phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36) and leads to the rapid degradation of IκB-α by cytosolic proteasomes (16Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 17Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Similarly, β-catenin phosphorylation constitutes a signal for degradation and is developmentally regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (18Jiang J. Struhl G. Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar).Among the known substrates of TrCP, Vpu is exceptional in that it does not appear to be targeted for degradation itself but rather acts as an adapter for proteasome targeting of CD4 (8Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to NF-κB or β-catenin, Vpu is constitutively phosphorylated by the ubiquitous casein kinase II (19Schubert U. Henklein P. Boldyreff B. Wingender E. Strebel K. Porstmann T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and, as a consequence, the vast majority of Vpu present in infected cells is TrCP binding-competent at all times. Both the constitutive Vpu phosphorylation as well as the inability to degrade TrCP-bound Vpu are likely to contribute to unusually stable complexes between the two proteins. Indeed, we have previously reported that expression of Vpu and TrCP in vitroin the presence of microsomal membranes resulted in efficient redistribution of TrCP from its normal cytoplasmic fraction to the Vpu-containing membrane fraction (8Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).In HIV-infected cells, Vpu is synthesized from a bicistronic mRNA also encoding the viral envelope (Env) protein gp160. Comparative analysis of Vpu and Env synthesis suggests that the two proteins are synthesized at similar rates. However, unlike the Env protein, which is packaged into virions and exported from the cell, Vpu remains largely cell-associated and accumulates over time in infected cells. Based on these observations, we speculated that the accumulation of Vpu in HIV-infected cells could interfere with the normal physiological function(s) of TrCP by acting as a competitive inhibitor of TrCP. To test this hypothesis, we characterized in this study the effects of Vpu on TrCP-mediated degradation of IkB-α and the resulting activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity. NF-κB is a transcriptional activator that under resting conditions resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex with its inhibitor IκB-α. Degradation of IkB-α following stimulation of cells by growth factors, chemokines, or inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α leads to activation of NF-κB and its translocation into the nucleus, where it induces target gene expression. NF-κB plays a central role in the expression of numerous genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and factors involved in T-cell activation and proliferation (reviewed in Refs. 17Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar and 20Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-κB has been implicated in the control of antiapoptotic genes (reviewed in Refs. 21Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar and 22DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, deregulation of NF-κB in HIV-infected cells will impact on a multitude of normal cellular functions.We now present evidence that the stable interaction between Vpu and TrCP in HIV-1-infected cells leads to impaired TrCP function. Indeed, infection of the CD4-positive A3.01 cell line with the NL4-3 molecular clone of HIV-1 but not with its Vpu-deficient variant resulted in an inhibition of TNF-α-induced IκB degradation. Using CD4/Vpu chimeric molecules with biological activities indistinguishable from those of authentic Vpu, we demonstrate that Vpu is required and sufficient to block IκB degradation. Using a Vpu phosphorylation mutant, we confirm that the ability of Vpu to block IκB degradation is linked to its ability to bind TrCP, demonstrating that Vpu indeed acts as a transdominant negative inhibitor of TrCP. Inhibition of IκB degradation by Vpu was found to severely impair TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Similarly, Vpu was found to significantly reduce HIV-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that Vpu has a transdominant negative effect on TrCP function that impairs both HIV- and cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB.DISCUSSIONHIV-1 is a human retrovirus that induces long term chronic infection in affected individuals. The virus is highly pathogenic and leads to the complete destruction of the immune system in the vast majority of patients. Disease progression is controlled by a complex interplay of viral and host factors, in particular cytokines that regulate the immune response (for a review, see Ref. 35Cohen O.J. Kinter A. Fauci A.S. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 159: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Chronic HIV infection results in the deregulation of numerous cellular functions, including cytokine production, which can either be increased or decreased (reviewed in Ref. 36Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). In HIV-1-positive individuals, expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 was found to be increased, especially at late stages of the disease (37Molina J.M. Scadden D.T.

Conversely, expression of the immunoregulatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-12 was gradually lost over time (43Clerici M. Shearer G.M. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 44Schulick R.D. Clerici M. Dolan M.J. Shearer G.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).As one of the key regulators of cytokine expression, NF-κB is likely to play a role in the perturbation of cytokine production observed in HIV-infected individuals. In fact, three main mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed persistent activation of NF-κB in HIV-1-infected cells: hyperphosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α caused by the constitutive activation of the IκB kinase (32Asin S. Taylor J.A. Trushin S. Bren G. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3893-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33DeLuca C. Petropoulos L. Zmeureanu D. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

Several HIV proteins have been shown to directly or indirectly affect NF-κB regulation. These include Tat, envelope gp120, and the accessory protein Vpr (42Roux P. Alfieri C. Hrimech M. Cohen E.A.

We now report that the HIV-1-specific Vpu protein is also involved in the regulation of NF-κB activity by acting as a negative modulator of TNF-α- and HIV-mediated hyperactivation of NF-κB. Our data suggest that Vpu functions both in HIV-1-infected T cells and in transfected HeLa cells by acting as a competitive inhibitor of βTrCP, thereby preventing the efficient degradation of phosphorylated IκB. Although NF-κB activation was chosen to illustrate the effect of Vpu on TrCP function, it is likely that this activity of Vpu has an even broader impact on cell function. Indeed, one would expect that Vpu can perturb with similar efficiency the degradation of other substrates of TrCP such as β-catenin (50Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar).The majority of the currently known HIV-1 isolates encode a completevpu gene (51Korber B Kuiken C Foley C. L Hahn B McCutchan Mellors F J.W Sodroski J Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1998: A Compilation andAnalysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences.Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1998: II-A-43-II-A-49Google Scholar). However, a number of HIV-1 isolates such as HxB2 and HTLVIIIB/LAI/BRU, which have been widely used in tissue culture studies, do not encode a functional Vpu protein (51Korber B Kuiken C Foley C.

Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1998: II-A-43-II-A-49Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the regulatory role of Vpu could have been overlooked in cases where recombinant protein, subgenomic expression vectors, or Vpu-deficient viruses were used (32Asin S.

Thus, our finding in the present study that Vpu negatively regulates the activation of NF-κB does not necessarily conflict with the previously reported activation of NF-κB in HIV-infected cells. Indeed, it is clear from our own results in both HeLa and A3.01 cells that the expression of full-length HIV-1 does lead to a net increase in NF-κB activity despite the presence of Vpu. However, this increase in NF-κB activity is small compared with the activation seen in the absence of Vpu (Fig. 5).The effect of Vpu on NF-κB is dose-dependent and is mediated through inhibition of the TrCP-dependent degradation of IκB-α. Unlike most other viral proteins, Vpu is not packaged into virions or secreted but gradually accumulates in the cell. As a result, Vpu-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation can be expected to be minor early in infection but to become more and more pronounced as the viral life cycle progresses. Nevertheless, our data obtained in HIV-infected T-cells (Fig. 1) or CD4U-inducible cell lines (Fig. 3) suggest that even when maximal amounts of Vpu are expressed, total inhibition of IκB degradation is not achieved, and NF-κB activity is not completely inhibited (Fig. 4). There are several possible explanations for this observation. First, it is possible that degradation of IκB is regulated by redundant cellular mechanisms. For example, TrCP2, a WD-F-box protein closely related to βTrCP, was recently found to target IκB for degradation (55Suzuki H. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Fujita T. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Shikama H. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2877-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although unlikely, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that the residual NF-κB activity observed in the presence of Vpu is due to an inability of the latter to bind and interfere with the function of TrCP2. Second, it is possible that due to its location in cellular membranes, Vpu is unable to prevent the nuclear degradation of newly synthesized IκB (56Renard P. Percherancier Y. Kroll M. Thomas D. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15193-15199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and therefore might be unable to block the sustained activation of a small pool of NF-κB. Finally, it is possible that NF-κB can be activated through TrCP-independent mechanisms, such as the reported dissociation of IκB-NF-κB complexes following tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB (57Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar).Despite the fact that Vpu is unlikely to completely inhibit NF-κB activity in vivo, its effects on cell function could nevertheless be profound. Indeed, studies performed in transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative variant of IκB-α indicate that T- and B-cell development can be dramatically perturbed when levels of active NF-κB are lowered below a critical physiological threshold (58Bendall H.H. Sikes M.L. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 59Boothby M.R. Mora A.L. Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Also, there is a body of evidence indicating that NF-κB plays a central role in regulating cellular apoptosis (reviewed in Ref.22DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it is still debated whether HIV-1 infection and the ensuing constitutive activation of NF-κB can effectively protect cells from apoptosis. In some cases, activation of NF-κB has been shown to prevent the natural tendency of HIV to induce apoptosis (60DeLuca C. Kwon H. Pelletier N. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Virology. 1998; 244: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), while it is also well documented that HIV infection can prime cells for apoptosis (61Estaquier J. Idziorek T. de Bels F. Barre-Sinoussi F. Hurtrel B. Aubertin A.M. Venet A. Mehtali M. Muchmore E. Michel P. Mouton Y. Girard M. Ameisen J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9431-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 62Gougeon M.L. Lecoeur H. Dulioust A. Enouf M.G. Crouvoiser M. Goujard C. Debord T. Montagnier L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3509-3520PubMed Google Scholar). The complex interplay between NF-κB, TNF-α, PKR, and other factors determines whether or not a cell will be able to overcome an apoptotic signal (22DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is possible that the gradual inhibition of NF-κB activity by Vpu during the course of an infection contributes to HIV-induced apoptosis. This notion is supported by the recent findings that NF-κB confers resistance against Fas-mediated apoptosis (63Dudley E. Hornung F. Zheng L. Scherer D. Ballard D. Lenardo M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and that Vpu increases susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells to Fas killing (64Casella C.R. Rapaport E.L. Finkel T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 92-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results described in the current study, we propose the model outlined in Fig. 6. In cells expressing Vpu, phosphorylation of IκB by various stimuli does not lead to the normal degradation of IκB and activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity. This is due to the fact that IκB degradation requires the activity of βTrCP, which, in Vpu-expressing cells, is competitively inhibited through interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu. Normal cellular substrates of βTrCP are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded, thereby releasing βTrCP from the complex. In contrast, Vpu is not targeted for degradation but instead accumulates in virus-producing cells and forms stable complexes with βTrCP. Both the accumulation of Vpu in virus-producing cells and the stability of Vpu-TrCP complexes are likely to contribute to the efficiency of Vpu-mediated inhibition of βTrCP activity, which becomes more and more pronounced in late stages of virus replication. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 is a complex retrovirus, which, in addition to the prototypical Gag, Pol, and Env products, requires the activity of a number of accessory proteins for replication in vivo. Most if not all of the viral accessory proteins exert multiple independent functions. This includes Vpu, which not only regulates virus release from infected cells (1Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also induces degradation of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (3Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7193-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized function of Vpu is its ability to induce the degradation of CD4 (for reviews, see Refs. 4Bour S. Strebel K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 75-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Strebel K. Bour S. J. AIDS. 1999; 13: S13-S24Google Scholar). Structurally, this activity is dependent on sequences present in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu and, in particular, requires the phosphorylation by casein kinase II of two highly conserved serine residues at positions 52 and 56 (6). CD4 degradation is initiated by physical interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of Vpu and CD4 (7Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of the two serine residues in Vpu, while critical for CD4 degradation, is not required for this initial binding (7Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the phosphoserine residues are involved in the recruitment of human βTrCP (TrCP). TrCP is a key component of a recently characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates protein degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (8Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This finding was of particular significance, since there is evidence for the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery in Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation (9Fujita K. Omura S. Silver J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of TrCP in the SkpI-Cdc53-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex is to select and recruit the proper substrate for polyubiquitination by the SCF. This is achieved by the modular organization of TrCP, which allows for simultaneous interactions with the target protein on the one hand through its C-terminal WD repeats and the SCF on the other hand through interactions between its F-box domain and SkpI (reviewed in Ref.11Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Recent studies have confirmed the important role of TrCP in the regulated degradation of cellular proteins. Indeed, the SCFTrCP was shown to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasome targeting of β-catenin as well as the NF-κB-inhibitory molecule IκB-α (12Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y.

Similar to the TrCP-binding domain in Vpu (15Margottin F. Benichou S. Durand H. Richard V. Liu L.X. Gomas E. Benarous R. Virology. 1996; 223: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the signal for recognition of both β-catenin and IκB by TrCP includes a pair of conserved phosphorylated serine residues"

In this study, we explored the changes in synthesis of proteoglycans by vascular smooth muscle cells in response to precisely controlled mechanical strains. Strain increased mRNA for versican (3.2-fold), biglycan (2.0-fold), and perlecan (2.0-fold), whereas decorin mRNA levels decreased to a third of control levels. Strain also increased versican, biglycan, and perlecan core proteins, with a concomitant decrease in decorin core protein. Deformation did not alter the hydrodynamic size of proteoglycans as evidenced by molecular sieve chromatography but increased sulfate incorporation in both chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (p < 0.05 for both). Using DNA microarrays, we also identified the gene for the hyaluronan-linking protein TSG6 as mechanically induced in smooth muscle cells. Northern analysis confirmed a 4.0-fold increase in steady state mRNA for TSG6 following deformation. Size exclusion chromatography under associative conditions showed that versican-hyaluronan aggregation was enhanced following deformation.

The vascular smooth muscle cell plays a prominent role in development and maintenance of arterial structure. Vascular smooth muscle cells are the primary source of arterial extracellular matrix (ECM), 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixASMCarterial smooth muscle cellsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisLDLlow density lipoprotein including collagens, elastic fibers, and several proteoglycans (1Wight T.N. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 421-440Google Scholar). Proteoglycans serve several functions in the artery wall, including regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (2Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). The major proteoglycan in the arterial ECM synthesized by arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMC) is the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican, also known as PG-M (5Yao L.Y. Moody C.

Versican is a member of a family of proteoglycans including brevican, neurocan, and aggrecan that can bind hyaluronan and form large aggregates (10Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycans, Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, NY2000: 327-342Google Scholar). These large aggregates contribute to tissue mechanical properties, providing a hydrated sponge-like matrix that resists or cushions against deformation (12Grodzinsky A.J. Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 1983; 9: 133-199PubMed Google Scholar). Arteries also contain smaller proteoglycans that contain dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans such as decorin and biglycan, which interact with other ECM proteins and with macromolecules that enter the vascular wall such as low density lipoproteins (13Chait A. Wight T.N. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 2000; 11: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, blood vessels contain perlecan, which is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan associated with basal lamina surrounding ASMC (2Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). extracellular matrix arterial smooth muscle cells polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis low density lipoprotein Vascular smooth muscle cells are under dynamic mechanical stresses from arterial pressure, and their responses to mechanical stimuli have therefore been of long-standing interest. In the past decade, improvements in bioengineering have provided much more precise and uniform methods of cell deformation (14Brown T.D. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Using DNA microarrays and a device that provides a precise and uniform biaxial strain profile, we have shown that small mechanical deformations, well below the amplitudes that cause cell injury, induce highly specific molecular events in ASMC (15Feng Y. Yang J.H. Huang H. Kennedy S.P. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F. Libby P. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These events include induction of several genes that may affect arterial extracellular matrix, including tenascin-C and plaminogen activator inhibitor-1. In addition, small deformations specifically suppress matrix metalloproteinase-1, an enzyme that can initiate degradation of fibrillar collagen (16Yang J.H. Briggs W.H. Libby P. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6550-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that deformation regulates smooth muscle cell ECM metabolism and suggest that ASMCs may modify their biomechanical environment in a manner that limits potential biomechanical injury. Because proteoglycans are ECM molecules that can play a prominent role in tissue mechanics, this study was designed to determine whether mechanical strain induced specific changes in the synthesis of proteoglycans and altered their ability to interact with other ECM molecules. ASMC were prepared from explants from excess aortic tissue from the donor at the time of organ harvest for orthotopic cardiac transplantation at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ASMC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate (16Yang J.H. Briggs W.H. Libby P. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6550-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 up to passage 6–7 for experiments. The Brigham and Women's Hospital Committee for Human Research approved the protocol. Mechanical deformation was applied to a thin and transparent membrane on which cells were cultured, an approach that provides a nearly homogeneous biaxial strain profile. Each culture dish consists of a plastic cylinder and a circular silicone elastometric membrane, which is the culture surface. The membrane undergoes cyclic tensile deformation as the platen assembly moves sinusoidally. We have previously measured membrane strains with a high-resolution video device (17Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); for this study, all experiments were performed with 4% cyclic strain, a magnitude of strain that does not lead to cell injury but reproducibly induces a restricted set of genes (15Feng Y. Yang J.H. Huang H. Kennedy S.P. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F. Libby P. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Culture membranes were precoated with 2 μg/ml serum fibronectin in 13 ml of Hank's solution for 24 h at 4 °C and then washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. ASMC were plated on the coated membrane dish at a density of 6 × 105 cells/dish in 13 ml of Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 24 h. Before mechanical strain was applied, 10 ml of fresh medium was exchanged. To eliminate the variable of time-dependent changes because of cell age or effects of adhesion to fibronectin or the membrane in each experiment, all cells were cultured on the membrane for an identical time period, and cells and media from all samples were harvested at the same time. For example, in a time course experiment with strain, the time point represents the time prior to harvest that strain was initiated, such that the strain sample and control sample were harvested at the same time. To assess proteoglycan synthesis, cells were labeled with 100 μCi per ml Na2[35S]O4 for various times. The medium was combined with a 0.1 volume of 10× protease inhibitors dissolved in 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, and 2% Triton X-100 detergent, pH 7.4, Ref. 8Schonherr E.

Aliquots of DEAE-purified material containing 30,000 dpm 35S were precipitated in 80% ethanol and 1.3% potassium acetate. The resulting pellet was then applied directly to SDS-PAGE or digested by incubation prior to chromatography with 2.3 units per ml chondroitin ABC lyase (Sigma) in Tris-buffered solution (45 mm Tris, 0.09 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.7 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, Ref.21Saito H.

The void peak was taken to eliminate free [35S]sulfate, split into two aliquots and applied to a 0.6 × 50 cm Sepharose CL-2B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) molecular sieve column in the same associative buffer. Prior to chromatography, one of the two aliquots was digested with 2 units ofStreptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 24 h. Under associative conditions, proteoglycans containing aggregates will elute in the void volume. Digestion of components of the aggregate, for example by hyaluronidase, will shift the elution position of the proteoglycans to a later fraction (34Wight T.N. Hascall V.C. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Kimura J.H. Hardingham T.E. Hascall V.C. Solursh M. J. Biol.

Human ASMC were exposed to 4% strain for 0, 12, 24, 36, or 48 h prior to harvest of all samples at the same time, with no media changes in the 48-h period. Northern analysis revealed a time-dependent increase in mRNA levels for versican, biglycan, perlecan, and type I collagen (Fig.1). The greatest increase occurred in versican mRNA levels, reaching 3.2-fold at 48 h. Levels of versican and biglycan mRNA were greatest at 48 h whereas those of perlecan were greatest at 24 h, indicating that the synthesis of different proteoglycans may be differentially regulated by strain. In contrast, decorin mRNA dropped rapidly by 12 h after the application of strain and remained low throughout the experiment. In additional zero strain controls, we observed no significant changes in gene expression during the 48 h of culture. To investigate the effect of strain on proteoglycan synthesis, ASMC were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate for the last 12 h of 12, 24, 36, or 48 h of 4% strain. A modest increase in total incorporation of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans, as determined by CPC precipitation, peaked at 24–36 h (47% increase,p < 0.005; Fig.2 A). The increase in proteoglycans was apparent in both the cell layer and the medium. The chondroitin/dermatan, and heparan sulfate portions of total radiolabeled proteoglycans were determined by chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of the cell and medium fractions, followed by CPC precipitation (Fig. 2 B). The maximum increase in radiolabeled chondroitin/dermatan sulfate synthesis was in the medium at 36–48 h (62% increase, p < 0.05), whereas that of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the medium was at 12–24 h (87% increase, p < 0.005), consistent with the early increase in perlecan mRNA levels (Fig. 1). In the cell layer, heparan sulfate incorporation reached a maximum at 36–48 h (58% increase, p < 0.05). Because the heparan sulfate component of the medium was approximately twice that of the cell layer, the total of cell and medium heparan sulfate peaked at 12–24 h. To determine whether strain altered the relative quantities or average size of the different classes of proteoglycan synthesized by ASMC, radiolabeled proteoglycans collected after 24–36 h strain were isolated by ion affinity exchange and subjected to molecular sieve chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. Two major peaks eluted at Kav ∼0.28 and ∼0.67 in the medium and 0.42 and 0.78 in the cell layer (Fig.3). The major component of the large peak is versican and the smaller peak is a mixture of biglycan and decorin (8Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No major differences were seen in the elution positions of these radiolabeled peaks between control or strain cultures. The relative amount of radiolabeled material secreted into the medium was ∼80% greater in the larger, versican-containing peak, indicating increased synthesis in response to strain. This is consistent with increased levels of versican mRNA (Fig. 1). The absence of a change in hydrodynamic size in the versican peak suggests that the increased accumulation of [35S]sulfate-labeled material is a result of increased synthesis of the proteoglycan core proteins and their GAG chains rather than elongation of GAG chains as has been observed for the synthesis of these proteoglycans by ASMC when stimulated by cytokines (8Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small shift in the Kav of the second peak in the medium to ∼0.63, indicating a greater hydrodynamic size, was probably because of an increase in the ratio of biglycan to decorin in that peak, because biglycan is a larger macromolecule (8Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the increase in mRNA and protein expression of biglycan by strain (Figs. 1 and 4) and the decrease in mRNA and protein for decorin (Figs. 1 and 4). Proteoglycans from cells exposed to strain for 24–36 h were applied to 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE. Decorin and biglycan run as separate bands in the resolving gel whereas versican remains in the stacking gel (8Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No change in the relative amount of biglycan could be detected by this method. On the other hand, the relative intensity of the decorin band in the medium was greatly decreased, to ∼30% of the control level (Fig.4 A). This is consistent with reduced production of decorin mRNA by cells exposed to strain (see Fig. 1). Western analysis was performed on medium and cell layer extracts from ASMC exposed to strain for 24–36 h (Fig. 4 B). Increases were observed in the levels of versican, biglycan, and perlecan. Versican core protein was increased to 126% of control levels in both medium and cell layer. Perlecan was increased to 144 and 413% of control levels in the medium and cell layers, respectively. The percent increase in biglycan levels could not be determined by scanning, because detectable levels were only found in medium after application of strain. In contrast, the level of decorin core protein was reduced to 13 and 89% of control levels in medium and cell layer, respectively. In DNA microarray experiments with the Affymetrix HU6800 microarray that were ongoing at the same time as these experiments, we found that the gene for the hyaluronan-binding protein TSG6 was among a small set of genes increased by 4% strain in ASMC. Northern analysis confirmed that mRNA for TSG6 was reproducibly increased by strain (Fig.5). Both TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and strain led to modest increases in a single band (∼90 kDa) recognized by anti-TSG6 antibody in a Western analysis under reducing conditions (data not shown). This corresponds to a size that is larger than the deduced molecular mass of TSG6 (∼35 kDa); in four separate experiments, the cell lysate contained no bands or a very faint band at ∼35 kDa. Thus, although these findings are consistent with previous observations (made with the identical antibody used in this study) that secreted TSG6 can form larger stable complexes with other molecules (33Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the identification of these 90-kDa bands as TSG6 is tentative. To determine whether increased synthesis of versican was accompanied by increased formation of high molecular weight versican-hyaluronan aggregates, we examined the presence of native aggregates using size exclusion chromatography under associative conditions (34Wight T.N. Hascall V.C. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Kimura J.H. Hardingham T.E. Hascall V.C. Solursh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2600-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of material at the void volume of a Sepharose CL-2B molecular sieve column under associative conditions in the control medium proteoglycans indicated that no aggregate formed (Fig.6 A). A void volume peak in medium from strained cells (Fig. 6 B) indicated the presence of a macromolecular aggregate of hyaluronan and versican. Digestion of the samples with Streptomyces hyaluronidase prior to chromatography shifted all of the aggregate from strained cells to the included volume of the column, whereas it had no effect on the column profile obtained with control medium. These findings demonstrate that mechanical strain induces proteoglycan aggregation with hyaluronan. In this study, we found that small, highly controlled biomechanical deformation induces the synthesis of specific vascular proteoglycans including versican, biglycan, and perlecan, whereas decorin expression was suppressed. We also found increased expression of the hyaluronan-binding protein TSG6. Furthermore, mechanical strain increased proteoglycan aggregation, suggesting that the cellular response to deformation is highly coordinated. Because DNA microarray experiments demonstrate that relatively few genes are altered by mechanical strain in these cells (15Feng Y. Yang J.H. Huang H. Kennedy S.P. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F. Libby P. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), these experiments highlight the restricted and specific molecular regulation of ASMC by biomechanical stimuli. Vascular smooth muscle cells perform a sentinel role in arterial mechanics. Under disturbed conditions such as hypertension, the vascular smooth muscle cell must sense the changes and respond appropriately. These responses include changes in the extracellular matrix, and prior studies have demonstrated that mechanical strain increases collagen and proteoglycan synthesis by these cells (36Leung D.Y. Glagov S. Mathews M.B. Science. 1976; 191: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 37Sumpio B.E. Banes A.J. Link W.G. Johnson Jr., G. Arch. Surg. 1988; 123: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Durante W. Liao L. Reyna S.V. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the molecular specificity of the proteoglycan increase has not been characterized previously. Because different proteoglycans can have markedly varied biological roles, we anticipated that not all vascular proteoglycans would be regulated similarly. These experiments demonstrate that decorin is specifically decreased by strain. Because decorin binds to collagen (39Keene D.R. San Antonio J.D. Mayne R. McQuillan D.J. Sarris G. Santoro S.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21801-21804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and regulates collagen cross-linking (40Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), the decrease in decorin could promote disorganization of collagen and a loosening of ECM. One of the key potential defenses of cells against excess deformation is secretion of proteoglycans. Proteoglycans, through negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains, can serve as molecular sponges that cushion against mechanical forces. The increase of versican-hyaluronan complexes shown in this study may provide a matrix environment that thickens intima and protects the cell against mechanical stimuli. This is consistent with the response of chondrocytes to deformation; chondrocytes increase aggregation of the large proteoglycan aggrecan to hyaluronan following deformation, which provides a highly hydrated mechanical environment around the cell (41Buschmann M.D. Kim Y.J. Wong M. Frank E. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which strain differentially regulates vascular proteoglycan synthesis are unclear. Our studies indicate that although remarkably few genes are induced by biomechanical stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, these responses are reproducible in different cell sources (15Feng Y. Yang J.H. Huang H. Kennedy S.P. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F. Libby P. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mechanical signals activate many different signal transduction pathways, but currently no single transcriptional regulatory element or combination of elements can explain cell-specific mechanical responses. Among the relatively restricted subset of genes induced by the small biomechanical stimulus of 4% biaxial strain is TSG6. This hyaluronan-linking protein is primarily known as a pro-inflammatory response gene that is induced by cytokines, but it is intensely overexpressed in mechanically injured arteries (42Ye L. Mora R. Akhayani N. Haudenschild C.C. Liau G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The impact of mechanical strain on hyaluronan synthesis will need to be explored to address the hypothesis that increased aggregation may be because of increased hyaluronan synthesis. In some circumstances, excess accumulation of vascular proteoglycans may be detrimental. Williams and Tabas proposed that retention of atherogenic lipoproteins in the artery is a central process in atherogenesis, a hypothesis known as the Response-to-Retention hypothesis (43Williams K.J. Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans may serve as the reservoir for arterial lipoproteins through a specific association with the apo-B100 protein; a single point mutation in the apo-B100 protein inhibits binding to proteoglycans without affecting low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding (44Boren J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T.N. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that biglycan colocalizes with apo-B in the atherosclerotic intima, and both versican and biglycan can bind LDL (45Riessen R. Isner J.M. Blessing E. Loushin C. Nikol S. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 962-974PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whereas accumulation of proteoglycans may contribute to mechanical properties of the artery, it may also provide a subendothelial retention reservoir for lipoproteins. In this study, we demonstrate that biomechanical strain selectively up-regulates expression of biglycan and versican, two vascular proteoglycans that can serve as LDL binding reservoirs. Thus, enhanced proteoglycan synthesis may serves as an initial defense against mechanical stress that can nonetheless prove deleterious as LDL infiltrates the vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W2066505046,"Ras proteins are key regulators of cell growth and differentiation. Mammalian cells express three closely related Ras proteins: Ha-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras. We have compared the abilities of the Ha-Ras and K-Ras isoforms to activate the Rac effector pathway, using three Rac-dependent readouts: induction of membrane ruffling and pinocytosis, stimulation of cell motility, and Pak binding. The total surface area of membrane ruffles induced by K-RasV12 was 2-fold greater than that induced by Ha-RasV12. Likewise, the number of K-RasV12-induced pinocytic vesicles per cell was ∼2-fold greater than that induced by Ha-RasV12. In a wound healing assay, K-RasV12-injected cells migrated twice as fast as Ha-RasV12-injected cells. Moreover, the Pak binding activity of Rac, which is indicative of the amount of GTP-bound Rac, was higher in K-RasV12-expressing cells than Ha-RasV12-expressing cells. These results suggest that K-Ras activates Rac more efficiently than Ha-Ras. The preferential activation of Rac by K-Ras is dependent on the mode of membrane anchoring and impacts on the ability of K-Ras to regulate cell survival.

The mammalian genome contains three ras genes that encode highly related proteins of either 188 or 189 amino acids: Ha-Ras, N-Ras, K4A-Ras, and K4B-Ras (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). The first 86 amino acids of Ras proteins are 100% identical, and the next 80 amino acids exhibit 85% homology between any pair of Ras proteins. The remaining C-terminal sequence consisting of residues 166–185, known as the hypervariable domain, is highly divergent with the exception of the last four amino acids (the CAAX motif), which are required for post-translational processing and plasma membrane association (2Hancock J.F. Peterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitously expressed, the three Ras isoforms have been postulated to perform distinct biological functions. This notion is supported by the finding that K-Ras but not Ha-Ras or N-Ras is essential for normal mouse development (3Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 4Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutationally activated forms of the three ras genes are selectively expressed in different human tumors. For example, K-Ras mutations occur in 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, whereas in acute myeloid leukemia over 25% of mutations detected involve N-Ras (5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of Ras proteins are exerted through the activation of several downstream effectors including the Ser/Thr kinase Raf, the p110 catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),1 and Ral GDS, an exchange factor for Ral GTPases (6Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The interaction of Ras with its effectors is mediated by the effector binding loop, which spans residues 32–40. Despite the fact that the amino acid sequence corresponding to the effector binding loop is identical among Ras proteins, recent studies have demonstrated that the three Ras isoforms can differentially activate Raf-1 and PI3K. K-Ras activates Raf-1 more effectively than Ha-Ras and N-Ras (7Voice J.K. Klemke R.L. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17164-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 8Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ha-Ras is a more potent activator of PI3K than K-Ras (8Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These hierarchies appear to result, at least in part, from differences in the mechanisms of membrane attachment of the three Ras isoforms (8Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, their physiological significance remains to be determined. Through genetic and biochemical studies it has been established that the growth promoting activity of Ras proteins is dependent on the synergistic activation of multiple effector pathways (9Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 10Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to the present work are the observations that the activation of a pathway that engages the small GTPase Rac is critical for both the mitogenic and oncogenic effects of Ras (11Joneson T. White M. Wigler M. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 12Qui R. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Rac itself controls at least three effector pathways leading to transcriptional activation, rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, and the generation of superoxide (13VanAelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Of these, the effector functions involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and production of superoxide are necessary components of the mitogenic response (14Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Barbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A.

Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rac plays an essential role in providing protection against apoptosis induced by high intensity Ras signaling (17Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to determine whether the Ha-Ras and K-Ras isoforms differ with respect to their ability to activate the Rac pathway. We demonstrate that K-Ras is a more potent activator of Rac relative to Ha-Ras. Our findings indicate that the efficiency of Rac activation is dictated by the mode of membrane anchoring of Ras and impacts on the ability of Ras to regulate cell survival. All Ras constructs were generated by subcloning the human cDNAs into the mammalian expression vector pCGT, which is derived from pCGN with a replacement of the HA epitope with the T7 epitope (18Walsh A.B. Dhanasekaran M. Bar-Sagi D. Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Ha-RasV121–164/K-RasV12 cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase. The primers used are as follows: Ha-RasV12, 5′-CAATCTAGAATGACGGAATATAAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTGAGCCTGCCGAGATTC-3′; K-Ras V12, 5′-CAGGCTCAGGACTTAGC-3′ and 5′-GATGGATCCTTACATAATTACACA-3′. The final polymerase chain reaction product was digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI andXbaI and ligated into pCGT. The expression plasmids encoding T7 epitope-tagged RacV12 and RacWT were kindly provided by Linda VanAelst (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The expression plasmid encoding HA epitope-tagged ERK2 has been previously described (11Joneson T. White M. Wigler M. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Myr-HRasV12S186 expression plasmid was kindly provided by J. Gibbs (Merck). REF-52 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator with 6.3% CO2 at 37 °C. COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections using a calcium phosphate method were performed as described previously (19Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was diluted in Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7) containing 2 m CaCl2 and added to HEPES/Na2HPO4 buffer. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to the addition to the cells. After 12–16 h the cells were washed with DMEM and fed with DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to harvesting. REF-52 cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm okadaic acid, 10 mmbenzamidine). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g and then incubated with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) for 2 h. The immune complexes were captured by incubation with protein A beads for 45 min. The immune complexes were washed twice in cold lysis buffer and subsequently washed twice in cold kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmsodium vanadate, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 20 μm ATP). The ERK2 kinase reaction was performed by incubating the immune complexes with 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 6000 Ci/mmol) in kinase reaction buffer. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were washed twice with cold PBS supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 and lysed in (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1% aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm benzamidine). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. Aliquots from the supernatant were taken to compare protein amounts. The lysates were incubated with either GST alone or GST-PBD (p21-binding domain) fusion protein bound to glutathione-coupled to Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads and the proteins bound to the fusion protein were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, and the eluted bound Rac proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal mouse antibody against Rac1. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated with either anti-T7 monoclonal (Novagen, 1:10,000), anti-Rac1 monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000), or anti-HA 12CA5 (1:5,000) primary antibodies and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, 1:20,000). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and densitometry scanning was performed using Image Pro Plus computer software. For microinjection experiments, REF-52 cells were plated on gridded glass coverslips, grown to confluency, and serum-starved for 24 h. 50 ng/μl of Ha-RasV12, K-RasV12, or Ha-RasV121–164/K-Ras expression plasmids, each resuspended in microinjection buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl and 5 mmNaH2PO4), were injected into the nucleus of cells located on selected grids of the coverslip. The membrane ruffles were scored 4 h after injection by the appearance of transient phase dense bands traversing across the upper surface of the cell. To quantify membrane ruffling, the surface area of the membrane ruffles was measured by autotracing the membrane ruffles based on pixel density using Metamorph computer software. The average surface area per injected cell was then normalized to the total area of the injected cells. Fluid phase pinocytic vesicles were scored as phase bright vesicles and counted 6 h after injection. The membrane ruffles and pinocytic vesicles were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert Fluorescence microscope. The diameter of the pinocytic vesicles was measured using Image Pro Plus computer software. For immunofluorescence, the injected cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature. Anti-T7 (1:400) or Y13–259 (1:200) primary antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The cells were washed three times with PBS and subsequently incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (Cappel, 1:100). The coverslips were mounted with 5 μl of 2%p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) dissolved in 200 μl of Immu-mount (Shandon). The cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert Fluorescence microscope. REF-52 cells were plated on gridded glass coverslips, grown to confluency, and serum-starved for 24 h. A wound diameter between 140 and 180 μm was introduced into a confluent monolayer of quiescent REF-52 cells with a pair of extra fine microforceps. Immediately following the introduction of the wound, the cells aligning the edges of the wound, and the adjacent row of cells were injected with 50 ng/μl of Ha-RasV12 or K-RasV12 expression plasmids. The wound width was measured at the time of wounding and 6 h after injection. A mean wound width was calculated for each time point by measuring the diameter of the wound every 60 μm over the length of the wound for ∼400–500 μm. The expression of the protein in the injected cells was verified by indirect immunofluorescence. The detection of apoptotic cells using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin V was performed as described previously (17Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 h after the microinjection of Ha-RasV12, K-RasV12, and Ha-Ras1–164/K-Ras expression plasmids (50 ng/μl), the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in a buffer containing FITC-annexin V (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. The FITC-annexin V positive cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Among the earliest cellular responses to Ras activation is the induction of membrane ruffling (20Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of Ha-Ras and K-Ras on membrane ruffling, quiescent REF-52 cells were microinjected with T7-tagged Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 4B (hereafter referred to as K-RasV12) expression plasmids. 4 h after injection, the cells were analyzed by time lapse video microscopy. Membrane ruffles were readily detected by the appearance of phase dense bands at the cell periphery or the dorsal surface of the cell (Fig.1 A, arrowheads). Membrane ruffles induced by Ha-RasV12 occurred predominantly along the cell periphery and had a long wavelike appearance. K-RasV12 induced elaborate and highly convoluted membrane ruffles at multiple sites both on the dorsal surface and the periphery of the cell. In addition to the distinct morphological differences, the membrane ruffles induced by the two Ras isoforms displayed different kinetic behavior. The K-RasV12-induced membrane ruffles were highly dynamic as indicated by the pronounced changes in ruffle appearance over a 120-s interval (Fig.1 A). In comparison, the Ha-RasV12-induced membrane ruffles remained mostly unchanged over a 120-s interval. Furthermore, based on the sampling of 10 cells, the average surface area of the K-RasV12-induced membrane ruffles was ∼2-fold greater than the Ha-RasV12 membrane ruffle surface area (Fig. 1 B). The Ras isoforms were expressed to similar levels and displayed an identical cellular distribution as determined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, the distinct ruffling patterns displayed by Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 were retained at higher concentrations of expression plasmid and occurred irrespective of cell density (data not shown). Because Ras-induced membrane ruffling is mediated by Rac (21Ridley A. Paterson H. Johnson C. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), the differences in the membrane ruffling activity of the Ras isoforms suggest that Ha-Ras and K-Ras are differentially coupled to the Rac pathway. Ras-induced membrane ruffling is accompanied by the stimulation of fluid phase pinocytosis (20Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Pinosomes are derived from membrane ruffles that close to form intracellular vesicles. They form at the cell margins and subsequently move inwardly toward the perinuclear region of the cell. Because the membrane ruffles induced by each of the Ras isoforms had a unique pattern, we hypothesized that there would be isoform-dependent differences in the stimulation of fluid phase pinocytosis. To test this hypothesis, quiescent REF-52 cells were microinjected with T7-tagged expression plasmids and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy at 6 h after injection. The pinocytic vesicles can be readily identified under these conditions by their refractile appearance (Fig. 2 B), and we have established previously that they correspond to pinosomes (20Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The number of K-RasV12-induced pinocytic vesicles per cell was ∼2-fold greater than that induced by Ha-RasV12 (Fig. 2, A andB). Moreover, the average size of pinocytic vesicles formed in the K-RasV12-injected cells was twice as large when compared with Ha-RasV12-injected cells (Fig. 2 C). As has been shown for Ha-RasV12 (21Ridley A. Paterson H. Johnson C. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), the stimulation of membrane ruffling and pinocytosis by K-RasV12 was blocked by the co-injection of dominant negative Rac, RacN17 (data not shown). Membrane ruffling is a critical event both in cell spreading and migration (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 on cell motility using a wound healing assay. A 140–180-μm scratch was introduced into a monolayer of quiescent REF-52 cells, and the cells aligning the edges of the wound were injected with T7-tagged Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12. The K-RasV12 injected cells migrated at a rate of 18 μm/h (± 1.5), whereas the Ha-RasV12 injected cells migrated at a rate of 12 μm/h (± 1.2) (Fig.3). The enhanced motility induced by K-RasV12 together with the more potent effects of this isoform on membrane ruffling and pinocytosis suggests that K-Ras might be a more effective activator of the Rac pathway compared with Ha-Ras. To directly compare the abilities of Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 to activate Rac, we have used a Pak binding assay (23Sander E.E. Delft S.v. Klooster J.P. t. Reid T. Kammen R.A. v. d. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with T7 epitope-tagged RacWT and Ha-RasV12 or K-RasV12 expression plasmids. Following 24 h of serum starvation, cells were lysed, and the lysates were incubated with the GTPase binding domain (CRIB domain) of the kinase Pak, a downstream effector of Rac, fused to GST. This domain has been found to specifically bind to the activated GTP-bound form of Rac (24Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins bound to the fusion protein GST-PBD were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), the binding of Rac-GTP to GST-PBD was ∼2-fold higher in the presence of K-RasV12 than Ha-RasV12, which is consistent with K-Ras being a stronger activator of Rac. It is important to note that the differential effects of Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 on membrane ruffling displayed by REF-52 cells were also observed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4 C). The attachment of Ras to the membrane is dependent on specific modifications of the C terminus. The CAAX motifs of Ha-Ras and K-Ras undergo the same post-translational modifications involving farnesylation, proteolytic cleavage, and carboxyl methylation (25Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hypervariable region preceding the CAAX motif is processed differently between Ha-Ras and K-Ras. Ha-Ras becomes palmitoylated on cysteine residues within the hypervariable region, whereas K-Ras lacks these cysteine residues but contains a polybasic domain that is required for effective membrane association (2Hancock J.F. Peterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). To test whether these differences could account for the differential activation of the Rac pathway, a chimeric Ras protein was constructed containing the first 164 amino acids of Ha-RasV12 and the last 25 amino acids of K-RasV12 (Ha-Ras1–164/K-Ras). The chimeric protein showed the same subcellular distribution as Ha-RasV12 following injection into quiescent REF-52 cells (Fig.5 A). Significantly, the membrane ruffling phenotype of the Ha-Ras1–164/K-Ras protein resembled closely the phenotype induced by K-RasV12 including an enhanced accumulation of pinocytic vesicles (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that the membrane attachment mechanisms can impact the efficiency of Ras-dependent activation of the Rac pathway. To further test this idea, we compared the signaling activities of Ha-RasV12 and Myr-HRasV12S186, which contains a mutation in the farnesylation site and a myristoylation signal on the N terminus, enabling the protein to be anchored to the membrane via the N terminus. Myr-HRasV12S186 and Ha-RasV12 had a similar subcellular distribution and activated the ERK kinase cascade to a similar level (Fig.5 B). However, Myr-HRasV12S186 failed to induce membrane ruffling when microinjected into quiescent REF-52 cells, indicating that activation of the Rac pathway is uniquely sensitive to the positioning of Ras in the membrane. We have recently shown that Rac-mediated signals are essential for protection against Ha-RasV12-induced apoptosis (17Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Ha-RasV12 promotes apoptosis, and this response is blocked by the concurrent expression of dominant active RacV12 and potentiated by the co-expression of dominant negative RacN17. If Ha-Ras and K-Ras differentially activate the Rac pathway, then they might be expected to differ in their ability to induce apoptosis. To test this prediction, quiescent REF-52 cells were microinjected with 50 ng/μl Ha-RasV12, K-RasV12, and Ha-Ras1–164/K-Ras expression plasmids, and apoptosis was visualized by the appearance of rounded cells after 16 h (Fig. 6 A). To quantitate the apoptotic effect, the number of cells stained with FITC-annexin V, an apoptosis marker, was determined in each injected area. In agreement with our earlier observations, microinjection of Ha-RasV12 induced apoptosis in 38% (± 4.5) of the cells (Fig.6 B). In contrast, microinjection of K-RasV12 had no apparent effect on cell viability (Fig. 6). Thus, the differential effects of Ha-RasV12 and K-RasV12 on apoptosis correlate well with the differences in their ability to activate Rac. Furthermore, it appears that the capacity to exert these effects is influenced by the mode of anchoring of Ras to the plasma membrane because similarly to K-RasV12, the chimeric Ha-Ras protein Ha-Ras1–164/K-Ras had also no observable effect on cell viability (Fig. 6 B). It is well established that the signaling activities of Ras are mediated by multiple effector pathways. In the present study we have demonstrated that the activation of the Rac effector pathway is differentially regulated by Ha-Ras and K-Ras. A primary determinant in conferring this difference is the hypervariable region located in the C-terminal portion of Ras proteins. Because this region specifies the membrane targeting of Ras, the distinct properties of Ha-Ras and K-Ras with respect to Rac activation most likely reflect variations in their membrane anchoring mechanisms. Several lines of evidence support the notion that Ha-Ras and K-Ras are localized to distinct membrane domains. First, Ha-Ras traffics to the plasma membrane via the endomembrane system, whereas K-Ras appears to reach the plasma membrane through a different transport pathway (26Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar,27Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feokitistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Second, interfering with the function of caveolin, an integral membrane protein that binds cholesterol (28Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar) impairs Ha-Ras but not K-Ras-dependent signaling, indicating that Ha-Ras is selectively localized to cholesterol-rich membrane domains (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Third, K-Ras but not Ha-Ras binds to tubulin, and this association is critical for the plasma membrane targeting of K-Ras (30Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is possible to envisage at least two mechanisms by which the site of anchoring of Ras to the membrane might influence effector interactions. Ras effectors or their co-activators could themselves be localized to distinct subdomains within the plasma membrane. Indeed, a number of signaling molecules involved in Ras signaling, including the Ras target Raf, have been shown to be preferentially localized to specialized cholesterol-rich microdomains also known as caveolea (31Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer E.P. Lisanti P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the spatial availability of effector molecules could account for the unique signaling properties of Ha-Ras and K-Ras. Alternatively, the efficiency of interaction with effector molecules might be influenced by the mode of anchoring to the plasma membrane. The association of Ha-Ras with the membrane is mediated by a farnesyl/palmitoyl anchor, whereas K-Ras uses farnesylation and a polybasic domain to bind to the plasma membrane (32Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Palmitate contributes to membrane interactions by virtue of its ability to insert deep into the lipid bilayer, whereas the polybasic domain facilitates membrane association through ionic interactions with negatively charged phospholipid head groups (33Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Structure. 1997; 5: 985-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These differences could influence the positioning of each Ras isoform at the inner face of the plasma membrane, thereby affecting accessibility to effector molecules. The lack of a detailed understanding of the effector pathways that couple Ras to Rac makes it difficult to investigate the mechanistic basis for the differential activation of Rac by Ha-Ras and K-Ras. Like all GTP-binding proteins, the activation of Rac is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote the exchange of GTP for GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rac belong to the Dbl family of proteins, all members of which contain the tandem arrangement of a PH domain adjacent to the catalytic Dbl homology domain (35Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In certain cases, the PH domains have been shown to regulate the targeting of Dbl homology domains to the appropriate subcellular location (36Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. Kammen R.A. v. d. Stalle L.R.-V. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 37Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the determinants that specify the targeting properties of PH domains are not well defined, it has been proposed that, depending on their lipid binding properties, different PH domains could be recruited to different membrane domains (38Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 39Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 40Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hence, activators of Rac might be differentially accessible to Ha-Ras and K-Ras. PI3K has been implicated in the regulation of Rac activation by Ras (41Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 42Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). At least one mechanism by which this might occur involves the generation of lipid mediators that modulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the Dbl homology domain containing proteins Vav and Sos (41Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 43Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Ha-Ras is a more potent activator of PI3K than K-RasV12 (8Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, we have shown K-Ras to be a more effective activator of Rac than Ha-RasV12, suggesting the existence of other coupling mechanisms linking Ras to the Rac cascade. In addition, it is important to note that mammalian cells express three isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110 α, β, or δ (44Braselmann S. Palmer T.M. Cook S.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 470-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been recently shown that each isoform has distinct signaling properties in the context of receptor-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (45Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, differential interactions of Ha-Ras and K-Ras with p110 isoforms could contribute to functional specificity. A biochemical assay for isoform-specific activation of PI3K by Ras will be required to test this hypothesis. Ras proteins play a role in regulating the turnover of focal adhesions and are essential for cell movement (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). In agreement with an earlier report (7Voice J.K. Klemke R.L. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17164-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we have found that K-Ras is more effective in stimulating cell motility compared with Ha-Ras. This difference is most likely a consequence of the preferential activation of Rac by K-Ras because the movement of cells requires the coordinated assembly and disassembly of stress fibers (46Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). In colon epithelial cells K-Ras but not Ha-Ras disrupts basolateral polarity by altering the expression of several intercellular adhesion proteins including β1 integrin andN-cadherin (47Yan Z. Deng X. Chen M. Xu Y. Ahram M. Sloane B.F. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27902-27907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The preferential ability of K-Ras to induce loss of cell-to-cell and cell-to-substratum adherence and to stimulate cell motility could account for the highly invasive and metastatic phenotype of K-Ras-derived tumor cells (48Finkelstein S.D. Sayegh R. Bakker A. Swalsky P. Arch. Surg. 1993; 128: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 49Suchy B. Zietz C. Rabes H.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The frequency of K-Ras mutations in human malignancies is considerably higher compared with Ha-Ras (5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that K-Ras displays a reduced capacity to induce apoptosis presumably because of its ability to activate more efficiently the anti-apoptotic cascade. The capacity of oncogenes to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest is thought to represent safeguard mechanisms to limit the growth of tumor cells. Thus, the compromised ability of K-Ras to induce apoptosis might explain, at least in part, the selective growth advantage of tumor cells harboring K-Ras mutations. All Ras effectors interact with a common and highly conserved region within Ras known as the effector binding loop. Our observation that myristoylated Ha-Ras retains the ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase but has lost the ability to activate Rac raises the possibility that each effector interaction might be uniquely regulated by the mode of attachment of Ras to the membrane. This is supported by a recent study suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Ras influences effector interaction (50Booden M.A. Sakaguchi D.S. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23559-23568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This adds another level of complexity to the regulation of Ras signaling, which along with the multiplicity of effector pathways and their cross-interactions enable the finely tuned control of cellular events that mediate cell growth and differentiation. We thank Tom Joneson for help with the mitogen-activated protein kinase and apoptosis assays and Brian E. Hall, Anjaruwee S. Nimnual and Laura J. Taylor for helpful discussions."

AR belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, whose members regulate ligand-dependent gene transcription (2Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev.

The AR and other receptors in this family possess identifiable activation domains that confer transactivation potential when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain. However, an important feature of the AR and other nuclear receptors that distinguish them from other transcription factors is that they are activated by their ligand binding domains (LBD). The unbound AR forms a complex with heat-shock proteins (HSPs) (4Sanchez E.R. Faber L.E. Henzel W.J. Pratt W.B.

Like other PAKs, PAK6 contains a putative amino-terminal CRIB domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. PAK6 is highly expressed in testis and prostate tissues. Protein-protein interaction between AR and PAK6 was further demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.Significantly, PAK6 can cotranslocate to nuclei with AR in a ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, cotransfection of PAK6 with AR was shown to specifically repress AR-mediated transcription. These results reveal a novel function for PAK proteins and suggest a unique mechanism by which other signal transduction pathways, such as the small GTPases, may impact AR-mediated transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a new p21-activated kinase, PAK6, and demonstrated a specific interaction between PAK6 and AR. These findings link PAK-mediated signaling to the steroid hormone receptor pathway, suggesting a novel function for this new PAK member. Many AR-interacting proteins have been identified thus far, and in general they are transcription factors that play direct roles in regulating transcription. The identification of PAK6, a protein kinase, as an AR-interacting protein is therefore quite interesting and novel. Consequently, we have spent a considerable amount of effort to prove that the interaction between PAK6 and AR is a truly physiological protein-protein interaction. We showed that the LBD of AR is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with PAK6 in an androgen-dependent manner in the yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that conformational changes in the LBD of AR upon binding to ligand are necessary for PAK6 to bind to AR protein. The interaction was further confirmed in vivo in mammalian cells. In the coimmunprecipitation experiments, the AR protein specifically interacted with Flag-tagged PAK6. The interaction between AR and PAK6 proteins was also observed in the mammalian one-hybrid experiment, in which PAK6 interacted with AR in the active AR-ARE transcription complex. In both cases, androgen was absolutely required for the interaction. Finally, we demonstrated a dynamic interaction between AR and PAK6 in the immunofluorescence studies. As shown in Fig. 7, PAK6 cotranslocates into nuclei with AR in response to androgen induction. Taken together, the data clearly indicate that the interaction between AR and PAK6 is biologically significant.To search for the biological consequences of the interaction between PAK6 and AR, we tested whether PAK6 was able to directly alter AR-mediated transcription. In transient transfection experiments, we showed that PAK6 inhibited ligand-dependent, AR-mediated transactivation. Importantly, PAK6 was shown to have no effect on another steroid hormone receptor, the GR, under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 9). These data suggest that the specific repression of AR by PAK6 may be one of the biological consequences of their protein-protein interaction. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether PAK6 interacts with other nuclear receptors.Although both physical and functional interactions between PAK6 and AR have been demonstrated, the mechanism by which PAK6 represses AR function is unknown. Given the fact that PAK6 contains a functional carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, we examined whether PAK6 can alter AR activity by the phosphorylation of AR protein. Using recombinant AR proteins, however, we failed to detect phosphorylation of AR by PAK6 (data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that AR phosphorylation states might not significantly enhance AR transcription activity (48Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2527-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 49Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that acetylation of AR can enhance AR transactivation (50Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that the repression of AR-mediated transcription by PAK6 may not be due to an alteration of AR phosphorylation states.To determine the mechanism by which PAK6 affected transcription, we fused PAK6 cDNAs into a heterologous DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD) to test intrinsic transcriptional activity. Both full-length and truncated PAK6 containing either amino- or carboxyl-terminal fragments showed no transcriptional activity (data not shown). These data are consistent with the protein structure of PAK6, suggesting that PAK6 may not contain a transcriptional inhibitory domain or may not interfere with the recruitment of other transcription repressors. Because several AR coactivators have been shown to enhance AR-mediated transcription through a specific interaction with the LBD of AR, one possible mechanism for PAK6 repression of AR could be due to direct competition with the binding of the coactivators to AR. Supporting this hypothesis is our preliminary data showing that coexpression of the AR coactivator, ARA70, can partially alleviate the repression of AR by PAK6 (data not shown). Because the mechanism of ARA70 enhancement of AR transactivation is unclear, further analyses with other AR coactivators need to be done to understand the effect of PAK6 on AR.Although we have determined that PAK6 represses AR activity, the protein sequence and structure of PAK6 suggest that the protein may possess other biological functions comparable with other PAK members. With a human multiple tissue blot, we demonstrated that PAK6 is selectively expressed in testis and prostate. This unique tissue distribution is similar to that of PAK4 but differs from other known PAK members (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Except for PAK1 and PAK3, which have been shown to be expressed predominantly in human brain, other known PAKs appear to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The selective expression of PAK6 in testis and prostate tissues is consistent with the interaction between AR and PAK6 that we have found, which further supports the hypothesis that PAK6 plays a potential biological role in AR function. These results also raise the possibility that each PAK transduces its signal via distinct substrates.PAK proteins are the direct effectors of the Rho family of GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42. The GTPases bind to a conserved p21 binding domain, also known as CRIB, thereby stimulating their serine/threonine kinase activities by a mechanism involving autophosphorylation (28Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,51Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 403-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that PAK6 contains CRIB and kinase domains that are homologous to the other known PAKs, especially to PAK4 and PAK5. However, outside of these domains, PAK6 diverges significantly from PAKs 1–3. Based upon low sequence homology with human PAKs 1–3 and the absence of SH3 motifs, it appears that the mechanism of regulation of PAK6 activity may differ from other PAK proteins. Using GST pull-down experiments, PAK6 was shown to interact only with activated Cdc42 through its CRIB domain, but PAK6 kinase activity was not activated upon binding to Cdc42. 2Steven P. Balk (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA), personal communication. This raises the question as to whether other Rho family members specifically mediate PAK6 activity or whether PAK6 does in fact interact with members of the Rho GTPase family in vivo.Recent studies have shown that the CRIB domain of PAK1 interacts intramolecularly with its catalytic domain to inhibit the kinase activity by forming a closed and inactive configuration (52Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have shown that the full-length PAK6 has much less kinase activity than the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, suggesting that a similar auto-inhibition mechanism for kinase activity may also exist in PAK6. Thus far, all known PAKs are found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm. PAK4 was shown to translocate from the perinuclear cytoplasm to Golgi membranes with activated Cdc42 (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our finding that PAK6 cotranslocates into the nucleus with AR suggests that PAK6 may have a novel function unlike other PAKs. It will be interesting to determine whether AR affects PAK6 functions through their interaction. Further characterization of PAK6 interaction with AR should clarify these issues.In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that a novel PAK protein, PAK6, specifically interacts with AR. Most importantly, the data indicate a mechanism whereby AR pathways can cross-talk with signaling pathways of the Rho-related small GTPase family. Further studies of the regulation of AR-mediated transcription by PAK6 may provide new insight into the biology of normal prostate and prostate cancer. The effects of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR),1 which plays a critical role in inducing normal differentiation of tissues of the reproductive organs and in the development and progression of prostate cancer (1Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AR belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, whose members regulate ligand-dependent gene transcription (2Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 3Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The AR and other receptors in this family possess identifiable activation domains that confer transactivation potential when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain. However, an important feature of the AR and other nuclear receptors that distinguish them from other transcription factors is that they are activated by their ligand binding domains (LBD). The unbound AR forms a complex with heat-shock proteins (HSPs) (4Sanchez E.R. Faber L.E. Henzel W.J. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5145-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Sullivan W.P. Vroman B.T. Bauer V.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Upon binding to ligand, the AR dissociates from the HSPs and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to the androgen response element (ARE) and recruits cofactors to regulate transcription (6Jenster G.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel AR-interacting protein, provisionally termed PAK6, which shares a high degree of sequence similarity with PAK family members. Like other PAKs, PAK6 contains a putative amino-terminal CRIB domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. PAK6 is highly expressed in testis and prostate tissues. Protein-protein interaction between AR and PAK6 was further demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.Significantly, PAK6 can cotranslocate to nuclei with AR in a ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, cotransfection of PAK6 with AR was shown to specifically repress AR-mediated transcription. These results reveal a novel function for PAK proteins and suggest a unique mechanism by which other signal transduction pathways, such as the small GTPases, may impact AR-mediated transcription. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a new p21-activated kinase, PAK6, and demonstrated a specific interaction between PAK6 and AR. These findings link PAK-mediated signaling to the steroid hormone receptor pathway, suggesting a novel function for this new PAK member. Many AR-interacting proteins have been identified thus far, and in general they are transcription factors that play direct roles in regulating transcription. The identification of PAK6, a protein kinase, as an AR-interacting protein is therefore quite interesting and novel. Consequently, we have spent a considerable amount of effort to prove that the interaction between PAK6 and AR is a truly physiological protein-protein interaction. We showed that the LBD of AR is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with PAK6 in an androgen-dependent manner in the yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that conformational changes in the LBD of AR upon binding to ligand are necessary for PAK6 to bind to AR protein. The interaction was further confirmed in vivo in mammalian cells. In the coimmunprecipitation experiments, the AR protein specifically interacted with Flag-tagged PAK6. The interaction between AR and PAK6 proteins was also observed in the mammalian one-hybrid experiment, in which PAK6 interacted with AR in the active AR-ARE transcription complex. In both cases, androgen was absolutely required for the interaction. Finally, we demonstrated a dynamic interaction between AR and PAK6 in the immunofluorescence studies. As shown in Fig. 7, PAK6 cotranslocates into nuclei with AR in response to androgen induction. Taken together, the data clearly indicate that the interaction between AR and PAK6 is biologically significant.To search for the biological consequences of the interaction between PAK6 and AR, we tested whether PAK6 was able to directly alter AR-mediated transcription. In transient transfection experiments, we showed that PAK6 inhibited ligand-dependent, AR-mediated transactivation. Importantly, PAK6 was shown to have no effect on another steroid hormone receptor, the GR, under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 9). These data suggest that the specific repression of AR by PAK6 may be one of the biological consequences of their protein-protein interaction. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether PAK6 interacts with other nuclear receptors.Although both physical and functional interactions between PAK6 and AR have been demonstrated, the mechanism by which PAK6 represses AR function is unknown. Given the fact that PAK6 contains a functional carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, we examined whether PAK6 can alter AR activity by the phosphorylation of AR protein. Using recombinant AR proteins, however, we failed to detect phosphorylation of AR by PAK6 (data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that AR phosphorylation states might not significantly enhance AR transcription activity (48Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2527-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 49Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that acetylation of AR can enhance AR transactivation (50Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that the repression of AR-mediated transcription by PAK6 may not be due to an alteration of AR phosphorylation states.To determine the mechanism by which PAK6 affected transcription, we fused PAK6 cDNAs into a heterologous DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD) to test intrinsic transcriptional activity. Both full-length and truncated PAK6 containing either amino- or carboxyl-terminal fragments showed no transcriptional activity (data not shown). These data are consistent with the protein structure of PAK6, suggesting that PAK6 may not contain a transcriptional inhibitory domain or may not interfere with the recruitment of other transcription repressors. Because several AR coactivators have been shown to enhance AR-mediated transcription through a specific interaction with the LBD of AR, one possible mechanism for PAK6 repression of AR could be due to direct competition with the binding of the coactivators to AR. Supporting this hypothesis is our preliminary data showing that coexpression of the AR coactivator, ARA70, can partially alleviate the repression of AR by PAK6 (data not shown). Because the mechanism of ARA70 enhancement of AR transactivation is unclear, further analyses with other AR coactivators need to be done to understand the effect of PAK6 on AR.Although we have determined that PAK6 represses AR activity, the protein sequence and structure of PAK6 suggest that the protein may possess other biological functions comparable with other PAK members. With a human multiple tissue blot, we demonstrated that PAK6 is selectively expressed in testis and prostate. This unique tissue distribution is similar to that of PAK4 but differs from other known PAK members (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Except for PAK1 and PAK3, which have been shown to be expressed predominantly in human brain, other known PAKs appear to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The selective expression of PAK6 in testis and prostate tissues is consistent with the interaction between AR and PAK6 that we have found, which further supports the hypothesis that PAK6 plays a potential biological role in AR function. These results also raise the possibility that each PAK transduces its signal via distinct substrates.PAK proteins are the direct effectors of the Rho family of GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42. The GTPases bind to a conserved p21 binding domain, also known as CRIB, thereby stimulating their serine/threonine kinase activities by a mechanism involving autophosphorylation (28Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,51Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 403-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that PAK6 contains CRIB and kinase domains that are homologous to the other known PAKs, especially to PAK4 and PAK5. However, outside of these domains, PAK6 diverges significantly from PAKs 1–3. Based upon low sequence homology with human PAKs 1–3 and the absence of SH3 motifs, it appears that the mechanism of regulation of PAK6 activity may differ from other PAK proteins. Using GST pull-down experiments, PAK6 was shown to interact only with activated Cdc42 through its CRIB domain, but PAK6 kinase activity was not activated upon binding to Cdc42. 2Steven P. Balk (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA), personal communication. This raises the question as to whether other Rho family members specifically mediate PAK6 activity or whether PAK6 does in fact interact with members of the Rho GTPase family in vivo.Recent studies have shown that the CRIB domain of PAK1 interacts intramolecularly with its catalytic domain to inhibit the kinase activity by forming a closed and inactive configuration (52Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have shown that the full-length PAK6 has much less kinase activity than the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, suggesting that a similar auto-inhibition mechanism for kinase activity may also exist in PAK6. Thus far, all known PAKs are found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm. PAK4 was shown to translocate from the perinuclear cytoplasm to Golgi membranes with activated Cdc42 (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our finding that PAK6 cotranslocates into the nucleus with AR suggests that PAK6 may have a novel function unlike other PAKs. It will be interesting to determine whether AR affects PAK6 functions through their interaction. Further characterization of PAK6 interaction with AR should clarify these issues.In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that a novel PAK protein, PAK6, specifically interacts with AR. Most importantly, the data indicate a mechanism whereby AR pathways can cross-talk with signaling pathways of the Rho-related small GTPase family. Further studies of the regulation of AR-mediated transcription by PAK6 may provide new insight into the biology of normal prostate and prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2083153124,"Epsilon toxin is a potent toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens types B and D, which are responsible for a rapidly fatal enterotoxemia in animals. One of the main properties of epsilon toxin is the production of edema. We have previously found that epsilon toxin causes a rapid swelling of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and that the toxin does not enter the cytosol and remains associated with the cell membrane by forming a large complex (Petit, L., Gibert, M., Gillet, D., Laurent-Winter, C., Boquet, P., and Popoff, M. R. (1997) J. Bacteriol. 179, 6480–6487). Here, we report that epsilon toxin induced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells a rapid decrease of intracellular K+, and an increase of Cl− and Na+, whereas the increase of Ca2+ occurred later. The entry of propidium iodide that was correlated with the loss of cell viability monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test indicates that epsilon toxin formed large pores. In artificial lipid bilayers, epsilon toxin caused current steps with a single-channel conductance of 60 pS in 100 mm KCl, which represented general diffusion pores. The channels were slightly selective for anions, but cations could also penetrate. Epsilon toxin formed wide and water-filled channels permeable to hydrophilic solutes up to a molecular mass of at least 1 kDa, which probably represents the basic mechanism of toxin action on target cells.

This toxin is the main virulence factor of C. perfringens type D, which is responsible for enterotoxemia in sheep, goat, and more rarely in cattle. Enterotoxemia is a rapidly fatal disease that causes important economical losses through the world. Overgrowth of C. perfringens type D in the intestine of susceptible animals is accompanied by the release of large amounts of epsilon toxin, which is absorbed through the intestinal mucosa and diffuses to all the organs by the blood circulation. The main biological activity of epsilon toxin is the production of edema. In experimental animals, epsilon toxin elevates the blood pressure, increases the vascular permeability, and causes edema and congestion in various organs including lungs and kidneys. Necrosis of the kidneys is also observed in lambs that have died from enterotoxemia (1Nagahama M. Lida H. Sakurai J. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 37: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Sakurai J. Nagahama M. Fujii Y. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epsilon toxin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain (3Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1237-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The terminal phase of enterotoxemia is characterized by neurological disorders (opisthotonus, convulsions, and agonal struggling). Epsilon toxin increases the permeability of the brain vasculature and causes perivascular edema, which is probably responsible for neuronal damage and neurological disorders (5Payne D. Williamson E.D. Titball R.W. Rev. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 8: S28-S30Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Finnie J.W. Blumbergs P.C. Manavis J. J. Comp. Pathol. 1999; 120: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, epsilon toxin could directly interact with hippocampus neurons leading to an excessive release of glutamate (7Miyamoto O. Minami J. Toyoshima T. Nakamura T. Masada T. Nagao S. Negi T.

Lett. 2000; 189: 109-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epsilon toxin is secreted as a non-toxic precursor that is activated by λ protease produced by C. perfringens or by digestive proteases such as trypsin and α-chymotrypsin. The proteolytic activation is achieved by removal of 11–13 N-terminal and 22–29 C-terminal amino acids depending of the protease (9Minami J. Katayama S. Matsushita O. Matsushita C. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For example, trypsin releases 13 N-terminal and 22 C-terminal amino acids, andC. perfringens λ protease removes 11 N-terminal and 29 C-terminal amino acids (9Minami J. Katayama S. Matsushita O. Matsushita C. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This induces a significant change of the isoelectric points (8.3 for the prototoxin and 5.4 for the activated toxin) (10Hunter S.E. Clarke I.N. Kelly D.C. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epsilon toxin is cytotoxic for MDCK1 cells and at a lesser extent for the human leiomyoblastoma (G-402) cells (11Lindsay C.D. Hambrook J.L. Upshall D.G. Toxicol. In Vitro. 1995; 9: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Payne D.W. Williamson E.D. Havard H. Modi N. Brown J. FEMS Microbiol.

We have previously found that epsilon toxin induces swelling, blebbing, and lysis of MDCK cells and that the toxin does not enter the cytosol and remains associated with the MDCK cell membrane by forming a large complex (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity was correlated with the formation of a large membrane complex and an efflux of K+ (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Nagahama M. Ochi S. Sakurai J. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, epsilon toxin causes a rapid decrease of the transepithelial resistance of MDCK cell monolayers. 2Manuscript in preparation. Here, we report that in MDCK cells, epsilon toxin causes a rapid decrease of intracellular K+, a rapid increase of Cl− and Na+, and a slower increase of Ca2+. The entry of propidium iodide (PI) into treated cells indicates that epsilon toxin forms large membrane pores. Investigation with artificial lipid bilayers shows that epsilon toxin elicits the formation of non-selective general diffusion channels permeable to molecules up to 1 kDa. Epsilon toxin was purified as previously described (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and propidium iodide were from Sigma. The fluorescent probes CD222, sodium green, calcium green, and MQAE were from Molecular Probes. MDCK cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. For cytotoxicity and propidium assays, MDCK cells were grown to confluency in 96-well plates. The monolayers were washed once in DMEM and incubated with serial dilutions of epsilon toxin in DMEM (100-μl final volume in each well). The viability test using MTT was performed as described previously (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were grown in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum until confluence. After two washings with DMEM without serum, the cells were incubated with epsilon toxin (10−8m) in DMEM without serum (0.5 ml per well) at 37 °C in a CO2incubator. At the indicated times, the cells were washed with 25 mm MOPS (pH 7) containing 150 mm glucose (MOPS-glucose) and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (125 μl per well). Each fluorescent probe was added to 45 μl of lysed cells to a final concentration of 1 μm for CD222 (K+ assay) or 10 μm for sodium green, calcium green, and MQAE (Cl− assay). The probes were measured in a spectrofluorimeter (Fluoroskan II; Labsystems) with the following filters: excitation 380 nm and emission 475 nm for CD222, excitation 485 nm and emission 538 nm for sodium green and calcium green, and excitation 355 nm and emission 475 nm for MQAE. The fluorescence obtained by washing MDCK cells with MOPS-glucose and lysing with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 addition was considered as the 0% base line, and the fluorescence of MDCK cells incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at 37 °C in the absence of epsilon toxin and then washed with MOPS-glucose and lysed with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 was considered as an activity of 100%. The data were expressed as percents of fluorescence quench. For assay of PI entry, MDCK cells were grown on 96-well plates until confluency. PI (5 μg/ml) was added in the culture medium, together with epsilon toxin. At the indicated times, the plates were read with a spectrofluorimeter (Fluoroskan II; excitation 540 nm and emission 620 nm). The results were expressed as the percentage of fluorescence obtained by treatment with Triton X-100 (0.2%) for 30 min at 37 °C. Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed as has been described previously (16Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) from a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and asolectin (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in N-decane. The instrumentation consisted of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments connected by a small circular hole with a surface area of 0.3 to 0.5 mm2. The lipid bilayer membranes were formed by painting onto the holes solutions of the different lipids. The aqueous salt solutions (Merck) were used unbuffered and had a pH value around 6, if not indicated otherwise. Native and activated C. perfringens epsilon toxin were added from concentrated stock solutions to the aqueous phase bathing membranes in the black state. The temperature was kept at 20 °C throughout. The single-channel recordings were performed using a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with salt bridges switched in series with a voltage source and a highly sensitive current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored with a storage oscilloscope, and the reconstitution of channels in the black lipid membrane was recorded with a strip chart recorder. Zero-current membrane potential measurements were performed by establishing a salt gradient across membranes containing 100 to 1000 epsilon toxin channels as they have been described earlier (17Benz R. Janko K. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that epsilon toxin causes a rapid swelling of MDCK cells and a subsequent loss of viability as monitored by the MTT test (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because epsilon toxin interacts with the cell membrane and has apparently no intracellular activity, its mechanism of action could consist in pore formation, as it is the case for many hemolysins. An increase of the membrane permeability for K+ has been evidenced in MDCK cells damaged by epsilon toxin (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Nagahama M. Ochi S. Sakurai J. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). To define more precisely the membrane permeability changes during the intoxication process of epsilon toxin, we analyzed the kinetics of intracellular cations (K+, Na+, and Ca2+) and anion (Cl−) versus the cytotoxic activity determined by the MTT test. Fig. 1 shows that intracellular K+ decreased rapidly. The 50% loss of K+ was observed within the first 5 min, whereas the 50% decrease of cell viability was recorded after 30 min of incubation with 10−8m of epsilon toxin. At this time, more than 90% of intracellular K+ was lost. The intracellular concentrations of the other cations, Na+ and Ca2+, which are low in control cells, increased significantly in MDCK cells intoxicated with epsilon toxin (Figs. 1 and2). The Na+ entry was rapid (50% increase of intracellular Na+ during 8 min) although slightly later than the loss of K+, but that of the divalent cation Ca2+ was delayed (50% increase of intracellular Ca2+ during 26 min). The increase of the intracellular Cl− concentration was as rapid as the decrease of K+ (50% decrease during 5 min). This demonstrates that the intracellular concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl− changed dramatically in MDCK cells treated with epsilon toxin. The early intracellular concentrations changes concerned that of the monovalent ions K+, and Cl− and slightly delayed for Na+, whereas that of the divalent cation Ca2+was slower.Figure 2Intracellular concentrations of Cl− and Ca2+ during the intoxication process of MDCK cells with epsilon toxin. MDCK cells were grown on 6-well plates and were treated with epsilon toxin (10−8m) for the indicated times. Intracellular concentrations of Cl− (▵) and Ca2+ (■) were measured by spectrofluorimetry. The data of cell viability are the same as in Fig.1. Data are means ± S.D. (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pore-forming toxins such as Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin recognizes a cell surface receptor, oligomerizes, and inserts into the membrane (18Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high concentration (>300 nm) α-toxin forms large pores permitting the entry of PI into cells (19Jonas D. Walev I. Berger T. Liebetrau M. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI internalization was assayed in MDCK cells treated with epsilon toxin. Fig. 3 shows that the entry of PI correlated with the loss of cell viability measured by the MTT test. The 50% entry of PI matched the 50% increase of intracellular Ca2+ (at 26–27 min), and both are close to the 50% loss of cell viability (at 32 min) induced by epsilon toxin intoxication. This indicates that epsilon toxin induced the formation of large pores in MDCK cell membranes even at a low concentration (10−8m) similar to α-toxin. To evaluate the size of the pores caused by epsilon toxin, competition with uncharged compounds of various molecular mass were performed to block the channels induced by epsilon toxin and subsequently to inhibit the effects of the toxin on cell viability and entry of PI into MDCK cells. Such techniques have been used previously with various hemolysins, for example from Escherichia coli,Clostridium septicum, or S. aureus. (20Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Merzlyak P.G.

Glucose (300 mm), sucrose (300 mm), and PEG300 (25 mm) impaired neither the cytotoxic activity in the MTT test nor the entry of PI induced by epsilon toxin. PEG6000 but not PEG3350 (25 mm) blocked the entry of PI stimulated by epsilon toxin (data not shown). However, these data were not highly reliable, because PEG1000 (25 mm) and above were to some extent cytotoxic for MDCK cells. In any case the results indicate that epsilon toxin forms large pores in MDCK cells at least 2 nm in diameter based on the size of PEG1000 (23Sherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivoexperiments indicated that epsilon toxin formed pores that were at least permeable to ions. Thus, it could be possible that epsilon toxin forms ion-permeable channels in membranes. In a first set of experimental conditions we studied the effect of the non-activated epsilon toxin on membranes formed from a variety of different lipids such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and asolectin. In all cases, we were able to observe some low channel-forming activity, which means that only a small number of channels were formed even at very high concentrations of non-activated epsilon toxin. Substantially increased channel-forming activity was observed, however, when epsilon toxin was activated by trypsin treatment before its addition to the aqueous phase bathing lipid bilayer membranes. Again, we did not observe any lipid specificity. Approximately, the same membrane activity was observed for all lipids used in this study. The relation between membrane conductance and toxin concentration in the aqueous phase was linear, which suggests that there is no association-dissociation reaction between non-conducting monomers and conducting oligomers and that the conductive units are long-lived. Fig. 4 shows the results of a lipid bilayer experiment with activated C. perfringens epsilon toxin. After formation of a diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/N-decane membrane in a 1 mKCl solution, we added 80 ng/ml of trypsin-activated epsilon toxin to the same side of the membrane. After about 2 min the membrane conductance started to increase in a stepwise fashion. The membrane conductance increased subsequently by more than three orders of magnitude within 30 min. Interestingly, the channels showed a stepwise fashion similar to the reconstitution of Gram-negative bacterial porins into lipid bilayer membranes (24Benz R. Ghuyen J.M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar). This means that they were mostly in the open configuration and did not close under our experimental conditions. This result indicated that the channel was formed by a defined structure, which does not show an association-dissociation equilibrium, such as the oligomers that form the hemolysin channels ofProteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii (25Benz R. Hardie K.R. Hughes C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A histogram of the channels formed by the activated C. perfringens epsilon toxin under the conditions of Fig. 4 is shown in Fig. 5. The epsilon toxin channel had on average a single-channel conductance of 550 pS in 1 mKCl. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the current fluctuations were very homogeneous, because the single-channel conductance ranged under the conditions of Fig. 4 from 440 to ∼640 pS, and other conductance values were only rarely observed. The most frequent single-channel conductance was 560 pS.Figure 5Histogram of the probability of the occurrence of certain conductivity units observed with membranes formed of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/N-decane in the presence of 80 ng/ml of activated epsilon toxin from C. perfringens. The aqueous phase contained 1m KCl. The applied membrane potential was 50 mV;T = 20 °C. The average single-channel conductance was 550 pS for 255 single-channel events. Single-channel recordings of 6 different membranes were analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Single-channel experiments were also performed with salts other than KCl to obtain some information on the size and selectivity of the epsilon toxin channel. The results are summarized in TableI. The replacement of chloride and potassium by the less mobile acetate and lithium ions had a considerable influence on the single-channel conductance. The influence of the replacement of chloride by acetate on the single-channel conductance was, however, more substantial (see Table I), which suggests that the channel formed by epsilon toxin in lipid bilayer membranes is at least slightly anion-selective. Table I shows also the average single-channel conductance, G, as a function of the KCl concentration in the aqueous phase. We observed a 1:1 relationship between conductance and KCl concentration, which would be expected for wide, water-filled channels similar to those formed by general diffusion porins of Gram-negative bacteria (24Benz R. Ghuyen J.M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar). This probably means that the channel formed by the C. perfringens epsilon toxin represents a general diffusion pore.Table IAverage single-channel conductance, G, of the channel formed by the activated epsilon toxin of C. perfringens in different salt solutionsSaltcGmpSnKCl0.031520.16030.316021.055063.01,7002LiCl1.03403K+acetate (pH 7.0)1.02404The membranes were formed of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine dissolved in N-decane.

The average single-channel conductance was calculated from at least 100 single events:c indicates the concentration of the aqueous salt solution;n is the number of membrane experiments. The selectivity of the epsilon toxin channel was measured in zero-current membrane potential measurements in the presence of salt gradients. After incorporation of a large number of channels in membranes bathed in 100 mm KCl, 5-fold salt gradients were established across the membranes by the addition of small amounts of concentrated KCl solution to one side of the membrane. In all cases, the more diluted side of the membrane became negative, which indicated preferential movement of anions through the epsilon toxin channel, i.e. it is anion-selective as was already suggested from the single-channel data (Table I). The zero-current membrane potential for a 5-fold KCl gradient was on average about −19 mV at the more diluted side (mean of four experiments). Analysis of the zero-current membrane potentials using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (17Benz R. Janko K. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) suggested that cations could also have a certain permeability through the epsilon toxin channel, because the ratio of the permeabilities PK and PCl was 0.30 (± 0.02; see TableII). This result represents another indication that the C. perfringens epsilon toxin forms a general diffusion pore, because both anions and cations (albeit at smaller rate than the anions) could penetrate the channel, and their ratios reflect their mobility sequence.Table IIComparison of the channel properties of C. perfringens epsilon-toxin with those of aerolysin and of alpha-toxinToxinSingle-channel conductance in 1 m KClZero-current membrane potential for 5-fold KCl gradientsSelectivity permeability ratiopSmVPK/PClAerolysin650−240.21α-toxin820−220.25ɛ-toxin550−190.30Vm is the electrical potential on the dilute side minus the potential of the concentrated side.

As previously reported, the in vivoexperiments suggest that epsilon toxin forms a complex in the membranes of the MDCK cells and does not enter their cytoplasm. The formation of the complex of the activated toxin molecule results in the loss of ions from the cells and in cell death (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Nagahama M. Ochi S. Sakurai J. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lindsay C.D. Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 1996; 15: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that C. perfringens epsilon toxin destroys the barrier function of the cytoplasmic membrane of MDCK cells but not of other cells, which probably do not contain a cell surface receptor for the toxin. Here, we show that epsilon toxin causes in MDCK cells a very early loss of K+ and entry of Na+ and Cl−, whereas the intracellular concentration of the divalent cation Ca2+ increased later similarly to the loss of cell viability monitored by the MTT test. Thus, epsilon toxin seems to form not very selective pores through the MDCK cell membrane permitting the flux of different ions. Differences in fluxes of monovalent and divalent cations have also been observed with other pore-forming toxins. As an example, staphylococcal α-toxin at low concentrations creates in susceptible cells such as keratinocytes pores permeable to K+ but not to Ca2+, and at high concentrations a rapid flux of K+ and Ca2+ is observed. The heterogeneity of pore sizes remains unexplained (27Bhakdi S. Walev N.I. Palmer M. Valeva A. Aktories K. Just I. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Springer, Berlin2000: 509-527Crossref Google Scholar). The pores induced by epsilon toxin were also permeable to PI. Inhibition of PI entry with PEG of different molecular mass indicated that the pores were large in size (at least 2 nm in diameter), but this is tentative, because high molecular mass PEG were cytotoxic for MDCK cells. The cell entry of PI induced by epsilon toxin matched the loss of cell viability. A good correlation was observed between the kinetics of PI entry and that of the MTT test. This raises the question whether the pores formed by epsilon toxin in MDCK cells are responsible alone for the loss of viability by release of ions and other essential molecules in the external medium. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that epsilon toxin may elicit additional cellular activities such as to trigger an intracellular signaling leading to cell death. In agreement with the possible destruction of the barrier function of the cytoplasmic membrane of MDCK cells, we were able to identify channel formation in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Essential for the formation was the trypsin-mediated activation of the protein. No obvious lipid specificity was detected in the experiments. Channels were formed with all lipids tested here. This result seems to represent a contradiction to receptor-mediated destruction of cells. However, it has to be kept in mind that many cytolytic bacterial toxins, such as the repeats in toxin toxins (28Ropele M. Menestrina G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Maier E.N. Reinhard N.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15224-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) form channels in lipid bilayer membranes without the need of receptors, whereas they all need a receptor for biological activity. Lipid bilayers have smooth surfaces without any surface structure including the surface-exposed carbohydrates of biological membranes, which means that the toxins can interact with the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer and can insert without the help of receptors, although receptors may promote such an interaction (35Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19839-19843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the formation of channels in lipid bilayers mediated by C. perfringens epsilon toxin was not a rare event. The addition of 100 ng/ml of this protein to the aqueous phase bathing a diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/N-decane membrane was able to increase the conductance of lipid bilayer membranes considerably, and more than 1000 channels were formed within about 20 to 30 min under these conditions in a membrane with a surface area of about 0.4 mm2. Higher concentrations led to the formation of even more channels. These considerations and the observation of channel formation of epsilon toxin in vivo suggest that we are not dealing with an unspecific artifact. The epsilon toxin channel is presumably formed by protein oligomers with an apparent molecular mass of about 155 kDa when inserted into cell membrane (14Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This makes about five times the molecular mass of a monomer. It is noteworthy that a common architecture of cytolytic toxins is the heptamer, which has been found for α-toxin from S. aureus (33Gouaux E. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), aerolysin fromAeromonas hydrophila (34Cabiaux V. Buckley J.T. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15224-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the cytolytic toxin ClyA ofE. coli (36Ludwig A. Bauer S. Benz R. Goebel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Wallace A.J. Stillman T.J. Atkins A. Jamieson S.J. Bullough P.A. Green J. Artymiuk P.J. Cell. 2000; 100: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). If the epsilon toxin oligomer has a somewhat different mobility in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than the monomer, it is also possible that the membrane channel is formed by a heptamer of the 30-kDa monomer. In such a case the membrane-spanning part of the epsilon toxin should be formed by β-strands, as it is the case at least for α-toxin and aerolysin (33Gouaux E. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Cabiaux V. Buckley J.T. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15224-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In fact, secondary structure prediction performed with the primary structure of epsilon toxin (10Hunter S.E. Clarke I.N. Kelly D.C. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals several stretches in the protein that can possibly form membrane-spanning amphipathic β-strands. Besides oligomer formation the epsilon toxin channel also shares some other features with those formed by aerolysin and α-toxin. All three channels are long-lasting channels with lifetimes in the range of minutes. They are all anion-selective channels caused probably by an excess of positively charged groups in or near the channel (see Ref. 31Chakraborty T. Schmid A. Notermans S. Benz R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand Table II). Nevertheless, all three toxin channels represent general diffusion pores, because they do not contain selectivity filters or binding sites for ions, as judged from the linear dependence of the single-channel conductance from the aqueous salt concentration observed for all three channels. This probably also means that the channels are wide and water-filled and are permeable to solutes up to a molecular mass of at least 1 kDa. Furthermore, the single-channel conductance itself is also very similar in all three systems as Table II clearly indicates. We did not find any similarity between the sequences of the three toxins. However, this does not represent a serious problem for our assumption, because aerolysin and α-toxin do also not show sequence similarities despite a similar architecture of the membrane channel."

Gen. & Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,10McCarthy J.E. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Others demonstrate high level RNA-binding specificity suggesting circumscribed functions in gene control. Examples of the latter group of proteins include cytosolic iron-response element-binding protein (6Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), human immunodeficiency virus Rev response element-binding protein (8Zapp M.L. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 342: 714-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the sex-lethal alternative-splicing factor (13Hughson F.M. Schedl P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins, like their DNA-binding protein counterparts, tend to be modular in structure with conserved RNA-binding domains and “auxiliary” domains that function in the assembly of multiprotein complexes central to specific RNP functions (14Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Four common motifs have been identified in mRNA-binding proteins as follows: the RNP domain (also called RNA recognition motif) (15Wittekind M. Gorlach M. Friedrichs M. Dreyfuss G. Mueller L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6254-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the RGG box (16Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), zinc fingers (17Kim C.A. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the KH (hnRNP1KHomology) domain (18Kanamori H. Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3991-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).The KH domain is one of the most commonly identified RNA-binding motifs. This domain, first identified in hnRNP K (19Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), has been found in more than 50 proteins in a wide range of organisms. Although proteins with single KH domains have been identified (20Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA ( NY ). 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these proteins more commonly contain 2–4 or 15 KH repeats (reviewed in Ref.21Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The KH domain encompasses ∼70 amino acids. The conserved structure of this domain, as defined by NMR and x-ray crystallography, composes a compact βααββα configuration (18Kanamori H. Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3991-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Baber J.L. Libutti D. Levens D. Tjandra N. J. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 100: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This structure projects an invariant Gly-X-X-Gly loop between the first and second α-helices and a variable loop between the second and third β-sheets. These two loops directly participate in RNA binding by forming a “molecular vise” that makes multiple sequence-specific contacts with 4–5 contiguous core bases within the target RNA (24Lewis H.A. Musunuru K. Jensen K.B. Edo C. Chen H. Darnell R.B. Burley S.K. Cell. 2000; 100: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). How such limited contacts can result in high specificity and high affinity interactions is not clearly understood.hnRNP K, the founding member of the KH family of RNA-binding proteins, was initially characterized as a component of the hnRNP complex (19Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This complex is responsible for packaging nuclear heterogeneous transcripts. Functional motifs in hnRNP K in addition to the three KH domains have been implicated in nuclear localization, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, binding of protein kinases, and transcriptional control. These data suggest that hnRNP K is involved in a wide variety of cell functions (26Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D. Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 409-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The only native RNA target defined for hnRNP K to date is a CU-rich sequence (DICE;differentiation-control element) repeated multiple times in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA. Binding of hnRNP K to this site mediates translation silencing of LOX mRNA in erythroid precursors (27Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Due to the ubiquitous distribution and high abundance of hnRNP K, it is probable that many of its targets and functions remain to be identified.A major group of KH domain proteins is composed of the αCP proteins (α-globin mRNA poly(C)-rich segment-binding protein; see below). αCPs are also referred to as PCBPs (poly(C)-binding protein) and hnRNP E (27Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 28Leffers H. Deigaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). αCP proteins exist in the cell in multiple isoforms encoded by four dispersed loci in both mouse and man (21Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The three best described isoforms are αCP-1, αCP-2, and αCP-2KL. All three bind tightly to poly(C). αCP-2KL is encoded by an alternatively spliced αCP-2 transcript that lacks a single exon (exon 8a) corresponding to an internal 31-amino acid segment (29Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). αCP-1 and the two αCP-2 isoforms can each independently bind to the hα-globin mRNA 3′-UTR to form the α-complex that is functionally linked to α-globin mRNA stabilization (30Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue surveys reveal that each of these isoforms is found in a wide range of tissues and cell lines. RNA and protein analyses suggest that αCP-2KL is the most abundantly expressed isoform (21Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Interest in the αCP proteins emerged from studies of post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Stabilization of the human (h) α-globin mRNA in erythroid cell lines is tightly linked to the formation of a binary complex (“α-complex”) between a single αCP molecule and a pyrimidine-rich binding site in the 3′-UTR (30Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4357-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 32Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of functionally important αCP binding sites in the 3′-UTRs of additional long lived mRNAs including collagen (35Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Liebhaber S.A. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tyrosine hydroxylase (36Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has further suggested that the α-complex may serve as a general determinant for high level mRNA stabilization (34Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). αCP proteins have also been implicated in translational control. They appear to maintain LOX mRNA in a translationally silent state until the terminal stages of erythroid differentiation by binding to the 3′-UTR DICE motif in conjunction with hnRNP K (27Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 37Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Remarkably, αCP can also mediate translational enhancement. In this case αCP increases the efficiency of cap-independent translation of picornavirus RNA by binding to two specific sites within the 5′-UTR internal ribosome entry site as follows: the 5′-terminal cloverleaf structure of the 5′-UTR (38Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA ( NY ). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 39Silvera D. Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38163-38170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and stem-loop IV (38Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA ( NY ). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar, 40Walter B.L. Nguyen J.H.C. Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. RNA ( NY ). 1999; 5: 1570-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The interaction with the 5′ cloverleaf, which is dependent on the co-binding of the viral protein 3CD, also controls the switch from translation to replication of the polio RNA viral genome (41Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Additional αCP-mediated translational controls have been reported in a variety of unrelated viral systems (42Collier B. Goobar-Larsson L. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22648-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 43Graff J. Cha J. Blyn L.B. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9668-9675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Spangberg K. Schwartz S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, αCPs may play a role in translational recruitment of dormant mRNAs during early development of the Xenopus embryo via controlled cytoplasmic poly(A) elongation (45Paillard L. Maniey D. Lachaume P. Legagneux V. Osborne H.B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, αCP proteins appear to be involved in a wide range of post-transcriptional controls involved in mRNA stability, modification, and expression. These controls target a specific subset of mRNAs and are mediated in an apparently sequence-specific and selective manner. Despite this wealth of descriptive data, the underlying mechanisms involved in these controls remain undefined.The αCP and hnRNP K proteins are closely related in structure and binding properties. Together they constitute the major poly(C) binding activity in the cell. Both proteins contain three copies of the KH domain arranged in a similar manner as follows: KH1 and KH2 at the N terminus separated from the more C-terminal KH3 domain by a central region of variable length and sequence (Fig. 1; also see Ref. 21Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Close structural and evolutionary relationships between hnRNP K and the αCPs are further supported by the observation that the primary sequences of their three corresponding KH domains are more closely related to each other than are KH domains within the same protein (28Leffers H. Deigaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,29Makeyev A.V. Chkheidze A.N. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24849-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This conservation of KH domain number, sequence, and positioning, and the shared binding to the DICE element in the LOX 3′-UTR (27Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) suggest commonalities in their modes and specificities of RNA binding. However, the unique ability of αCPs to mediate translational enhancement, modification, and stabilization of specific mRNAs suggests that these proteins may be distinct in their relative RNA binding specificities.Whereas both αCP and hnRNP K are categorized as poly(C)-binding proteins, their optimal binding sites appear to be more complex and distinct from each other than is suggested by their common homopolymer recognition profiles. For example, hnRNP K cannot bind effectively to the α-globin 3′-UTR nor can it form the α-complex that is linked to stabilization of a number of additional mRNAs (30Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis for αCP binding also appears to reflect more than a simple recognition of poly(C) as the major isoform of αCP, αCP-2KL, has a 6-fold higher affinity for its α-globin 3′-UTR target sequence than it does for poly(C) homoribopolymers. 2A. Makeyev and S. Liebhaber, unpublished data. 2A. Makeyev and S. Liebhaber, unpublished data. The observation that mutations outside of the defined minimal αCP-binding site within the α-globin mRNA 3′-UTR can severely decrease α-complex formation (32Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) further suggests that higher order RNA structures might be of considerable importance in determining RNA target preference and affinity. In the present study we define the optimal sequences and structures of the RNA binding sites for hnRNP K and αCP-2KL. Parallel analyses of these two sets of protein-RNA interactions revealed well defined differences in how these two closely related proteins interface with their respective RNA targets.DISCUSSIONThe optimized RNA-binding sequences for two closely related RNA-binding proteins, αCP-2KL and hnRNP K, were determined in the present study. These proteins each contain three structurally conserved copies of the KH domain (Fig. 1) and constitute the major poly(C) binding activities in murine and human cells (Fig. 9 A). The two sets of SELEX RNAs revealed distinct primary consensus sequences (Figs. 3 and 6) encompassed in consistent secondary structures (Figs. 4 and 7). The data demonstrated that despite parallels in protein structure, αCP-2KL and hnRNP K have distinct requirements for high affinity RNA-protein complex formation.SELEX studies have been previously reported on three additional KH-proteins as follows: Nova-1, Nova-2, and Vigilin. The neuronal RNA-binding Nova proteins each contain 3 KH domains. SELEX-determined consensus for Nova-1 is ((UCAU(N)0–2)3 (51Buckanovich R.J. Darnell R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Computer formulations predict that the three short pyrimidine-rich patches in this target are in single-stranded configuration. In contrast, SELEX studies of the closely related Nova-2 protein revealed a consensus binding sequence of a single short binding site, 5′-GAGUCAU-3′ (12Yang Y.Y. Yin G.L. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13254-13259Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The difference in structures of Nova-1 and Nova-2 consensus sequences would appear to parallel the differences between αCP-2KL and hnRNP K targets. However, in contrast to hnRNP K and αCP-2KL, structural mapping to confirm the structure of the RNA-binding sites was not carried out, and cross-competition binding studies between the two Nova proteins failed to confirm a difference in their respective binding specificities (12Yang Y.Y. Yin G.L. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13254-13259Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A SELEX study has also been carried out with Vigilin. The Vigilin protein contains 14 KH domains. This protein binds unstructured, single-stranded RNAs containing multiple conserved 5′-(A)nCU-3′ and 5′-UC(A)n-3′ motifs in a largely G-free region. Approximately 75 bases were required for optimal binding (53). The multiple repeats in structure and the open configuration of the target site for Vigilin binding to its RNA target is similar to αCP-2KL and Nova-1. These three studies support the model that KH domain proteins interact with short and sometimes multiply arrayed RNA target sites and that these sites must be in single-stranded configuration for optimal interaction.The αCP-2KL consensus sequence was 5′-(A/U)2 C 3–5(A/U)2–6 C 3–5(A/U)2–6 C 3–5(A/U)2-3′ (Fig. 3). The three C-rich patches that constituted this consensus all contributed to αCP-2KL binding (Fig. 5). Remarkably, this tripartite C-rich consensus sequence bore considerable resemblance to the previously described αCP-binding site in the native human α-globin 3′-UTR (30Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identical or closely related C-rich regions have also been identified in the 3′-UTRs of 15-lipoxygenase, α(1)-collagen, and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs (34Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These RNP complexes (“α-complexes”) formed between these regions, and αCPs appear to serve as critical determinants of mRNA stability and/or translational control (35Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Liebhaber S.A. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, the functionally important αCP-binding sites previously identified in four native mRNAs were consistent with the consensus sequence obtained by αCP-2KL-based SELEX from a library with sequence complexity of >4 × 1014. These data suggest that the native-binding sites are indeed targeted by αCP and that the spectrum of native high affinity αCP-binding sites may be limited to this single motif.The hnRNP K consensus binding motif was 5′-UC 3–4 (U/A)2-3′ (Fig. 6). The cytosines in this motif were critical to protein binding (Fig. 7). The size and structure of the hnRNP K-binding sites were of note for several reasons. First, their sizes conformed to the 4–5-base patch that can be recognized by a single KH domain (26Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D. Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 409-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, they conformed to the short DICE motif (5′-UCCCCAA-3′) present in 11 copies within the 192-nucleotide repeat region of the LOX 3′-UTR and described as a native hnRNP K-binding site (27Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Third, the structure was remarkably similar to the individual C-patches within the αCP-2KL consensus. These observations suggested that binding of hnRNP K to its target RNAs was mediated by a single KH domain. The lower complexity of the hnRNP K optimal binding site, when compared with that of αCP-2KL, would suggest that its interactions are less stringent in their sequence and structural constraints. This would be consistent with the inclusion of hnRNP K but not αCP in hnRNP complexes involved in general mRNA packaging.The isolation of αCP-2KL targets with three C-patches reflected the power of SELEX to discriminate among targets with relatively close binding affinities. Mutagenesis of a representative αCP-2KL SELEX target (R7α1) revealed that slightly lower affinity binding could occur on less extensive targets. For example, elimination of one of the three patches resulted in a 2.1-fold decrease in relative binding affinity (Fig. 5 A). Despite this limited loss of binding affinity, there were no SELEX RNAs that contained less than three C-patches. Equally remarkable was the observation that elimination of two of the three C-patches did not completely eliminate αCP-2KL binding. For example, two of the mutant R7α1 RNAs containing only a single residual C-patch were still able to mediate protein binding, albeit at a substantially lower affinity (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to the interaction of hnRNP K with its single C-patch target, the interaction of αCP-2KL with a single C-patch was weak, and the complex appeared to differ in structure from that with the intact target (Fig. 5 B). This weak and qualitatively distinct interaction could not be attributed to suboptimal (i.e.nonexposed) structure of the mutated R7α1-binding site because αCP-2KL also demonstrated very weak or no binding to a number of the hnRNP K SELEX targets that present the single C-patch in an optimized single-stranded conformation. Thus, while a single C-patch may be able to mediate interaction with an individual KH domain, and is sufficient for hnRNP K binding, the tandem array of three C-patches maximized αCP-2KL binding to its RNA target.Interaction of αCP-2KL with mutated SELEX targets containing only a single residual C-patch not only demonstrated lower binding affinity than to the triple C-patch target but also resulted in an RNP complex with a more rapid electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5 B). This faster migration may have reflected an alteration in the overall geometry of the RNP complex or a change in the stoichiometry of the RNA-protein interaction. Of note, the optimal R7α1 target assembled a similar fast complex when αCP-2KL was added at low concentrations (Fig. 5 B, 1st panel). We cannot exclude that the lower mobility complex might be generated by multimerization of αCP-2KL on multiple C-patches, whereas such a multimerization would not be compatible with a single C-patch configuration as seen in Fig.5 B. This model would be consistent with the ability of αCP-2KL to dimerize in cell extracts and in yeast two-hybrid assays (38Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA ( NY ). 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar).3 Selection for single C-patches on the hnRNP K SELEX targets might reflect a corresponding inability of hnRNP K to undergo productive protein-protein interactions.The secondary structures of both sets of SELEX targets appeared to be crucial to high affinity interactions. The M-fold generated secondary structures, and RNase mapping demonstrated that the consensus sequences were encompassed within a single-stranded loop and that these loops were substantially longer than would have been necessary to accommodate the consensus binding sites (Figs. 4 and 7). The relevance of RNA secondary structure to αCP-2KL binding affinity was highlighted by comparing the structure of the SELEX target to that of the native α-globin 3′-UTR. Although the primary sequence of the α-globin 3′-UTR-binding site was consistent with t"

The channel consists of three subunits (α, β, γ) each containing a proline rich region (PPXY) in their carboxyl-terminal end. Mutations in this PPXY domain cause Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant, salt-sensitive hypertension, by preventing the channel's interactions with the ubiquitin ligaseNeural precursor cell-expresseddevelopmentally down-regulated protein (Nedd4). It is postulated that this results in defective endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of ENaC leading to an increase in ENaC activity. To show the pathway that degrades ENaC in epithelial cells that express functioning ENaC channels, we used inhibitors of the proteosome and measured sodium channel activity. We found that the inhibitor, MG-132, increases amiloride-sensitive trans-epithelial current in Xenopus distal nephron A6 cells. There also is an increase of total cellular as well as membrane-associated ENaC subunit molecules by Western blotting. MG-132-treated cells also have increased channel density in patch clamp experiments. Inhibitors of lysosomal function did not reproduce these findings. Our results suggest that in native renal cells the proteosomal pathway is an important regulator of ENaC function.

We found that the inhibitor, MG-132, increases amiloride-sensitive trans-epithelial current in Xenopus distal nephron A6 cells. There also is an increase of total cellular as well as membrane-associated ENaC subunit molecules by Western blotting. MG-132-treated cells also have increased channel density in patch clamp experiments. Inhibitors of lysosomal function did not reproduce these findings. Our results suggest that in native renal cells the proteosomal pathway is an important regulator of ENaC function. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC)1 is essential for control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by distal nephron kidney cells and fluid clearance from the lung alveolar spaces (1O'Brodovich H. New Horizons. 1995; 3: 240-247PubMed Google Scholar). The channel consists of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ; each subunit consists of two transmembrane domains and one large extracellular domain with several putative N-linked glycosylation sites (2Canessa C.M.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ENaC activity is regulated either by altering the channel open probability or the number of functional ENaC molecules in the plasma membrane. Changes in the number of channels will result from an imbalance between the synthesis and degradation of ENaC proteins. Certain signals (e.g. vasopressin) cause the insertion of new channels into the plasma membrane ofXenopus distal nephron-derived A6 cells (4Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in several heterologous expression systems such as Xenopusoocytes and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with and overexpressing all three ENaC subunits, the number of channel molecules at the plasma membrane and ENaC activity is regulated by ENaC degradation (5Staub O.

The physiological impact of these observations in terms of ENaC activity being regulated by degradation of channel proteins in native, sodium-transporting epithelial cells has not been tested. In our experiments, we sought to determine whether degradation could alter ENaC activity in native, sodium-transporting epithelial cells because as shown in prior studies linking ENaC activity (5Staub O.

Membrane proteins are frequently degraded in lysosomes, but there are examples of transport proteins being degraded by the 26S ubiquitin-proteosome system (8Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 9Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L.A.L.A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 10Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In fact, several different types of proteins with diverse functions, cellular localizations, and half-lives are degraded by this pathway (8Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway is initiated when a target protein is conjugated to ubiquitin, which leads to its recognition and degradation by the 26S proteosome (11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6901) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate protein is ATP-dependent through formation of an isopeptidic covalent linkage between the terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a lysine in the target protein. Several enzymes catalyze this process: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1; a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2; and a ubiquitin ligase, E3 (11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6901) Google Scholar), but other proteins can substitute for E1, E2, and E3. For example, Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentallydown-regulated protein (Nedd4) can act as a ubiquitin ligase. ENaC β and γ subunits interact with Nedd4 in the yeast two-hybrid system and with ENaC in rat lung and kidney cells (12Staub O. Rotin D. Structure. 1996; 4: 495-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nedd4 is homologous to ubiquitin ligase and contains three WW domains (12Staub O. Rotin D. Structure. 1996; 4: 495-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Binding of these domains to the PPXY regions of ENaC β and γ subunits has been reported so far in Western binding assays and in mammalian cells transfected with ENaC subunits (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 14Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivarum G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After these WW domains interact with the ENaC subunit PPXY domain, an E6-AP carboxyl terminus homologous domain in Nedd4 acts as a ubiquitin ligase and conjugates ubiquitin to the amino termini of α and γ ENaC subunits (15Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin coupling to ENaC α and γ subunits occurs in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with all three ENaC subunits, and a reduction in ENaC protein levels occurs (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Co-expressing Nedd4 and ENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes reduces ENaC protein at the cell surface and decreases whole cell sodium current (6Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation of this observation would be that ENaC protein is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal proteolysis but Abriel and colleagues (6Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) embed the change in channel activity to lysosomal degradation of ENaC. For some membrane proteins, ubiquitin does not act as a proteosomal degradation signal but rather as a signal for endocytosis of the proteins and subsequent degradation by lysosomal rather than proteosomal pathways (16Strous G.J. Gowen C.W. J. Cell. Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reports of Staub and colleagues and Goulet and colleagues (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To identify the site of ENaC degradation and whether proteolysis can regulate wild type ENaC function, we studied a native distal nephron cell line (A6) derived from Xenopus kidney and examined how inhibiting proteosome activity affected the amount of cellular ENaC protein, the number of functional ENaC molecules in the plasma membrane, and the properties of single ENaC channels. Our results suggest that functional ENaC channel proteins are degraded by ubiquitin-proteosome proteolysis and that this pathway therefore, might be an important regulator of ENaC in native, sodium-transporting epithelial cells. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides derived from xENaC (Xenopus epithelial Na+ channel) subunit sequences (Lofstrand Laboratories). Anti-α xENaC polyclonal antibodies were generated against a peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence137CIPNNQRVKRDRAGLPYLLELLPPGS161 present in the extra-cellular domain of α xENaC. Anti-β and anti-γ xENaC polyclonal antibodies were directed against amino acid sequences624CGTPPPNYDSLRVNTAEPVSSDEEN647 and600CVDNPICLGEEDPPTFNSALQLPQSQDSHVPRTPPPKYNTLRIQSAF647, respectively, which are present in the carboxyl-terminal regions of the subunits. The antibodies were purified from serum using an antigenic peptide affinity column that had been synthesized by coupling immunizing peptides with SulfoLink agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Lysates of A6 cells were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and bands of 86, 97, and 100 kDa were observed after adding α, β, and γ subunit-specific antibodies, respectively; the bands were missing when the respective antigenic peptide for each of the three subunits was added before probing the membrane (Fig.1). These results imply that the bands corresponding to the glycosylated forms of the three xENaC subunit proteins bind to the complimentary determining region of the antibodies. However, the anti-β antibody also recognized a 78-kDa band that corresponds to the non-glycosylated form of the protein. We also constructed fusion proteins of all three subunits with glutathioneS-transferase protein (GST) and expressed them inEscherichia coli BL-21 bacteria. The antibody recognized a fusion protein of the correct size only in the induced bacteria (Fig.1); these bands were abolished by adding the antigenic peptide. Next, we repeated these experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been transfected with complete α, β, and γ xENaC subunits. The same size bands were observed in the Chinese hamster ovary cellular lysates as in the A6 lysate. No such bands were observed in the untransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and adding the antigenic peptides suppressed recognition of all three xENaC subunits (results not included). A highly transporting clone, 2F3, ofXenopus laevis distal nephron epithelial cells (A6) were maintained using standard tissue culture techniques as described previously (17Eaton D.C. Marunaka Y. Ling B.N. Schafer J. Giebisch G.H. Membrane Transport in Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1991: 73-165Google Scholar). Cells within passage number 100–120 were grown to confluence on 0.02 μm of Anopore membranes (Nalge Nunc) in the presence of 1.5 μm aldosterone. Trans-epithelial voltage and resistance of A6 monolayers were measured by EVOM (World Precision Instruments) and the current/unit area was calculated as: I = [(V)/(R)]/filter area in cm2. After treatment of the A6 monolayer with proteosomal (MG-132, Biomol) or lysosomal (chloroquine and methylamine, Sigma) inhibitors, measurements for calculating the trans-epithelial current were made, cells were washed twice with PBS buffer, and then harvested at 4 °C by scraping them in the PBS buffer containing mixture A protease inhibitors, (100 μmleupeptin, 100 μm antipain, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 100 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone). xENaC polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into PGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), cut with EcoRI enzyme and subcloned into PGEX4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PGEX4T-3 is a prokaryotic vector containing the GST gene. Fusion proteins were generated with GST protein and amino acids corresponding to the α (65QFGLLF … WSLWFGS518), β (571TILKFLA … QAATA647), and γ (562WVVLRQR … VFTLTSMR660) xENaC subunits. All constructs were expressed in E. coliBL21-Codon Plus RIL competent cells (Stratagene) in liquid cultures grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5–0.6 at 600 nm. Fusion protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm for 2 h, after which cells were collected by centrifugation. Bacteria were washed and lysed by sonication in PBS buffer containing mixture A protease inhibitors. Unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation and the bacterial proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-ENaC subunit-specific antibodies. Confluent A6 cells grown on permeable supports were washed three times with cold PBS buffer, and then 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-SS-biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer (85 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 15 mmNa2B4O7, pH 9.0) was added to the apical surface while the basolateral compartment was exposed to media containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The experiment was performed at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 15 min, and the procedure was repeated. The labeling was stopped by adding 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were extensively washed in PBS buffer, harvested, and lysed in buffer B (PBS with 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing mixture A protease inhibitors. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (1200 × g, 5 min), and biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated by incubating with prewashed streptavidin coupled to agarose beads for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. These beads were washed five times with buffer B and the biotin-streptavidin complex lysed by boiling in buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and 5% SDS. The precipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-ENaC subunit-specific antibodies. A6 cellular proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (bacterial proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The nitrocellulose was blocked in TBS buffer containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with the anti-xENaC subunit-specific antibodies or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) monoclonal antibody (Biodesign International). In experiments involving peptide competition, the primary antibody was incubated with the antigenic peptide for at least 1 h at room temperature before using it to probe the nitrocellulose. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories), and the antigen antibody complex was detected by a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The films were scanned, and the band intensity was measured using Sigma Gel (Jandel Scientific). Confluent A6 cells on permeable supports were washed three times with PBS buffer and incubated for 48 h in regular media but without serum and methionine. The cells were then incubated overnight with media containing [35S]methionine, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in regular media containing either MG-132 or the vehicle Me2SO. At various times, plates of cells were harvested, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The films were scanned, and the recorded band intensities were measured using Sigma Gel (Jandel Scientific). A6 cells were grown to confluence on glutaraldehyde-fixed, collagen-coated Millipore-CM filters (Millipore Corp.) attached to the bottom of small Lucite rings. The cells were visualized with Hoffman modulation optics (Modulation Optics, Inc.). At room temperature the pipette tip gently contacted the A6 cell surface, and negative pressure was applied to obtain a seal resistance of 10–20 gigaohms. Unitary channel events were measured using a List EPC-7 Patch Clamp (Medical Systems Corp.), digitized by DAS 601 Pulse Code Modulator (Dagan Corp.), and recorded on a SL-HF860D video recorder (Sony Corp. of America). Data were acquired using a 902LPF 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Inc.), TL-2 acquisition hardware, and Axotape software (Axon Instrument, Inc.). Analysis of data was performed on a 386SX computer (Mitsuba Southeast, Inc.). Pipette and extracellular bath solutions were physiological amphibian saline solutions containing 95 mm NaCl, 3.4 mmKCl, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgCl2, and HEPES, pH 7.4. MG-132 was added to both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the A6 cells (at a concentration of 6 μm) before patches were made. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels were identified in apical cell-attached patches as low conductance (4 picosiemans) channels. A nonlinear current-voltage relationship and long mean open and closed times were obtained as described (17Eaton D.C. Marunaka Y. Ling B.N. Schafer J. Giebisch G.H. Membrane Transport in Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1991: 73-165Google Scholar). The total number of channels (N) in the patch was estimated by observing the number of current levels or the number of peaks detected on current amplitude histograms. As a measure of channel activity,NPo (Number of channels × the open probability) was calculated using the following relationship (Equation1), NPo=∑n=0Nn−tnTEquation 1 where T is the total recording time, and tis the time during recording when there were n channels open. If channels open independently of one another and the exact number of channels in a patch are known, then the open probability (Po) of a single channel in a patch can be calculated by dividing NPo by the number of the channels in a patch. Values are expressed as S.E. Test values ofp < 0.05 were considered significant. At 6 μm, MG-132 is a specific inhibitor of the proteosome activity in kidney cells (18Franch H.A. Curtis P.V. Mitch W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C843-C851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When A6 cells were treated with 6 μm MG-132 for 2–3 h, there was an increase in α, β, and γ subunits by 376, 453, and 728% respectively (versus levels in untreated cells) (Fig.2 A). A more specific (and expensive) inhibitor of the proteosome activity, lactacystin, also caused an increase in all three ENaC subunits (data not shown). These results suggest that the total amount of each ENaC subunit (both the membrane-associated and intracellular pools) increases when proteosome activity is inhibited and that activity of this proteolytic pathway might be important in determining the steady state levels of ENaC in A6 cells. MG-132 treatment substantially increased the half-life of β ENaC from 2.05 ± 0.366 h to no detectable decrease in subunit amount after 4 h (Fig. 2 B). MG-132 did not affect our measurement of the half-life of the α subunit. However, the α subunit half-life in untreated cells was extremely long (there was no statistically significant decrease in this subunit even after 24 h), so we could not reliably detect any change induced by MG-132 in our experiments. Nonetheless, prolongation of the β subunit half-life supports our hypothesis that MG-132 changes ENaC degradation rather than ENaC synthesis. To determine whether ubiquitin-proteosome proteolysis influences ENaC proteins in the apical membrane, these proteins were labeled with biotin, precipitated with streptavidin, and subjected to Western blot analysis. When cells were treated with MG-132 before biotin labeling, the amount of ENaC subunit protein increased (Fig.3). These results suggest that the inhibition of proteosome activity increases the number of functional ENaC molecules in the apical plasma membrane of A6 cells and, hence, should increase trans-epithelial Na+ transport. To determine whether the increase in ENaC protein is physiologically relevant, ENaC function was measured as trans-epithelial current after A6 cells were exposed to MG-132 for 4 h. There was an increase of trans-epithelial current by 2.5–3-fold in these cells compared with untreated cells (Fig.4 A). The increase in trans-epithelial current reached a maximum in about 2–2.5 h after the inhibitor was added, a time course consistent with that of a rapidly exchangeable pool of ENaC that regulates delivery of assembled ENaC to the membrane (a previously reported half-life of about 2–3 h) (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To establish that this increase in the trans-epithelial current was due to an increase in amiloride-sensitive Na+ current, A6 cells treated with MG-132 were then exposed to 100 nm amiloride on the apical surface. Trans-epithelial current in both the experimental as well as the control cells was abolished by amiloride (Fig. 4 B) indicating that the increase in trans-epithelial current following inhibition of the proteosome is predominantly due to increased ENaC activity. To confirm that the MG-132 results are due to inhibition of proteosome activity, we used a more specific inhibitor, lactacystin; results with 10 μm lactacystin showed an increase in trans-epithelial current in the same time course as observed with MG-132. This response was also abolished by 100 nm amiloride (data not shown). The increase in trans-epithelial current implies an increase in the activity of ENaC in the apical membrane, but this response could be due to an increase in the number of channels in the membrane or to an increase in the open probability of existing channels. Although Western blots suggest that the number of channels increase, these channels may not be active; so we examined this possibility by patch clamp. Membrane patches were formed on the surface of paired sets of A6 cells that had been treated with MG-132 or left untreated. Recordings were made from 40 min to 4 h after application of MG-132 with alternate recordings from both treated and untreated cells (current levels in the patches were counted as a measure of the number of channels/patch, N) (Fig.5 A). There was a significant increase (p = 0.035) in the number of channels in MG-132 treated cells (mean for treated cells = 7.4 ± 1.3,n = 11; mean for untreated cells = 4.1 ± 0.71, n = 11) (Fig. 5 B). There was also a significant increase (p = 0.049) in the activity of channels measured as the product of the number of channels × the open probability (NPo, mean for treated cells = 4.3 ± 1.0; mean for untreated cells = 1.0 ± 0.27). Based on these values of N andNPo for individual patches, it is possible to estimate the open probability (Po, mean for treated cells = 0.49 ± 0.089; mean for untreated cells = 0.21 ± 0.053). We recognize that caution is required in interpreting the Po values because they depend upon accurate estimates of N. However, if N in MG-132-treated cells were found to be larger than our calculated value, then Po for the treated cells would have been lower and not significantly different from that for untreated cells. Because the lysosomal pathway is another degradation pathway for some membrane proteins and because the lysosomal pathway is reportedly important for ENaC degradation in cell systems transfected with ENaC subunits (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), we examined whether lysosomal proteolysis might regulate the number of ENaC in A6 cells. Chloroquine and methylamine are weak bases that prevent proteolysis in late lysosomes by increasing vacuolar pH to inhibit the activity of lysosomal enzymes and interfere with protein trafficking. A6 cells were incubated with 0.1 μmchloroquine or 10 μm methylamine for 2–3 h, and ENaC expression was examined by Western blotting. No significant increase was observed in any of the three ENaC subunits in cells treated with chloroquine (Fig. 6 A) or methylamine (data not shown). We believe that the inhibitors did inhibit lysosomal function because there was a significant increase in GAPDH levels after incubation with methylamine, and GAPDH is known to be lysosomally degraded. Because the half-life of GAPDH is much longer than that of ENaC subunits, the cells were incubated for 72 h with methylamine before harvesting (19Aniento F. Roche E. Cuerve A.M. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but again, there was no significant increase in ENaC subunit levels (data not shown). Thus, lysosomal proteolysis does not appears to play an important role in the degradation of the endogenous ENaC proteins present in A6 cells. ENaC activity (trans-epithelial current) was also measured in A6 cells treated with the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine (0.1 μm) or methylamine (10 μm); there was no increase in trans-epithelial current when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). Even when the drugs were tested at different doses and various exposure times, there was no increase in the trans-epithelial current. To confirm that lysosome degradation does not regulate activity of endogenous ENaC, we studied a lysosomal protease inhibitor, 10 μm leupeptin. There was no increase in trans-epithelial current of A6 cells (data not shown). Curiously, chloroquine caused some decrease in transport activity. This may be due to reduced ENaC trafficking to the membrane because chloroquine can inhibit endosomal trafficking. Alternatively, there may be a cytotoxic effect of chloroquine because it can also uncouple mitochondrial electron transport. Our objectives were to identify the proteolytic pathway primarily responsible for degradation of ENaC subunit proteins in native, sodium-transporting epithelial cells and to determine whether degradation could play a role in determining the number and activity of functional ENaC channels in renal A6 cells. We studied both the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway and lysosomal proteolysis because enzymes involved in ubiquitin conjugation can interact with the α and β subunits of ENaC and because ubiquitin conjugation was linked to lysosomal degradation of ENaC subunits transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (6Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 12Staub O. Rotin D. Structure. 1996; 4: 495-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, lysosomes characteristically degrade membrane proteins and can degrade ENaC proteins under some circumstances (8Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). We used A6 cells because A6 epithelial cells in culture form polarized monolayers that express ENaC protein on the apical membrane and because ENaC activity is regulated by the same factors as in intact kidney (20Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that both the total pool of ENaC protein in A6 cells and the number of functional ENaC molecules in the apical membrane are predominantly degraded by the proteosome (Figs.2 A and 3). Based on the long half-life of the α subunit and the increase in function of ENaC after blocking the proteosome for only 4 h, it is tempting to speculate that turnover of the β subunit affects the net functional pool of ENaC more than the α subunit. The difference we observed between the increase in the total cellular and membrane-associated ENaC subunits (Figs. 2 A and 3) is likely attributable to the techniques used (simple Western blotting versus double immunoprecipitation). The double immunoprecipitation experiments involved biotin labeling of cell surface ENaC subunits and their precipitation, first with streptavidin and then with anti-ENaC subunit-specific antibodies. Consequently, the effectiveness of ENaC subunit detection depended both on the efficiency of biotin labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitations compared with the detection efficiency of Western blots. Despite this caveat, we cannot rule out the possibility that proteosomes degrade ENaC localized at the cell surface at a slower rate than ENaC within the cell because intracellular mis-assembled or mis-folded subunits would be degraded more rapidly than properly assembled, functional channels would be within the apical membrane. Our patch clamp results indicate that inhibition of proteosome activity increases channel density (Fig. 5) whereas inhibition of lysosomal or cathepsin activity produced no increase in ENaC amount or activity (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, chloroquine, and to a much lesser extent methylamine, may actually reduce the functional ENaC activity (measured as trans-epithelial Na+current). A potential explanation is that inhibitors of the lysosomal proteolytic pathway (like methylamine and chloroquine) operate by reducing the intralysosomal pH gradient but incidentally also reduce endosomal pH. Because a change in endosomal pH can interfere with protein trafficking (21Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), total cellular ENaC subunit protein levels might not change, but ENaC trafficked to the membrane would decrease. Chloroquine can also act as an uncoupler of mitochondrial electron transport and, therefore, could be toxic to cells over a prolonged period. In some ways, inhibition of the proteosome mimics changes in Na+ transport that are present in Liddle's syndrome because there is an increase in ENaC activity resulting predominately from an increase in the number of functional ENaC channels. In Liddle's syndrome, there is a mutation or deletion of the proline rich (PPXY) region of the β or γ subunit (22Hansson J.H. Nelson-Williams C. Suzuki H. Schild L. Shimkets R. Lu Y. Canessa C.M.

Nedd4, a potential ubiquitin ligase is co-localized with ENaC in rat lung and kidney cells (13Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nedd4 functions as a negative regulator of whole cell current and of the ENaC residing in the plasma membrane inXenopus oocytes expressing α, β, and γ ENaC subunits (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because Nedd4 has regions that are homologous to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, we and others reasoned that ENaC could be degraded by the proteosome after Nedd4-dependent ubiquitin conjugation. Staub and et al. (13Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) transfected ENaC subunits into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and examined how proteosome inhibition affected their turnover. They concluded that mis-folded and unassembled ENaC are degraded by the proteosome but that properly assembled and functional ENaC residing in the plasma membrane are degraded in lysosomes. This pathway would lead to an increase in non-functional cellular ENaC levels when proteosome activity is inhibited, but there would be no increase in membrane-associated ENaC proteins nor any gain in channel function. In contrast, in A6 cells that express functional ENaC channels there is an increase in channel function when proteosome activity is blocked (Fig.5). Likewise, ENaC activity rises in oocytes injected with Liddle's mutant or inactivated Nedd4 (6Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These data implicate Nedd4-mediated ubiquitin conjugation in the degradation of ENaC (Fig. 7), but in cells transfected to express ENaC lysosomal inhibitors do appear to alter ENaC degradation (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) even though the endogenous ENaC protein levels and ENaC activities in native cells are not affected by blocking lysosomal activity or cathepsins (Fig. 6). Presumably, the results obtained in cells transfected to express ENaC result from the pathway that uses ubiquitin coupling as a signal for membrane protein endocytosis. Endocytosis leads to the degradation of these proteins by proteolysis in lysosomes as shown for uracil permease, multidrug transporter Pdr5, and Ste6 protein (25Galan J.M. Moreau V. Andre B. Volland C. Hague-nauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Egner R. Kuchler K.

However, we found that GAPDH degradation is inhibited by lysosomal inhibitors but that ENaC degradation is unaffected by the same lysosomal inhibitors. This leads to the conclusion that endogenous-functioning ENaC channel proteins in the cell membrane are not degraded by the lysosomes but are degraded by the proteosome. The difference in our results from those of Staub and colleagues (5Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) may lie in the fact that protein expression or cellular pathways in transfected cells change the pathways by which protein turnover is regulated. We have also observed that blocking activity of the proteosome increased the open probability (Po) of ENaC. This observation needs to be interpreted cautiously because it is influenced by the accuracy of our estimate of N (the number of channels), and there are other possibilities for an increase inPo. One possibility is that the increase in Na+ transport alters the cellular environment in such a way as to increase ENaC Po. This possibility seems unlikely because “feedback” inhibition of ENaC by an increase in intracellular Na+ would be expected to decreasePo when Na+ transport increased. A second possibility is that there is a differential degradation of subunits leading to the formation of channels with a higherPo. This also seems an unlikely possibility because it would require a change in channel properties, but we observed no differences in other channel characteristics besidesPo in MG-132-treated cells. A third possibility is that a ubiquitin-conjugated channel has a higher open probability. This is possible because mutations in the regions to which ubiquitin binds, at least in the α subunit, can alter ENaC gating and hence,Po (28Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Karlson K.H. Stanton B.A. Ismailov I.I. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1881-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The final possibility is that ENaC activity is maintained at low levels by a regulatory protein that is degraded by the proteosome. In this case, inhibition of the proteosome would increase the number of putative regulator molecules that increasePo. Distinguishing between the latter two possibilities might be difficult unless the regulatory protein is identified. In summary, we find that inhibition of proteosome activity increases the cellular level of all three ENaC subunits, increases the trans-epithelial Na+ transport, the apical density of the channel, and possibly Po). These findings support the hypothesis that the pathway regulating membrane and cellular ENaC turnover in native, sodium-transporting epithelial involves ubiquitin conjugation and proteosome degradation rather than a lysosomal pathway.

Aro E.-M. Regulatory Aspects of Photosynthesis: Advances in Photosynthesis.8. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar). In this study we report on the identification of a 350-kDa ClpP protease complex with 10 different subunits that was released from the thylakoid membranes ofArabidopsis thaliana by Yeda press treatment. The complex was identified through Blue-Native gel electrophoresis (4Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)1and nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) (for reviews see, e.g., Refs. 5Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Roepstorff P. Proteins. 1998; Suppl. 2: 74-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Pandey A. Mann M. Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Clp proteins (for caseinolyticprotease) were first identified in Escherichia coli (7Katayama Y. Gottesman S. Pumphrey J. Rudikoff S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15226-15236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Katayama-Fujimura Y. Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, a Clp complex with a mass of ∼300 kDa was shown to be an ATP-dependent serine type protease consisting of a catalytic core composed of two apposite heptameric rings of ClpP protease subunits. All 14 ClpP subunits are identical and are encoded by one gene. This catalytic core can be flanked at one or both ends by a hexamer of regulatory ClpA/X chaperone subunits, belonging to the family of ATP-dependent HSP100 proteins (9Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This family, is divided into class I with five subclasses (A, B, C, D, and E) and II with four subclasses (M, N, X, and Y). Proteins in class I contain two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and proteins in the second class are shorter in length, containing only one NBD and a conserved C-terminal region (10Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The structure of the heptameric ClpP ring in E. coli has been determined at 2.3-Å resolution and resembles a hollow, solid-walled cylinder ∼51 Å in diameter with only two axial openings (11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The narrow width of the pore opening (∼10 Å) suggests that protein substrates enter the proteolytic chamber in a largely unfolded conformation (11Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The ClpP complex alone degrades only peptides of fewer than 6 amino acid residues, but when the hexameric chaperone rings are attached to ClpP, the complex can degrade longer polypeptides and proteins (12Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The proteolytic core can also be formed by ClpQ (HslV) proteins, which are otherwise unrelated to ClpP, both in terms of amino acid sequence and mode of proteolytic action (13Missiakas D. Schwager F. Betton J.M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The Clp family in higher plants (A. thaliana) consists of at least the plastid-encoded pClpP gene, six homologous nuclear-encoded nClpP genes, and the nuclear encoded chaperones ClpB, -C, -X, and ClpD, also named ERD1 (for early responsive todehydration). Information concerning chloroplast Clp proteins has been reviewed in Refs. 14Adam Z. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 15Clarke A.K. Ann. Botany. 1999; 83: 593-599Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar. No ClpQ homologue has been found in any plant species. Cyanobacteria have an additional ClpP homologue, named ClpR, but, as this homologue does not have an active catalytic triad, it is believed to be a regulatory subunit (45Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Rodermel S.R. Shinozaki K. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1912-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). There is evidence for chloroplast localization of pClp, nClpP1, ClpC, and ERD1, from either in vitro import into isolated chloroplasts or Western blotting and immunodetection (16Shanklin J. DeWitt N.D. Flanagan J.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1713-1722PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nakabayashi K. Ito M. Kiyosue T. Shinozaki K. Watanabe A.

Biol. 1993; 21: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). pClpP and ClpC were reported to be constitutively expressed in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissue in equimolar amounts. Their protein levels also remained unchanged during various stress treatments, such as heat shock and dehydration (16Shanklin J. DeWitt N.D. Flanagan J.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1713-1722PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of transcripts of ERD1, nClp3, and nClp5 was shown to be up-regulated during drought stress and other stresses, during long term dark treatment, as well as during senescence, suggesting that these gene products function during natural senescence (17Nakabayashi K. Ito M. Kiyosue T. Shinozaki K. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.D. Arteca R.N. Pell E.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During senescence, the expression of pClpP, nClpP1, nClpP2, nClpP4, and nClpP6, on the other hand, seems to stay unchanged (17Nakabayashi K. Ito M. Kiyosue T. Shinozaki K. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation showed that pClpP and nClpP6 were associated with ClpC (21Desimone M. Weiss-Wichert C. Wagner E. Altenfeld U. Johanningmeier U. Bot. Acta. 1997; 110: 234-239Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Sokolenko A. Lerbs-Mache S. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Planta. 1998; 207: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas immunoblotting of size-fractionated chloroplast stroma indicated that ClpC, pClpP and nClpP6 migrated in a range of different sized complexes (between 160 and 1700 kDa) (22Sokolenko A. Lerbs-Mache S. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Planta. 1998; 207: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was thus postulated that heterocomplexes such as ERD1/ClpP1 or ClpC/ClpP1, or ERD1/CplC/pClpP (etc.) could exist (17Nakabayashi K. Ito M. Kiyosue T. Shinozaki K. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Sokolenko A. Lerbs-Mache S. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Planta. 1998; 207: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The physiological role for the Clp proteins in chloroplasts is to degrade misfolded or unassembled proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (23Liu X.-Q. Jagendorf A.T. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 248-252Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Halperin T. Adam Z. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Majeran W. Wollman F.A. Vallon O. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar). In the green algaeChlamydomonas, the pClpP gene was shown to be essential (26Huang C. Wang S. Chen L. Lemieux C. Otis C. Turmel M. Liu X.-Q. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas reduced expression levels of pClpP restricted the ability of the cells to adapt to high CO2 levels and also suggested that ClpP is involved in proteolytic disposal of fully or partially assembled cytochrome b6 f (25Majeran W. Wollman F.A. Vallon O. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of ClpP in E. coli and Synecocystisis not lethal (27Damerau K. St. John A.C. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12536-12545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these studies, no chloroplast Clp complex has been isolated and its subunits identified and characterized. Such isolation and identification of the subunits is needed to determine the stoichiometry and expression of the different isoforms and to understand the role of the different gene products and the relationship to stress and chloroplast development and senescence. In this study, we identified a chloroplast Clp complex of 350 kDa using nondenaturing Blue-Native gel electrophoresis (4Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membrane-associated complexes were separated by Blue-Native PAGE, and each complex was then separated into their individual subunits by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie and silver staining. The Clp complex separated into seven strong and two weak protein spots, and all protein spots were successfully analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-MS/MS. Analysis of the mass spectrometry data showed that the isolated Clp complex contained 10 different Clp proteins, including pClpP, 5 nuclear-encoded ClpP proteins, 3 nuclear-encoded ClpR proteins, as well as 1 novel Clp protein, ClpS1. The nomenclature of the Clp proteins in higher plants is confusing, with several proteins going under different names. In agreement with a suggestion for nomenclature of chloroplast proteases (45Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Rodermel S.R. Shinozaki K. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1912-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we have (re)named a number of the Clp genes, based on presence or absence of functional domains and confirm the homology to Clp protein in E. coli and Synechocystis PCC6803. A. thaliana, ecotype Columbia, was grown on soil in a temperature-controlled growth chamber under a 10/14-h light dark cycle, at 21 °C/16 °C light/dark temperatures at a light intensity of about 100 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. Leaves from Arabidopsis were homogenized in ice-cold medium A (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), filtered through four layers of Miracloth (22 μm), and centrifuged for 3 min at 9000 × g. Thylakoid pellets were resuspended in medium A and centrifuged on a Percoll gradient (0–90%) in medium A for 4 min at 3000 × g. The thylakoid band was collected and washed three times in the same medium A. Thylakoids were passed twice through the Yeda press (at 100 bar), and thylakoid membranes were subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 150,000 × g). The membrane-free supernatant was collected and concentrated to ∼20 mg protein·ml−1. Samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm caproic acid, 50 mmBis-Tris, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol, 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, and separated on gradient (4 -12% acrylamide) Blue-Native gels (4Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Molecular mass complexes ranging from 67 to 669 kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were loaded for calibration of the gels. Gel lanes were then cut out and equilibrated twice for 20 min in SDS solubilization buffer (containing 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol and 2% SDS; 5 mm tributylphosphine). Proteins were separated on 8–16% acrylamide Tricine gels (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver nitrate (30Rabilloud T. Vuillard L. Gilly C. Lawrence J.J. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 57-75PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shevchenko A.

Stained protein spots were excised from the gel, washed, reduced, alkylated using iodoacetamide, and digested with modified trypsin (Promega), according to Ref. 31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar. The peptides were then extracted and dissolved in 20 μl of 5% formic acid and applied to the MALDI-TOF target plate by the dried droplet method using α-cyano-4-hydrocynnamic acid as matrix. When necessary, the samples were concentrated using microcolumns (32Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and eluted directly onto the MALDI target. The mass spectra were obtained using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (REFLEX II from Bruker Daltonics and Voyager-DE-STR from Perseptive Biosystems Inc.). The spectra were annotated with the program “m/z” from Proteometrics and internally calibrated using tryptic peptides from autodigestion. The latest versions of the NCBI nonredundant data base were searched with the resulting peptide mass lists, using the search engine ProFound. The search strategy was in principle as described previously (33Peltier J.B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F. Adamska I. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To further analyze the samples, the remainder of the extracted peptides were desalted and concentrated on microcolumns (Poros R2, PE Biosystems) and eluted directly into nanoelectrospray needles (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark) with 1.2 μl of 50% MeOH and 1% formic acid (34Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The spectra were acquired on an electrospray tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Micromass). The instrument was calibrated with 1 μg/μl NaI in 50% isopropanol. Alternatively the spectra were used to search the public data bases with the program Mascot. Alternatively, the MS/MS spectra were interpreted using MassLynx and PepSeq (Micromass) and were used to search different public data bases using FASTA3. Predictions for chloroplast localization, chloroplast, and lumenal transit peptides were made using the search engines TargetP and Predotar. First, the sequences were grouped into clades of those where homologous relationships could be established, using the union find algorithm applied with 20% and 30% identity threshold. This type of approach has been employed in establishing clusters of genes or proteins in various data bases (35Benner S.A. Chamberlin S.G. Liberles D.A. Govindarajan S. Knecht L. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Yona G. Linial N. Linial M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 360-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the tree building of all the Arabidopsis Clp genes, two distinct clades were identified. In both clades, sequences were identified using a 20% cutoff, but not a 30% cutoff and were excluded from further phylogenetic study. For both clades, multiple sequence alignments were constructed using ClustalW. Additional multi-alignments were done using MultAlin. Using these multiple sequence alignments in PHYLIP, phylogenetic trees were calculated using maximum likelihood (Molphy) parsimony and two distance based methods (neighbor joining and UPGMA) with bootstrap values to test the statistical robustness of the trees (37Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Relationships that were present in all of the tree methodologies supported by bootstrap values >95% by at least one methodology are depicted, whereas more ambiguous relationships are presented as start clusters. A box is placed over the central start, where homology cannot be established based upon sequence alone. A second tree using ClpP/R sequences from Arabidopsis,Synechocystis, and Synechococcus was built using ClustalW alignment and both neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood trees, which were alike. To identify protein complexes that are peripherally attached to thylakoid membranes, we first purified fairly large quantities of thylakoid membranes (membranes containing about 100 mg of chlorophyll, equivalent to ∼800–900 mg of protein) from mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. The chloroplast stroma is reported to contain 15–30 mm Mg2+, which is needed to keep the thylakoid membranes in its physiologically stacked state and to stabilize several known complexes, such as ribosomes. Therefore, the thylakoid membranes were kept in a medium containing MgCl2 all throughout the preparation, as we expected that this could enhance binding and stability of membrane-associated protein complexes. The thylakoid membranes were purified on linear Percoll gradients to minimize contamination with other membranes or organelles. To release peripherally attached thylakoid complexes, we attempted treatment with very low levels of nonionic detergents and treatment by Yeda press, both followed by differential centrifugation. We will not further report on the detergent extraction since this did not result in the purification of significant amounts of novel stable peripheral complexes. Instead, we report on the purification of complexes using Yeda press. Thylakoid membranes were fragmented by Yeda press treatment, and the membranes were subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation. The remaining supernatant was concentrated and loaded on Blue-Native gels to separate the native protein complexes according to their molecular mass. High molecular mass markers were run in parallel to estimate the molecular masses of the peripheral complexes (Fig.1 A). At the end of the electrophoretic run, three focused protein complexes were visible in the region of 350–600 kDa and their estimated molecular masses were 400 and 550 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Gel lanes were then excised and incubated in SDS, and the complexes were separated into their individual subunits by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 (B and C) show a silver-stained and Coomassie-stained gel of the 350- and 600-kDa region. In this molecular mass range, we detected two dominant complexes and one complex of lower abundance. Protein spots of each of the three complexes were picked from the gels and prepared for mass spectrometry analysis. Protein spots from the gels were digested with trypsin and the generated peptides were extracted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. To identify the protein(s) in each spot, the experimentally determined peptide masses, were used to search the public sequence data bases (see “Experimental Procedures”). The largest complex was Rubisco (550 kDa) with the large (RbcL) and small subunit (RbcS), and the complex at 400 kDa was the ATP synthase complex CF1 (data not shown) (Fig. 1). In the third, low abundant complex of ∼350 kDa, we could distinguish clearly seven protein spots after silver staining. These seven spots, as well as the gel material in between the spots were excised, such that nine slices, covering the range of 20–30 kDa, were collected. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were obtained from all of them, resulting in the identification of at least one protein per gel slice (Table I). From the MALDI-TOF MS data, it became clear that the 350-kDa complex contains several Clp proteins, suggesting we had purified a chloroplast Clp complex with several isoforms. To obtain further confirmation of these identities and to search for additional proteins in the spots, the remainder of each peptide extract was analyzed by nano-electrospray MS/MS to generate sequence tags. The precursor and fragment ions masses were then used to search NCBI directly (see “Experimental Procedures”). Additionally, all MS/MS spectra were interpreted into amino acid sequences, to search the Arabidopsis data base with FASTA and thus to allow for errors in gene annotation (see below and “Discussion”).Table IIdentification and analysis of the Clp proteins in the 350-kDa complex by mass spectrometrySpot no.1-aExperimental molecular mass.Identity (previous names)Size in aa1-bPredicted length of the protein in number of amino acids; in parentheses is correction based on comparison to EST sequences and MS data (see Figs. 3 and 5).

https://openalex.org/W2006697311,"In this study, we focus on different modes of regulation of STRA13, a human ortholog of the mouse basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor, previously identified by us as a new von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) target. The gene was overexpressed in VHL-deficient cell lines and tumors, specifically clear cell renal carcinomas and hemangioblastomas. Introduction of wild type VHL transgene into clear cell renal carcinoma restored low level expression of STRA13. Overexpression was also detected in many common malignancies with an intact VHL gene, suggesting the existence of another, VHL-independent pathway of STRA13 regulation. Similar to many other von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL) targets, the expression of STRA13 on the mRNA level was hypoxia-sensitive, indicating oxygen-dependent regulation of the gene, presumably through the pVHL/hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway. The yeast two-hybrid screening revealed interaction of the STRA13 protein with the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC9) protein, the specificity of which was confirmed in mammalian cells. By adding the proteasome inhibitor acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, we demonstrated that the 26 S proteasome pathway regulates the stability of pSTRA13. Co-expression of STRA13 and UBC9 led to an increase of the pSTRA13 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. These data established that UBC9/STRA13 association in cells is of physiological importance, presenting direct proof of UBC9 involvement in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of pSTRA13. Hypoxia treatment of mammalian cells transiently expressing STRA13 protein showed that stability of pSTRA13 is not affected by hypoxia or VHL. Thus, STRA13, a new pVHL target, is regulated in cells on multiple levels. We propose that STRA13 may play a critical role in carcinogenesis, since it is a potent transcriptional regulator, abundant in a variety of common tumors.

Recent studies highlighted pVHL as a key regulator of cellular responses to oxygen deprivation. pVHL regulates activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), consisting of an HIF-1α/HIF-1β heterodimer. Under normoxic conditions, the α subunit interacts with the pVHL-elongin B-elongin C complex and is rapidly degraded (1Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E.

Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the human ortholog of the mouse Stra13 (stimulated withretinoic acid) gene (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).STRA13 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors that play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref.10Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 649-653Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of STRA13 shows the highest homology in the bHLH domain with Drosophila Hairy (H),Enhancer of Split (E(Spl)), and mouse Hes1 proteins (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Outside of the bHLH domain, STRA13 contains three putative α-helices, which have no obvious similarity with any known proteins. Although mouse Stra13, unlike many other bHLH proteins (10Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 649-653Google Scholar), does not bind E- or N-boxes, it exhibits DNA binding properties and transcriptional repression activity in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which is mediated through the α-helices (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The in vitro interaction between Stra13 and either TBP or TFIIB, the subunits of RNA polymerase II complex, supports the idea that Stra13 may repress transcription by interacting with the basal transcription machinery (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Stra13 expression is regulated through a negative autoregulatory mechanism that is brought about by its interaction with the co-repressor histone deacetylase (11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Little is known about Stra13 function, although its ability to repress mesodermal and endodermal differentiation, promoting, instead, neuronal differentiation, strongly suggests that Stra13 may play a critical role during mouse development (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Its expression in kidney tubules at early stages (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) is of special interest, since these structures are known to be involved in carcinogenesis due to mutations of the VHL gene (12Wallace A.G. Nairn R.C. Cancer. 1972; 29: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,13Fogt F. Zhuang Z. Linehan W.M. Merino M.J. Oncol. Rep. 1998; 5: 923-926PubMed Google Scholar).Our findings that STRA13 is a pVHL target (7Ivanov S.V. Kuzmin I. Wei M.H. Pack S. Geil L. Johnson B.E. Stanbridge E.J. Lerman M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12596-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and that it is overexpressed in many common malignancies (this paper) prompted us to propose STRA13 association with carcinogenesis and stimulated further research into its expression regulation in cells. We have focused on STRA13 control on mRNA and protein levels. On the mRNA level, STRA13 expression is regulated by pVHL with involvement of both β-domain and elongin C-binding domains. We found that the gene is hypoxia-inducible, suggesting involvement of HIF-1 in its regulation. Our data imply that STRA13 may function as another important mediator of cellular responses to hypoxia in the pVHL/HIF-1 pathway. We further showed that STRA13 is also tightly controlled on the protein level. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9 specifically interacts with pSTRA13. We demonstrated also that pSTRA13 accumulates upon proteasome inhibitor treatment, producing multiubiquitinated forms. Co-expression of UBC9 and pSTRA13 increased ubiquitination of STRA13 and shortened its half-life. Hypoxia experiment showed that regulation of STRA13 on the protein level does not depend on hypoxia and VHL. Localization of the protein in the nucleus and its ability to homodimerize conform to its proposed role as a transcriptional regulator. Overall, our data suggest that STRA13 is a cancer-associated protein regulated by pVHL and hypoxia on the mRNA level and by the UBC9/ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway on the protein level.DISCUSSIONInvolvement of bHLH-containing proteins, such as c-myc, Max (reviewed in Ref. 21Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and HIF-1 (22Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar) in carcinogenesis is well established. In this study, we characterized the bHLH-containing pSTRA13 as a new cancer-associated protein. A bHLH domain of pSTRA13 is highly homologous to bHLH domains of hairy andE(spl) proteins involved in Drosophilaembryogenesis (23Ishibashi M. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was shown that the Stra13 expression during mouse development is restricted to the neuroectoderm and also to a number of mesodermal and endodermal derivatives (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Overexpression of mouse Stra13 in P19 cells led to repression of mesodermal and endodermal promoting neuronal differentiation (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Sun and Taneja (11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the protein may play a critical role during embryogenesis and may be involved, like many other genes engaged in differentiation and cell cycle regulation, in carcinogenic pathways.In our work, we confirmed that the STRA13 gene is down-regulated by pVHL on the mRNA level. Expression of the STRA13 mRNA is dependent on the VHL status in renal cell carcinoma cell lines with involvement of both the elongin-binding domain and β-domain of pVHL (Fig. 1). pVHL plays a critical role in hypoxia-regulated proteolysis of the HIF-α subunits of the transcriptional heterodimer HIF-1. HIF-α proteins are significantly stabilized in response to oxygen deprivation. Because pVHL regulates stability of HIF-1, which, in turn, orchestrates expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes, it may be suggested that most, if not all, pVHL targets are also HIF-1 targets and, thus, are hypoxia-up-regulated. We demonstrated that the STRA13 gene is indeed hypoxia-sensitive (Fig. 1 C), like previously studied pVHL targets vascular endothelial growth factor (3Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C.

Lerman M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12596-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, STRA13 possesses another feature typical for a number of pVHL targets; it is up-regulated in a large variety of common tumors (Fig.2). Taken together, our observations on STRA13 expression analysis in different types of malignant cells suggest that the gene may be 1) up-regulated in pVHL-deficient tumors, 2) induced by hypoxia in pVHL-positive tumors, and 3) up-regulated in pVHL-positive tumors by unknown mechanisms. The morphogenic potential of STRA13 (9Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) combined with its cancer-associated elevated expression warranted further investigation into its regulation on the protein level.Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is a highly complex, temporally controlled, and tightly regulated process that plays important roles in a broad array of basic cellular functions. The list of cellular proteins targeted by ubiquitin is growing rapidly. These are cell cycle regulators, tumor suppressors and oncogenes, transcriptional activators and their inhibitors, cell surface receptors, and endoplasmic reticulum proteins (19Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination requires the sequential action of three enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3). Usually there is a single E1, but there are many species of E2s and E3s. While in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 13 genes encode E2 and E2-like proteins, many more ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have been described in mammals (25Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Some E2s are involved in specific cellular processes, while the role of others is obscure. One S. cerevisiae E2 called UBC9 and its ortholog, hus5 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), have been shown to be essential for cell viability (26Jentsch S. Annu Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and for normal mitosis (27Al-Khodairy F. Enoch T. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 475-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human UBC9 shares 75 and 82% amino acid similarity with S. cerevisiae andS. pombe proteins, respectively (27Al-Khodairy F. Enoch T. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 475-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S.

Modification of Ran GTPase-activating protein by sentrin, a small ubiquitin-like protein, does not lead to proteolysis but, instead, appears to modulate the Ran GTPase-activating protein subcellular localization. Other results obtained on E2A (37Kho C.J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol.

The data we present here assure that the meaning of this interaction is in maintaining tight control of pSTRA13 turnover, supporting the idea of direct involvement of UBC9 in the protein degradation pathway.Interaction of UBC9 and STRA13 was demonstrated in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown) and was further confirmed in mammalian cells by the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2).We found that pSTRA13, like pUBC9 (17Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Ganguly S. Bohlander S. Shen Z. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is localized primarily in the nucleus that confirms their physical ability to interact. The deletion of 113 C-terminal amino acids or 292 N-terminal amino acids resulted in an entirely cytoplasmic distribution of the protein (Fig.4 B), while subsequent deletions of the 258 N-terminal amino acids did not alter nuclear localization (Fig. 4 A). Nuclear proteins like transcription factors and ribosomal proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and have to be transported into the nucleus to fulfill their functions. The transport of proteins through the nuclear pore complex is an active, energy-requiring process. The best characterized protein import pathway is the “classical” nuclear localization signal-dependent pathway (44Kohler M. Haller H. Hartmann E. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins that contain a simple or bipartite basic amino acid sequence called the nuclear localization signal are imported into the nucleus by a heterodimeric receptor that consists of the importin-α and importin-β subunits (44Kohler M. Haller H. Hartmann E. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the past few years, knowledge about protein trafficking across the nuclear membrane has grown exponentially. It was shown that another mechanism such as substrate phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 45Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar) or protein dimerization (46Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) regulates nuclear transport as well. From our data, we may conclude that localization of STRA13 is determined by a specific C-terminal sequence called the nuclear localization signal. In fact, computer prediction of the basic nuclear localization signal at position 286 (PSORT II server) of STRA13 is in agreement with our experimental data. We may also conclude that STRA13 nuclear localization does not depend on the ability of STRA13 to form dimers like in the case of the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (46Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We showed that STRA13 needs the entire protein for homodimerization (data not shown), so most of the deletion mutants lost their ability to homodimerize but did not change their distribution in the nucleus.Since UBC9 is involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of some proteins (17Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Kho C.J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol.

Res. 2000; 255: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we checked whether the STRA13 protein is a target for 26 S degradation machinery. We found that exposure of STRA13-transfected HEK 293 cells to 26 S proteasome inhibitor ALLnL led to pSTRA13 ubiquitination and accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of pSTRA13 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.We showed that pSTRA13 is relatively stable as compared with strikingly short half-lives of other stress-activated transcription factors such as HIF-1α (half-life under normoxia is a few minutes) (47Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-Myc (∼20–30 min) (48Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), c-Jun (∼90 min) (49Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), or p53 (∼7–8 h) (see Ref. 50Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar and references therein). We estimated the half-life of pSTRA13 as ∼30 h (Fig. 7 B), which correlates with the predicted half-life value of ∼30 h in vitro and ∼20 h in yeast in vivo.In our attempt to identify the regions of pSTRA13 that are required for its stabilization, we found that the entire STRA13 protein has a much shorter half-life than its C or N terminus-truncated derivatives (Fig. 6 B). For instance, the steady-state level of the least stable mutant (1) lacking 113 C-terminal amino acids was hardly detectable upon transient expression but significantly increased after exposure to ALLnL (Fig. 6 B). The half-life of the mutant was less than 0.5 h, which is ∼60 times shorter than that of the entire pSTRA13. Given that the whole STRA13 protein is needed for homodimerization (data not shown), it is tempting to speculate that pSTRA13 is stabilized by either homo- or heterodimerization. A similar protein stabilization mechanism was demonstrated for two transcription factors, MATa1 and MATα2. Both were stabilized by heterodimerization that interfered with degradation by masking the ubiquitin recognition signal (51Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that pVHL proteins with mutations in the CBD domain disrupting elongin B and C binding were highly unstable and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner (14Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar proteasome-resistant complex may form between pSTRA13 and its yet unidentified partners and that truncation of either terminus would lead to dissociation of such complexes with immediate ubiquitination and degradation of pSTRA13.Further evidence of UBC9 direct involvement in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of pSTRA13 was obtained in experiments on these two proteins' co-expression. The level of pSTRA13 was significantly decreased upon UBC9/STRA13 co-expression. STRA13 and ATBF domain co-expression did not change the amount of STRA13 protein (Fig. 7 A). The half-life of pSTRA13 in the presence of UBC9 was shortened from ∼30 to ∼8 h (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, the ubiquitination level of pSTRA13 was higher when pSTRA13 was co-expressed with UBC9 than when it was co-expressed with the ATBF domain (Fig. 7 C).We have determined that the interaction between STRA13 and UBC9 required the C-terminal end of STRA13 and was unaffected by deletions of the bHLH domain or three N-proximal α-helices (Fig.3 B). It has been shown previously that highly unstable helix-loop-helix E2A protein that binds Ubc9 for degradation purposes also does not need the bHLH domain for the interaction (37Kho C.J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, interaction of another helix-loop-helix protein, TEL, with UBC9 through the HLH domain modulates TEL transcriptional activity but does not lead to TEL degradation (18Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Ganguly S. Bohlander S. Shen Z. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thes"

Genetic targeting studies in mice showed that Rac2 is an essential regulator of neutrophil chemotaxis, L-selectin capture and rolling, and superoxide production. Recently, a dominant negative mutation of Rac2, D57N, has been reported to be associated with a human phagocytic immunodeficiency. To understand further the cellular phenotypes associated with this D57N Rac2 mutant we examined its biochemical characteristics and functional effects when expressed in primary murine bone marrow cells. When compared with wild type (WT) Rac2, D57N Rac2 displayed ∼10% GTP binding ability resulting from a markedly enhanced rate of GTP dissociation and did not respond to the guanine nucleotide exchange factors. These results suggest that D57N Rac2 may act in a dominant negative fashion in cells by sequestering endogenous guanine nucleotide exchange factors. When expressed in hematopoietic cells, D57N Rac2 reduced endogenous activities of not only Rac2, but also Rac1 and decreased cell expansion in vitro in the presence of growth factors due to increased cell apoptosis. Unexpectedly, D57N expression had no effect on proliferation. In contrast, expansion of cells transduced with WT Rac2 and a dominant active mutant, Q61L, was associated with significantly increased proliferation. Transplantation of transduced bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipients showed that the percentage of D57N-containing peripheral blood cells decreased markedly from 40% at 1 month to <5% by 3 months postinjection. Neutrophils derived in vitro from the transduced progenitor cells containing D57N demonstrated markedly impaired migration and O2− responses to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, reflecting the same cellular phenotype in these differentiated cells as those described previously in patient cells. These data suggest that the phenotypic abnormalities associated with D57N Rac2 may involve not only neutrophil cellular functions, but also abnormal cell survival in other hematopoietic cells and that overexpression of Rac leads to increased proliferation of normal cells in vitro, whereas deficiency of Rac leads to increased apoptosis.

A number of studies have shown that Rho GTPases are involved in multiple cellular processes such as actin polymerization and cytoskeleton rearrangement, regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell survival. Rho GTPases were initially found to be required for the regulation of actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells. In these and subsequent studies it has been demonstrated that Rho activates the assembly of actin-myosin stress fibers and focal adhesions, Rac induces lamellipodial extension and membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 promotes filopodia or microspike formation (for review, see Refs. 3MacKay D.J.

When microinjected into fibroblasts, it has also been reported that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 stimulate cell cycle progression through G1 and DNA synthesis (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar); and expression of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 activates gene transcription via serum response factor and nuclear factor κB (11Hill C.S.

Studies of downstream signaling pathways have shown that Rac and Cdc42 are distinguished from Rho by activating c-Jun kinase, also known as stress-activated protein kinase (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-talk between Rho proteins has also been observed. Cdc42 acts as a stronger activator of Rac, and activated Rac can activate or inhibit Rho depending on the cells involved (3MacKay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol.

Very little is known about how Rho GTPases differentially orchestrate cellular processes and signaling pathways in different mammalian cell lineages. The Rac subfamily of Rho GTPases has three highly homologous members, Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3. Unlike Rac1 and Rac3, which are widely expressed, Rac2 is found only in hematopoietic cells (14Didsbury J.

In a cell-free system, both Rac recombinant proteins can reconstitute a fully active NADPH oxidase complex that produces superoxide (21Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, gene targeting studies have demonstrated that the loss of Rac2 activity decreases superoxide production in unactivated bone marrow neutrophils in response to some but not all agonists (22Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A. Pollock J.D. Borneo J.B. Bradford G.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with other previous results suggesting that Rac2 is a primary GTPase regulator in this cellular event (23Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G.M. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rac2 activity was also found to be required for neutrophil chemotaxis both in vivo and in vitro, in part because of the reduced F-actin formation in response to chemoattractants (22Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A. Pollock J.D. Borneo J.B. Bradford G.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac2-deficient mast cells display diminished cell migration in response to stem cell factor (25Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 557-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Rac2−/− mast cells also demonstrate a significant decrease in growth factor-dependent survival. Studies of kinase signaling pathways indicate that Rac2 function is required for activation of Akt downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (25Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 557-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac2 appears to be critical for the appropriate expression of Bcl2 family members Bcl-XL and BAD in these cells. Although ectopic expression of activated Rac mutants in fibroblasts has been demonstrated to stimulate cell cycle progression through G1 and subsequent DNA synthesis (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), no significant cell proliferation defect has been found in Rac2−/− neutrophils or mast cells (25Yang F.C. Kapur R. King A.J. Tao W. Kim C. Borneo J. Breese R. Marshall M. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 557-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Like all other GTPases, Rac2 functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. A number of proteins, such as guanine exchange factors (GEFs)1 and GTPase-activating proteins, regulate the ratio of GTP/GDP-bound forms which determines the activities of Rac GTPases (8Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt the cycling of the two forms of GTPases have been identified in the guanine nucleotide binding domain or the effector domain regions. These mutations have been shown in Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, and in some cases are they similar to mutations reported in Ras. Mutations at positions 12 (G12V) and 61 (Q61L) inhibit GTP hydrolysis to produce constitutively active mutants (26Xu X. Wang Y. Barry D.C. Chanock S.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and a mutation at position 17 (T17N) destabilizes the guanine nucleotide-binding site resulting in a dominant negative mutant (27Menard L. Tomhave E. Casey P.J. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, Ambruso et al. (2Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N.

Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar) identified a genetic mutation (D57N) in Rac2 GTPase which is associated with a human phagocyte immunodeficiency. The patient suffered severe recurrent infections and defective neutrophil cellular functions similar to those found in Rac2−/− mice. The patient's genotype wild type (WT) Rac2/D57N Rac2 (2Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J. Kurkchubasche A. Thurman G. Gonzalez-Aller C. Hiester A. deBoer M. Harbeck R.J. Oyer R. Johnson G.L. Roos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4654-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) was associated with normal Rac2 message levels (1Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F.C. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar) and normal cDNA sequences in 50% of cloned cDNAs (1Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F.C. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils derived from normal human bone marrow progenitor cells transduced by the cloned D57N Rac2 cDNA mimic the patient's neutrophil phenotypes of decreased cell migration and superoxide production (28Williams D.A. Smith F.O. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these data suggest that the D57N protein had a dominant negative effect on WT Rac2 protein. In addition, expression of the D57N mutant in NIH/3T3 cells, which express Rac1 but not Rac2 endogenously, resulted in dominant negative phenotypic changes in these cells, such as diminished growth, abnormal cell shape, and reduced membrane ruffling in response to PDGF. These data imply that the D57N mutant may affect the function of other Rac GTPases and that the patient's phenotype could be caused by dysfunction not only of Rac2, but also of Rac1, function. To examine carefully the biochemical and biological consequences of D57N Rac2 expression in hematopoietic cells further, we studied recombinant protein in vitro and introduced this mutant into murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Biochemical analyses show that D57N Rac2 has significantly decreased binding affinity for GTP resulting from a very rapid dissociation rate of GTP but not GDP. The mutant protein is also nonresponsive to GEF binding, suggesting that D57N Rac2 acts in a dominant negative fashion by sequestering endogenous GEFs from Rac-related Rho GTPases. To study the effects of D57N in hematopoietic cells, GST-effector pull-down assays were performed on transduced myeloid cells and demonstrated loss of both Rac1 and Rac2 activities. The biological consequences of expression of D57N include reduced cell expansion of hematopoietic cells in vitro unexpectedly not because of reduced proliferation but associated with increased apoptosis. Long term engraftment in vivo after bone marrow transplantation was also impaired significantly. As expected, neutrophils derived from D57N-transduced myeloid progenitors displayed reduced chemotaxis and superoxide generation. On the other hand, overexpression of WT Rac2 or the constitutively activated mutant Q61L was associated with increased proliferation of normal cells and slightly reduced apoptosis. Thus, D57N Rac2 appears to affect the activity of both Rac2 and Rac1. Although normal Rac2 expression and function appear critical for the growth factor-induced survival, overexpression of Rac2 is associated with increased proliferation. The data imply that Rac proteins are critical regulators of both actin function and cell survival/proliferation in hematopoietic cells. The human D57N Rac2 mutant cDNA was cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-28a at EcoRI and XhoI sites; and WT human Rac2 cDNA was cloned into the pET-15b plasmid without the 11-amino acid T7 tag (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). The Rac2 constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain as (His)6-tagged fusion proteins. Recombinant proteins were purified through the His-binding resins as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated proteins were >90% pure judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The PAK1 p21 binding domain (PBD) and cDNA of TrioN were fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the pGEX bacterial expression plasmids, respectively (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expressed proteins were isolated from glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following instructions for bulk GST purification modules given by the manufacturer. The final protein products were demonstrated to have >80% purity analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GST-PBD fusion protein was stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mdithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol at −80 °C. [γ-35S]GTP and [3H]GDP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were preloaded onto 1–2 μg of recombinant Rac2 proteins (WT and D57N) in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT for 20 min at room temperature. The labeled Rac2 protein complexes were stabilized by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. Binding of guanine nucleotides to Rac2 proteins was determined by counting radioactivity bound to filters as described previously (29Chuang T.H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,30Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation assays were performed by adding activation solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm GTP, and 5 mmMgCl2) to the preloaded reaction mixture (26Xu X. Wang Y. Barry D.C. Chanock S.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the remaining bound radioactivity was examined at different time points by filtration (Midwest Scientific, Valley Park, MO). To measure GEF-stimulated change in nucleotide binding, 1 μg of recombinant Rac2 proteins was preloaded with [3H]GDP and exchanged for cold GTP in a buffer of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm GTP with or without the addition of GEF TrioN. The remaining bound [3H]GDP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was determined at five different time points by filtration. Complex formation of His-tagged WT Rac2 and D57N Rac2 with GST-TrioN was carried out as described for the Dbl-G-protein interactions (31Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of purified (His)6-WT Rac2 or (His)6-D57N Rac2 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton 100, and 1 mm DTT was incubated with 2 μg of GST or GST-TrioN immobilized on agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. The coprecipitates were washed three times with the incubation buffer and were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis using anti-His polyclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence reagents. WT mouse Rac2 and mutant Rac2 (human D57N and Q61L) cDNAs were cloned into a modified murine stem cell virus-based bicistronic vector (MIEG3; (1Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F.C. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar)) at unique EcoRI and XhoI sites. The resultant retroviral plasmids were introduced into a Phoenix-ampho packaging cell line (American Type Culture Collection) cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% glutamine, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The viral supernatant derived from the transfected Phoenix-ampho cells was used to establish stable GP+E86-derived producer clones for MIEG3, WT Rac2, D57N, and Q61L Rac2 as described in Williams et al. (1Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F.C. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The titers of viral supernatants collected from different stable E86 clones were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) analysis using the method reported by Felts et al. (48Felts K. Bauer J.C. Vaillancourt P. strategies. 1999; 12: 74-77Google Scholar). High titer E86 clones (>1 × 105/ml) were used to collect viral supernatant to infect mouse bone marrow cells. Whole bone marrow was collected from WT and Rac2−/− mice 48 h after treatment with 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg of body weight; American Pharmaceutical Partners, Los Angeles, CA) and was resuspended in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). LDBM cells were isolated from fresh BM by centrifugation on Histopaque-1083 (Sigma) gradient for 30 min at 1,500 rpm at room temperature. Cells at the interface were collected and washed twice with RPMI and then counted on a hemocytometer. 20 million LDBM cells were plated on a 10-cm non-tissue culture Petri dish and prestimulated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% penicillin and streptomycin, cytokines (100 ng/ml hG-CSF, 100 ng/ml MGDF, 100 ng/ml SCF, all from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) (complete medium), for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Virus-mediated LDBM transduction was performed as described previously (32Hanenberg H. Hashino K. Konishi H. Hock R.A. Kato I. Williams D.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 2193-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were infected by viral supernatant overnight on CH296 (Tokara Shuzo Co., Japan)-coated six-well plates. The infected cells were kept in culture with complete RPMI medium for 48 h. Cells were subsequently analyzed and sorted for green fluorescence using a FACScan or FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson). Transduced and enhanced green florescence protein positive (EGFP+) BM cells were immunoblotted using mouse antibodies for Rac2 (1:5,000, a gift from Dr. Gary Bokoch, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA), Rac1 (23A8, 1:2,000, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Olacid, NY), Cdc42 (sc87G, 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and total p38 (1:2,000, New England Biolabs). For GST-effector pulldown assays, in vitro transduced and cultured bone marrow cells (cytokine-stimulated, 1 × 106 cells/assay) were incubated with 2 × lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, all from Roche, Indianapolis, IN) on ice. The lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. For in vitro guanine nucleotide binding, cell lysates were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 100 μm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP. The loading was stopped by the addition of MgCl2 to 30 mm (30Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crude or guanine nucleotide-loaded cell lysates (100 μl) were added to 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), 10 μg of PAK1 PBD-GST recombinant protein, and 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed twice with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and 3 times with washing buffer without detergent. The bead pellets were finally resuspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Each sample was analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted by specific antibodies for Rac1 (1:2,000) and Cdc42 (1:2,000). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (1:2,500, New England Biolabs). The immunoblots were detected by New England Biolabs Luminol kit and Kodak Biomax film. After cell sorting, infected BM cells were >95% EGFP+. For liquid culture, 1 × 105 cells (expressing MIEG3, WT Rac2, D57N, and Q61L, respectively) were seeded on a 24-well tissue culture plate in complete RPMI medium. Cells were enumerated by a hemocytometer every 2 days. For colony-forming assays, 1 × 104/ml cells were plated in triplicate in methylcellulose (Stem Cell Technology, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 100 ng/ml hG-CSF, 100 ng/ml MGDF, 100 ng/ml SCF, and 10 ng/ml murine interleukin-3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and incubated for 7 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Colonies were enumerated and scored for size under an inverted microscope at day 7. To examine cell proliferation, 5 × 104 cells/well in 200 μl of complete RPMI were plated on the 96-well plate (six wells for each sample). Cells were incubated with 1 μCi [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before being harvested on a cell harvester (Packard Instrument, Meriden, CT). The retained radioactivity on the filter was counted by the scintillation counter (Beckman/Coulter, Fulleton, CA) as described (33Yee N.S. Paek I. Besmer P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine the frequency of apoptotic cells, 1 × 105 cells (in vitro cultured in the complete RPMI medium) in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2) were stained with either 1 μg of propidium iodide (PI; Calbiochem)/100 μl of cells for 10 min on ice in dark, or 3 μl of annexin V-biotin/100 μl of cells for 30 min on ice followed by 2 μl of streptavidin-PE (all from PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed twice in 1 × PBS and were analyzed by flow cytometry on FACScan. For TUNEL assay, 2 × 106 cells were fixed in 200 μl of a freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (2% in PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed in 1 × PBS once and resuspended in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. The prefixed cells were labeled with an in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red (Roche), and analyzed by flow cytometry on FACScan. Transduced BM cells were cultured in the complete RPMI medium with cytokines for 7 days, and 105 cells were then stained for myeloid cell lineage markers Gr-1 (1 μl of PE-Ly6G/100 μl of cells, PharMingen) and Mac1 (0.2 μl of PE-CD11b/100 μl of cells, PharMingen). More than 90% of the cells showed both Gr-1+ and Mac1+ on FACS analysis. Chemotaxis of in vitro differentiated myeloid cells (Gr-1+, Mac1+, and GFP+) was performed using a modified Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc., Cabin John, MD) as described in Roberts et al. (22Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A. Pollock J.D. Borneo J.B. Bradford G.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Williams D.A.

In the present report the physiological role of the syntaxin 1-glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2) interaction has been investigated by using a brain-derived preparation. Previous studies, focused on syntaxin 1-transporter interactions using overexpression systems, led to the postulation that syntaxin is somehow implicated in protein trafficking. Since syntaxin 1 is involved in exocytosis of neurotransmitter and also interacts with GLYT2, we stimulated exocytosis in synaptosomes and examined its effect on surface-expression and transport activity of GLYT2. We found that, under conditions that stimulate vesicular glycine release, GLYT2 is rapidly trafficked first toward the plasma membrane and then internalized. When the same experiments were performed with synaptosomes inactivated for syntaxin 1 by a pretreatment with the neurotoxin Bont/C, GLYT2 was unable to reach the plasma membrane but still was able to leave it. These results indicate the existence of a SNARE-mediated regulatory mechanism that controls the surface-expression of GLYT2. Syntaxin 1 is involved in the arrival to the plasma membrane but not in the retrieval. Furthermore, by using immunogold labeling on purified preparations from synaptosomes, we demonstrate that GLYT2 is present in small synaptic-like vesicles. GLYT2-containing vesicles may represent neurotransmitter transporter that is being trafficked.

Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter mainly present in brainstem and spinal cord, where it plays a role in a variety of motor and sensory functions. Apart from its inhibitory effect on glycinergic neurons, glycine modulates the action of glutamate on theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. After the release of glycine, high affinity reuptake mechanisms play an important role in the removal of glycine from the extracellular space, thereby terminating the neurotransmission signal. The uptake of glycine is accomplished by two high affinity glycine transporters, GLYT1 and GLYT2. Both transporters have been cloned (7Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Hartig P.R. Branchek T. Weinshank R.L.

Neurobiol. 1997; 14: 117-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The fine tuning of reuptake mechanisms are thought to control the duration of the neurotransmission signal and therefore the overall synaptic action (13Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 15: 606-612Crossref Scopus (2025) Google Scholar). Protein trafficking plays a key role in the regulation of many aspects of neuronal function, and certainly many data point to the fact that neurotransmitter transporters are also regulated by protein redistribution mechanisms (14Buckley K.M. Melikian H.E. Provoda C.J. Waring M.T. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recently we reported the interaction between the glycine transporters and syntaxin 1 (16Geerlings A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 17: 51-54Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This interaction was found to be similar to those reported for the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 (17Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the N- and Q-type calcium channels (18Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride channel (19Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All these studies have in common that syntaxin 1 overexpression decreased the currents in the channels or the transport rate in the transporters. The emerging view from these studies is that syntaxin 1 somehow interferes in protein trafficking (16Geerlings A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 17: 51-54Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fact that syntaxin 1 is also involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane during the release of neurotransmitter made us study the relation between exocytosis and GLYT2 trafficking, both in the presence and absence of functional syntaxin 1. Here we show that a treatment that induces glycine release in synaptosomes also stimulates the fast arrival of GLYT2 to the plasma membrane, which is immediately followed by an internalization of the transporter. The trafficking of GLYT2 toward and from the plasma membrane might be supported by its localization in synaptic-like vesicles. We furthermore demonstrate that the arrival, but not the retrieval, of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane is mediated by syntaxin 1. The Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins Bont/C and Bont/B were purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Antibodies against syntaxin 1 (clone SP6) and Na+/K+ ATPase (clone C464.6) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-synaptophysin (clone SP15) was from Calbiochem, and anti-transferrin receptor was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). GLYT2 antibodies have been characterized (21Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were purified from rat (3 months old, male) brainstem and spinal cord as described (22Nagy A. Delgado-Escueta A.V. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and resuspended in ice-cold HBM buffer (Hepes-buffered medium, composition in mm: NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, Na2HPO4 1.2, NaHCO3 5, glucose 10, and HEPES-NaOH 20, pH 7.4). This buffer was used as a Ca2+-free medium. The preparation was then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with or without neurotoxin (80 nm Bont/C or 80 nm Bont/B) and immediately used in experiments. Synaptic vesicles were isolated from rat (3 months old, male) brainstem and spinal cord as described (23Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Instead of the last purification step (controlled pore glass chromatography), a flotation density gradient was performed (24Diebler M.F. Lazereg S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, crude synaptosomes (P2) were prepared by differential centrifugation (10 min at 800 ×g, followed by 15 min at 9200 × g on the first supernatant) and lysed by a hypoosmotic shock. After differential centrifugation (20 min at 25,000 × g, supernatant was taken and centrifuged for 2 h at 165,000 × g), the obtained pellet was resuspended in 40 mm sucrose. This preparation is referred to as crude synaptic vesicles (lysate of P2). This fraction was then further purified by a continuous (50–800 mm) sucrose gradient. After centrifugation (3 h at 65,000g), the 200–400 mm sucrose band was taken and 2m sucrose was added to give a final concentration of 1m. This sample was then transferred to a tube and subjected to a flotation gradient by adding the following amounts of sucrose on top of the sample: 6 ml of 800 mm, 6 ml of 600 mm, 6 ml of 380 mm, and 6 ml of 250 mm. After centrifugation (3 h at 27,000 ×g), the band at the 600–380 mm sucrose interface was taken, and the membranes isolated by centrifugation (2 h at 165,000 × g). Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of glycine buffer (300 mm glycine, 5 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.3). During the purification, three samples were taken for Western blot analysis corresponding to crude synaptosomes (P2), crude synaptic vesicles (LP2), and purified synaptic vesicles (SV). A suspension of synaptosomes (0.5 mg/ml of protein) in HBM buffer was preloaded with 150 nm radiolabeled glycine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min. After centrifugation (3 min, 10,000 × g), the synaptosomes were washed 3 times with HBM. Release of [3H]glycine was then evoked at 37 °C by the addition of 1 mm 4-aminopyridine and 5 mm CaCl2 (final concentrations). After several time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 min), an aliquot (0.1 mg of protein) was taken and immediately transferred to ice. Medium and synaptosomes were then separated by centrifugation (3 min, 10,000 × g), followed by washing the synaptosomes three times with ice-cold HBM buffer. Synaptosomes were finally resuspended in 200 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. The [3H]glycine present in the medium and in the resuspended synaptosomes was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Transport assays were performed at 37 °C in HBM buffer as described (25López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Synaptosomes (0.5 mg/ml of protein) were incubated with 150 nm[3H]glycine in a glass tube under continuous agitation. Assays were performed in the presence of 1 mm sarcosine to block glycine transport by GLYT1. After 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 min of incubation, a sample (0.1 mg of protein) from the tube was taken and immediately transferred to ice. After centrifugation (3 min, 10,000 × g), the synaptosomes were washed three times with ice-cold HBM. Finally the synaptosomes were lysed in 0.2m NaOH and the [3H]glycine present counted on a liquid scintillation counter. In kinetic parameter determinations, glycine concentrations ranging from 150 nm to 100 μm were used in a 1-min transport assay. All assays were done in triplicate. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford, M. M. (1976) 72, 248–254.Google Scholar). At time point 0, 4-aminopyridine and CaCl2 (final concentrations of 1 and 5 mm, respectively) were added to a suspension of synaptosomes (0.5 mg/ml in HBM). Immediately, at the indicated time points, aliquots (0.1 mg of protein) were manually taken with a pipette and transferred to a tube containing 1 ml of ice-cold HBM to stop all trafficking events. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged (3 min, 10,000 ×g), and the synaptosomes washed once with ice-cold HBM and then resuspended in 1 ml of HBM containing the cell membrane impermeable reagent sulfo-N-succinimidyl-6-biotinamidohexanoate (2 mg/ml, Pierce), and an incubation for 1 h at 4 °C was performed. Then, the excess of reagent was quenched by adding lysine (100 mmfinal concentration) and the incubation was continued for another 10 min. Samples were centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 × g), and the pellets were washed twice with HBM and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The biotinylated proteins were then incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-agarose beads and precipitated by centrifugation (Sigma). The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting (25López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified on a model 300A densitometer in combination with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) by using film exposures that were in the linear range. Standard errors in biotinylation studies were calculated after densitometry from at least four separate experiments. To test the biotinylation procedure, samples from different synaptosomal preparations were taken and subjected to biotinylation. Streptavidin-precipitated proteins were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against intracellular proteins (e.g. syntaxin 1 and synaptophysin). We never found immunoreactivity against intracellular proteins in biotinylated fractions, which indicated that only plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated using the above described protocol. Purified synaptic vesicles were attached to collodion carbon-coated electron microscopy grids, previously made hydrophilic by glow discharge. These grids were placed on drops of a synaptic vesicle suspension (0.7 mg/ml in glycine buffer; 300 mm glycine, 5 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.3) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. After removal of excess liquid, the absorbed material was fixed by incubation with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in TBS (30 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.2) for 2 min. Grids were then incubated for 10 min in TBG (TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% gelatin) to block nonspecific binding. Subsequently the grids were transferred to drops of anti-synaptophysin (1/10 dilution) or anti-GLYT2 (1/2 dilution) and incubated for 1 h. This step was omitted in control incubations. Then, after several washes with TBG, the grids were incubated for another 45 min with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm colloidal gold or 10-nm gold-protein A conjugate for anti-synaptophysin or anti-GLYT2, respectively. Both secondary antibodies (Biocell Research Laboratory, Cardiff, United Kingdom) were diluted 1/40 in TBG. Grids were then washed three times in TBS, followed by three washes in glycine buffer, and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in TBS for 2 min. Finally the grids were negatively stained for 40 s in a 2% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. Samples were examined in a JEM-1010 electron microscope, and pictures were taken using a 792 Bioscan digital camera (Gatan Inc., Warrendale, PA). The starting point of the present study was to delineate the physiological role of the interaction between syntaxin 1 and the glycine transporter GLYT2. Since syntaxin 1 plays a crucial role in the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and also interacts with several neurotransmitter transporters, we decided to stimulate exocytosis in a brain-derived preparation and study its effect on the glycine transporter GLYT2, both in the presence and the absence of functional syntaxin 1. The last is possible by inactivating syntaxin 1 in vivo with Bont/C, a neurotoxin that specifically cleaves syntaxin 1 (27Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). For these studies purified sealed synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) were used because these allow the treatment of Bont/C and additionally contain the complete functional machinery of exocytosis and reuptake of neurotransmitters. Synaptosomes were prepared from rat spinal cord and brainstem because it has been reported that GLYT2, the model transporter in our studies, is abundant in neurons from these areas (28Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were preloaded with [3H]glycine, and calcium-dependent exocytosis was provoked by plasma membrane depolarization using 4-aminopyridine in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. 4-Aminopyridine blocks certain voltage-gated K+ channels, causing spontaneous repetitive firing in synaptosomes and a sustained rise in synaptosomal free Ca2+ concentration (29Tibbs G.R. Barrie A.P. Van Mieghem F.J. McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 30Tibbs G.R. Dolly J.O. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that 4-aminopyridine closely mimicked physiological stimulation of calcium channels, resulting in a calcium influx (31Nichols R.A. Suplick G.R. Brown J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23817-23823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment provoked a release of [3H]glycine from synaptosomes (Fig.1), whereas no release was measured when 4-aminopyridine or extracellular calcium were added individually (data not shown). A 30-min preincubation of the synaptosomes with 1.0 μm bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the V-ATPase that prevents the entrance of neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles (32Cousin M.A. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), strongly reduced the release of [3H]glycine (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that the release of [3H]glycine from the synaptosomes is mainly due to exocytosis of [3H]glycine-filled synaptic vesicles. Accordingly, preincubation of synaptosomes with Bont/C resulted in an inhibition of [3H]glycine release, and a partial (approximately 55%) proteolysis of syntaxin 1 (Fig. 1, inset). It has been reported that Bont/C causes a 60% maximal breakdown of syntaxin 1 in synaptosomes, and that this is sufficient to completely block vesicular neurotransmitter release (27Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This study was performed on the glycine transporter GLYT2, which, in contrast to isoform 1, is mainly neuronal (28Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows the time course of [3H]glycine transport in synaptosomes at a concentration of 150 nm [3H]glycine. The uptake of [3H]glycine was completely abolished in the absence of chloride ions in the uptake assay (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that low affinity glycine transport systems, which do not depend on Cl− ions (33Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), do not contribute to glycine transport. Additionally, all transport assays were carried out in the presence of sarcosine, a specific inhibitor of GLYT1. Therefore, glycine transport in our experiments is mainly due to the activity of GLYT2. A 90-min pre-treatment of synaptosomes with 80 nmBont/C reduced glycine transport by approximately 50% (Fig.2 A). A pre-treatment with Bont/B, a neurotoxin that blocks neurotransmitter release by proteolytic cleavage of VAMP (34Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), reduced glycine uptake in a similar way as Bont/C did (Fig. 2 A). Kinetic constants measurements showed that Bont/C treatment mainly affected the Vmax of GLYT2 (Km = 26.7 ± 1.3 μm andVmax = 4.39 ± 0.18 μmol/mg of protein/min for control synaptosomes, and Km = 20.1 ± 0.4 μm and Vmax = 2.27 ± 0.14 μmol/mg of protein/min for Bont/C-treated synaptosomes). Changes in Vmax are usually indicative for changes in the number of plasma resident transporters; therefore, surface biotinylation experiments were performed to study this issue in more detail. These studies revealed a reduction in GLYT2-surface immunoreactivity after Bont/C (55% of control) or Bont/B (65% of control) treatment (Fig. 2 B), which explains the observed inhibition in glycine uptake after neurotoxin treatment. This is in agreement with that found for the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 in hippocampal cultures, where GAT1 partially disappeared from the plasma membrane after Bont/C incubation (35Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our results show that two SNARE proteins (syntaxin 1 and VAMP) somehow control the number of GLYT2 proteins on the plasma membrane. To determine why GLYT2 disappears partly from the plasma membrane, we hypothesized that neurotoxin treatment might interfere in GLYT2 trafficking and impede the transporter to reach the plasma membrane. To study this issue, we analyzed in more detail surface expression of GLYT2 in Bont/C-treated and non-treated synaptosomes. As syntaxin 1 is both involved in exocytosis and in the regulation of GLYT2, we provoked plasma membrane depolarization in synaptosomes by addition of 4-aminopyridine and extracellular calcium, and studied its effect on GLYT2 trafficking by biotinylation. 4-Aminopyridine and CaCl2 were added to a suspension of synaptosomes, and, at different time points, samples were taken and placed on ice. Subsequently, the synaptosomes in these samples were subjected to biotinylation and the amount of GLYT2 present on the plasma membrane revealed by Western blotting with GLYT2 antibodies. Fig. 3 shows that GLYT2 disappeared gradually from the plasma membrane during conditions of sustained exocytosis. This effect reached a maximum after 15 min and was not seen when 4-aminopyridine or CaCl2 were individually added (data not shown). Then, after 15 min of incubation, the remaining extracellular calcium was removed by washing with EGTA, and the synaptosomes were incubated for another 15 min in the absence of 4-aminopyridine and Ca2+. This treatment resulted in a re-incorporation of GLYT2 into the plasma membrane of control synaptosomes, although not completely to the level at the beginning of the experiment. Even after longer incubation times, the starting level could not be reached (Fig. 3). This may be explained by the fact that EGTA only removes extracellular calcium and does not affect intracellular levels. Anyhow, this experiment clearly shows that plasma membrane depolarization in the presence of extracellular calcium results in a removal of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane on a minute time scale, and that removal of the extracellular calcium partly reverses this effect. When this experiment was performed with synaptosomes pretreated with Bont/C, GLYT2 was still able to leave the plasma membrane after depolarization, but lost its capacity to return after EGTA washing (Fig. 3). This last result demonstrates that syntaxin 1 is necessary in the arrival and the incorporation of GLYT2 into the plasma membrane, and is not involved in the removal of the transporter from the plasma membrane. This may also explain why GLYT2 is less abundant on the plasma membrane after Bont/C incubations (Fig. 2 B). During the 90-min preincubation with Bont/C, GLYT2 proteins are able to leave the plasma membrane, but are subsequently unable to return, resulting in an overall removal of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane after the preincubation. To test if calcium also has a fast effect on GLYT2 trafficking, we examined, in an experiment similar to that described above, what happened to GLYT2 in the first few seconds after plasma membrane depolarization and calcium influx. When 4-aminopyridine and CaCl2 were added to synaptosomes at 37 °C, a slight decrease in the amount of GLYT2 present on the plasma membrane was immediately observed (data not shown). However, when the same experiment was performed at 25 °C, an immediate up-regulation was seen directly after stimulation (Fig. 4). This effect was most prominent after the first second of incubation with 4-aminopyridine and CaCl2, and was not detected when 4-aminopyridine and CaCl2 were individually added (data not shown). The biotinylation method chosen to study this fast arrival of GLYT2 to the plasma membrane allows to take samples as soon as 1 s, but it is not possible to study this phenomenon during the first second. This is probably the reason why this effect was not observed at 37 °C because, at this temperature, the process is most likely much faster and over when the first sample was taken. Nonetheless, with this method, we were able to detect an immediate increase in the number of GLYT2 on the plasma membrane by a factor of approximately 2.4 (2.4 ± 0.6; n = 4). This increase is immediately followed by a retrieval of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane, as was already demonstrated in Fig. 3. When the experiment was performed at 25 °C with synaptosomes previously treated with Bont/C, this rapid increase was not observed, again demonstrating that syntaxin 1 is necessary for GLYT2 to arrive to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). The active trafficking of GLYT2 toward and from the plasma membrane prompted us to investigate if GLYT2 is being transported by small vesicles. Therefore, crude synaptosomes were lysed and the synaptic vesicle population purified. During the purification, several samples were taken and analyzed by Western blotting. Fig.5 A demonstrates the enrichment of the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin in the purified fraction. On the other hand, no plasma membrane contamination was present in the purified synaptic vesicle preparation since no Na+/K+ ATPase could be detected after the purification. Immunoblots using an endosomal marker (transferrin receptor) showed that fraction SV was almost free of endosomal membranes. Syntaxin 1 was found to recycle with synaptic vesicles (36Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which explains why this SNARE protein was present in the purified synaptic vesicle fraction. Interestingly, we detected GLYT2 immunoreactivity in the purified fraction (Fig. 5 A), although GLYT2 immunoreactivity was not enriched, suggesting that most of GLYT2 is present on the plasma membrane or on other intracellular compartments. Immunogold detection using anti-GLYT2 confirmed the presence of GLYT2 in small (40–60-nm) synaptic-like vesicles (Fig.5 B). Approximately 5–10% of the vesicles were labeled with anti-GLYT2, whereas synaptophysin-immunogold labeling on the same vesicle preparation demonstrated that this synaptic vesicle marker was present in most (80–90%) of the vesicles (Fig. 5 C). These experiments show for the first time GLYT2 immunoreactivity in small synaptic-like vesicles, although the precise nature of these GLYT2-containing vesicles has yet to be determined. In the present study, we have shown that treatment of synaptosomes with an agent that promotes plasma membrane depolarization in the presence of extracellular calcium stimulates the arrival of the neuronal glycine transporter GLYT2 to the plasma membrane, and that this effect is immediately followed by an internalization of the transporter. The arrival, but not the removal, of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane is mediated by syntaxin 1 and probably other SNARE proteins. Moreover, the present data demonstrate that GLYT2 is present in synaptic-like vesicles, which might represent GLYT2 that is being trafficked. These results reveal the close correlation between release and uptake of neurotransmitter. Recently the proline transporter was found to be localized in synaptic vesicles (37Renick S.E. Kleven D.T. Chan J. Stenius K. Milner T.A. Pickel V.M. Fremeau Jr., R.T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the noradrenaline transporter in secretory granules of PC12 cells (38Kippenberger A.G. Palmer D.J. Comer A.M. Lipski J. Burton L.D. Christie D.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both neurotransmitter transporters belong to the same family as the glycine transporters and are thought to be responsible for the clearance of, respectively, proline and noradrenaline from the extracellular space. Here data are presented that indicate GLYT2 is also present in synaptic-like vesicles. At present, it is not known whether transporters and neurotransmitters share the same vesicles or use specialized individual vesicles. Nonetheless, a coordination in the exocytosis of such vesicles should exist making a connection between release of neurotransmitter and its reuptake by transporters. The observation that the number of GLYT2 proteins on the plasma membrane rapidly augments after membrane depolarization of nerve terminals now strengthens this hypothesis of an exocytotic-like transportation of neurotransmitter transporters from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Jayanthi et al. (39Jayanthi L.D. Wilson J.J. Montalvo J. DeFelice L.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) described a fast and slow effect of calcium on the substrate-induced currents mediated by the proline transporter. These experiments, however, were done in transfected HEK cells, a cell line not known to have a specialized exocytotic machinery. Additionally, previous work on the serotonin transporter expressed in JAR cells also showed a long term inhibition of calcium on the transport rate. This inhibition reached 85% after 1 h of incubation with the calmodulin antagonist CGS 9343B and was found to affect mainly the Vmax of the serotonin transporter (40Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in Vmax is usually indicative for a reduction in the number of transporters on the plasma membrane. Taking all these data together, it seems that the long term effect of calcium on the neurotransmitter transporters might be modulated by protein kinases. This idea is strengthened by the fact that activation of protein kinase C resulted in an inhibition of glycine transport in glioblastoma cells (41Gomeza J. Zafra F. Olivares L. Giménez C. Aragón C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); moreover, other neurotransmitter transporters that belong to the same family as GLYT2, like the serotonin and dopamine transporters and GAT1, were found to be internalized upon protein kinase C mediation (42Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 43Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol.

Fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, followed by the compensatory endocytosis, induces the redistribution of certain proteins present on the plasma membrane. This was recently found to be the case for several SNARE proteins, e.g. syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (45Boudier J.A. Martin-Moutot N. Boudier J.L. Iborra C. Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3449-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These SNAREs, which are mainly present on the plasma membrane, are internalized with vesicle proteins during endocytosis coupled to exocytosis and are subsequently re-inserted into the plasma membrane although at different rates (45Boudier J.A. Martin-Moutot N. Boudier J.L. Iborra C. Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3449-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the dopamine transporter was recently found to be internalized upon protein kinase C activation and targeted to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (43Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 46Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dynamin-dependent mechanism might also be used by GLYT2 during coupled exocytosis/endocytosis. Future work, however, should clarify the exact mechanism by which GLYT2 and possibly other neurotransmitter transporters are being trafficked to and from the plasma membrane upon calcium activation. The co-localization of GLYT2 and syntaxin 1 on the neuronal plasma membrane and the functional and physical interaction between these two membrane proteins suggested a physiological role for this interaction (16Geerlings A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 17: 51-54Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GLYT2 and syntaxin 1 in COS cells resulted in an internalization of the transporter (16Geerlings A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 17: 51-54Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here obtained from a brain-derived preparation demonstrate that syntaxin 1 does not stimulate internalization of the transporter but is involved in its arrival to the plasma membrane. These seemingly different results might be explained by a disruption in the equilibrium of the SNARE system caused by overexpression of syntaxin 1, which may vary the rate of exocytosis, protein trafficking, or even compete with native SNARE proteins (20Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Deken et al. (35Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) proposed both a trafficking and a functional inhibitory role for syntaxin 1 in GAT1 regulation, and both processes might be separated in place and time. It could well be that this also holds for GLYT2, although future experiments may unravel the details of this possible dual role for syntaxin 1. To conform to the results presented previously for GAT1, where syntaxin 1 was proposed to be a positive regulator for GAT1 expression (35Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we now propose that syntaxin 1 is involved in the arrival and insertion of GLYT2 into the plasma membrane. These results demonstrated a syntaxin 1 involvement both in the fast arrival of GLYT2 after plasma membrane depolarization, as well as in calcium-independent arrival of GLYT2 to the plasma membrane. The last became evident from the results presented in Fig. 3. After endocytosis of GLYT2 and subsequent EGTA washing, GLYT2 was unable to return to the plasma membrane in Bont/C-treated synaptosomes, in contrast to non-treated synaptosomes. We have shown here that calcium controls the number of GLYT2 proteins on the plasma membrane and that at least two SNARE proteins (syntaxin 1 and VAMP) are involved in GLYT2 trafficking. The results, therefore, suggest that GLYT2 trafficking is accomplished by a process where GLYT2-containing vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane. Previous studies revealed a direct physical contact between syntaxin 1 and GLYT2 (16Geerlings A. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 17: 51-54Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), similar to the one found for GAT1 (35Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, these interactions reduced transport rates in both transporters, suggesting a regulatory inhibitory function for syntaxin 1. From the results presented here, however, it does not become clear if GLYT2 trafficking and its incorporation into the plasma membrane requires a direct interaction between the transporter and syntaxin 1. However, it seems reasonable to think that fusion of GLYT2-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, like synaptic vesicle fusion, requires only SNARE proteins, and therefore the syntaxin 1-GLYT2 interaction might only play a role in the inhibitory function of syntaxin 1. In conclusion, calcium seems to have two effects on the arrival and the retrieval of the glycine transporter GLYT2 toward and from the plasma membrane. First, it causes a fast syntaxin 1-dependent increase in the concentration of GLYT2 on the plasma membrane. This up-regulation is directly followed by a removal of GLYT2 from the plasma membrane under sustained exocytotic conditions. At the moment, we can only speculate about the physiological role of these processes. It could well be that the nerve terminal regulates in this way the duration of the neurotransmission signal, both in the short term and the long term. For the short term regulation of GLYT2, it seems reasonable to think that during fast neurotransmission more GLYT2 might be transiently needed to clear the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft in an efficient way, keeping the neurotransmitter signal short. On the other hand, the long term down-regulation of GLYT2 might result in a longer presence of glycine in the synaptic cleft in situations of sustained exocytosis. Within this context, it has been proposed that the redistribution of membrane proteins may play an important role in synaptic plasticity (15Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Renick S.E. Kleven D.T. Chan J. Stenius K. Milner T.A. Pickel V.M. Fremeau Jr., R.T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Without any doubt, many data now point to the fact that the fine tuning of neurotransmitter transporters is crucial in neurotransmission; as shown in this and other reports, this mechanism should be controlled tightly in space and time.

Many potential iPLA2β functions have been proposed, including a signaling role in β-cell insulin secretion and a role in generating lysophosphatidylcholine acceptors for arachidonic acid incorporation into P388D1 cell phosphatidylcholine (PC). Proposals for iPLA2β function rest in part on effects of inhibiting iPLA2β activity with a bromoenol lactone (BEL) suicide substrate, but BEL also inhibits phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1 and a group VIB phospholipase A2. Manipulation of iPLA2β expression by molecular biologic means is an alternative approach to study iPLA2β functions, and we have used a retroviral construct containing iPLA2β cDNA to prepare two INS-1 insulinoma cell clonal lines that stably overexpress iPLA2β. Compared with parental INS-1 cells or cells transfected with empty vector, both iPLA2β-overexpressing lines exhibit amplified insulin secretory responses to glucose and cAMP-elevating agents, and BEL substantially attenuates stimulated secretion. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses of arachidonic acid incorporation into INS-1 cell PC indicate that neither overexpression nor inhibition of iPLA2β affects the rate or extent of this process in INS-1 cells. Immunocytofluorescence studies with antibodies directed against iPLA2β indicate that cAMP-elevating agents increase perinuclear fluorescence in INS-1 cells, suggesting that iPLA2β associates with nuclei. These studies are more consistent with a signaling than with a housekeeping role for iPLA2β in insulin-secreting β-cells.

We report here the preparation of two stably transfected insulinoma cell lines that overexpress iPLA2β. We have studied insulin secretory responses, arachidonate incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, and iPLA2β subcellular location in these lines. ECL detection reagents and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphatidylcholine standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and arachidonic acid from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). BEL iPLA2 suicide substrate (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Tissue culture media (CMRL-1066, RPMI, and minimal essential medium), penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, andl-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT) and Pentex bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid-free, fraction V) from ICN Biomedical (Aurora, OH). ATP, ampicillin, IBMX, propranolol, and kanamycin were obtained from Sigma and forskolin from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. INS-1 insulinoma cells provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (University of Texas, Dallas, TX) were cultured as described (56Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Fillous C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B.

RetroPack PT 67 cells (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 mg/ml glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A retroviral system (59Coffin J.M. Varmus H.E. Retrovirus. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar, 60Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to stably transfect INS-1 cells with iPLA2β cDNA and achieve overexpression. To construct the retroviral vector, iPLA2β cDNA (10Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J.L. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) was subcloned into EcoRI-BglII multiple cloning sites of pMSCVneo vector using the CLONTECH murine stem cell retrovirus (MSCV) expression system. Full-length rat pancreatic islet iPLA2β cDNA was excised from pBK-CMV-iPLA2β vector and subcloned into the retroviral vector pMSCVneo at the recognition sites for restriction endonucleasesEcoRI and XhoI. The construct containing the iPLA2β cDNA (pMSCVneo-iPLA2β) was transfected into CLONTECH RetroPack PT 67 packaging cells with a GenePORTER transfection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Upon transfection of packaging cells, pMSCVneo integrated into the genome and expressed a transcript containing viral packaging signal, a neomycin resistance gene that confers resistance to the selection agent G418, and iPLA2β cDNA. This transcript is recognized by viral proteins in packaging cells. Introduction of pMSCVneo-iPLA2β into PT 67 cells results in production of high titer, replication-incompetent infectious virus particles that were released into the culture medium, collected, and used to infect INS-1 cells. INS-1 cells were plated on 100-mm Petri dishes at a density of 3–5 × 105 cells/plate 12–18 h before infection. Freshly collected, retrovirus-containing medium was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and added to INS-1 cell monolayers. Polybrene (final concentration 4 μg/ml) was added to culture medium, and medium was replaced after 24 h of incubation. To select stably transfected cells that expressed high levels of iPLA2β, retrovirally infected cells were cultured with G418 (0.4 mg/ml) for 1–2 weeks. After G418-resistant colonies became apparent, cell culture was continued for several days. Individual colonies were transferred to a 48-well plate for expansion of clonal cells. Two iPLA2β-overexpressing (iPLA2-X) lines were obtained that exhibit similar properties not shared by parental cells or clonal lines selected after transfection with empty vector. Seeded INS-1 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached by trituration. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication (Vibra Cell High Intensity Processor, five 1-s pulses, amplitude 12%) in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 40 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.1, 4 °C). Homogenates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) to yield a cytosolic supernatant. Protein content was measured with Coomassie regent (Pierce) against bovine serum albumin standard. Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity in aliquots of cytosol (25 μg of protein) was assayed by ethanolic injection (5 μl) of 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (final concentration 5 μm) in assay buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA; total volume 200 μl). Assay mixtures were incubated (3 min, 37 °C, with shaking) and reactions terminated by adding butanol (0.1 ml) and vortexing. After centrifugation (2,000 × g, 5 min), products in the butanol layer were analyzed by silica gel G TLC in petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80/20/1). The TLC plate region containing free fatty acid was identified with iodine vapor and scraped into a scintillation vial. Released [14C]fatty acid was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and PLA2specific activity was calculated from dpm of released fatty acid and protein content as described (61Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). INS-1 cell cytosolic proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane that was subsequently blocked (3 h, room temperature) with Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (TBS-T, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk protein. The blot was then washed (TBS-T, 5 min, five times) and incubated (1 h, room temperature) with a polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution in TBS-T) to iPLA2β generated by multiple antigen core technology against peptides in the iPLA2β deduced amino acid sequence, as described below. The nylon membrane was then washed in TBS-T (5 min, five times) and incubated (1 h, room temperature) with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish"

N-Bak is generated by neuron-specific splicing of a novel 20-base pair exon, which changes the previously described Bak, containing Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains BH1, BH2, and BH3, into a shorter BH3-only protein. As demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection assay, N-Bak transcripts are expressed only in central and peripheral neurons, but not in other cells, whereas the previously described Bak is expressed ubiquitously, but not in neurons. Neonatal sympathetic neurons microinjected with N-Bak resisted apoptotic death caused by nerve growth factor (NGF) removal, whereas microinjectedBak accelerated NGF deprivation-induced death. Overexpressed Bak killed sympathetic neurons in the presence of NGF, whereas N-Bak did not. N-Bak was, however, still death-promoting when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells. Thus, N-Bak is an anti-apoptotic BH3-only protein, but only in the appropriate cellular environment. This is the first example of a neuron-specific Bcl-2 family member.

Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). In the developing nervous system, for example, 30–80% of the initially produced neurons die, mostly due to deficiency of neurotrophic factors that neutralize the death program in neurons (2Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 3Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The cells of an organism retain a potential to die apoptotically during their entire lifetime (4Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Apoptotic pathways are therefore delicately balanced and controlled positively and negatively at several levels (5Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6233) Google Scholar). The life and death decisions of a cell are critically controlled by the proteins of the Bcl-2 family that are either anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic. When overexpressed, anti-apoptotic members protect cells against death stimuli, and their lack in vivo promotes developmental death or sensitivity to death stimuli. Conversely, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members kill the cells even in the presence of life-promoting stimuli, and their deficiency reduces apoptotic death (7Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). All anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1, and Boo/DIVA) contain four conserved BH1 domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4), whereas pro-apoptotic members contain either three BH domains (BH1, BH2, and BH3) (Bax, Bak, and Mtd/Bok) or only the BH3 domain (Bad, Bid, Bik, Blk, Hrk, Bim, Rad9, and Noxa) (7Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 8Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). How the Bcl-2 family proteins work is still poorly understood. According to the current understanding, pro-apoptotic members containing several BH domains (Bax and Bak), when activated by a death stimulus, generate pores to the mitochondrial outer membrane that lead to the release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial molecules to the cytoplasm, where they trigger activation of caspases at the apoptosome (5Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6233) Google Scholar). Once activated above certain threshold levels, caspases irreversibly execute cell death (6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6233) Google Scholar, 12Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In addition, heterodimerization between certain pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins nullifies the activity of the partners, and the fate of the cell is determined by the member that is in excess (7Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins are believed to regulate or modulate the activity of multi-BH domain members. Thus, Bid activates Bax (13Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), with the net result being cell death in both cases. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been described for many Bcl-2 family members, with the activity of the protein isoforms remaining unchanged in most cases (16Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Full-length N-Bak and Bak cDNAs were generated by RT-PCR from P1 mouse brain RNA, inserted into the pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), and verified by sequencing. To check whether the expression plasmids produce the respective proteins in cells, COS-7 cells in semiconfluent 10-cm dishes were transfected with Bak- or N-Bak-encoding expression plasmids or with the empty pCR3.1 vector (5 μg/dish) using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To protect cells against death caused by overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins, plasmid encoding human Bcl-xL (5 μg/dish) was cotransfected. Also, plasmid pGreenLantern-1, encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (0.5 μg/dish; Life Technologies, Inc.), was included to reveal transfection efficiency. The next day, cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Bak antibodies (65606E; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) (see Fig. 3 A). The peptide sequence used to generate these antibodies is present in both Bak and N-Bak (25Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2849-2855PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with the same anti-Bak antibodies. Both theBak- and N-Bak-transfected cultures, but not the vector-transfected or untransfected cultures, contained strongly Bak-immunoreactive cells (data not shown). To demonstrate endogenous N-Bak protein, newborn mouse brain, cultured SCG or hippocampal neurons, or Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells were lysed in buffer containing either 2% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS or 1% SDS and 8 murea. Either Bak proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates with the anti-Bak antibodies (Pharmingen 65606E), or the crude lysate was used; and the filter was probed with the same antibody. In all samples, only Bak (but not N-Bak) protein was visible (data not shown), whereas both N-Bak and Bak proteins were detected in control COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing N-Bak and Bcl-xL (similar to the results shown in Fig. 3 A). The same result was obtained with anti-Bak antibodies from Oncogene Research Products (AM04; Darmstadt, Germany) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H-211; Santa Cruz, CA) (data not shown). To show that the non-neuronal cells overexpressing N-Bak die apoptotically, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression vector for GFP-N-Bak or with the empty pEGFP-C1 vector. 2 h after transfection, GFP-N-Bak-transfected cells exhibited weak fluorescence, became round, and began to detach from the substrate, whereas GFP-expressing cells remained healthy and flat. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 1 μm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were acquired on an Olympus AX 70 Provis microscope and analyzed by Adobe Photoshop software. For the DNA ladder assay, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding N-Bak or GFP. After 3 h, DNA was prepared and analyzed for the presence of internucleosomal degradation fragments according to a published protocol (26Kaufmann S.H. Mesner P.W. Samejima K. Toné S. Earnshaw W.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNAs from different rat and mouse tissues or from cultured purified neurons or non-neuronal cells were isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNAs from human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Rat cortical and hippocampal neurons were cultured as described (27O'Malley E.K. Sieber B.-A. Morrison R.S. Black I.B. Dreyfus C.F. Brain Res. 1994; 647: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). First strand cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT)15 or dN6 random primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with enhanced avian reverse transcriptase (Sigma) or Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2-μl cDNA aliquots were processed by PCR with the High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and Bak-specific primers (forward, 5′-CCACCATGGCATCTGGACAAGGACCAG; and reverse, 5′-TCATGATCTGAAGAATCTGTGTACC) were used to amplify full-length N-Bak and Bak cDNAs. For nested PCR, a different pair of N-Bak-specific primers was used after amplifications with the primers shown above: forward, 5′-TTGCCCAGGACACAGAGGAGGT; and reverse, 5′-GAATTGGCCCAACAGAACCACACC. Both primers were localized to different exons to distinguish amplification products from cDNA and genomic DNA. In addition, with either pair of primers, fragments of the size of Bak or N-Bak cDNAs were not amplified from mouse genomic DNA (data not shown). PCR was performed for 35 cycles with the following program: 95 °C for 45 s, 60° for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products (10–20 μl) were separated on 1.5% agarose gel to reveal the 20-bp difference in the Bak fragments. Fragments of interest were excised and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector or the pCR3.1 expression vector. Nucleotide sequences were verified by sequencing. To prepare neurons completely devoid of non-neuronal cells, 1000–2000 neurons dissociated from neonatal mouse SCG were seeded onto a restricted area on the culture dish, and all non-neuronal cells were manually killed by a micromanipulator-driven needle. Absence of non-neuronal cells was then checked for several days, and the few non-neuronal cells that remained in the culture were killed. This approach was not feasible for hippocampal cultures. Therefore, neurons from 5-day cultures of E16 mouse hippocampi were individually picked up with glass pipettes with the help of a micromanipulator under visual control with an inverted microscope essentially as described (28Moshnyakov M. Arumäe U. Saarma M. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). About 30 neurons were individually picked up with separate glass pipettes with an aperture slightly bigger than the cell diameter and collected into Trizol reagent. RNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed as described above. No fragments were amplified from the culture medium collected in the same way as the neurons (data not shown). The RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed as described (29Timmusk T. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Full-length N-Bak cDNA was used to generate 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe. The assay resulted in one fragment of 572 bp for N-Bak and two fragments of 322 and 230 bp for Bak. Only the 572- and 230-bp fragments are shown in Fig. 2. For a positive control, the mouse %-actin riboprobe (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) was used. P1–P2 mouse SCG were digested with collagenase (2.5 mg/ml; Worthington), dispase (5 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and trypsin (10 mg/ml; Worthington) for 45 min at 37 °C and dissociated mechanically with a siliconized glass Pasteur pipette. Non-neuronal cells were removed by extensive preplating. Almost pure neurons were cultured in polyornithine/laminin (Sigma)-coated 35-mm plastic dishes at a 1:1 ratio of nutrient mixture F-12 to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Cramlington, United Kingdom), serum substitute containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin (Pathocyte-4, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), 60 ng/ml progesterone, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 400 ng/ml L-thyroxine, 38 ng/ml sodium selenite, and 340 ng/ml triiodothyronine (all from Sigma Chemical Co.) (30Davies A.M. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 153-175Google Scholar), and 30 ng/ml mouse 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Neither antibiotics nor antimitotic drugs were included in the culture medium. Hippocampi from E16 mice were dissociated with trypsin (0.25%) for 15 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) and 10 mm glucose, triturated with a siliconized glass Pasteur pipette, plated onto polyornithine (Sigma)-coated dishes, and grown further in neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing B-27 serum substitute (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nuclei of the SCG neurons, cultured for 5–6 days with 30 ng/ml NGF, were pressure-injected under direct visual control with expression plasmids encoding Bak or N-Bak or with the empty pCR3.1 vector, all 50 ng/μl. All injection solutions contained also 10 ng/μl pGreenLantern-1. A Model MMO-220 micromanipulator (Narishige International Ltd., London) and a Model 5246 Transjector (Eppendorf Scientific, Westbury, NY) were used for injection. Neurons were grown further with NGF or in NGF-free medium with function-blocking anti-NGF antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Initial neurons surviving the procedure were counted 3–4 h later. 50–100 neurons were successfully injected with each plasmid combination in every experiment. To later follow all injected neurons individually, the positions of the injected neurons were mapped according to the grid scratched in the bottom of the dish. Healthy fluorescent neurons with phase-bright cytoplasm and an intact neuritic tree, identified according to the fluorescence and the map, were counted daily and expressed as a percentage of the uninjected cells. Few neurons that lost fluorescence during experiment were subtracted from the initial neurons. Uninjected neurons were counted from one dish. Non-neuronal cells from dissociated P1 mouse SCG were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum without neurotrophic factors until all neurons were dead and injected as described above for neurons. Initial cells were counted 2 h (40–50 cells for every plasmid) and living fluorescent cells 18–20 h after injection. During that period, injected cells neither moved nor divided significantly, so they were recognizable according to the fluorescence and the map. Experiments were repeated three times on independent cultures. In every repeat, all treatment groups presented in Fig. 4 (A–C) were studied collectively in the same culture. Statistical significance of the data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tuckey's post hoc test at a significance level of α = 0.05. For intracellular localization studies, GFP was fused to the N terminus of full-length N-Bak using the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). N-Bak cDNA without a putative transmembrane domain (lacking amino acids 125–150) was generated by PCR and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector. Functional properties of this deletion mutant together with other mutated forms of N-Bak are currently being studied in our laboratory. Neurons microinjected with these constructs (50 ng/μl) were grown with or without NGF for 48 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. In some experiments, neurons were treated with 1 μm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 15 min and washed extensively before fixation. Although a classical punctate pattern of Mitotracker staining was obtained with the non-neuronal cells in culture, the neurons showed more broad and diffuse staining where individual mitochondria were difficult to discern. Images were acquired on an OZ confocal laser scanning microscope (Noran Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI) and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. When verifying the nucleotide sequences of RT-PCR fragments ofBak from mouse brain, we noticed a 20-bp sequence, GCCAGCAGCAACATGCACAG (Fig.1 A), not present in the published mouse Bak sequence (23Ulrich E. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Hueber A.O. Williamson J. Chittenden T. Ma A. Evan G. Genomics. 1997; 44: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We cloned and sequenced full-length Bak cDNA from mouse brain. The 20-bp insert was found in several sequenced cDNA clones. Also some minor differences from the published Bak sequence were detected in all clones: there is an additional guanine between positions 147 and 148 as well as two additional cytidines between positions 153 and 154 of the published mouse Bak sequence. We do not know whether these minor differences result from sequencing errors of Ulrichet al. (23Ulrich E. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Hueber A.O. Williamson J. Chittenden T. Ma A. Evan G. Genomics. 1997; 44: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or whether they represent polymorphisms or mutations in the Bak gene of the 3T3 cells used by Ulrichet al. to clone it. In the predicted Bak protein deduced from the corrected nucleotide sequence, residues 50 and 51 are both alanines, but not arginine and proline, as published by Ulrich et al. (23Ulrich E. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Hueber A.O. Williamson J. Chittenden T. Ma A. Evan G. Genomics. 1997; 44: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), followed by an additional alanine absent in the published sequence (Fig. 1 D). The 20-bp sequence is inserted at position 344 (corrected nucleotide numbering) of Bak cDNA (Fig. 1 A), which corresponds exactly with the junction of exons 4 and 5 of the mouseBak gene (23Ulrich E. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Hueber A.O. Williamson J. Chittenden T. Ma A. Evan G. Genomics. 1997; 44: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 20-bp insert is a hitherto undescribed exon. We determined a partial sequence of the intron between exons 4 and 5 of the Bak gene. The 20-bp sequence was found in the intronic sequence flanked by intron-exon junction sequences corresponding to the GT-AG rule (Fig.1 C). In addition, the 3′-splice site of the 20-bp exon deviated from the respective consensus sequence (Pyr)12CAG (where Pyr is pyrimidine), with several purines interrupting the polypyrimidine tract (Fig. 1 C). The majority of the alternatively spliced exons have weak 3′-splice sites with higher purine content compared with the 3′-sites of constitutively spliced exons (31Stamm S. Zhang M.Q. Marr T.G. Helfman D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Lou H. Gagel R.F. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We designated this exon as exon N (for neuron-specific exon; see below) and the transcript using this exon as N-Bak. The corrected genomic organization of the mouseBak gene and the two transcripts generated from it by alternative use of exon N are schematically presented in Fig. 1. Use of exon N would cause a translational frameshift, resulting in a changed amino acid sequence and a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon (Fig. 1 D). The predicted protein translated from N-Bak contains 150 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 16.4 kDa and a calculated pI of 4.48. The previously described Bak isoform has 208 residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 23.3 kDa and a calculated pI of 6.08. The novel C-terminal amino acid stretch RPAATCTAYLRVASAGAAWWLSWALATVWPCTSTSVV of N-Bak (Fig.1 D) has no homology to any of the known proteins. As predicted by the Sosui and TopPred2 programs, 24 C-terminal residues of this novel sequence (VASAGAAWWLSWALATVWPCTSTS) may form a transmembrane α-helix. No other known structural motifs were found in this novel sequence by the PSORT II program. Use of exon N would lead to the change of the BH1 domain of the Bak protein into a different amino acid sequence. The BH2 as well as transmembrane domains would not be translated, whereas the BH3 domain would remain unchanged (Fig.1 D). Thus, use of exon N would convert the three BH domain-containing Bak protein into a BH3-only protein with a novel putative transmembrane domain. We designated the short protein isoform (encoded by N-Bak) as N-Bak and the previously known longer protein isoform as Bak. A similar 20-bp sequence (GCCAGCAGCAACACCCACAG) was found in four independent Bak cDNA clones from human brain with two nucleotide differences from mouse exon N. This human sequence is inserted at the position identical to that in mouse BakcDNA, leading to the same changes in amino acid sequence as in mouse N-Bak: a truncated protein of 150 amino acids, a novel C-terminal amino acid sequence (RPAATPTACLRVASIGAVWWLFWASATVWPYTSTSMA) with a predicted transmembrane domain, and a lack of BH1 and BH2 domains. Expression of Bak splice variants in different tissues was studied by RT-PCR and RPA. RT-PCR analysis showed that Bak was expressed in all studied rat tissues, whereas N-Bak was expressed exclusively in the nervous tissue (Fig. 2 A). Identical results were obtained when RNAs from human tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR (data not shown). RPA also revealed expression of Baktranscripts in all adult mouse tissues analyzed, whereas N-Bak was detected only in brain. The levels of bothBak and N-Bak transcripts were rather similar in different brain regions (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore,Bak and N-Bak transcripts were differently regulated during mouse brain development. Low levels of N-Bak were present at E13, and the levels increased in the late embryogenesis and early postnatal days, with the peak being around birth (Fig. 2 C). In contrast to this, the levels ofBak were high in E13 brain and decreased gradually during development (Fig. 2 C). Both transcripts of Bak were detected in cultured cells of rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 2 A) that contained neurons as well as non-neuronal cells. In contrast, the non-neuronal cells from rat cerebral cortical culture expressed only Bak, but not N-Bak. Similarly, the rat sciatic nerve, known to contain mostly Schwann cells, expressed Bak, but not N-Bak (Fig. 2 A). To clarify the cell-type specificity of expression of the two Bak transcripts, we manually separated cultured neonatal mouse SCG or E16 mouse hippocampal neurons from all non-neuronal cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Neuron-free cultures of non-neuronal cells from both sources were also prepared. We then analyzed expression ofBak splice variants in purified cell populations by RT-PCR. Both SCG and hippocampal neurons expressed only N-Bak, but not Bak. Conversely, only Bak (but not N-Bak) was expressed in non-neuronal cells (Fig.2 D). The experiments with purified SCG neurons were repeated three times with identical results. Absence of Bak in neurons was further verified with totally non-neuronal cell-free SCG neurons by nested PCR. Bak message was still not detected (data not shown). Although we did not analyze other neuronal populations, it is probable that the Bak transcript in brain tissues (Fig. 2 C) may be of glial origin. Thus, expression of N-Bak is strictly neural tissue-specific and, at least in SCG and hippocampus, strictly neuron-specific, whereas Bakis expressed almost ubiquitously (20Chittenden T.

Chittenden T. Ma A. Evan G. Genomics. 1997; 44: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but is absent (or below the detection limit) in the neurons. Exon N, as well as neuron-specific expression of N-Bak, is conserved in the mouse, rat, and human species. However, as our attempts to demonstrate endogenous N-Bak protein failed (see “Experimental Procedures”), we do not have evidence that endogenous N-Bak mRNA is translated into protein in neurons. To study the functional activity of N-Bak in its natural cellular environment, we microinjected cultured neonatal mouse sympathetic SCG neurons with the expression plasmid encoding N-Bak or Bak and maintained the neurons further with or without NGF. Cultured neonatal SCG neurons are known to die apoptotically when deprived of NGF (33Deckwerth T.L. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The respective proteins were produced from the corresponding expression plasmids in transiently transfected COS-7 cells as shown by Western blotting (Fig.3 A). An ∼28-kDa band was greatly enhanced in Bak-transfected cells, comigrating with the endogenous Bak in COS-7 cells, whereas a smaller band of ∼22 kDa was revealed only in N-Bak-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). For some unknown reason, both proteins migrated somewhat slower than predicted by their amino acid sequences. N-Bak was also produced by the injected expression plasmid in the neurons, as shown by staining the injected neurons with anti-Bak antibodies (Fig.3 B). As shown previously (34Martinou I. Missotten M. Fernandez P.A. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C."
https://openalex.org/W1995308854,"Nineteen different functional RNAs were synthesized for an investigation of the actions of ribozymes, in vitro and in vivo, under the control of two different promoters, tRNA or U6, which localize transcripts either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. No relationships were found between the activities of these RNAs in cultured cells and the kinetic parameters of their respective chemical cleavage reactions in vitro, indicating that in no case was chemical cleavage the rate-limiting stepin vivo. For example, a hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, whose activity in vitro was almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of a hammerhead ribozyme, still exhibited similar activity in cells when an appropriate expression system was used. As expected, external guide sequences, the actions of which depend on nuclear RNase P, were more active in the nucleus. Analysis of data obtained with cultured cells clearly demonstrated that the cytoplasmic ribozymes were significantly more active than the nuclear ribozymes, suggesting that mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm might be more accessible to antisense molecules than are pre-mRNAs in the nucleus.

Small ribozymes that can be designed to cleave RNA strands intermolecularly include hammerhead, hairpin, and HDV1 ribozymes. Thesetrans-acting ribozymes recognize their RNA substrates via formation of Watson-Crick base pairs, and they cleave these RNAs in a sequence-specific manner. Because of their specificity,trans-acting ribozymes show promise as tools for the dysfunction of target RNAs (9–21). The constitutive expression of a ribozyme in vivo, under the control of a strong promoter, represents an attractive strategy for the application of trans-acting ribozymes to gene therapy. As described in our previous reports (22Koseki S. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Shioda T. Nagai Y. Shimada T. Ohkawa J. Taira K. J.

High levels of expression under the control of the pol III promoter are advantageous for the exploitation of ribozymes in vivo. Therefore, we chose an expression system with the promoter of a human gene for tRNAVal. Many ribozymes, such as hammerheads and hairpins, have been effectively expressed under the control of promoters of gene for tRNAs (9Ojwang J.O. Hampel A. Looney D.J. Wong-Staal F. Rappaport J. Proc.

A major advantage of our tRNAVal-directed expression system is that, with appropriate modification of the tRNAValportion, it is possible to colocalize the expressed ribozyme in the cytoplasm with its target mRNA (14Kuwabara T.

Ribozymes expressed under the control of the tRNAVal promoter are exported to the cytoplasm as effectively as natural tRNAs via the action of Xpo(t), 2T. Kuwabara and K.

Mature mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Thus, both ribozymes and their target mRNAs can be co-localized in the same cellular compartment. By contrast, an external guide sequence (EGS), which is added intrans and is able to bind to its target RNA, appears to function in the nucleus because its effect depends on the activity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) (17Plehn-Dujowich D. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7327-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Forster A.C. Altman S.

Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8468-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The EGS RNA binds to the target RNA, yielding a structure that resembles the pre-tRNA that is recognized as a substrate by RNase P. RNase P normally cleaves precursors to tRNAs to generate the 5′ termini of mature tRNAs. Because RNase P is expressed constitutively in cells and accumulates, in particular in the nucleus, the use of an EGS as a gene-inactivating agent does not require expression of additional RNase P from exogenously introduced genes. Although an EGS does not have intrinsic cleavage activity, when it acts in cooperation with endogenous RNase P, it can effectively inactivate its target mRNA. Although there have been many studies both in vitro andin vivo of the activities of the ribozymes mentioned above, further detailed information on the parameters that determine their activities as gene-inactivating agents in vivo is necessary so that we will be able to optimize their effects by optimizing the requisite parameters. In addition, although it has been claimed for each individual ribozyme that it has potential utility as an effective gene-inactivating agent, there has been no systematic analysis in which the activities of various ribozymes have been compared under similar conditions in vivo. In this study, we designed several types of functional RNA targeted to the junction site of theBCR-ABL chimeric mRNA that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Using this system, we have accumulated data that might allow correlations to be made between ribozyme activities in cultured cells and the efficacies of the same ribozymes in vivo, namely, in mice (15Kuwabara T.

Asano S. Nature. 2000; 406: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CML occurs as a result of reciprocal chromosomal translocations that result in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. One of the chimeric mRNAs transcribed from an abnormal BCR-ABL(B2A2) gene (consisting of exon 2 of BCR and exon 2 of ABL; Refs. 31Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R.

Science. 1960; 132: 1497-1499Google Scholar) provides a suitable substrate for comparisons of ribozymes. We used six kinds of functional RNA, including hammerhead, hairpin, and HDV ribozymes; our maxizyme andin vitro selected minizymes; and EGSs to examine parameters that determined activities in vitro and in vivo. Our goal was to determine whether activity in vitro might reflect activity in mammalian cells. Moreover, since we have evidence that suggests that tRNAVal-driven ribozymes with high level of activities are efficiently exported to the cytoplasm, whereas similarly expressed tRNA ribozymes with poor activities are accumulated in the nucleus (22Koseki S. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Shioda T. Nagai Y. Shimada T. Ohkawa J. Taira K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to examine the correlation between nuclear localization and/or transport of functional RNAs and the activity in vivo. For this purpose, we used two kinds of promoter. One promoter was the promoter of the gene for tRNAVal described above, and the other was a U6 promoter (33Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Ohkawa J. Taira K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transcripts expressed under the control of these promoters are located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. We found that the intrinsic cleavage activity of a ribozyme is not the sole determinant of activity in cultured cells and that it is the cytoplasmic localization and the association of the ribozyme with its substrate that regulate activity. The construction of vectors for expression of ribozymes from the tRNAVal promoter using pUC-dt (a plasmid that contains the chemically synthesized promoter for a human gene for tRNAVal between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC 19) was described previously (22Koseki S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pUC-dt was double-digested with Csp45I and SalI, and a fragment having a linker sequence with 5′ Csp45I site and the restriction sites for KpnI and EcoRV and the terminator sequence TTTTT at the 3′ end with 3′ SalI site was cloned into the double-digested plasmid to yield pUC-tRNA/KE. TheKpnI and EcoRV sites were used for subsequent insertion of the each ribozyme sequence. The construction of vectors for ribozyme expression from the U6 promoter has been described elsewhere (17Plehn-Dujowich D. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7327-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The EcoRI and XhoI sites were used for insertion of each ribozyme sequence. Each ribozyme and two substrates, namelyBCR-ABL and ABL RNAs, were preparedin vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. Assays of ribozyme activity in vitro were performed, in 25 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C, under enzyme-saturating (single-turnover) conditions, as described elsewhere (14Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Orita M. Koseki S. Ohkawa J. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each ribozyme (50 μm) was incubated with 2 nm 5′-32P-labeled substrate. The substrate and the products of each reaction were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel and detected by autoradiography. HeLa S3 cells on a coverslip, which had been transfected in advance with an appropriate plasmid, were washed in fresh phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in fix/permeabilization buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min each. Seventy micrograms of Cy3-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probe with a sequence complementary to the ribozyme and 20 μg of tRNA from Escherichia coli MRE 600 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), dissolved in 10 μl of deionized formamide, were denatured by heating for 10 min at 70 °C. The mixture was then chilled immediately on ice, and 10 μl of hybridization buffer, containing 20% dextran sulfate and 2% BSA in 4× SSC, were added. Twenty microliters of the hybridization solution containing the probe were placed on the coverslip, and the coverslip was inverted on a glass slide, sealed with rubber cement, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed in 2× SSC, 50% formamide and in 2× SSC at room temperature for 20 min each. The coverslip was mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on a glass slide, and cells were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence (1 × 107 cells) and were transfected with a tRNAVal-Rz expression vector with the Lipofectin™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested. For the preparation of the cytoplasmic fraction, collected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in digitonin lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 50 μg/ml digitonin) on ice for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and held on ice for 10 min, and the resultant lysate was used as the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic RNA and nuclear RNA were extracted and purified from the cytoplasmic fraction and the nuclear fraction, respectively, with ISOGEN reagent (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Thirty micrograms of total RNA per lane were loaded on a 3.0% NuSieve™ (3:1) agarose gel (FMC Inc., Rockland, ME). After electrophoresis, bands of RNA were transferred to a Hybond-N™ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The membrane was probed with a synthetic oligonucleotide that was complementary to the sequence of the relevant ribozyme. Each probe was labeled with32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). Luciferase activity was measured with a PicaGene® kit (Toyo-inki, Tokyo, Japan) as described elsewhere (15Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Tanabe T. Tani K. Asano S. Taira K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In order to normalize the efficiency of transfection by reference to β-galactosidase activity, cells were cotransfected with the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and then the chemiluminescent signal due to β-galactosidase was quantitated with a luminescent β-galactosidase genetic reporter system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (15Kuwabara T.

In order to express ribozymesin vivo, we used two kinds of pol III promoter (Fig.1 A). Transcripts with the promoter of the gene for tRNAVal can be efficiently transported to the cytoplasm when the appropriate choice of and combination of linker and ribozyme sequence is made (14Kuwabara T.

Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 462-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We used the mouse U6 promoter, which controls expression of U6 RNA that is localized in the nucleus, for expression and accumulation of transcripts in the nucleus. Ten functional RNAs (Fig. 1 B) directed against sites within a limited region (<100 nt) ofB2A2 and ABL mRNAs (Fig. 1 C; target sites are underlined; the identical cleavage site could not be chosen because of different cleavable sequence for each different ribozyme) and expression vectors that encoded each respective functional RNA were designed such that each functional RNA was produced under the control both of the tRNAVal promoter and of the U6 promoter. The product translated from B2A2 chimeric mRNA causes CML. We demonstrated previously that the RNA maxizyme that functions as a dimer cleaves B2A2 chimeric mRNAin vitro and in vivo with extremely high specificity without any damage to normal ABL mRNA (15Kuwabara T.

Asano S. Nature. 2000; 406: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since it seemed possible that a hairpin ribozyme might also distinguish abnormal B2A2 mRNA from normalABL mRNA (even though conventional hammerhead ribozymes fail to do so), we decided to use these two substrates in this study. Using two different substrates, we hoped to gain more insight into the differences among the activities of the various ribozymes in vivo in more general terms. The hammerhead ribozyme is one of the smallest trans-acting ribozymes (6Symons R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 7Birikh K.R. Heaton P.A.

The maxizyme is one such derivative and acts as a dimer (Fig. 1 B), and, in general, maxizymes have high level activity in vivo (14Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Orita M. Koseki S. Ohkawa J. Taira K. Nat.

The minizymes shown in Fig. 1 B are minimized hammerhead ribozymes with stem II deletions and relatively high activity, and each of them was identified recently by in vitro selection (43Conaty J.

Therefore, they may have advantage at low concentrations of Mg2+ ions in vivo; thus, we included them in our study. The maxizyme is an effector-inducibletrans-activated ribozyme, and the maxizyme shown in Fig.1 B recognizes the junction region of B2A2; it cleaves B2A2 mRNA but not normal ABL mRNA and, therefore, we used this well characterized tRNAVal-driven maxizyme as a positive control in studies in cultured cells (15Kuwabara T.

We thus undertook to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription of MUC5B in gastric cancer cells. To this end, high expressing (KATO-III) and low expressing (AGS) gastric cancer cell lines were chosen to study human mucin gene MUC5Bexpression and promoter activity. Sequencing of the promoter region revealed a distal TATA box located 1 kilobase upstream of the proximal TATA box. Functional activity of the promoter was addressed by using deletion mutants covering 2044 nucleotides upstream of theMUC5B transcription start site. We identified a distal promoter 10 times more active than the proximal promoter in KATO-III cells. In AGS cells, both promoters, much less active, showed the same range of activity. Binding assays allowed us to show that the transcription factor ATF-1 binds to a cis-element present in the distal promoter.

Numerous studies have now demonstrated that the expression of mucin genes is tissue- and cell-specific and that their expression is altered during the pathogenesis of several diseases, which suggests that human mucin gene expression is tightly regulated and that they may play important roles during cell differentiation and carcinogenesis (3Ho S.B.

We recently characterized the first 956 nucleotides located upstream ofMUC5B transcription start site and studied the promoter functional activity in colon cancer cells (20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The region is characterized by the presence of a TATA box and numerous putative binding sites for ubiquitous (Sp1) and specific transcription factors (NF-κB, c-Myc). The high expression of MUC5B was correlated with the mucus-secreting phenotype of the LS174T colon cancer cell line. Introns 1 and 37 of MUC5B have also been studied in our laboratory because they contain tandemly repeated GA- and GC-rich sequences that bind the transcription factors Sp1 (20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and NF1-MUC5B, respectively (19Pigny P. Van Seuningen I. Desseyn J.-L. Nollet S. Porchet N. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that MUC5B is abnormally expressed in gastric carcinomatous tissues and cell lines. Computer analysis of the genomic sequence upstream of the MUC5B transcription start site revealed the presence of a distal TATA box. Numerous putative binding sites for Sp1, CREB, ATF-1, and AP-1 transcription factors were found adjacent to this TATA-box. Binding assays showed that the nuclear factors Sp1 and ATF-1 bind to the distal promoter. The functional activity of the two promoters of MUC5B was studied in two gastric cancer cell lines that either show a high (KATO-III) or a low (AGS) level of MUC5B mRNA expression. From these studies, a distal region highly active in KATO-III cells was identified. Moreover, this region was shown to be highly methylated in AGS cells in accordance to the low level ofMUC5B mRNA transcripts found in these cells. Specimens of tumoral and normal gastric mucosae were obtained from six patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma (cardia, well differentiated (n = 2); fundus, mucous type (n = 1); fundus, well differentiated (n = 1); antrum, well differentiated (n = 1); and antrum, moderately differentiated (n = 1)). Each specimen was immediately immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer and further embedded in paraffin. Sections 3-μm-thick were cut and mounted onto gelatin covered slides. Adjacent sections from the same blocks were systematically stained with hematoxylin-eosin-safran and Astra blue for a histological control.In situ hybridization was performed using a specificMUC5B 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The 48-mer oligonucleotide antisense probe (5′-TGTGGTCAGCTCTGTGAGGATCCAGGTCGTCCCCGAGTGGAGAGGG-3′) was chosen in the tandem repeat domain of MUC5B (27Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.-P.

The labeling of the probe and the hybridization steps were as described in Ref. 4Audié J.-P. Janin A. Porchet N. Copin M.-C. Gosselin B. Aubert J.-P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar. Controls consisted in a treatment of tissue sections with a large excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide identical or distinct from theMUC5B radiolabeled probe. The KATO-III and AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were purchased from European Collection of Cell Culture (Salisbury, UK) (28Sekigushi M. Sakakibara K. Fujii G. Japan J. Exp. Med. 1978; 48: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar, 29Barranco S.C. Townsend C.M.J.r. Casartelli C. Macik B.G. Burger N.L. Boerwinkle W.R. Gourley W.K. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1703-1709PubMed Google Scholar). KATO-III cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France). AGS cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Both cell lines were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The inhibitor of methylation, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5 μm) (Sigma Saint-Quetin Fallavier, France), was added to confluent cells, and cells were cultured in the presence of the chemical reagent for 3 more days before being harvested in appropriate buffer to prepare total RNA. Inserts were prepared using the restriction map of the cosmid clone called ELO9 (30Buisine M.-P. Desseyn J.-L. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. Biochem.

Gel purified fragments (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) were subcloned into the promoterless pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Charbonnières, France). Internal deletion mutants were generated by PCR using pairs of primers bearing specific restriction sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends (see Table I). PCR products were digested, gel purified and subcloned into the pGL3 vector that had been previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. All clones were sequenced on both strands on an automatic LI-COR sequencer (ScienceTec, Les Ulis, France) using infrared labeled RV3 and GL2 primers (Promega).

Equimolar amounts of single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]dATP. DNA fragments 1450 and 1896 cloned into pGL3 vector used as probes were first digested with SacI-MluI (1450) and KpnI-MluI (1896) to obtain the insert. The fragments were then gel purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP at the 3′ end by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment (Roche Diagnostics).

Primer extension reactions were performed using 25 μg of total RNAs prepared from KATO-III and AGS cells as above and from human trachea (Clontech). Annealing and labeling of the exon 1 (5BOAS): 5′-TGCCTGCGGCACCACGAGCATG-3′ and NAU 647: 5′-TCCCTGGTCACCAGCGTCCTG-3′ reverse primers and extension reactions were performed as previously described (20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem.

Manual sequencing of DNA fragment 1429 was performed using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France). Samples were denatured for 10 min at 90 °C before loading on a 6% sequencing gel (Sequagel-6, National diagnostic, Prolabo, France). The gel was then vacuum dried and autoradiographed for 3–4 days at −80 °C. Transfections were performed using Effectene® reagent (Qiagen). Cells were passed the day before the transfection. Transfection conditions were optimized to 1 μg of DNA, 5 μl of Effectene®, and 0.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Transfected cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Total cell extracts were prepared using 1× reagent lysis buffer (Promega) as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. Results were corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting 0.1 μg of pSV-βGal vector (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in 96-well plates as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual using 10 μl of cell extracts (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured on a Berthold 9501 luminometer on 20 μl of cell extracts using luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The luciferase activity is expressed as fold of induction of the test plasmid activity compared with that of the corresponding control vector (pGL3 control vector, Promega) after correction for transfection efficiency by dividing by β-galactosidase activity. Each plasmid was assayed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. Cotransfection studies with pCMV-Sp1 and pCMV-Sp3 expression vectors were performed as previously described (20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PMA (100 nm) or CTA (1 μg/ml) were added to the cells 24 h after cell transfection and left for another 24 h before harvesting cells to measure luciferase activity. Calcium ionophoreA23187 (250 nm) was added to the cells 1 h prior to harvesting cells. This corresponds to the optimized conditions to obtain the maximum effect of each reagent on MUC5B promoter activity. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Nuclear extracts from cell lines of interest were prepared as described in (31Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and kept at −80 °C until use. Protein content (5 μl of cell extracts) was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method in 96-well plates as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual (PERBIO Science, Bezons, France). Nuclear proteins (5 μg) were preincubated for 20 min on ice in 20 μl of binding buffer with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeled DNA probe was added (120,000 cpm/reaction), and the reaction was left for another 20 min on ice. For super-shift analyses, 1 μl of the antibody of interest (anti-Sp1, anti-Sp2, anti-ATF-1, anti-CREB-1, and anti-HoxD9; TEBU, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) was added to the proteins and left for 1 h on ice before adding the radiolabeled probe. Cold competition were performed by preincubating the nuclear proteins with an excess (×50) of the cold oligonucleotide for 20 min before adding the radiolabeled probe. Negative controls were carried out using 1 μl of irrelevant antibody in the reaction mixture. Reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of loading buffer and loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis conditions were as described in Ref. 20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. Gels were vacuum dried and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C. Genomic DNA was prepared using a blood and cell culture DNA mini kit (Qiagen). 20 μg of genomic DNA was submitted to an overnight digestion withBamHI (50 units) at 37 °C. To study methylation,BamHI-digested DNA was ethanol precipitated and submitted to either a HpaII (methylation-sensitive, 40 units) or aMspI (methylation insensitive, 40 units) digestion overnight at 37 °C. Digested DNA was then loaded on a 2% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was run in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, denatured DNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Biotrans +, 0.45 μm; ICN, Orsay, France) in 20× SSC buffer overnight and UV cross-linked for 4 min. The membrane was first incubated in prehybridization buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS) for 3 h at 65 °C followed by a 3-h incubation at 65 °C with 1450 and 1896 DNA probes (1 × 106 cpm/lane) in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate (w/v), 0.25 mg/ml herring sperm DNA). Excess of the probe was washed off with 10 ml of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, and the wash was repeated once. The blot was then rinsed with 3× SSC and autoradiographed for a few days at −80 °C. DNA sequences were analyzed using PC-GENE software, and the TRANSFAC 4.0 data base was used to define potential transcription factor binding sites within the clones of interest. The search was conducted using MatInspector V2.2 software (32Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Expression of MUC5B was analyzed in gastric adenocarcinoma and normal resection margins from six patients undergoing gastric resection using in situ hybridization.MUC5B was not detected in the specimens of normal gastric mucosa (6/6) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, a signal was detected with the MUC5B probe in four of six specimens of gastric carcinomas (all well differentiated). The labeling was distributed heterogeneously throughout the tumoral glands (Fig. 1 B). The hybridization procedure was repeated several times. Competition studies checked the validity of the signal. The labeling disappeared when a large excess of unlabeled MUC5Boligonucleotide was added to the 35S-labeledMUC5B probe (Fig. 1 C). The expression of MUC5B mRNA was also studied by RT-PCR in two gastric cancer cell lines (Fig.2 A). A high expressing (KATO-III) and a low expressing (AGS) cell line were chosen. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the expected 415-bp PCR product was found in a large amount in KATO-III cells (lane 3, KATO-III), whereas a very faint band was observed in AGS cells (lane 3, AGS). Having shown that MUC5B is abnormally expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and cancer cell lines, further investigation of MUC5B 5′-flanking region DNA sequence was conducted to identify new regulatory regions. The first 956 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site were previously described (20Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Numerous Sp1 binding sites were found clustered in the close vicinity of the TATA box. In this report, further sequencing of the region located upstream of DNA fragment 1896 over 1.1 kb was conducted, and analysis of the DNA sequence using PC-GENE software revealed the presence of a second TATA-box like sequence (TAAATAAAA). The distal TATA box is located 1.1 kb upstream of the proximal TATA box (Fig.3). Using the TRANSFAC 4.0 data base, we found out that the region adjacent to this second TATA box is characterized by the presence of two clustered putative binding sites for CREB/ATF and AP-1 transcription factors. Further upstream were located potential binding sites for Sp1, glucocorticoid receptor, thyroid transcription factor-1, retinoid orphan receptor-α1, TGT3, Wilm's tumor-1 transcription factor (KTS), and insulin receptor factor-2. The presence of a distal putative TATA box suggests that a distal transcription start si"

During fibrogenic process in the liver, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the main producers of type I collagen, whereas parenchymal hepatocytes produce little, if any, of this protein. We have previously reported that Sp1 and an interacting unknown factor(s) bind to the −313 to −255 sequence of the α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) and play essential roles for basal and TGF-β-stimulated transcription in skin fibroblasts and HSC. Recently, Smad3 has been shown to bind to this region, and its interaction with Sp1 has been implicated in TGF-β-elicited COL1A2 stimulation. The present study demonstrates predominant binding of Sp3 rather than Sp1 to this regulatory element in parenchymal hepatocytes. In these cells, this region did not exhibit strong enhancer activity or mediate the effect of TGF-β. Transfection of HSC with an Sp3 expression plasmid abolished the COL1A2 response to TGF-β, whereas overexpression of Sp1 in hepatocytes increased basal COL1A2transcription and conferred TGF-β responsiveness. Functional and physical interactions between Sp1 and Smad3, but not between Sp3 and Smad3, were demonstrated using the bacterial GAL4 system and immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses. These results indicate that cell lineage-specific interactions between GC box binding factors and Smad protein(s) may account, at least in part, for differential COL1A2 transcription and TGF-β responsiveness in HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes.

It is composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain, which are coordinately expressed but encoded by the distinct genes,COL1A1 1 andCOL1A2, respectively. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1, henceforth referred to as TGF-β) plays important roles in stimulating type I collagen gene expression mainly at the levels of transcription (1Ramirez F. Di Liberto M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the liver, it has been widely accepted that activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) showing the morphological and functional features of myofibroblasts are the main producers of type I collagen (2Friedman S.L. Seminars Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Maher J.J. McGuire R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). By contrast, parenchymal hepatocytes produce little, if any, collagen during hepatic fibrogenesis (4Takahara T. Kojima T. Miyabayashi C. Inoue K. Sasaki H. Muragaki Y. Ooshima A. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 509-521PubMed Google Scholar, 5Milani S. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Hahn E.G. Stein H. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recent studies by us and others have indicated that both COL1A1 (6Houglum K. Buck M. Alcorn J. Contreras S. Bornstein P. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and COL1A2 (7Inagaki Y. Truter S. Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. de Crombrugghe B. Nemoto T. Greenwel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) transgenes are expressed in mesenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal hepatocytes, after carbon tetrachloride administration into transgenic mice harboring collagen promoter-reporter gene constructs. These results further confirmed the minor contribution of hepatocytes to collagen production. However, very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms determining differential type I collagen gene expression in activated HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes. We have previously shown that similar regulatory mechanisms controlCOL1A2 transcription in skin fibroblasts (8Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimentro E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activated HSC (10Inagaki Y. Truter S. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Unoura M. Kobayashi K. Ramirez F. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 573-579PubMed Google Scholar). The COL1A2 upstream sequence spanning from −313 to −183 is essential for basal transcription of the gene in the two cell types of mesenchymal origin and mediates stimulatory effect of TGF-β on COL1A2 transcription. Thus, we designated this region the TGF-β-responsive element (TbRE). Within the TbRE there are at least two distinct sites of DNA-protein interaction, Box 3A (−313 to −286) and Box B (−271 to −255; Fig.1). Box 3A contains two GC boxes, which are bound by a ubiquitous trans-activator Sp1 in skin fibroblasts and HSC (9Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional GC box is present in the intervening sequence between Box 3A and Box B. Our previous work has demonstrated that TGF-β up-regulates COL1A2 transcription by modifying the interaction between Box 3A-bound Sp1 and an unknown nuclear factor(s) bound to the neighboring Box B sequence (9Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Smad3, an intracellular mediator of TGF-β signal transduction, binds to the CAGACA sequence present in Box B and stimulates COL1A2 transcription (12Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that a functional interaction between Sp1 and Smad3/Smad4 is critical for TGF-β-elicited stimulation of COL1A2 transcription in fibroblasts (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas others have implicated functional cooperation with p300/CBP in Smad-dependent stimulation ofCOL1A2 transcription (15Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to determine whether collagen gene transcription is differentially regulated in activated HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes and, if so, to study the molecular mechanisms responsible for this cell type-specific expression. Our results indicated that, unlike in mesenchymal cells such as skin fibroblasts and HSC, strong enhancer activity of the −313 to −183 segment and response to TGF-β were not observed in primary culture of hepatocytes. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that, whereas Sp1 was the major Box 3A-bound factor in HSC, Sp3 bound predominantly to this GC-rich sequence in hepatocytes. Transfection of activated HSC with an Sp3 expression plasmid abolished the COL1A2 response to TGF-β. By contrast, overexpression of Sp1 in hepatocytes increased the basal level of COL1A2 transcription and conferred TGF-β responsiveness. Functional and physical interactions between Sp1 and Smad3, but not between Sp3 and Smad3, were demonstrated using the bacterial GAL4 fusion protein system and immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses. Based on these lines of experimental evidence, we conclude that interaction between Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors and Smad proteins modulates, at least in part, cell lineage-specific COL1A2 transcription in HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes. Adult rat hepatocytes and HSC were prepared by collagenase perfusion (16Summerfield J.A. Vergalla J. Jones E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Pronase-collagenase perfusion (17Greenwel P. Schwartz M. Rosas M. Peyrol S. Grimaud J.-A. Rojkind M. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 644-653PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (for hepatocytes) or 20% (for HSC) fetal bovine serum (FBS). More than 95% purity of parenchymal hepatocytes and more than 90% purity of HSC were confirmed immunohistochemically using anti-albumin and anti-desmin antibodies, respectively (data not shown). Primary HSC passaged one to three times were used for transfection experiments. CFSC-2G is an activated HSC clone derived from a cirrhotic rat liver induced by carbon tetrachloride injection (18Greenwel P. Rubin J. Schwartz M. Hertzberg E.L. Rojkind M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 210-217PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 10% FBS and non-essential amino acids. Because primary culture of rat hepatocytes were found to maintain their differentiated phenotype better on type I collagen-coated dishes (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY; data not shown), primary HSC and CFSC-2G cells were plated on the same substrata for a strict comparison in the experiments shown in Fig.2. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. Plasmids containing different lengths of COL1A2 upstream sequence linked to either a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene or a firefly luciferase gene have been previously described (8Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimentro E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. An SV40 early promoter region was cloned into pBLCAT3 vector (designated pSVCAT3) and used as a positive control. Expression plasmids used are pCMV-Sp1 (21Elder G.A. Liang Z. Li C. Lazzarini R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6281-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. G. Elder, pCMV-Sp3 (22Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from Dr. J. Horowitz, and pCMV-Smad3 (23Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) from Dr. R. Derynck. In these plasmids, either Sp1, Sp3, or Smad3 is expressed under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. An empty CMV-driven expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), was used as a negative control. Bacterial GAL4 fusion protein expression plasmids, pMSp1, pMDNSp1, and pMSp3, which encode the active form Sp1, transactivation domain-deleted Sp1, and active form Sp3, respectively, were generously provided by Dr. Y. Sowa, as well as a control pM plasmid and the pG5-luc reporter construct (24Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa-Hiranabe S. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4266-4270PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of plasmid DNA for cell transfection was previously described (8Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimentro E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CFSC-2G cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (8Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimentro E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a 15% glycerol shock for 90 s. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostic Co., Indianapolis, IN) was used for transfection of primary culture of rat hepatocytes and HSC. In some experiments, transfected cells were placed in medium containing 0.1% FBS and treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to either CAT or luciferase assays. Enzyme activity of the COL1A2·CAT chimeric constructs was normalized against that of co-transfected pSVXP1, in which the SV40 early promoter region was cloned into a promoterless luciferase gene construct, pXP1 (25Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of the COL1A2/luciferase chimeric constructs and pG5-luc reporter construct was normalized against that of co-transfected pRLCMV (Promega, Madison, WI), in which a Renilla luciferase gene was driven by a CMV promoter. To avoid competition between the CMV promoter region of the expression plasmids and that of pRLCMV vector, the latter DNA was added to the plasmid mixture at 1:1,000 molar ratio against the former. CAT assays and the dual luciferase assays were carried as previously reported (26Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega), respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared from culture cells as previously reported (27Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubating nuclear extracts with an end-labeled probe, gel mobility shift assays were carried out as previously described (27Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding conditions, as well as the sequences of the Box 5A (−330 to −297) and Box 3A (−313 to −286) oligonucleotides used as either probes or unlabeled competitors, have been previously described (9Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identical amounts of nuclear proteins from each cell source were added to the binding reactions. For antibody interference assays, antibodies against CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPγ), NF1, or Sp1-related factors (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblotting of nuclear proteins was performed as previously described (11Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3. To analyze interactions between Smad3 and Sp1/Sp3, COS-7 cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged Smad3 expression plasmid (23Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) together with an expression vector encoding either Sp1 or Sp3, in the presence or absence of HA-tagged constitutive active TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5TD) (23Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours later, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by immunoblotting with either anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies. Some cell lysates from the transfected cells were directly immunoblotted with anti-Myc, anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, or anti-HA antibodies (Roche Diagnostic Co.) to confirm expression of Myc-tagged Smad3, Sp1, Sp3, and HA-tagged ALK5TD, respectively, in the cells. Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Either Student's t test or the Mann-WhitneyU test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between groups: a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. We first compared COL1A2 transcription and response to TGF-β between activated HSC (CFSC-2G) and primary culture of rat hepatocytes. Normalization of the assay data against the activity of the co-transfected pSVXP1 vector allowed us to make a comparison between the two cell types, despite the fact that we used two different methods of transfection. In primary culture of hepatocytes, transcriptional activity of the −378 and −313COL1A2·CAT constructs containing the TbRE was one-third of that in CFSC-2G transfectants (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of the −378 to −183 sequence did not affect COL1A2 transcription in hepatocytes: there were no significant differences in the CAT enzyme activity among the −378, −313, and −183COL1A2·CAT transfectants (Fig. 2 A). This was apparently different from the results obtained with CFSC-2G cells showing that transcriptional activity of the −378 and −313COL1A2·CAT constructs was significantly higher than that of the −183COL1A2·CAT construct (Fig. 2 A). Administration of 2 ng/ml of TGF-β into the culture medium resulted in a significant increase in transcriptional activity of the −378 and −313COL1A2·CAT constructs in CFSC-2G cells, but not in primary culture of hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with these results, a parallel experiment of Northern blot hybridization did not show any detectable amount of COL1A2 mRNA in either untreated or TGF-β-treated hepatocytes (data not shown). Transcription of the −183COL1A2·CAT construct did not show TGF-β responsiveness when transfected into either CFSC-2G cells or primary culture of hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained when comparing COL1A2transcription between early passaged HSC, instead of an immortalized HSC clone CFSC-2G, and primary culture of hepatocytes (Fig.2 B). Because the above functional assays revealed a major difference in the promoter activity and TGF-β responsiveness of the −378 to −183 segment between HSC and primary culture of hepatocytes, we next examined the binding of transcription factors present in the nuclei of these cells to theCOL1A2 upstream sequence. Nuclear extracts prepared from primary culture of hepatocytes and CFSC-2G cells exhibited similar gel shift patterns when using the Box 5A oligonucleotide as a probe, although the intensities and relative ratios of the retarded bands were somewhat different from each other (Fig.3 A). By contrast, gel mobility shift assays using the Box 3A probe indicated that nuclear proteins prepared from primary culture of hepatocytes and CFSC-2G cells demonstrated slightly different migrating patterns. The faster migrating complexes obtained with both cell types showed different mobilities from each other (Fig. 3 A). Antibody interference assays revealed that anti-C/EBPβ antibodies effectively diminished the intensity of the Box 5A-bound complexes, particularly the fast migrating bands, in both primary culture of hepatocytes and CFSC-2G cells (Fig. 3 B), as previously reported with NIH3T3 fibroblasts (28Greenwel P. Tanaka S. Penkov D. Zhang W. Olive M. Moll J. Vinson C. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). None of the anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPγ, and anti-NF1 antibodies interfered with the complex obtained with either hepatocytes or CFSC-2G cells (Fig. 3 B). When using the Box 3A oligonucleotide as a probe, anti-Sp1 antibodies completely diminished the slowly migrating complex obtained with CFSC-2G nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead). By contrast, anti-Sp3 antibodies showed a relatively modest effect on both slowly and faster migrating complexes. On the other hand, in the case of primary culture of hepatocytes, anti-Sp3 antibodies completely diminished the intensity of the fast migrating Box 3A-bound complex (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead), whereas anti-Sp1 antibodies had a modest influence on both slowly and faster migrating complexes. Neither anti-Sp2 nor anti-Sp4 antibodies interfered with the complex formation with Box 3A probe (Fig. 3 B). To analyze semi-quantitatively the amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins present in HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes, nuclear proteins prepared from both cell types were subjected to Western blot analyses using anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies. The results indicated that a larger amount of Sp1 protein was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from freshly isolated HSC than in those from hepatocytes (Fig.3 C). Conversely, more Sp3 protein was present in nuclei from parenchymal hepatocytes than those from HSC (Fig. 3 C). Likewise, nuclear extracts prepared from CFSC-2G cells contained a larger amount of Sp1 and less Sp3 protein as compared with hepatocyte nuclei (data not shown). The gel mobility shift assays and Western blot analyses of nuclear proteins indicated a difference in the relative amounts of Box 3A-bound Sp1 and Sp3 between CFSC-2G cells and primary culture of hepatocytes. Thus, we next examined the effects of overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 onCOL1A2 transcription in both cell types. Transfection of CFSC-2G cells with an Sp1 expression plasmid significantly increased basal transcription of the −378COL1A2·LUC construct (Fig.4). TGF-β treatment further increasedCOL1A2 transcription in Sp1-transfected cells. Interestingly, overexpression of Sp1 in primary culture of hepatocytes not only increased basal COL1A2 transcription but also conferred TGF-β responsiveness to the cells (Fig. 4). In contrast to these stimulatory effects of Sp1 overexpression, transfection of CFSC-2G cells with an Sp3 expression plasmid did not affect the basal transcription levels (Fig. 4). More importantly, overexpression of Sp3 in CFSC-2G cells completely abolished TGF-β-elicited COL1A2 stimulation (Fig. 4). We next examined the effects of co-transfecting either Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector together with an expression plasmid encoding Smad3, an intracellular mediator of TGF-β signal transduction. Overexpression of Smad3 in CFSC-2G cells significantly increased transcription of the −378COL1A2·LUC construct (Fig.5 A). Whereas co-transfection with an Sp1 expression plasmid resulted in a further increase in −378COL1A2·LUC transcription, overexpression of Sp3 did not affect Smad3-stimulated COL1A2 transcription (Fig.5 A). Because there are at least two more Sp1 binding sites downstream of the TbRE (Fig. 1; Refs. 29Hasegawa T. Zhou X. Garrett L.A. Ruteshouser E.C. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we also performed co-transfection experiments using the −378COL1A2·LUC construct containing an internal deletion of the −183 to −108 segment (−378COL1A2del·LUC in Fig. 1). Basal transcriptional activity of this internally deleted construct was approximately one-fourth of that of the parental −378COL1A2·LUC construct (Fig. 5 A), indicating that the two Sp1 binding sites present in the −183 to −108 segment are also important for basal COL1A2 transcription. However, co-transfection of Smad3 and Sp1 expression plasmids resulted in the same level (∼3-fold) of transcriptional activation with both −378COL1A2·LUC and −378COL1A2del·LUC constructs (Fig.5 A). It is therefore suggested that Smad3 might interact with the TbRE-bound Sp1, rather than with the downstream Sp1, to mediate TGF-β-elicited COL1A2 stimulation. Functional interaction between Sp1 and Smad3, but not between Sp3 and Smad3, was further confirmed using the bacterial GAL4 system. Transfection of CFSC-2G cells with an expression plasmid encoding GAL4 DNA binding domain-fused Sp1 protein (pMSp1) increased transcription of the pG5-luc reporter gene ∼18-fold. Co-transfection with a Smad3 expression plasmid further increased Sp1-stimulated transcription, although Smad3 by itself had no effect on transcription (Fig.5 B). By contrast, transfection with an expression plasmid encoding a transactivation domain-deleted Sp1 (pMDNSp1) resulted in less than 4-fold increase in pG5-luc transcription, and it was not further stimulated by co-transfection with a Smad3 expression plasmid (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, overexpression of an Sp3·GAL4 fusion protein (pMSp3) stimulated transcription 8-fold, which was not affected by co-transfection with a Smad3 expression plasmid (Fig. 5 B). In the last set of experiments, we examined physical interactions between Sp1 and Smad3 and between Sp3 and Smad3 using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. We first attempted to examine interactions between endogenous GC box binding factors and Smad3 using CFSC-2G cells, but failed to detect any co-immunoprecipitated proteins (data not shown). It was not clear whether this was because of a lack of interaction between Sp1/Sp3 and Smad3 or because of relatively small amounts of these proteins present in CFSC-2G cells. We therefore transfected COS-7 cells with a Myc-tagged Smad3 expression plasmid together with either Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector, in the presence or absence of HA-tagged constitutive active TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5TD). Direct immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-Myc, anti-Sp1, or anti-Sp3 antibodies confirmed expression of Myc-tagged Smad3, Sp1, and Sp3, respectively, in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.6). In the absence of ALK5TD, anti-Sp1 antibodies hardly detected immunocomplexes, which had been first precipitated with anti-Myc antibodies recognizing Myc-tagged Smad3. By contrast, overexpression of ALK5TD markedly enhanced the physical interaction between Sp1 and Smad3 (Fig. 6), indicating that the interaction is TGF-β-dependent. On the other hand, immunoblotting using anti-Sp3 antibodies failed to detect Smad3-bound Sp3, either in the presence or absence of ALK5TD (Fig. 6). In this study, we demonstrated that different molecular mechanisms control COL1A2 transcription in activated HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes. Our experimental data indicated the differential roles of Sp1 and Sp3 in COL1A2 regulation. They also suggested that, in parenchymal hepatocytes, predominant binding of Sp3 to the Box 3A sequence and a lack of interaction with Smad3 may account, at least in part, for relatively low levels ofCOL1A2 transcription and loss of TGF-β responsiveness. It should be noted that, although we confirmed more than 95% purity of hepatocytes, there still remained a small number of HSC contaminated in the culture (31Maher J.J. Bissell D.M. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which may respond to TGF-β. Despite possible underestimate of the results because of this contamination of HSC, cell transfection assays clearly indicated that the COL1A2promoter containing the TbRE did not show TGF-β responsiveness when transfected into primary culture of hepatocytes. Sp1 and Sp3 are closely related proteins with very similar structural features (32Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). They bind to the common GC-rich sequence named the GC box with the same specificity and affinity and regulate gene transcription (33Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, Sp3 often acts as a transcriptional repressor by competitively binding to the Sp1-bound GC box sequences (33Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and/or by expressing internally initiated Sp3 proteins functioning as potent inhibitors of Sp1/Sp3-mediated transcription (34Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that Sp3 can either activate or repress transcription of target genes depending on the cell type, the context of DNA binding sites, and the interactions with other nuclear factors (35Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that both Sp1 and Sp3 stimulateCOL1A2 transcription when transfected intoDrosophila Schneider cells lacking endogenous Sp transcription factors (36Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By contrast, it has been shown by others that co-transfection of an Sp3 expression plasmid inhibits Sp1-stimulated COL1A1 transcription in the same insect cells (37Chen S.-J. Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Gene. 1998; 215: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, neither of the studies examined the effects of Sp1 or Sp3 on TGF-β-elicited COL1A2 stimulation. The present study clearly demonstrated that, although Sp3 functioned as a weaktrans-activator of transcription in the bacterial GAL4 system, it did not increase basal levels of COL1A2transcription when transfected into CFSC-2G cells. More importantly, overexpression of Sp3 abolished TGF-β responsiveness in CFSC-2G cells. Different behaviors of Sp3 in regulating COL1A2transcription in Drosophila Schneider cells and mammalian CFSC-2G cells might be attributed to the presence of interacting factor(s) in the latter cells (35Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of Sp1 in primary culture of hepatocytes conferred TGF-β responsiveness with regard to COL1A2 transcription. A family of proteins termed Smad have been identified (38Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) and found to play important roles in the intracellular signal transduction pathways of the TGF-β superfamily members (22Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of them, Smad3 and Smad4, have been shown to bind to the so-called CAGACA sequence present in the promoters of several TGF-β-inducible genes including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (39Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), junB (40Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), p21WAF1/Cip1 (41Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and Smad7 (42Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Box B of the COL1A2 promoter also contains a CAGACA sequence (−265 to −260) (39Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 40Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that Smad3 binds to this sequence in vitro and stimulates COL1A2transcription (12Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have recently revealed that an interaction between Sp1 and Smad3 is critical in mediating the stimulatory effect of TGF-β onCOL1A2 transcription in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We demonstrated a functional interaction between Sp1 and Smad3/Smad4 using co-transfection experiments. In addition, it was found that, despite the presence of CAGACA sequence in Box B, recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 proteins did not bind to the −313 to −255 sequence by themselves. Nor could they stimulate COL1A2 transcription in fibroblasts stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the dominant-negative form of Sp1 (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Only in the presence of Sp1 protein, Smad3 and Smad4 were able to bind to this sequence and synergistically stimulate COL1A2 transcription. These data suggest the possibility of physical interactions between Sp1 and Smad3/Smad4 (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The present study further confirmed these functional and physical interactions between Sp1 and Smad protein(s) in activated HSC by utilizing the bacterial GAL4 system and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. It also revealed that similar interactions were not observed between Sp3 and Smad3. A recent study has revealed that the glutamine-rich transactivation domain of Sp1 and the MH1 domain of Smad3 mediate the interaction between these two proteins bound to the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene promoter, which is stimulated by TGF-β (43Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, the present study showed that co-transfection of an expression plasmid encoding transactivation domain-deleted Sp1 together with a Smad3 expression vector did not increase transcription in the bacterial GAL4 system. It has been previously reported that the glutamine-rich transactivation domain of Sp1 cannot be replaced by the homologous sequence of Sp3 (33Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is conceivable that a lack of interaction between Sp3 and Smad3 may account, at least in part, for the loss of TGF-β responsiveness of COL1A2 transcription in parenchymal hepatocytes. It has been shown that Smad2, another TGF-β responsive Smad, is also capable of interacting with Sp1 (43Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 44Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Our recent study revealed that Smad2 did not bind to the TbRE of the COL1A2 promoter (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nor did transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with a Smad2 expression plasmid stimulate basal COL1A2 transcription (14Zhang W. Oul J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the other hand, under a certain experimental condition, overexpression of Smad2 in primary culture of skin fibroblasts markedly increased TGF-β responsiveness of COL1A2 transcription without affecting basal transcription level (45Inagaki Y. Mamura M. Kanamaru Y. Greenwel P. Nemoto T. Takehara K. ten Dijke P. Nakao A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Functional roles of Smad2 in TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription have not been fully understood, and experiments are in progress to clarify possible contribution of Smad2 to cell lineage-specificCOL1A2 transcription. In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate, at the molecular level, differences in cell lineage-specific regulation ofCOL1A2 transcription in activated HSC and parenchymal hepatocytes. It illustrates that two members of the GC box binding transcription factor family participate in regulation ofCOL1A2 transcription through differential interaction with Smad3. These results lead to not only better understanding of regulatory mechanisms responsible for cell type-specific gene expression but also the development of novel therapeutic means for fibrotic diseases in various organs by suppressing pathologically activated collagen gene transcription.

Here, we report that TFPI inhibits the proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cells. A truncated form of TFPI, containing only the first two Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains, has very little antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of TFPI is responsible for this activity. Binding studies revealed that full-length TFPI, but not the truncated TFPI molecule, is recognized by the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL receptor) indicating that this receptor is a novel high affinity endothelial cell receptor for TFPI. The antiproliferative activity of TFPI on endothelial cells is inhibited by the receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of ligand binding by the VLDL receptor, and by anti-VLDL receptor antibodies. These results confirm that the antiproliferative activity of TFPI is mediated by the VLDL receptor and suggest that this receptor-ligand system may be a useful target for the development of new anti-angiogenic and antitumor agents.

The fVIIa·TF complex then functions as a potent enzyme, activating factor X which leads to thrombin generation. In addition to initiating coagulation, recent research suggests that fVIIa·TF complexes play an important role in angiogenesis (1Zhang Y. Deng Y. Luther T. Muller M. Ziegler R. Waldherr R. Stern D.M.

Although TF is not normally expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells,in situ hybridization studies have detected TF mRNA in tumor-associated endothelial cells from patients with invasive breast cancer (2Contrino J. Hair G. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Finally, in a TF-dependent metastasis model, the binding and proteolytic activity of VIIa was shown to be necessary for the initial steps of tumor metastasis (3Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin.

TFPI forms a tight complex with both fXa and fVIIa leading to their inhibition. The TFPI molecule contains three Kunitz-type domains and a basic carboxyl-terminal region. By employing site-directed mutagenesis, Girard et al. (4Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze G.J.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the second Kunitz domain is required for efficient binding and inhibition of fXa, and both Kunitz domains 1 and 2 are required for the inhibition of fVIIa/TF activity. Mutation of the predicted inhibitory residues of the third Kunitz domain had no significant effect on either function of TFPI. Rather, this portion of the molecule binds to the cell surfaces by interacting with cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (5Wesselschmidt R. Likert K. Girard T. Wun T.C. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFPI can also bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (6Warshawsky I. Broze G.J.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and, in doing so, mediates the permanent down-regulation of cell-surface TF in monocytic cells via LRP-dependent internalization and degradation (7Hamik A. Setiadi H. Bu G. McEver R.P. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4962-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). LRP is a member of the LDL receptor family, which includes the LDL receptor, LRP-1b, gp330/megalin, apoER2, and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL receptor). LRP is widely expressed in fibroblasts, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, neurons, and activated glial cells (8Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) but does not appear to be highly expressed in vascular endothelium (9Argraves K.M. Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D.

In contrast, VLDL receptor is expressed in HUVECs, in the endothelium of capillaries and small arterioles (10Wyne K.L. Pathak R.K. Seabra M.C. Hobbs H.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and on the endothelial surface of bovine arteries (11Multhaupt H.A.B. Gafvels M.E. Kariko K. Jin H. Arenas-Elliott C. Goldman B.I. Strauss J.F.I. Angelin B. Warhol M.J. McCrae K.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1985-1997PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor was originally identified by homology cloning (12Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and initially was thought to function in the delivery of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to peripheral tissues (12Takahashi S.

Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2173-2182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies in homozygous knockout mice that lack the VLDL receptor gene revealed that the animals had normal levels of plasma triglyceride and cholesterol indicating that in mice the VLDL receptor is not likely a major receptor involved in lipoprotein catabolism (14Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since fVIIa·TF complexes seem to play a role in the pathological proliferation of endothelial cells, we sought to determine whether TFPI, the natural inhibitor of fVIIa/TF, was capable of regulating this process. Our initial studies focused on determining the effect of TFPI on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated endothelial cell growth. We report here that TFPI is a potent inhibitor of the growth of bFGF-stimulated endothelial cells. Furthermore, we show that the antiproliferative activity of TFPI is independent of its fVIIa/TF inhibitory activity but rather results from association with the VLDL receptor. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human microvascular dermal endothelial cells, media for their proliferation (Endothelial Cell Basal Medium (EBM), and Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (EGM) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Rat C6 glioma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). B16BL6 melanoma cell line is a variant cell line derived from B16F10 melanoma cells obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Central Repository (Frederick, MD) certified free of Mycoplasma and other pathogenic murine viruses. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), and l-glutamine were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkerville, MD). TFPI purified from human plasma or HepG2 cells, recombinant full-length TFPI, recombinant truncated TFPI (1–160 a.a), and a rabbit anti-human TFPI were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). bFGF was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 2ME2, heparin (16–17 kDa), gelatin, and hematoxylin were from Sigma. Cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BrdUrd kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the human VLDL receptor carboxyl terminus (R2623) has been described (15Battey F. Gåfvels M.E. Fitzgerald D.J. Argraves W.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the antibody was affinity-purified on peptide-Sepharose as described. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against the purified VLDL receptor (R4522) have been described (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and were purified by chromatography on protein G-Sepharose as described previously (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to human LRP (R777) were developed as described (17Kounnas M.Z.

HUVECs were routinely cultured to confluence in EGM. The cells were trypsinized and plated in a 96-well plate at 5,000 cells per well per 100 μl of EBM supplemented with 2% FCS and antibiotics. The cells were allowed to adhere to the plate for at least 2 h. Then, bFGF at 10 ng/ml and various concentrations of TFPI or 2ME2 were added to the wells. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell proliferation was determined using a uridine incorporation method as described by the manufacturer and confirmed by cell counting (Cell Counter model Z1, Coulter Incorporation, Miami, FL). Inhibition of cell proliferation, as assessed by uridine incorporation, was calculated using Equation 1. %inhibition of proliferation=Equation 1 (absorbance of bFGF­treated cells)−(absorbance of bFGF and TFPI­treated cells)(absorbance of bFGF­treated cells)−(absorbance of untreated cells)×100Additional experiments were performed using VLDL receptor-specific antibodies to block the antiproliferative activity of TFPI. In these experiments, either fixed or increasing concentrations of the rabbit polyclonal anti-VLDL receptor IgG (R4522) or the control anti-VLDL receptor IgG (R2623) were preincubated with HUVECs for 1 h at 37 °C. In other experiments, the VLDL receptor antagonist, RAP, was preincubated with endothelial cells for 24–36 h. After addition of VLDL receptor antagonists, TFPI and bFGF were added, and HUVEC proliferation was determined as above. Rat C6 glioma and B16BL6 melanoma tumor cells were routinely cultured to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. B16BL6 melanoma cells were used between 6 and 18 passages. For the proliferation assay, tumor cells were plated in 96-well plate at 2,500 cells per well per 100 μl of media and were allowed to adhere to the plate for at least 2 h. Various concentrations of TFPI or 2ME2 were then added to the wells. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell proliferation was determined using a uridine incorporation method. Inhibition of cell proliferation was defined as described above. A fragment of the human VLDL receptor was generated as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. The polymerase chain reaction primers used are sense, AGTTGGATCCGGGAGAAAAGCCAAATGTGAA, and antisense, AGTTGAATTCTTAGTAGTAACACTCTTTCAGGGGCTCATCACT. These primers generated a 989-bp fragment corresponding to the 8 ligand binding repeats of the VLDL receptor. Two tyrosine residues were added after the final cysteine of repeat 8 so the fragment could be radioiodinated. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the pGEX-2T vector. The entire insert of this final pGEX-VLDLR1–8 construct was sequenced. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with pGEX-2T-VLDLr1–8 and grown in a 10-liter fermenter. When cells were in mid-log phase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce fusion protein production. After 3 more hours, cells were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and lysed by treatment with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 50 μm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml DNase I for 1 h at 4 °C. The digest was diluted 2-fold into GSH wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and applied to the GSH-Sepharose column. Following washing, the column was eluted with wash buffer containing 25 mm GSH. The GST-VLDLr1–8 fusion protein was digested with 20 nmthrombin for 1.5 h at 25 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 200 nmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl. The digestion reaction was re-applied to the GSH-Sepharose, and the flow-through containing free VLDLr1–8 was recovered. This was dialyzed against 5% acetic acid overnight and lyophilized. The fragment was then resuspended in nitrogenated 6 m guanidinium HCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.5, and refolded according to the method of Dolmer et al. (18Dolmer K. Huang W.

The refolded VLDLr1–8 was subjected to RAP affinity chromatography, and bound VLDLr1–8 was eluted from RAP-Sepharose with 20 mm EDTA. For the solid phase binding assays, purified VLDLr1–8 was immobilized on microtiter wells at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. The microtiter wells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. RAP, uPA, TFPI, and truncated TFPI were radioiodinated using IODO-GEN-coated tubes, whereas VLDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride method as described (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To form the uPA·PAI-1 complex, a 3-fold molar excess of PAI-1 was incubated with 125I-labeled uPA. To determine binding affinities, radiolabeled ligand at the indicated concentration was added to the initial well, and a 3-fold serial dilution was performed, and ligand binding was allowed to continue 1 h at 37 °C. Specific binding was determined using 100-fold molar excess of RAP. After binding, wells were washed 3 times and counted in a γ counter. Mouse PEA13 cells, an LRP-negative cell line, were infected with one of two adenovirus constructs essentially as described (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar): Ad-VLDLr, which encodes for the VLDL receptor, and Ad-LacZ, a control virus which encodes for the β-galactosidase gene. Briefly, either Ad-LacZ or Ad-VLDLr was added to PEA-13 cells at a concentration of 50,000 particles/cell and incubated overnight. After incubation, cells were rinsed and split into 12-well dishes. TFPI binding, internalization, and degradation studies were performed as described (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 25 nm125I-TFPI in binding buffer (DMEM, 2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, Neutridoma®-NS media supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) was incubated with infected PEA13 cells for various lengths of time. Control wells included excess cold RAP, which inhibits ligand binding to the VLDL receptor, or 1 μg/ml chloroquine, which inhibits lysosomal degradation of internalized ligands. At various time points the media were removed and mixed with 50% trichloroacetic (1:5 v/v). The pellet was collected by centrifugation and contained intact ligand, whereas the supernatant contained degraded ligand. Adherent cells were then treated with trypsin, EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells are gently rinsed off the dish and centrifuged. After centrifugation, surface-bound TFPI was localized in the supernatant, whereas the cell pellet contained internalized TFPI. The radioactivity associated with each fraction was determined in a γ counter. To determine the effect that TFPI has on endothelial cell growth, bFGF-stimulated endothelial cells were grown in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of TFPI. As shown in Fig.1 A, TFPI had a dramatic effect on bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell growth, inhibiting proliferation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC50 value of 350 nm. In several additional experiments, the IC50 value for TFPI ranged from 150 to 400 nm. In contrast to its effect on endothelial cells, TFPI had no effect on the growth of B16BL6 melanoma cells (Fig.1 B), Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), or rat C6 glioma cells (data not shown). As a control in each experiment, 2ME2, a naturally occurring antiproliferative agent (19Fotsis T. Zhang Y. Pepper M.S. Adlercreutz H. Montesano R. Nawroth P.P. Schweigerer L. Nature. 1994; 368: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), was used and inhibited the proliferation of both endothelial cells (Fig.1 A) and B16BL6 cells (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of cell proliferation by TFPI was reversible and was restored by removal of TFPI and addition of fresh media containing bFGF. TFPI derived from nonrecombinant sources exhibited a similar antiproliferative activity. Full-length protein purified from human plasma or HepG2 cells inhibited bFGF-promoted proliferation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner with a similar IC50 value (data not shown). TFPI is composed of three Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains. Domains 1 and 2 are required for factor VIIa and Xa binding (4Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze G.J.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), whereas domain 3, along with the carboxyl terminus of TFPI, can bind to heparin (20Enjyoji K. Miyata T. Kamikubo Y. Kato H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5725-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To identify the region of TFPI responsible for this antiproliferative activity, proliferation studies were performed with both full-length TFPI and a truncated TFPI containing only domains 1 and 2 (1–160 a.a.). The results of this experiment (Fig. 2) demonstrated that truncated TFPI exerts a diminished inhibitory action, suggesting that Kunitz-3 and the carboxyl terminus of TFPI play an important role in the antiproliferative action of this protein. We next sought to determine the mechanism of the antiproliferative activity of TFPI. TFPI is known to bind and inhibit the activity of fVIIa·TF complexes. However, we were unable to detect tissue factor antigen on proliferating endothelial cells using immunoblotting experiments, suggesting that another receptor is likely responsible for the antiproliferative activity of TFPI. Previous studies have shown that TFPI binds to the LRP (6Warshawsky I. Broze G.J.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and thus we employed RAP to determine whether TFPI is mediating its effect via an LDL receptor family member. RAP was initially identified when it was noted to copurify with LRP during ligand affinity chromatography (21Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This molecule binds with high affinity to LRP, VLDL receptor, and gp330/megalin and antagonizes the binding of all ligands to these receptors (22Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the current study, a fixed amount of RAP was first preincubated with cells, and 24–36 h later increasing amounts of TFPI were added, such that the molar excess of RAP over TFPI varied from 2- to 8-fold. The results (Fig. 3) demonstrate that RAP inhibits the TFPI antiproliferative effect by shifting the IC50 value of TFPI from 300 to 700 nm. Webb et al. (23Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrated that incubation of cells with RAP for up to 5 days had no effect on the cell surface levels of the VLDL receptor nor on its biological activity. Thus, we conclude that RAP acts as a competitive inhibitor of TFPI, preventing it from binding to a member of the LDL receptor family. RAP alone had no effect on bFGF stimulation of endothelial cell growth and does not affect the binding of 125I-labeled TFPI to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (data not shown), confirming the results of Warshawsky et al. (6Warshawsky I. Broze G.J.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas LRP has been previously reported to bind TFPI, this receptor could not be detected in HUVEC cell extracts by immunoblotting or RAP ligand blotting (9Argraves K.M. Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D. McCrae K.R. Gåfvels M. Kozarsky K.F. Chappell D.A. Strauss J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26550-26557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the structurally related VLDL receptor is expressed in HUVECs in the endothelium of capillaries and small arterioles and on the endothelial surface of bovine arteries, suggesting that the VLDL receptor may be responsible for the effect of TFPI. To test this, we employed specific antibodies to LRP and the VLDL receptor. Although previous studies have determined that the anti-VLDL receptor IgG blocks ligand uptake by this receptor (16Argraves K.M. Kozarsky K.F. Fallon J.T. Harpel P.C. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2170-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the specificity of this antibody on endothelial cells has not been demonstrated. To investigate the specificity of the anti-VLDL receptor antibody, immunoblotting experiments on membrane preparations from endothelial cells were performed. The results of this experiment (Fig. 4) confirm that the anti-VLDL receptor antibody is highly specific and only reacts with two polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 130,000 and 95,000. Multiple forms of the VLDL receptor exist (13Sakai J. Hoshino A. Takahashi S. Miura Y. Ishii H. Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2173-2182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulting from alternate splicing of the pre-mRNA; type I receptors contain theO-linked sugar domains and have an apparent molecular weight of ∼130,000 under nonreducing conditions, whereas type II receptors lack the O-linked sugar domain and have an apparent molecular weight of 95,000–100,000 under nonreducing conditions. VLDL receptor mRNA that lacks exon 4 (encoding for L3) has also been detected in the brain (24Christie R.H. Chung H. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). LRP antibodies had no effect on TFPI inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation (data not shown). In contrast, anti-VLDL receptor IgG did partially neutralize the effect of TFPI on HUVEC proliferation (Fig.5 A), whereas a control IgG prepared against the VLDL receptor cytoplasmic domain had no effect in this assay (Fig. 5 A). In the absence of TFPI, anti-VLDL receptor IgG had no effect on bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation. Fig.5 B demonstrates the effect of increasing antibody concentration on HUVEC proliferation while maintaining a constant concentration of TFPI. Anti-VLDL receptor IgG significantly reduced the effect of TFPI on endothelial cell growth, although it did not completely restore the growth to levels seen in the absence of TFPI. These experiments confirm that the VLDL receptor is involved in this effect. Fig. 5 C shows an experiment in which fixed levels of anti-VLDL receptor IgG were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of TFPI, demonstrating that high concentrations of TFPI can overcome the blocking effects of anti-VLDL receptor IgG. This apparent competition between TFPI and VLDL receptor antibody further supports our hypothesis that the VLDL receptor plays an important role in the TFPI-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell growth. The ability of RAP and anti-VLDL receptor IgG to inhibit the antiproliferative activity of TFPI on endothelial cells suggests that the VLDL receptor is involved in this response. We next sought to determine whether TFPI can directly bind to the VLDL receptor. To measure this, a soluble form of the VLDL receptor (sVLDLr1–8) containing the ligand binding portion of the VLDL receptor (12Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 25Mikhailenko I. Considine W. Argraves K.M. Loukinov D. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3269-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli. Following refolding and affinity purification, the sVLDLr1–8 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE which revealed that the purified receptor migrated as a single band under reducing (Fig. 6 A, lane 1) and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). The faster electrophoretic mobility for sVLDLr1–8 under nonreducing conditions is consistent with the notion of a compactly folded structure arising from the formation of intra-chain disulfide bonds. sVLDLr1–8 was recognized by the anti-VLDLR IgG (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4) confirming that this antibody is capable of binding to the VLDL receptor ligand binding region. The functional properties of the recombinant sVLDLr1–8 were examined by solid phase binding assays. In these experiments, sVLDLr1–8 was coated on microtiter wells, and the ability of 125I-labeled RAP, VLDL, and uPA·PAI-1 complexes to bind to this molecule was measured. The results (Fig. 7) indicate high affinity binding of RAP (K D = 1.4 nm) and uPA·PAI-1 complexes (K D = 7.3 nm) to the immobilized receptor. The K Dvalues measured in these experiments are virtually identical to theK D of 0.7 and 15 nm measured for the binding of RAP and uPA·PAI-1 complexes to the intact VLDLr, respectively (9Argraves K.M. Battey F.D. MacCalman C.D. McCrae K.R. Gåfvels M. Kozarsky K.F. Chappell D.A. Strauss J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

It still remains unclear how these structurally similar enzymes act differently in vivo. In the present study, we performed the enzymatic characterization of ST8Sia II and IV; both ST8Sia II and IV have pH optima of 5.8–6.1 and have no requirement of metal ions. Because the pH dependence of ST8Sia II and IV enzyme activities and the pK profile of His residues are similar, we hypothesized that a histidine residue would be involved in their catalytic activity.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-xiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there have been no mutagenesis studies within sialyl motif VS. A recent study using Fc-NCAM mutants lacking the fourth plus fifth or sixth N-glycosylation sites clearly showed that ST8Sia IV formed larger polySia chains than ST8Sia II (31Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We still cannot exclude the possibility that the lack some N-glycosylation sites Fc-NCAM caused conformational changes that could affect the polysialylation rate by ST8Sia II or/and IV. Unfortunately, the polySia chains of wild-type Fc-NCAMs polysialylated by ST8Sia II and IV have not yet been characterized in detail. The ST8Sia IV enzyme itself was shown to be polysialylated in vitro, and this modification seems to be important for the enzyme activity (37Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that both ST8Sia II and IV underwent polysialylation in vivo and that polysialylated ST8Sia II and IV were localized to the Golgi and cell surface, respectively (38Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These polysialylated enzymes on the cell surface could modulate cell adhesion as suggested by Colley and colleagues (38Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports concerning the actual lengths of the polySia chains of these enzymes. In this study we compared the enzymatic properties of ST8Sia II and IV. Then we examined the importance of the His residue in sialyl motif VS of these enzymes for their catalytic activity. Next, the DPs of polySia in NCAM catalyzed by ST8Sia II and IV were analyzed. Furthermore, we re-examined the actions of both ST8Sia II and IV on themselves, and we found that in this case NeuAcα2,8-NeuAcα2,3-R was the major product instead of α2,8-polysialylation.

All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. ST8Sia II-H348K-bs+ and ST8Sia IV-H331K-bs+ were generated using a Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer 1 (TCCCAGGCCAGCCCCAAAACCATGCCCTTGGAA) and primer 2 (TTCCAAGGGCATGGTTTTGGGGCTGGCCTGGGA) were used to mutate the His residue at position 348 of ST8Sia II to a Lys residue. Primer 3 (TCCAACGCCAGTCCTAAAAGGATGCCATTAGAA) and primer 4 (TTCTAATGGCATCCTTTTAGGACTGGCGTTGGA) were used to mutate the His residue at position 331 of ST8Sia IV to a Lys residue. ST8Sia II-348K and ST8Sia IV-H331K constructs were then cloned into the pCDSA expression vector at the XhoI site. COS-7 cells were grown on 150-mm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected using Lipofectin with the vector plasmids designated as pCDSA-ST8Sia II, pCDSA-ST8Sia II-H348K, pCDSA-ST8Sia IV, and pcDSA-ST8Sia IV-H331K, containing cDNAs encoding IgG binding domain of protein A-fused soluble mouse ST8SiaII, ST8Sia II-H348K, ST8SiaIV, and ST8Sia IV-H331K, respectively (24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20 ml of the medium were collected 48 h after transfection, and the soluble enzymes were adsorbed to 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose resin (50% suspension in PBS), and then used as enzyme preparation as described previously (30Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Soluble enzymes adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose resin were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Aliquots of 2 μl of each enzyme preparation used for sialyltransferase assay were calculated to contain 3.0 pmol of the enzyme. Fc-NCAM protein was prepared as described previously (40Simmons D.H. Harty D. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with a vector plasmid containing a cDNA encoding human NCAM fused with the Fc region of human IgG1. After 72 h, the medium was collected and applied to a protein A-Sepharose column (1 × 1.2 cm). After the column was washed with 10 volumes of PBS, Fc-NCAM was eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.0), and then neutralized immediately with 1m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Fc-NCAM protein was precipitated with 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol, suspended with water, and used for sialyltransferase assay. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Enzyme assays were carried out in the presence of 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0), 0.5% Triton CF-54, 100 μm CMP-[14C]NeuAc, 0.6 μg of Fc-NCAM, and 2 μl of enzyme preparation, in a total volume of 10 μl, as described previously (30Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), unless described otherwise. For ST6GalNAc IV enzyme assay, 10 μg of asialofetuin was used as an acceptor substrate. After 2 h (for SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis) or 16 h (for peptide N-glycanase digestion and for mild acid hydrolysis) of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (for SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis) (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) or by quick freezing at −80 °C (for PNGase F digestion and for mild acid hydrolysis). For product identification by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis, the reaction mixture containing Laemmli sample buffer was denatured at 65 °C for 20 min, loaded onto the gel, and analyzed with a BAS2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji). For product analysis by Mono-Q HPLC following PNGase F digestion or mild acid hydrolysis, enzyme reaction was carried out essentially as described above, but on a 5- or 10-fold larger scale. The reaction mixtures containing 14C-polysialylated Fc-NCAM were diluted with 0.5 ml of PBS, and then 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% suspension in PBS) was added to adsorb 14C-polysialylated Fc-NCAM. For PNGase digestion, the resin was washed with PBS five times and was suspended with 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and then 10 μl (10 unit) of PNGase F was added to it (42Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Roux L. Toomre D.K. Manzi A. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 305-309Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h with gentle shaking, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant containing free N-linked glycan chains was collected for further analysis by Mono-Q HPLC (31Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal.

The sample was diluted to 2 ml with water, and then applied to the Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (0.5 × 5 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with solvent A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). By using solvent A and solvent B (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), two-step linear gradients were generated with a Tosoh HPLC system. Elution was performed for the first 5 min with 0% of solvent B, 0–30% solvent B for the next 20 min, and 30–55% solvent B for the next 75 min. The elution rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions were collected every minute with a connected fraction collector. As an internal reference, mild acid hydrolysates of colominic acid were co-injected with the sample. The elution patterns of oligo/polysialic acid chains and14C-polysialylated compounds were monitored by UV absorption at 210 nm and scintillation counting, respectively. Before the next sample was injected, the column was washed with solvent B for 10 min and then re-equilibrated with solvent A. 14C-Polysialylated ST8Sia II adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose was subjected to controlled mild acid hydrolysis in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) at 37 °C for 4 days. The method has been previously established to detect sialic acid dimer and oligomers (43Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 50Funakoshi Y. Taguchi T. Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After incubation, the sample was centrifuged, and 90% of the supernatant was used for the Mono-Q HPLC analysis which was described as above. The remaining sample was used for TLC analysis on 0.2-mm thick silica gel plastic plates (Kieselgel 60; Merck) in 1-propanol, 25% aqueous ammonia, water, 6:1:2.5 by volume (43Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reference oligosaccharides were visualized using the resorcinol spray reagent after heating at 80 °C. 14C-Sialylated product was visualized with BAS2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji). For determining optimum pH, the enzyme activities were measured in one of the following buffers: 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 5.8, 6.1, 6.4, or 6.7; or 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.7, 7.0, 7.3, or 7.6. To determine metal ion requirements, the enzyme activities were determined by addition of 1 mm EDTA or 10 mmMnCl2, MgCl2, or CaCl2. To determine the Kmvalues of ST8Sia II and IV for N-CAM substrate, various concentrations of Fc-NCAM (0.1–15 μm) and a fixed concentration of CMP-NeuAc (100 μm) were used for sialyltransferase assays. Kinetic constants were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots. In all cases, assays were performed in triplicate. COS-7 cells transiently expressing ST8Sia II, ST8Sia II-H348K, ST8Sia IV, or ST8Sia IV-H331K cDNA were labeled with 35S-Express protein labeling mix for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM and then chased for 6 h in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. Each medium fraction was collected and applied to a 0.5 ml of CDP-hexanolamine-agarose column. The column was washed with buffers E (10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.1% Triton CF-54, 0.15m NaCl) and H (20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.3, 0.1% Triton CF-54, 0.15 m NaCl) and then eluted with buffer H containing 5 mm CDP (45Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 46Paulson J.C. Prieels J.-P. Glasgow L.R. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 253: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). IgG-Sepharose resin (20 μl) was added to each fraction to pull down protein A-fused enzymes and washed with buffer H. The bead fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and with a radioimage analyzer. When we used Fc-NCAM as an acceptor substrate and protein A-tagged ST8Sia II or IV as the enzyme for enzymatic characterization, it was necessary to discriminate between the two kinds of reaction products, i.e. polysialylated Fc-NCAM and ST8Sia II or IV themselves. The reaction products analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimage analysis are shown in Fig. 1. When we used ST8Sia II for enzyme assay in the absence of Fc-NCAM, we observed a broad band of radioactivity extending from 60 to 90 kDa (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of Fc-NCAM, we observed an additional band of >220 kDa that was thought to be polysialylated Fc-NCAM. When we used ST8Sia IV, heterogeneous bands were also observed from 100 to 240 kDa (Fig.1 B). On addition of Fc-NCAM as a substrate, we observed a polysialylated Fc-NCAM at >300 kDa. Migration patterns of the polydisperse bands in the absence of Fc-NCAM were similar with those of polysialylated ST8Sia II (70–131 kDa) and ST8Sia IV (105–190 kDa) reported previously in Chinese hamster ovary cells (38Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together, these polydisperse bands were most likely polysialylated ST8Sia II and IV, respectively. In the present study, we discriminated between 14C-polysialylated Fc-NCAM and14C-polysialylated ST8Sia II and IV by their migration rates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Optimal pH for ST8Sia II and IV activity was determined over the pH range of 5.5–7.6 (Fig.2 and TableI). Maximum enzyme activities of ST8Sia II and IV were observed at almost the same pH range, pH 5.8–6.1, with Fc-NCAM as an exogenous acceptor. Next, the effects of 1 or 10 mm Mn2+, Ca2+, or Mg2+ions on ST8Sia II and IV activities were tested (Table I). At 1 mm, none of these ions showed any significant effects on enzyme activity. ST8Sia II activity was inhibited slightly by the addition of 10 mm MnCl2, CaCl2, or MgCl2, whereas these ions showed lesser effects on ST8Sia IV activity. It was also shown that 1 mm EDTA had little effect on ST8Sia II or IV activity (data not shown).Table IEnzymatic properties of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IVST8Sia IIST8Sia IV%Effect of metal ion1-aRelative activities in which control (no addition of metal ions) was taken as 100%.

Open table in a new tab The optimum pH for ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV is 5.8–6.1. The apparent Km value for NCAM is 3.2 μmfor ST8Sia II and 8.9 μm for ST8Sia IV. Although it is widely known that both ST8Sia II and IV can polysialylate NCAM in vitro and in vivo, no quantitative data concerning the affinity of these enzymes with NCAM have been reported. Next, protein A-fused soluble enzymes, ST8Sia II and IV, were used to determine theKm values of ST8Sia II and IV for Fc-NCAM. Enzyme assays were performed using various concentrations of Fc-NCAM (0.1–15 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TheKm value of ST8Sia II for Fc-NCAM was 3.2 μm, which was almost one-third of that of ST8Sia IV (8.9 μm) (Fig. 3 and Table I). These values were significantly lower than those for any other glycosyltransferases for their acceptor substrates reported previously. Based on our observation that the pH dependence of ST8Sia II and IV activities and the pKprofile of His are similar, we hypothesized that a His residue conserved in these enzymes may be involved in their catalytic activity. All sialyltransferase genes cloned to date have three consensus motifs,i.e. sialyl motif L, S, and VS. Previous reports suggested that sialyl motif L is involved in binding of CMP-NeuAc and that sialyl motif S is related to the binding of both donor and acceptor substrates. By using degenerate primers based on highly conserved sialyl motif L and S sequences, many sialyltransferase genes have been cloned (48Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast, sialyl motif VS has been poorly characterized. Interestingly there is a conserved His residue in sialyl motif VS of all sialyltransferase genes cloned to date (Fig.4). To determine whether the His residue in this motif is critical for the catalytic activity, we constructed mutant ST8Sia II and IV in which the His residue of sialyl motif VS was changed to a Lys residue. As shown in Fig.5 A, both ST8Sia II and IV mutant proteins, ST8Sia II-H348K and ST8Sia IV-H331K, were secreted into the medium from COS cell transfectants, suggesting that the mutants were folded correctly. Each enzyme protein fused with protein A was prepared using IgG-Sepharose from medium and used for enzyme assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, we found no detectable enzyme activity for ST8Sia II-H348K or ST8Sia IV-H331K mutants (Fig. 5 B). Not only polysialyltransferases but also other types of sialyltransferase such as ST6GalNAc IV lost enzyme activities by the replacement of His residue in sialyl motif VS with Lys residue, as shown in Fig. 5 C. The result suggested that the mutation in His residue of sialyl motif VS is not specific for polysialyltransferases but is specific for sialyltransferases in general. As ST8Sia II-H348K and ST8Sia IV-H331K mutants were shown to b"
https://openalex.org/W1983106503,"Just as interactions of soluble proteins are affected by the solvent, membrane protein binding is influenced by the surface environment. This is particularly true for adhesion receptors because their function requires tightly apposed membranes. We sought to demonstrate, and further, to quantify the possible scale of this phenomenon by comparing the effective affinity and kinetic rates of an adhesion receptor (CD16b) placed in three distinct environments: red blood cells (RBCs), detached Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and K562 cells. Effective affinity reflects both the intrinsic receptor-ligand kinetics and the effectiveness of their presentation by the host membranes. Expression of CD16b, a low affinity Fcγ receptor, was established by either transfection or spontaneous insertion via its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Binding to IgG-coated RBCs, measured using a micropipette method, indicated a 50-fold increase in effective affinity for receptors on RBCs over CHO and K562 cells, whereas the off rates were similar for all three. Electron microscopy confirmed that specific tight contacts were broad in RBC-RBC conjugates but sparse in CHO-RBC conjugates. We suggest that through modulation of surface roughness the cytoskeleton can greatly impact the effectiveness of adhesion molecules, even those with no cytoplasmic structures. Implications for locomotion and static adhesion are discussed. Just as interactions of soluble proteins are affected by the solvent, membrane protein binding is influenced by the surface environment.

We suggest that through modulation of surface roughness the cytoskeleton can greatly impact the effectiveness of adhesion molecules, even those with no cytoplasmic structures. Implications for locomotion and static adhesion are discussed. Cell–cell bond formation must be preceded by the creation of a contact zone, a region in which surface-bound receptors and ligands are able to bridge narrow gaps, properly aligning by lateral and rotational diffusion (1Bell G.I. Dembo M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 1051-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Rough cells initially may form isolated point contacts that over time might be broadened and connected through active membrane processes (2Dustin M.L. Golan D.E. Zhu D.M. Miller J.M. Meier W. Davies E.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30889-30898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cells may simply possess inherently smooth surfaces capable of broad initial contacts. A smooth membrane will not enhance binding to a soluble ligand because the soluble protein can diffuse freely into the membrane folds of rough cells. However, in adhering to immobilized ligand, the ability to form an expansive tight contact area is a distinct advantage. Therefore, cell-cell adhesion depends not only on the intrinsic kinetic rates of the receptor-ligand interaction but also on how effectively the host membranes present these molecules (3Erlandsen S.L. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In this study we quantified the effects of various microtopological presentations on cell adhesion by comparing the effective affinity of the same receptor (CD16b) in three distinct host environments: erythrocytes (RBCs), 1The abbreviations used are:RBCred blood cellCHOChinese hamster ovaryGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolSEMscanning electron microscopy Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and erythroleukemic K562 cells. Although all other Fc receptors have intracellular domains, CD16b (FcγRIIIb) terminates at the lipid bilayer with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety and so has no direct cytoskeletal interface. Currently there are no data to suggest the existence of multiple activation states in CD16b. These simplifications permit a more focused investigation into the role of the membrane environment in the functionality of this receptor.The adhesive character of CD16b in each environment was quantified by using a recently developed micropipette method (4Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This assay is unique in its yield of estimates for the effective kinetic rate constants for binding of membrane-bound ligand, so-called two-dimensional parameters. Earlier results from the application of this assay to the binding of CD16b-transfected CHO and K562 cells to IgG-coated RBCs produced similar two-dimensional binding parameters for both transfectants (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1867-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was to examine an additional environment, the RBC membrane, that has a markedly smoother morphology and to compare these results with those from the earlier CHO and K562 studies. We also visually compared the structure of the different cell to cell contacts with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this manner we were able to demonstrate a major role for membrane microtopology in cell adhesion and suggest an expanded role for the cytoskeleton in the regulation of adhesion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and ProteinsErythrocytes were isolated from whole blood and stored in EAS45 RBC additive solution (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transfected cell lines and murine monoclonal antibodies were produced in house except for UPC-10 (IgG2a, Sigma). CD16b (NA2 allotype) was detergent-extracted from transfected K562 cells and purified by affinity chromatography (7Nagarajan S. Anderson M. Ahmed S.N. Sell K.W. Selvaraj P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline (5 mm) to the lysis buffer. Purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Reconstitution and Chromium-Chloride CouplingReconstitution, or transfer of purified CD16b to target membranes, was accomplished by coincubation at 37 °C according to Nagarajan et al. (7Nagarajan S. Anderson M. Ahmed S.N. Sell K.W. Selvaraj P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reconstituted RBCs were kept in ice-cold EAS45 for up to 2 weeks (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Covalent coupling of human IgG to the surfaces of RBCs employed a modified chromium-chloride method (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Site densities of protein on RBCs (CrCl3-coupled IgG or reconstituted CD16b) were determined by quantitative indirect fluorescent immunoassay using LFA-3 expression as in Ref. 5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. Site densities of CD16b on K562 and CHO cells were quantified by radioimmunoassay using 125I-CLBFcgran1 Fab fragments.The Micropipette Adhesion Frequency AssayDetails of the micropipette system and the adhesion frequency assay have been described (4Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay involves using a computer-controlled piezoelectric actuator to move a pair of cells (one receptor-bearing and one ligand-bearing) into contact, hold them for a prescribed duration, and then quickly retract one. Direct observation of any deflection in the flexible RBC membrane indicates the presence of at least one bond at the moment of retraction (Fig.1). A video demonstration of the micropipette assay is available online (Video 1). For each cell line 40–80 cell pairs were examined over a range of contact durations and receptor-ligand expression levels, with at least 100 consecutive adhesion cycles performed for each cell pair. Adhesion frequencies were either directly compared or used to generate characteristic binding parameters. In the latter cases, estimates for the effective affinity and kinetics were determined (4Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 8Zhu C. Williams T.E. Biophys.

Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Conjugated samples were prepared by mixing equal amounts of receptor and ligand-bearing cells, centrifuging (5 min, 200 × g), incubating on ice for 30 min, and gently resuspending with a wide mouth pipette. Normal RBCs replaced the reconstituted RBCs in negative controls. Samples were examined for conjugate formation under light microscopy prior to fixation. Subsequent sample processing and imaging were performed by R. Apkarian (Emory University Integrated SEM Facility). Specimens were staged in the lens of an ISI DS-130 SEM operated at 5 kV. Localization images were obtained below the lens using a 4-mm working distance.RESULTSCD16b and IgG Expression Levels on the Host Cell SurfacesCD16b-expressing K562 and CHO cells, transfected from the same vectors, were used as independent cellular hosts for the adhesion receptor. Because CD16b utilizes a hydrophobic GPI anchor, it can be reinserted, or reconstituted, into the lipid bilayer of any available membrane (7Nagarajan S. Anderson M. Ahmed S.N. Sell K.W. Selvaraj P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CD16b was purified from the K562 transfectant membranes and reconstituted into RBCs and wild-type CHO cells. The ligand, human IgG, was covalently coupled to RBCs by a chromium-chloride method. Expression levels for all cells are shown in Fig. 2. Flow cytometry before and after each experiment series confirmed expression stability.Figure 2The receptor CD16b was presented on three cell types (a) using two different mechanisms (b), transfection ( CHO , K562) and reconstitution ( RBC , CHO ). The ligand IgG was coated on RBC membranes via chromium-chloride chemistry. Mean site densities were determined by radioimmunoassay or quantitative indirect fluorescent immunoassay. Several RBC site densities were examined within the ranges shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RBC-reconstituted CD16b Binds Specifically to RBC-bound IgGSpecificity was established with the micropipette assay (Fig.3 a). RBCs that underwent the sham reconstitution (i.e. without CD16b present) showed minimal binding to IgG+ RBCs. Preincubation of CD16b+ RBCs with the function-blocking monoclonal antibody CLBFcgran1 (10 μg/ml, 30 min, 4 °C) suppressed the binding seen when preincubating these cells with an irrelevant mIgG2a. Similarly, preincubation of IgG+ RBCs with soluble dimeric CD16a, a moderate affinity Fcγ receptor, partially blocked binding, whereas soluble dimeric B7, a non-IgG-associating protein, had no effect.Figure 3a, adhesion frequencies during controlled contacts between RBC pairs presenting CD16b and IgG. Either the receptor- or ligand-presenting RBC was preincubated with an adhesion-blocking or structurally similar irrelevant protein.b, results from micropipette adhesion frequency assays show how adhesion approaches equilibrium as the contact times increase. A single fit (curves) to the model of all the data shown generated an estimate for Ac Kaand kr. Total n = 40 pairs, 100 contacts each. Individual points are means ± S.E. Site densities are in molecules/μm2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Time-dependent Adhesion Frequency Provides Estimates for the Two-dimensional Kinetic Rates Ackfand kr and the Effective Affinity AcKaThe micropipette assay was used to generate time-dependent adhesion frequency curves from three sets of RBC pairs expressing various levels of CD16b and IgG. An additional series of experiments was performed with cells coated with ovalbumin rather than IgG. Results are shown in Fig. 3 b. All data were fit simultaneously to a previously described probabilistic adhesion model (4Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) to determine the effective affinity and kinetic rates for the RBC-RBC system.The adhesion model (and its generalized extension (8Zhu C. Williams T.E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1850-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) is premised on the idea that, once membranes become close enough for receptors and ligands to bridge the gap, the actual event of forming or breaking each incremental bond is probabilistic. The kinetic rates influence this probability in a predictable way. The initial slope of the adhesion frequency curve is proportional to the forward kinetic ratekf, whereas the equilibrium frequency reflects the affinity Ka. The equilibrium adhesion frequency and initial slope also depend on the product of the receptor and ligand population densities (as is evident in Fig. 3 b) and the contact area Ac. Because acceptable contact gaps must be on the order of tens of nanometers, the true contact area is not determinable in the micropipette assay (although a constantapparent contact area, as seen under light microscopy, is maintained by the piezo throughout all experiments). The contact area therefore is embedded with Ka to form what we have termed the effective affinityAc Ka. Because it includes information regarding both the intrinsic reaction kinetics of the molecules and the effectiveness of their presentation, effective affinity will determine the membrane-specific level of bond formation for any given level of receptor-ligand expression. Note that these are two-dimensional binding parameters describing the association of membrane-bound receptors and ligands. The commonly used three-dimensional parameters, governing the binding of soluble ligand to membrane-bound receptors, do not necessarily predict the two-dimensional behavior (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Best fits of the data to the model produced estimates for the effective affinity as well as the reverse kinetic rate constant for IgG+ RBC to CD16b+ RBC adhesion. (The effective forward rate constant is derivable from Ac kf =Ac Ka × kr.) Using this single pair of parameters, all three curves shown in Fig.3 b were generated, illustrating the high quality of the estimates.RBC Effective Affinity Is 50-fold Higher than That of CHO or K562 Cells, but There Are No Differences in Reverse Kinetic RatesThe effective affinity and reverse rate for CD16b+ RBC are compared in Fig.4 a with those for CHO cells (5Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and K562 cells (6Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1867-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When hosted by RBCs, the receptor displayed a tremendous 50-fold increase in effective affinity over the CHO and K562 cell hosts. However, no significant differences in reverse kinetic rates were found, indicating that the affinity enhancement was due solely to a much increased effective forward rate on the RBC host.Figure 4a, comparison ofAc Ka and kr(means ± S.E.) of RBC-reconstituted CD16b with CHO- and K562-transfected CD16b illustrates the 50-fold higher effective affinity of RBCs despite similar reverse rates. b, using reconstitution only, K562-purified CD16b was transferred to the surfaces of RBCs and wild-type CHO cells from the same aliquot. Testing for adhesion frequency during 5-s contacts confirmed that the reconstituted CHO cells performed as poorly as the transfected CHOs, relative to the RBCs. For multialiquot comparison, the frequencies predicted by the binding parameters in a under these conditions (CD16b/μm2 = 115 for RBC, 80 for CHO) are shown in italics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Increased Binding Efficiency Is Not Due to ReconstitutionBecause the receptor was expressed on RBCs via reconstitution (protein transfer) and by transfection (gene transfer) in the other hosts, we investigated whether reconstitution itself could account for the enhanced binding. Using the same aliquot of purified protein, CD16b was reconstituted onto both RBCs and wild-type CHO cells. With a fixed contact time of 5 s, cells were assayed for binding frequency against IgG-coated RBCs. Sham-reconstituted cells were negative controls. Results are shown in Fig. 4 b. Just as with the transfected CHO cells, the reconstituted CHO cells exhibited a low level of binding relative to the RBCs. In fact, using the parameters obtained with the transfected CHO cells (Fig.4 a), a predicted adhesion frequency was calculated and found to be quite similar to the adhesion frequency actually observed here using reconstituted CHOs, thus establishing the equivalency of the reconstitution and transfection modes of expression. It should be noted also that the excellent correspondence between the predictions based on earlier experiments and results from new experiments with a different CD16b preparation suggests a high degree of reproducibility for all reagents and protocols employed.Enhanced Binding to RBCs Is Not Evident in the Three-dimensional Association of Soluble Antibody to the F/G Loop of Membrane-bound CD16bUnlike two-dimensional interactions, microtopological differences should not impact three-dimensional binding because a soluble ligand can easily access both peaks and valleys on the cell surface. To test this in our system we used Scatchard analysis to measure the three-dimensional affinity of the monoclonal antibody CLBFcgran1 for RBC-reconstituted CD16b. CLBFcgran1 binds CD16b in the area of the F/G loop on the membrane-proximal globular domain of the receptor (9Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1576-1581PubMed Google Scholar). The F/G loop also hosts critical epitopes for IgG binding (10Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The CD16b-CLBFcgran1 dissociation constant, Kd(= 1/Ka), was found to be 8 ± 2 nmwith reconstituted RBCs and 12 ± 5 nm with transfected CHO cells (11Chesla S.E. Li P. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10235-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating the lack of any significant binding enhancement for RBCs with an antibody in solution. It is also further evidence of the equivalency of the two expression modes.RBC Doublets Form Broad Tight Contacts, Whereas CHO-RBC Conjugates Do NotThe surface microtopology of RBCs, CHO cells, and K562 cells was examined by scanning electron microscopy (Figs. 2 and5). Although the RBC surfaces were quite smooth, CHO cells (detached with EDTA) were densely covered with long microvilli, and K562 cells displayed bulbous extensions averaging 200–400 nm in height. Still, even on the red cell intermembrane gaps greater than about 50 nm are in effect infinite, precluding any possibility for receptor-ligand interaction. Quantifying true contact area formation by direct means has proven challenging (12Mege J.L. Capo C. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 177-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although Dustin et al. (13Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) has demonstrated a promising approach. In this paper we have presented effective affinity as an indirect measure when intrinsic affinity can be controlled. For a more direct examination, CD16b-IgG-mediated RBC-RBC and CHO-RBC conjugates were prepared and viewed under SEM (Fig. 5, a and b). High magnification imaging of the region of contact between RBC-RBC conjugates revealed broad areas in which the membrane gap would likely accommodate receptor-ligand interactions. In contrast, the CHO-RBC conjugates were characterized by widely distributed point contacts between CHO microvilli and the RBC membrane. This was consistent with Mege et al. (12Mege J.L. Capo C. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 177-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), who presented transmission electron microscopy images of RBCs showing sparse small contacts with rough-surfaced macrophages.Figure 5Scanning electron microscopy of receptor-ligand-mediated RBC-RBC (a) and CHO-RBC (b) conjugates illustrates the effects of microtopology on initial contact area formation. c, RBCs labeled with 12 nm anti-CD16 immunogold prior to SEM prep suggest a random distribution of this GPI-anchored receptor when reconstituted into RBC membranes. CD16b/μm2 = 21 from quantitative indirect fluorescent immunoassay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe effective forward kinetic rate,Ac kf, was found to be about 50-fold higher when the receptor CD16b was hosted by RBCs rather than CHO or K562 cell membranes. Purification and reconstitution of the protein did not create any alterations leading to increased binding. The evidence points toward the host cell environment as the source of this effect rather than any variation in the protein itself.These results suggest the presence of a 50-fold greater true contact area in RBC-RBC pairings over those in CHO-RBC or K562-RBC pairings, all with similar apparent contact areas. A larger true contact area will increase the rate at which bonds form but will have no influence on their reverse rates because the latter governs the dissociation of preexisting bonds. This pattern is evident in the data presented here. The enhanced RBC binding was isolated to the forward kinetic rate and two-dimensional assays only, consistent with our hypothesis that microtopology was the underlying mechanism for the enhancement.Cell-dependent Differences in Lateral Diffusion Should Not Affect the Outcomes of Short Duration Low Affinity ContactsThere has been considerable recent discussion regarding the effects of lateral diffusion on receptor-ligand interactions. Although the lateral diffusion of lipid-anchored proteins on RBCs may differ from that on K562 or CHO cells, such differences are unlikely to play a significant part in the micropipette assay employed here. There are two elements of higher lateral diffusion that may affect adhesion: (i) faster depletion-driven diffusion of free molecules intothe contact area as bonds form, and (ii) more frequent free receptor-ligand interactions within the contact. In the first case, bond formation lowers the concentration of free molecules in the contact area relative to the noncontact surfaces, therefore driving the flux of additional free molecules into the contact area (13Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In high affinity cases this initial flow might be rapid. However, in very low affinity (and very brief) interactions such as those described here, only a few bonds are expected to form despite the presence of hundreds to thousands of free receptors and ligands in the contact area. (This can be seen in Fig. 3 b, in which the frequency of having no adhesion at all is considerable.) Depletion therefore is so limited that even if bound molecules were immediately replaced the increase in population density (and hence, adhesion frequency) would be negligibly small. This is in contrast with long duration, actively spreading contacts, where lateral diffusion has been demonstrated to have a role in the rate of adhesion strengthening (14Chan P.Y. Lawrence M.B. Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Golan D.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Note that the mechanism described above can potentially affect bond formation rate but not the ultimate equilibrium adhesion level. This is also true for the second rapid diffusion feature, increased molecular interaction frequency. In a fixed amount of time, a highly mobile receptor may encounter a larger number of free ligands than a less mobile molecule. In a high affinity system this may result in a noticeable acceleration of bond formation and, hence, an earlier equilibrium, but it will also cause an increase in the dissociation rate. Diffusion is fundamentally a process that can alter the rate at which a system reaches equilibrium but cannot alter the final equilibrium state. Therefore the 50-fold equilibrium affinity difference described in this paper cannot be explained by dissimilar diffusivities.It is interesting to note that even the kinetic rates will be independent of diffusivity if the adhesion is reaction-limited rather than diffusion-limited. This, in fact, is the case here, again because of very low affinity. With kr = 0.5/s andkf = 3 × 10−6 μm2/s (assuming at least half of the apparent contact area is true contact in RBC-RBC adhesions) and a very slow diffusion coefficient of 0.01 μm2/s, the procedure of Lauffenburger and Linderman (15Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signalling. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 143-160Google Scholar) decomposes kf into a diffusion-drivenk+ of 2 × 10−2μm2/s and a reaction-driven kon of 3 × 10−6 μm2/s. So the diffusion step is conservatively four orders faster than the reaction step, strongly suggesting reaction-limited diffusion-independent kinetic rate constants and accounting for the nearly identical krvalues in Fig. 4 a. We have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to estimate the actual diffusion coefficient of CD16b on CHO cells to be 0.16 μm 2S. Chesla and C. Zhu, unpublished data. /s, an even more reaction-limiting value than above.2Cell-specific Localization or Clustering Patterns Could ContributeAlthough the simplest explanation for the 50-fold difference in the CD16b effective affinity appears to be the distinct microtopology of the RBCs as compared with CHO and K562 cells, there may be other cell-specific factors playing a contributory role that will require additional studies to clarify. For example, localization of molecules into regions of low or high adhesive potential has been observed in several other cases. On neutrophils, L-selectin is localized preferentially on microvilli tips, whereas integrin αMβ2 is predominantly on the cell body (3Erlandsen S.L. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this study, a surface distribution that localized the CD16b near the cell body and away from promontories on both CHO and K562 cells would contribute to the diminished binding seen relative to RBCs. Because GPI proteins lack a cytoplasmic domain, nonrandom distributions would rely on either an association with a transmembrane protein linked to the cytoskeleton or lipid interactions.Clustering (distinct from localization) of receptors could increase their effective affinity by lowering the entropic barrier to ligand binding. GPI-rich lipid microdomains, termed rafts, have been proposed, although they remain controversial (16Kenworthy A.K. Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 17Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). At present their cellular distribution patterns and the proportion of GPI molecules likely associated with them is unclear. Our preliminary SEM studies h"

Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is secreted by the liver, and its mRNA is present in most other tissues, implying that they secrete it as well (4Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An immunohistochemical study has shown that selenoprotein P is strongly associated with endothelial cells (5Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Boeglin M.E. Ebner F.F. Chittum H.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, selenoprotein P is present in extracellular fluid and bound to cells. There is increasing evidence that selenoprotein P has a role in defense against oxidative injury. Administration of low doses of diquat to selenium-deficient rats causes lipid peroxidation, massive liver necrosis, and death within a few hours (6Burk R.F. Lawrence R.A. Lane J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1024-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These adverse events can be prevented by injection of a physiological dose of selenium 12 h before administration of the diquat. The selenium-dependent protection correlates with the appearance of selenoprotein P in plasma but not with the appearance of glutathione peroxidase in liver or in plasma (7Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Kato T. Cockell K.A. Lyons P.R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study using this model showed that the initial lesion in the liver was injury of the centrilobular sinusoidal endothelial cells and loss of them within 2 h (8Atkinson J.B. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell loss was followed within an hour by necrosis of the exposed hepatocytes. The results of these studies are compatible with protection by selenoprotein P against diquat-induced oxidative injury of endothelial cells. Two reports have appeared recently suggesting that selenoprotein P has enzymatic activities of an antioxidant nature (9Saito Y. Hayashi T. Tanaka A. Watanabe Y. Suzuki M. Saito E. Takahashi K. J.

It binds to heparin-Sepharose columns when applied at pH 7.0, but most of it is eluted when the pH is raised to 8.5. This suggests that histidine residues, which have pKa values of 6.5–7.0, are important in the binding. Elution of bound selenoprotein P with a pH gradient from 7.0 to 8.5 yielded several peaks, suggesting the presence of isoforms of the protein that have differing affinities for heparin (12Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two of the eluted peaks contained single proteins that shared the same N terminus. One was the full-length form of selenoprotein P, and the other was a short form that terminated at the second UGA (13Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other isoforms appear to exist, and all of them bind to heparin (12Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This report, which presents the first structural data on selenoprotein P, describes experiments carried out to locate its heparin-binding site(s). Site-directed mutagenesis is often used to assess the significance of specific amino acid residues in binding of proteins to heparin. However, expression of animal selenoproteins is generally not possible in bacteria and is even difficult to achieve in animal cells. Thus, site-directed mutagenesis could not be used to study heparin binding by selenoprotein P. The older, but classic, techniques of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and mass spectrometry were used to identify histidine and lysine residues that are responsible for the interaction of selenoprotein P with heparin. p-Hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG)1 was from Pierce. DEPC, [14C]DEPC, TNBS, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and heparin-agarose were purchased from Sigma. FPLC and heparin HiTrap columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were analytical grade or better. For reverse phase HPLC, a Hewlett-Packard XDB-C18 column (2.1-mm inner diameter × 15 cm) was used. For tryptophan emission experiments, a SPEX-Fluorolog-1681 photon-counting fluorometer was used. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on a Hewlett Packard P8453 spectrophotometer linked to a Hewlett Packard-Vectra XM microcomputer. Selenoprotein P was purified from rat plasma by a simplification of a previously described method (1Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

Rat plasma, containing a small amount of 75Se-labeled selenoprotein P, was applied to the column. Typically, 50 ml of plasma was applied to the column and then washed with 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The column was washed with 15 ml of 1m NaCl to elute nonspecifically adsorbed plasma proteins. Selenoprotein P was then eluted from the column with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.8, and collected in 1-ml fractions. The eluted protein was neutralized with 50 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, so that the final concentration of Tris-Cl was 50 mm. “Cold” selenoprotein P (without 75Se-labeled plasma added) could be purified using the same procedure. The unlabeled protein was used for labeling with [14C]DEPC, proteolytic digestion, separation by HPLC, and 14C determination by liquid scintillation. Modification by DEPC was performed either on purified protein or on rat plasma. For DEPC modification of selenoprotein P, a final concentration of 6.9 mm DEPC in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was used unless otherwise indicated. For modification of lysine residues with TNBS, the final concentration of TNBS was 0.2 mm in 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer at pH 7.0 or pH 8.5. Modification of arginine residues was done with 1 mm HPG in 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.0. Four separate columns of heparin-agarose (0.8 ml) were equilibrated with 50 mmsodium bicarbonate, pH 7.0. Purified selenoprotein P (50 μg) was treated for 2 h with either TNBS, DEPC, or HPG, or was not treated. Modification of selenoprotein P with DEPC was done in 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Modification of selenoprotein P with TNBS was done in 0.2 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Modification of selenoprotein P with HPG was done in 0.2 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0. After modification, the samples were dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.0, for 4 h at 4 °C. After dialysis, each sample was applied to a heparin-agarose column. The columns were each washed with 11 ml of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.0.75Se in the wash was determined by radioactive measurement of 1-ml aliquots of wash in an LKB Compugamma 1282 γ-counter. Carbethoxylation of histidine residues by DEPC causes an increase in absorbance at 240 nm (14Ovadi J. Keleti T. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1969; 4: 365-378PubMed Google Scholar). Selenoprotein P (50 μg) in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer was used as a reference blank, and DEPC was added to an identical sample to give a final concentration of 6.9 mm. The extent of modification, as measured by an increase in absorbance at 240 nm, was monitored over 10 min. The same experiment was carried out with heparin (5 mg/ml) in the solution. The extent of modification of lysine residues was monitored using the lysine-specific reagent, TNBS. When TNBS reacts with the ε-amino group of lysine, an increase in absorbance at 420 nm occurs (15Fields R. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Purified selenoprotein P was modified in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7 or at pH 8.5. The absorbance at 420 nm was followed for 10 min. Modification of histidine residues by DEPC is dependent upon the pH, since the positively charged imidazolium ion will not react with DEPC. For these studies, 50 μg of selenoprotein P in 1 ml of 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer with pH values from 5.5 to 8.0 was modified with 6.9 mm DEPC, and the extent of modification was followed at 240 nm. For heparin HiTrap chromatography, 0.1-ml aliquots of plasma labeled with 75Se diluted to 1 ml with buffer A (100 mm ammonium acetate, 50 mmTris base, and 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.0) were used. One sample was then modified with 6.9 mm DEPC for 5 min in the starting buffer. A second sample was modified with 6.9 mm DEPC for 5 min in the starting buffer and then treated with 110 volume of 2 m hydroxylamine (adjusted to pH 7.0) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Carbethoxylation of histidine residues can be reversed by treatment with hydroxylamine (16Melchior W.B. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This reversal has previously been used to distinguish modification of histidine residues by DEPC from modification of thiols and other amino groups in proteins (17Miles E.W. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third sample, used as the control, was not treated with DEPC. The samples were then injected onto 1-ml heparin HiTrap columns attached to a FPLC. The columns were then washed with 10 volumes of buffer A. Selenoprotein P was eluted with a linear gradient from 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B (0.25 ml/min flow rate). Buffer B was identical to buffer A, except that its pH was 8.5. Protein remaining on the column after the pH gradient was eluted with 2m NaCl in buffer B. 400 μg of selenoprotein P in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, was mixed with 2 μg of chymotrypsin, 2 μg of trypsin, or neither and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the sample was loaded onto a 1-ml heparin HiTrap column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0 (buffer C). The column was then washed with 10 ml of buffer C, after which a salt gradient was applied. Buffer D was the same as buffer C except that it contained 1 m NaCl. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and the gradient was set at 2.22% buffer D/ml. A 200-μg sample of selenoprotein P was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. [14C]DEPC was added to a final concentration of 6.9 mm (specific activity 1.6 mCi/mmol). The sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then dialyzed against 4 liters of 10 mm NaHCO3buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. This was followed by digestion with 10 μg of chymotrypsin for 5 h at room temperature. The sample was then dried in a SpeedVac to reduce the volume, redissolved in 100 μl of column buffer, and injected onto the HPLC column. The HPLC column was a 2.1-mm inner diameter × 15-cm narrow bore C18 column (XDB-C18). Solvent E consisted of 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent F consisted of 30% solvent E and 70% acetonitrile. The initial conditions were 95% E, 5% F for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% F in 70 min, followed by a return to the initial conditions over 2 min. Selenoprotein P was also modified in the presence of heparin. Conditions for modification, digestion, and HPLC were the same as above except that the sample contained 5 mg/ml heparin. Plasma (25 μl) containing selenoprotein P radiolabeled in vivo was brought to a volume of 0.5 ml with buffer A, pH 6.9. This sample was applied to a 1-ml heparin HiTrap column and washed with 10 ml of buffer A, pH 6.9, and successively with 10-ml volumes of the same buffer containing 0.0069, 0.069, 0.69, and 6.9 mm DEPC. Then 10-ml of buffer A, pH 6.9, containing 1m NaCl was passed over the column to elute the remaining selenoprotein P. This experiment is shown in Fig. 7 A. Fractions 62–64 shown in Fig. 7 A were combined and extensively buffer exchanged with buffer A, pH 6.9. The buffer-exchanged sample was applied to another heparin HiTrap column as shown in Fig. 7 B and washed with 10 ml of buffer A, pH 6.9. Then 10 ml of buffer B, pH 8.5, was applied, followed by 10 ml of buffer B, pH 8.5, containing 1 m NaCl. 1-ml fractions were collected. Peptides isolated from proteolytic digests by HPLC as described above were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 492 Procise protein sequencer. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was done with a Vestec Voyager Elite Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer using an acceleration potential of 20 kV. The instrument was calibrated with insulin as an external calibration standard. 2 μg (∼40 pmol) of full-length selenoprotein P, prepared as peak 2 on a heparin HiTrap column (12Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was dissolved in 20 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Modified trypsin (0.04 μg) was added to give an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:50, and then the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. 1 μl of the digested mixture was analyzed using mass spectrometry. 2 μg (∼40 pmol) of full-length selenoprotein P was dissolved as above, and DEPC was added to it at a concentration of 6.9 mm. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then dialyzed against water for 6 h. It was then dried using a SpeedVac and redissolved in 20 μl of 100 mmammonium bicarbonate. Digestion and mass spectrometric analysis was performed as described for the unmodified selenoprotein P. In order to measure the structural integrity of the DEPC-modified protein, tryptophan emission spectra were taken of the modified and native proteins. Excitation was done at 295 nm, and the tryptophan emission was recorded between 300 and 420 nm. Spectra were recorded in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at a protein concentration of 25 μg/ml for both native and DEPC-modified selenoprotein P. Heparin binding by proteins is mediated by basic amino acids arranged to form a heparin-binding site. In order to determine which basic amino acids are present in the heparin-binding site(s) of selenoprotein P, the75Se-labeled protein was treated with reagents that selectively modify basic residues. Then the protein was passed over a heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer of pH 7.0. It was reasoned that modification of residues in the binding site would interfere with heparin binding of the protein. The amount of selenoprotein P bound to the column was determined by subtracting the amount of 75Se that passed through the column from the amount of 75Se applied to the column. Selenoprotein P was modified with DEPC, TNBS, and HPG in separate experiments. DEPC binds to unprotonated histidine residues, but it can also modify tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine residues (18Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). TNBS modifies primary amino groups in proteins, especially lysine residues. HPG is highly specific for modifying arginine residues (19Yamasaki R.B. Vega A. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results in Table I show that DEPC treatment of selenoprotein P abolished its heparin-binding property at pH 7.0. TNBS treatment blocked most heparin binding. However, modification of selenoprotein P by HPG had only a small effect on the affinity of the protein for heparin. These results implicate histidine and lysine residues in the binding of selenoprotein P to heparin.Table IBinding of chemically modified selenoprotein P to a heparin-agarose columnSelenoprotein P treatment75Se bound to column%None97DEPC3TNBS31HPG86Selenoprotein P was modified with DEPC, TNBS, and HPG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The modified protein was then passed over a heparin-agarose column, and the column was washed with pH 7.0 buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Selenoprotein P was modified with DEPC, TNBS, and HPG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The modified protein was then passed over a heparin-agarose column, and the column was washed with pH 7.0 buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The modification of histidine and tyrosine residues by DEPC can be followed spectrophotometrically. When histidine becomes carbethoxylated, there is a corresponding increase in absorbance at 240 nm (14Ovadi J. Keleti T. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1969; 4: 365-378PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of tyrosine side chains produces a decrease in absorbance at 278 nm (20Burstein Y. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In order to assess histidine and tyrosine modification, purified selenoprotein P was treated with DEPC, and UV spectra were recorded. A progressive increase in absorbance at 240 nm occurred with time, but no decrease took place at 278 nm (spectra not shown). Therefore, modification of histidine occurs, but no evidence was found for modification of tyrosine side chains. When selenoprotein P was modified with DEPC, histidine binding reached saturation in about 2 min at pH 7.0 (Fig.1). When selenoprotein P was modified in the presence of heparin, the increase in absorbance at 240 nm was not as great as seen with the unliganded protein (Fig. 1). This indicates that the presence of heparin prevents DEPC from modifying some of the histidine residues, implicating histidine in the heparin binding. DEPC reacts with unprotonated histidine residues. In order to approximate the pKa of the modifiable histidine residues, the modification of selenoprotein P by DEPC was carried out at varying pH values. The modification of selenoprotein P in sodium phosphate buffer with pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 is shown in Fig. 2. A marked increase in reaction rate occurred when the pH reached 6.8. The data from Fig. 2 indicate that the pKa values of the modified histidine residues are in the range of 6.4–6.8. Peptides that become modified by DEPC treatment of the native protein are predicted to be solvent-exposed and thus might be involved in binding of selenoprotein P to heparin. To determine which peptides of the native protein can be labeled by DEPC, [14C]DEPC was employed. After labeling, the purified selenoprotein P sample was dialyzed to remove excess [14C]DEPC. Then it was digested with chymotrypsin. Peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (chromatogram not shown). Peaks that contained 14C were submitted for amino acid sequence analysis. The peptides identified are shown in TableII. Two of them are KHAHL and KKQVSDHIAVY, which correspond to residues 80–84 and 85–95, respectively. Although it has been reported that loss of label is usually observed during the Edman degradation procedure (21Ko Y.-H. Vanni P. Munske G.R. McFadden B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7451-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Lemaire and colleagues (22Lemaire M. Schmitter J.-M. Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Gadal P. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27291-27296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed an additional peak that did not correspond to any standard PTH-derivative when sequencing a peptide containing a single histidine residue that had been labeled with [14C]DEPC. Such a peak appeared along with a PTH-derivatized histidine residue during its turn in the Edman cycle. Similarly, we were able to identify a secondary peak with a retention time slightly less than PTH-proline that was always associated with DEPC-labeled histidine. A potential interpretation of this result is that some of the carbethoxylated histidine residues survived the sequence analysis and appeared as a new peak in the sequencing chromatogram. These sequencing results (not shown) indicate that His-81, His-83, and His-91 become carbethoxylated upon treatment of the protein with DEPC (Table II).Table IIPeptides Modified with [14C]DEPCResidue numbersSequence 2-aResidues shown in boldface type were modified by DEPC.85–95KKQVSDHIAVY80–84KHAHL106–116TLLNGNKDDFL256–262SLAQRKL2-a Residues shown in boldface type were modified by DEPC. Open table in a new tab We also found evidence for lysine modification by DEPC. Again, the sequence analysis provided the evidence. The PTH-derivatized lysine residues in the peptides in Table II did not elute in the position for PTH-lysine but were shifted so that the retention of the modified lysine was slightly greater than that of PTH-valine. A previous study that used DEPC to modify chick liver glutathioneS-transferase demonstrated that DEPC modified lysine residues and that the N-carbethoxylated PTH-lysine eluted in a similar position to that reported here (23Chang L.-H. Tam M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, Lys-80, Lys-85, Lys-86, Lys-112, and Lys-261 became modified with DEPC based on the sequencing chromatograms (not shown). A second approach that used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for detecting DEPC-labeled peptides was employed. It has been reported that peptides containing carbethoxylated histidine residues can be detected by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (24Glocker M.O. Kalkum M. Yamamoto R. Schreurs J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14625-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Kalkum M. Pryzbylski M. Glocker M.O.

Fig. 3 A shows the mass spectrum of a total tryptic digest of the native full-length isoform of selenoprotein P. 12 peaks with the predicted masses of tryptic peptides could be identified in the spectrum. After treatment with DEPC and subsequent digestion, shifts of 72 mass units, corresponding to the addition of a C(O)OCH2CH3 group to an imidazole nitrogen atom or to an ε-amino group, were detected in eight peptides (Fig. 3 B and Table III).Table IIIPeptides labeled with DEPC and detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometryPeak3-aLetters indicate peaks labeled with corresponding letters in Fig. 3.ResiduesPeptide sequenceUnmodified massModified massNo. of residues modifiedm/zobs 3-bm/zobs, the observed mass to charge ratio.m/zcalc3-cm/zcalc, the calculated mass to charge ratio.m/zobs3-dThe number of modifications observed for the most abundant ion is 1.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 presents the amino acid sequence of selenoprotein P as derived from its cDNA (3Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thesolid lines under thesequence coincide with the peptides identified by mass spectrometry of the tryptic digest (Fig. 3 A). Thebroken lines with arrowheads above the sequence indicate the peptides that were detected to be shifted in mass by DEPC treatment of the protein (Fig. 3 B). Residues in boldface typeindicate the DEPC-modified peptides identified by sequencing (TableII). These results demonstrate that at least five stretches of the selenoprotein P sequence are accessible to modification by DEPC in the native protein. These stretches are residues 81–120, 178–193, 233–238, 256–262, and 292–297. These results do not indicate that no other parts of the molecule interact with heparin. The largest peptide detected (residues 190–232 in Fig. 3 A, HGHEHLGSSKPSENQQPGALDVETSLPPSGLHHHHHHHK) represents the sequence between the second and third stretches identified as potential heparin-binding sites. Because of its richness in histidines, this peptide might be expected to bind to heparin. After DEPC modification of the protein, this peptide could not be detected in the trypsin digest (no peak in Fig. 3 B). Peptides on either side of it were detected, so it must have been present in the digest. This result implies that the peptide had been modified by DEPC. It seems likely that the modification impaired the ability of the peptide to be ionized and therefore detected. Thus, this stretch of the sequence would appear to be a candidate for a heparin-binding site along with the adjacent histidine-rich sequences. In order to determin"

The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has emerged as a novel vertebrate model system that is amenable to mutagenesis and transgenesis. High fecundity, rapid oviparous development, and a translucent embryo make zebrafish a prolific experimental model (1Streisinger G. Walker C. Dower N. Knauber D. Singer F. Nature.. 1981; 291: 293-296Google Scholar). Furthermore, the zebrafish eye possesses distinct advantages for studying the development, function, and inherited diseases of the retina.

Berson E.L. Drrja T.P. Neuron.. 1992; 9: 815-830Google Scholar). However, none of these models combines the vertebrate eye with features of amenability to mutagenesis screens and transgenesis, as found in zebrafish. The developmental expression of zebrafish rod opsin initiates in two phases. It is expressed initially in a ventral-nasal patch of cells, and subsequently rod opsin-expressing cells arise in a scattered pattern throughout the remainder of the retina (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar, 21Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. J. Comp. Neurol... 1996; 371: 222-234Google Scholar). Furthermore, rod photoreceptors are added to the fish retina throughout life from two retinal sources: stem cells in the circumferential germinal zone and rod precursor cells, which are found in the outer nuclear layer (22Johns P.R. J. Comp. Neurol... 1977; 176: 343-358Google Scholar, 23Johns P.R. Fernald R.D. Nature.. 1981; 293: 141-142Google Scholar, 24Johns P.R. J. Neurosci... 1982; 2: 178-198Google Scholar).To develop tools for transgene expression in the zebrafish retina, we cloned the rod opsin gene. Characterization of the gene revealed that it lacks introns and contains conserved cis-regulatory sequences. We identified a 1.2-kbp promoter fragment that directs enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression specifically to rods. Furthermore, this transgene was integrated stably into the germline and transmitted to the subsequent generation. The expression of transgenes in zebrafish photoreceptors will enhance our ability to investigate visual gene function, gene regulation, and gene therapy.DISCUSSIONThe advent of zebrafish as a prolific model system for vertebrate genetics directed us to isolate and characterize the zebrafish rod opsin gene. As previously reported for other teleosts, the zebrafish gene lacks introns, contrasting with the typical gene structure of five exons and four introns found in nearly all other vertebrate opsin genes (42Fitzgibbon J. Hope A. Slobodyanyuk S.J. Bellingham J. Bowmaker J.K. Hunt D.M. Gene ( Amst. ).. 1995; 164: 273-277Google Scholar). Our localization of the transcription start site predicts a 1,660-bp nonpolyadenylated mRNA, which is consistent with the 1.9-kilobase polyadenylated message identified by Northern blot. In zebrafish, genome duplication has resulted in multiple alleles of some zebrafish genes (43Detrich H.W. Westerfield M. Zon L.I. The Zebrafish:Genetics and Genomics.Academic Press. 1999; Google Scholar). Occasionally, this creates distinct regulatory profiles for the alleles that additively account for the expression pattern of the gene (43Detrich H.W. Westerfield M. Zon L.I. The Zebrafish:Genetics and Genomics.Academic Press. 1999; Google Scholar). Also, gene duplication can mask recessive and dominant mutations generated in mutagenesis screens. For zebrafish rod opsin, our Southern data are consistent with a single-copy gene or copies that are highly conserved.We identified evolutionary conserved sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the rod opsin gene that may control rod opsin expression in zebrafish. The conserved cis-elements (glass,NRE,Ret-1/PCE-1, andRet-4) include sites for transcription factors (Crx, Erx, Glass,Mash-1, Nrl, and Rx) that regulate retina/photoreceptor/rod-specific expression and that segregate with visual defects (32Moses K.

Nature.. 1997; 387: 603-607Google Scholar). Rod opsin expression is regulated in a combinatorial fashion that depends on the synergistic activities of several transcription factors (34Kumar R. Chen S. Scheurer D. Wang Q. Duh E. Sung C. Rehemtulla A. Swaroop A. Adler R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 29612-29618Google Scholar, 39Kimura A. Singh D. Wawrousek E.F. Kikuchi M. Nakamura M. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 1152-1160Google Scholar). The presence of these regulatory elements in the ZOP-EGFP transgene likely helped to ensure its robust level of rod-specific expression. Although rod opsin gene expression may be regulated in a complex fashion, its promoter is excellent for expressing transgenes in the rod photoreceptors. Rod opsin promoters have successfully directed gene expression to rod photoreceptors in both mouse and Xenopus(48Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett... 1998; 423: 117-121Google Scholar, 49Lem J. Applebury M.L. Falk J.D. Flannery J.G. Simon M.I. Neuron.. 1991; 6: 201-210Google Scholar, 50Woodford B. Chen J. Simon M. Exp.

Also, the promoter in its native state drives a high level of expression during the terminal differentiation of rod cells and maintains that expression level through the life of the cell.In this study, we identified a 1.2-kbp zebrafish promoter that directs EGFP expression to rod photoreceptors. The expression pattern of the transgene appears to recapitulate the tissue-specific and developmental progression of the zebrafish rod opsin gene (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar, 21Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. J. Comp. Neurol... 1996; 371: 222-234Google Scholar, 52Robinson J. Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. Visual Neurosci... 1995; 12: 895-906Google Scholar). At 3 dpf, EGFP-positive cells are clustered in the ventral-nasal retina and begin to appear singly in other retinal regions at 6–7 dpf (data not shown). However, a more critical analysis at the cellular level reveals two subtle divergences from endogenous rod opsin expression. First, the temporal expression of ZOP-EGFP is delayed slightly relative to rod opsin. Rhodopsin expression is observed first in the ventral retina, nasal to the choroid fissure. Although differentiating rods accumulate rapidly and to a high density in this ventral patch, rods are added at a slower rate and in a random, isolated fashion in other retinal regions (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar). In contrast, the EGFP expression pattern at 4 dpf appears like the pattern of rhodopsin expression seen in developing fish at 55–60 h postfertilization (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar). Thus, rods appear to differentiate and express rhodopsin prior to expressing EGFP. This result may suggest that an additional factor necessary for the initiation of rod opsin expression during early differentiation acts beyond our 1.2-kbp cloned promoter fragment. Second, in adults, not all rod photoreceptors express EGFP, and the expression may occur in a dorsal-ventral gradient. A gradient of transgene expression was reported previously with a bovine rod opsin promoter directing transgene expression in mice (51Zack D.J. Bennet J. Wang X. Davenport C. Klaungerg B. Gearheart J. Nathans J. Neuron.. 1991; 6: 187-199Google Scholar). These temporal and spatial divergences from rhodopsin expression may be because of restricted expression of the transgene to a subpopulation of rods such as the rod precursor cells, position effects related to the integration site of the transgene, or perhaps cytotoxicity by the EGFP (53Liu H.S. Jan M.S. Chou C.K. Chen P.H. Ke N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 260: 712-717Google Scholar). Further examination of the transgenic retinas may shed light on native regulation of rod opsin gene expression. Although the expression of EGFP is delayed, the persistent rod-specific expression makes this a useful promoter for expressing transgenes in rod cells during both development and adulthood.EGFP was transiently expressed in ≈6% of injected embryos, consistent with percentages previously described (13Higashijima S. Okamoto H. Ueno N. Hotta Y. Eguchi G. Dev. Biol... 1997; 192: 289-299Google Scholar, 14Long Q. Meng A. Wang H. Jessen J.R. Farrell M.J. Lin S. Development.. 1997; 124: 4105-4111Google Scholar). The frequency of injected embryos exhibiting germline transmission was 0.25–1.75%. However, the frequency of transmission may have been underestimated because of gene silencing and technical difficulties in detection of EGFP in the eye. In addition to screening for transgene expression by fluorescence microscopy, adult fish were screened secondarily for stable transgene integration by PCR amplification of fin genomic DNA. Adults that typed positive were outcrossed, and their progeny were screened by fluorescence microscopy to verify transmission of the transgene in the germline. As the fish age, microscopic observations of the retina become obscured by the envelope of melanophores and iridiphores around the eyes. Treatment of fish with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea inhibits the synthesis of melanin, thus permitting observation of EGFP through the translucent eye at 3 dpf (the onset of rhodopsin expression). However, the 1-phenyl-2-thiourea does not inhibit the production of the gold- or silver-reflecting components of the iridiphores so that at 6–8 dpf, EGFP fluorescence is often observed only as it exits through the lens. Thus, proper orientation of the fish, as previously reported for Xenopus (54Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1999; 40: 3276-3280Google Scholar), is critical to ensure the accurate detection of EGFP expression.The identification of a functional zebrafish rod opsin promoter will provide several significant applications. The promoter will be used to drive the expression of putative dominantly active transgenes to generate models of human retinal diseases. Also, as candidate genes are identified for zebrafish retinal mutants, the expression of wild-type genes in the mutant will be a powerful method to confirm gene identification. This type of “gene rescue” has been widely exploited in Drosophila. In addition, transgenic lines that express markers such as EGFP will be useful tools in mutagenic screens, in which subtle phenotypes may be identified more easily by the loss of a readily observable marker like the EGFP. Because thecis-elements in rod opsin promoters are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, transgenic zebrafish may prove useful in characterizing the developmental regulation of rod opsin and other photoreceptor genes. Transgenic zebrafish also may prove useful in elucidating the current controversy over the nature of circadian photoreception. The controversy stems from whether the circadian photoresponse is initiated in the eye, pineal, or other tissues and whether the photoreceptor is opsin-based, a cryptochrome, or an unknown photoreceptor (55Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2000; 69: 31-67Google Scholar, 56Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Strahle U. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Neurosci... 1998; 1: 701-707Google Scholar). Apparent system redundancy and species differences complicate the issue (57Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells.. 2000; 5: 725-738Google Scholar, 58Selby C.P. Thompson C. Schmitz T.M. Van Gelder R.N. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 14697-14702Google Scholar). In zebrafish, six opsin genes expressed in four retinal photoreceptor classes and six cryptochrome genes expressed in the body, brain, and eye have been characterized (26Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci... 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar, 57Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells.. 2000; 5: 725-738Google Scholar). Mutagenesis screens to identify circadian mutants and the ablation of specific retinal cell populations by targeted expression of toxic genes may prove useful to reveal genes that function in circadian photoreception. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has emerged as a novel vertebrate model system that is amenable to mutagenesis and transgenesis. High fecundity, rapid oviparous development, and a translucent embryo make zebrafish a prolific experimental model (1Streisinger G. Walker C. Dower N. Knauber D. Singer F. Nature.. 1981; 291: 293-296Google Scholar). Furthermore, the zebrafish eye possesses distinct advantages for studying the development, function, and inherited diseases of the retina. Eye ontogenesis proceeds rapidly, completing the laminae of the adult retina by 3 days postfertilization (dpf1; Ref. 2Branchek T. Bremiller R. J. Comp. Neurol... 1984; 224: 107-115Google Scholar). The zebrafish eye is relatively large and accessible, and the position and morphology of the rod and cone classes are readily distinguishable (3Raymond P. Barthel L. Rounsifer M. Sullivan S. Knight J. Neuron.. 1993; 10: 1161-1174Google Scholar). Finally, the integrity of visual system structure and function can be evaluated by morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological methods (4Brockerhoff S.E. Hurley J.B. Niemi G.A. Dowling J.E. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 4236-4242Google Scholar, 5Malicki J. Neuhauss S.C.F. Schier A.F. Solnica-Krezel L. Stemple D.L. Stainier D.Y.R. Abdelilah S. Zwartkruis F. Rangini Z. Driever W.

Rhodopsin, comprising the rod opsin protein bound to 11-cis-retinaldehyde, constitutes the photosensitive visual pigment of vertebrate rod photoreceptors (15Nathans J. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 4923-4931Google Scholar). Rhodopsin is concentrated in the outer segments of the rod photoreceptor cells, which mediate vision in dim light. Mutations in the human rod opsin gene (RHO) can result in retinitis pigmentosa, a slow retinal degeneration resulting in blindness (16Gal A. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Janecke A.R. Zrenner E. Osborne N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal and Eye Research.Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc. 1997; 16: 51-79Google Scholar).

The expression pattern of the transgene appears to recapitulate the tissue-specific and developmental progression of the zebrafish rod opsin gene (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar, 21Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. J. Comp. Neurol... 1996; 371: 222-234Google Scholar, 52Robinson J. Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. Visual Neurosci... 1995; 12: 895-906Google Scholar). At 3 dpf, EGFP-positive cells are clustered in the ventral-nasal retina and begin to appear singly in other retinal regions at 6–7 dpf (data not shown). However, a more critical analysis at the cellular level reveals two subtle divergences from endogenous rod opsin expression. First, the temporal expression of ZOP-EGFP is delayed slightly relative to rod opsin. Rhodopsin expression is observed first in the ventral retina, nasal to the choroid fissure. Although differentiating rods accumulate rapidly and to a high density in this ventral patch, rods are added at a slower rate and in a random, isolated fashion in other retinal regions (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar). In contrast, the EGFP expression pattern at 4 dpf appears like the pattern of rhodopsin expression seen in developing fish at 55–60 h postfertilization (20Raymond P.A. Barthel L.K. Curran G.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1995; 359: 537-550Google Scholar). Thus, rods appear to differentiate and express rhodopsin prior to expressing EGFP. This result may suggest that an additional factor necessary for the initiation of rod opsin expression during early differentiation acts beyond our 1.2-kbp cloned promoter fragment. Second, in adults, not all rod photoreceptors express EGFP, and the expression may occur in a dorsal-ventral gradient. A gradient of transgene expression was reported previously with a bovine rod opsin promoter directing transgene expression in mice (51Zack D.J. Bennet J. Wang X. Davenport C. Klaungerg B. Gearheart J. Nathans J. Neuron.. 1991; 6: 187-199Google Scholar). These temporal and spatial divergences from rhodopsin expression may be because of restricted expression of the transgene to a subpopulation of rods such as the rod precursor cells, position effects related to the integration site of the transgene, or perhaps cytotoxicity by the EGFP (53Liu H.S. Jan M.S. Chou C.K. Chen P.H. Ke N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 260: 712-717Google Scholar). Further examination of the transgenic retinas may shed light on native regulation of rod opsin gene expression. Although the expression of EGFP is delayed, the persistent rod-specific expression makes this a useful promoter for expressing transgenes in rod cells during both development and adulthood.EGFP was transiently expressed in ≈6% of injected embryos, consistent with percentages previously described (13Higashijima S. Okamoto H. Ueno N. Hotta Y. Eguchi G. Dev. Biol... 1997; 192: 289-299Google Scholar, 14Long Q. Meng A. Wang H. Jessen J.R. Farrell M.J. Lin S. Development.. 1997; 124: 4105-4111Google Scholar). The frequency of injected embryos exhibiting germline transmission was 0.25–1.75%. However, the frequency of transmission may have been underestimated because of gene silencing and technical difficulties in detection of EGFP in the eye. In addition to screening for transgene expression by fluorescence microscopy, adult fish were screened secondarily for stable transgene integration by PCR amplification of fin genomic DNA. Adults that typed positive were outcrossed, and their progeny were screened by fluorescence microscopy to verify transmission of the transgene in the germline. As the fish age, microscopic observations of the retina become obscured by the envelope of melanophores and iridiphores around the eyes. Treatment of fish with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea inhibits the synthesis of melanin, thus permitting observation of EGFP through the translucent eye at 3 dpf (the onset of rhodopsin expression). However, the 1-phenyl-2-thiourea does not inhibit the production of the gold- or silver-reflecting components of the iridiphores so that at 6–8 dpf, EGFP fluorescence is often observed only as it exits through the lens. Thus, proper orientation of the fish, as previously reported for Xenopus (54Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Knox B.E. Papermaster D.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1999; 40: 3276-3280Google Scholar), is critical to ensure the accurate detection of EGFP expression.The identification of a functional zebrafish rod opsin promoter will provide several significant applications. The promoter will be used to drive the expression of putative dominantly active transgenes to generate models of human retinal diseases. Also, as candidate genes are identified for zebrafish retinal mutants, the expression of wild-type genes in the mutant will be a powerful method to confirm gene identification. This type of “gene rescue” has been widely exploited in Drosophila. In addition, transgenic lines that express markers such as EGFP will be useful tools in mutagenic screens, in which subtle phenotypes may be identified more easily by the loss of a readily observable marker like the EGFP. Because thecis-elements in rod opsin promoters are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, transgenic zebrafish may prove useful in characterizing the developmental regulation of rod opsin and other photoreceptor genes. Transgenic zebrafish also may prove useful in elucidating the current controversy over the nature of circadian photoreception. The controversy stems from whether the circadian photoresponse is initiated in the eye, pineal, or other tissues and whether the photoreceptor is opsin-based, a cryptochrome, or an unknown photoreceptor (55Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2000; 69: 31-67Google Scholar, 56Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Strahle U. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Neurosci... 1998; 1: 701-707Google Scholar). Apparent system redundancy and species differences complicate the issue (57Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells.. 2000; 5: 725-738Google Scholar, 58Selby C.P. Thompson C. Schmitz T.M. Van Gelder R.N. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 14697-14702Google Scholar). In zebrafish, six opsin genes expressed in four retinal photoreceptor classes and six cryptochrome genes expressed in the body, brain, and eye have been characterized (26Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Visual Neurosci... 1999; 16: 571-585Google Scholar, 57Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells.. 2000; 5: 725-738Google Scholar). Mutagenesis screens to identify circadian mutants and the ablation of specific retinal cell populations by targeted expression of toxic genes may prove useful to reveal genes that function in circadian photoreception. The advent of zebrafish as a prolific model system for vertebrate genetics directed us to isolate and characterize the zebrafish rod opsin gene. As previously reported for other teleosts, the zebrafish gene lacks introns, contrasting with the typical gene structure of five exons and four introns found in nearly all other vertebrate opsin genes (42Fitzgibbon J. Hope A. Slobodyanyuk S.J. Bellingham J. Bowmaker J.K. Hunt D.M. Gene ( Amst. ).. 1995; 164: 273-277Google Scholar). Our localization of the transcription start site predicts a 1,660-bp nonpolyadenylated mRNA, which is consistent with the 1.9-kilobase polyadenylated message identified by Northern blot. In zebrafish, genome duplication has resulted in multiple alleles of some zebrafish genes (43Detrich H.W. Westerfield M. Zon L.I. The Zebrafish:Genetics and Genomics.Academic Press. 1999; Google Scholar). Occasionally, this creates distinct regulatory profiles for the alleles that additively account for the expression pattern of the gene (43Detrich H.W. Westerfield M. Zon L.I. The Zebrafish:Genetics and Genomics.Academic Press. 1999; Google Scholar). Also, gene duplication can mask recessive and dominant mutations generated in mutagenesis screens. For zebrafish rod opsin, our Southern data are consistent with a single-copy gene or copies that are highly conserved. We identified evolutionary conserved sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the rod opsin gene that may control rod opsin expression in zebrafish. The conserved cis-elements (glass,NRE,Ret-1/PCE-1, andRet-4) include sites for transcription factors (Crx, Erx, Glass,Mash-1, Nrl, and Rx) that regulate retina/photoreceptor/rod-specific expression and that segregate with visual defects (32Moses K.

Nature.. 1997; 387: 603-607Google Scholar). Rod opsin expression is regulated in a combinatorial fashion that depends on the synergistic activities of several transcription factors (34Kumar R. Chen S. Scheurer D. Wang Q. Duh E. Sung C. Rehemtulla A. Swaroop A. Adler R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 29612-29618Google Scholar, 39Kimura A. Singh D. Wawrousek E.F. Kikuchi M. Nakamura M. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 1152-1160Google Scholar). The presence of these regulatory elements in the ZOP-EGFP transgene likely helped to ensure its robust level of rod-specific expression. Although rod opsin gene expression may be regulated in a complex fashion, its promoter is excellent for expressing transgenes in the rod photoreceptors. Rod opsin promoters have successfully directed gene expression to rod photoreceptors in both mouse and Xenopus(48Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett... 1998; 423: 117-121Google Scholar, 49Lem J. Applebury M.L. Falk J.D. Flannery J.G. Simon M.I. Neuron.. 1991; 6: 201-210Google Scholar, 50Woodford B. Chen J. Simon M. Exp.

This allows phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase to bind to Gab1. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that Gab1 acts as an amplifier of PI3K- and SHP2-dependent signaling in B lymphocytes. By overexpressing Gab1 in the WEHI-231 B cell line, we found that Gab1 can potentiate BCR-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a PI3K-dependent response. Gab1 expression also increased BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 as well as the binding of Grb2 to SHP2. We show that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Gab1 is required for BCR-induced phosphorylation of Gab1 and for Gab1 participation in BCR signaling. Moreover, using confocal microscopy, we show that BCR ligation can induce the translocation of Gab1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and that this requires the Gab1 PH domain as well as PI3K activity. These findings are consistent with a model in which the binding of the Gab1 PH domain to PI3K-derived lipids brings Gab1 to the plasma membrane, where it can be tyrosine-phosphorylated and then act as an amplifier of BCR signaling.

The initiation of many BCR signaling pathways involves the recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling enzymes to the plasma membrane, where they can act on membrane-associated substrates. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cγ must be recruited to the plasma membrane to act on their substrate, the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). B cell antigen receptor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate mammalian SOS pleckstrin homology enhanced green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase There are multiple ways in which receptors can recruit cytoplasmic signaling enzymes to the plasma membrane. One important mechanism involves the binding of SH2 domains in signaling proteins to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences on membrane-associated docking/scaffolding proteins. Since the SH2 domains of different proteins bind different phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (6Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 7Songyang Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), the set of signaling enzymes a receptor recruits depends on the spectrum of phosphotyrosine-containing sequences it generates on membrane-associated proteins. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of its Ig-α and Ig-β subunits allows the BCR to recruit the Syk tyrosine kinase (8Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Justement L.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 2-51Google Scholar). However, the absence of other phosphotyrosine-containing sequences in Ig-α and Ig-β prevents the direct recruitment of other SH2 domain-containing proteins to the BCR. The BCR overcomes this problem by using its associated tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate appropriate tyrosine residues on other membrane-associated docking proteins (e.g. CD19). In addition, adaptor proteins (e.g. BLNK and Shc) that are tyrosine-phosphorylated after BCR signaling can couple SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins with membrane-associated docking proteins (10Kelly M.E. Chan A.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Myung P.S. Boerthe N.J. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions are essential for the BCR to recruit PI3K, phospholipase Cγ, mSOS (son of sevenless homolog), and other signaling enzymes to the plasma membrane. Signaling enzymes can also be recruited to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (12Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). PH domains bind membrane phospholipids, in particular the PI3K products phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. PH domain-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane is important for the BCR to activate the Akt and Btk kinases (13Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P.

Ladbury J.E. Saraste M. Structure. 1999; 7: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting their membrane localization, PIP3can also contribute to the activation of PH domain-containing signaling enzymes such as phospholipase Cγ, mSOS, and Vav (18Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 19Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Thus, PI3K-derived lipids play a role in the activation of many different BCR signaling pathways. The recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane, where its substrates are located, is therefore a key event in BCR signaling. The BCR uses multiple docking/scaffolding proteins to recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane. BCR engagement results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CD19, a transmembrane protein; and this creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of PI3K (20Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P. Fearon D.T. Science. 1993; 260: 986-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Cytosolic docking proteins that are recruited to the plasma membrane also contribute to the ability of the BCR to direct PI3K to the plasma membrane. Cbl, which uses its SH2-like domain to bind to phosphorylated Syk (21Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Lill N.L. Andoniu C.E. Miyake S. Clark E.A. Druker B. J. Biol.

The BCR also uses the Gab1 docking protein to recruit PI3K as well as other signaling enzymes to the plasma membrane (24Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M. Siu C. Wong A.J. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30630-30637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated after BCR ligation and that this allows the SH2 domains of PI3K, the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase, and the Shc adaptor protein to bind directly to Gab1 (24Ingham R.J.

Grb2 can then bind via its SH2 domain to the tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 and Shc that are bound to Gab1. Gab1 belongs to a family of docking/scaffolding proteins that includes the closely related Gab2 protein as well as insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 and the Drosophila DOS (daughter of sevenless) protein (25Gu H.H.

All of these proteins contain a PH domain, a cluster of binding sites for the PI3K SH2 domain, and one or more binding sites for the SH2 domain of SHP2. The presence of a PH domain in these docking proteins suggests that they are recruited to the plasma membrane when receptor signaling stimulates the production of PI3K-derived lipids. Once at the plasma membrane, these docking proteins can be tyrosine-phosphorylated, allowing them to recruit additional PI3K complexes as well as other signaling enzymes. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that Gab1 functions in this way as a PI3K-dependent amplifier of BCR signaling. We found that overexpressing Gab1 increased the ability of the BCR to signal via PI3K and SHP2. We also show that the BCR recruits Gab1 to the plasma membrane in a PI3K-dependent manner and that the PH domain of Gab1 is required for membrane recruitment of Gab1 and for its ability to amplify BCR signaling. Goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies were obtained from Bio-Can (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Anti-Gab1 antibodies and the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to SHP2, Grb2, and the p85 subunit of PI3K were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

The Gab1ΔPI3K protein has tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions at amino acids 448, 473, and 590 that eliminate the three YXXM sequences that the PI3K SH2 domains can bind to. The Gab1ΔSHP2 protein has a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 628 that eliminates the YXDL sequence that the SHP2 SH2 domains can bind to. A cDNA encoding a truncated form of Gab1 that includes amino acids 116–695 but lacks the N-terminal PH domain (Gab1ΔPH) has been described previously (32Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding wild-type Gab1, Gab1ΔPI3K, Gab1ΔSHP2, and Gab1ΔPH were excised from the pLTR2 vector using BamHI andNotI and subcloned into the pMX retroviral expression vector (33Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, as well as pMX with no insert, were transfected into the BOSC23 packaging cell line (34Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). The retroviral particles released into the culture supernatant were then used to infect WEHI-231 cells as described (35Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After retroviral infection, the WEHI-231 cells were cultured in the presence of 0.25 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days to select for infected cells. The resulting bulk populations of infected WEHI-231 cells were maintained in culture medium with 0.25 μg/ml puromycin. Expression of the various Gab1 proteins in these bulk populations was confirmed by immunoblotting. Previous analyses using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA cloned into pMX showed that >95% of the puromycin-resistant WEHI-231 cells obtained after retroviral infection express the transduced gene (35Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding wild-type Gab1 and Gab1ΔPH were subcloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH), as described previously (32Maroun C.R.

Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with 50 μg of the plasmid encoding either Gab1-EGFP or Gab1ΔPH-EGFP in addition to 20 μg of pWZLBlast (a gift from Dr. Steven Robbins, University of Calgary), a plasmid encoding resistance to blasticidin. After culturing the cells for 10–14 days in the presence of 2 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), individual colonies of blasticidin-resistant cells were isolated as described (28Richards J.D.

WEHI-231 cells were resuspended to 2.5 × 107/ml in modified HEPES-buffered saline (25 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.2, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 1 mg/ml glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol) and stimulated with goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Reactions were stopped by adding cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the cells. After washing, the cells were solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Prior to being stimulated, AtT20/BCR/Syk cells were washed with PBS and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in modified HEPES-buffered saline (see above) to further reduce signaling due to serum growth factors. The cells were washed again with PBS, and 10 ml of 37 °C modified HEPES-buffered saline was added to each dish. BCR signaling was initiated by adding goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, washing the cells twice with cold PBS, and then solubilizing the cells with Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunoprecipitations, extracts from 1–2 × 107 cells (0.5–1 mg of protein) were mixed with 1–2 μg of specific antibodies plus 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer before bound proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 0.1 mdithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (24Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M.

Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Akt activation was analyzed by immunoblotting total cell lysates (60 μg of protein) with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. The filters were then stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt antibodies. The relative levels of Akt phosphorylation were determined by densitometry using an Alpha Innotech gel documentation system (Canberra Packard, Mississauga). The cells were grown to near confluency on 10-mm poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After culturing overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.2% fetal calf serum, the cells were stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies as described above. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells twice with cold PBS. The coverslips were then prepared for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (36Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Images were collected using a Bio-Rad Radiance Plus confocal microscope and analyzed using NIH Image Version 1.62 software. We have previously shown that BCR ligation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and that this allows PI3K to bind via its SH2 domains to Gab1 (24Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M. Siu C. Wong A.J. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30630-30637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since Gab1·PI3K complexes are found in the membrane-enriched particulate fraction of the RAMOS human B cell line after BCR ligation (24Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M. Siu C. Wong A.J. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30630-30637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this led us to propose that Gab1 acts as a docking protein that recruits PI3K to the plasma membrane after BCR engagement. This would presumably result in increased production of PI3K-derived lipids that can activate downstream targets such as the Akt protein kinase. To test this idea that Gab1 functionally links the BCR to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we expressed Gab1 in the WEHI-231 murine B lymphoma cell line. WEHI-231 cells normally express the closely related Gab2 protein (Ref. 25Gu H.H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and data not shown), but express little or no Gab1 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that this transfected Gab1 protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated after BCR ligation in the WEHI-231 cells and that it associated with a number of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As in RAMOS cells (24Ingham R.J. Holgado-Madruga M. Siu C. Wong A.J. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30630-30637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with Gab1 after BCR stimulation in WEHI-231 cells is the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase (see Fig. 9 B), whereas the 46- and 52-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are two isoforms of the Shc adaptor protein (data not shown). Thus, the transfected Gab1 expressed in the WEHI-231 cells appears to function similarly to the endogenous Gab1 present in other B cell lines such as RAMOS.Figure 9Gab1 expression potentiates BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2; dependence on the PH domain of Gab1. Vector control cells and WEHI-231 cells expressing either wild-type (wt) Gab1 or a mutant form of Gab1 that lacks the PH domain (Gab1ΔPH) were incubated with or without anti-IgM antibodies for 2 min. A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (ippt) with anti-SHP2 antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody. The filters were then reprobed with anti-SHP2 antibodies to show that similar amounts of SHP2 had been precipitated. Immunoblotting total cell lysates with anti-Gab1 antibodies (lower panel) showed that the cells expressed similar amounts of wild-type Gab1 and Gab1ΔPH. One of two independent experiments that yielded similar results is shown. B, the binding of SHP2 to wild-type Gab1 and Gab1ΔPH was assessed by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with anti-Gab1 antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP2 antibodies. The filters were then reprobed with anti-Gab1 antibodies to show that similar amounts of wild-type Gab1 and Gab1ΔPH had been precipitated. Molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated to the left. One of four independent experiments that yielded similar results is shown. All of the experiments were performed on the same set of cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked whether expressing Gab1 in WEHI-231 cells could potentiate the ability of the BCR to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We used phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 as a readout since we had previously shown that this response is dependent on PI3K activity (37Gold M.R. Scheid M.P. Santos L. Dang-Lawson M. Roth R.A. Matsuuchi L. Duronio V. Krebs D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1894-1905PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that overexpressing Gab1 in WEHI-231 cells increased the ability of the BCR to stimulate Akt phosphorylation. Densitometric analysis showed that Gab1 expression increased anti-IgM antibody-stimulated Akt phosphorylation by ∼2-fold at all time points between 1 and 30 min. Thus, Gab1 expression increased the magnitude of BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation as opposed to merely changing the kinetics of this response. The ability of Gab1 to potentiate BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation depended on its ability to bind PI3K (Fig.3). This was shown by expressing in WEHI-231 cells a mutant form of Gab1 (Gab1ΔPI3K) in which all three potential binding sites for the PI3K SH2 domains had been ablated by tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations. Fig. 3 shows that Gab1ΔPI3K did not bind PI3K after BCR ligation and that its ability to potentiate BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation was much less than that of wild-type Gab1. Compared with WEHI-231 cells infected with retroviruses containing the empty pMX vector, Akt phosphorylation at 2 min after anti-IgM antibody addition was 97 ± 21% (n = 10) higher in cells expressing wild-type Gab1, but only 27 ± 16% (n = 3) higher in cells expressing Gab1ΔPI3K. Thus, the ability of Gab1 to bind PI3K allows it to link the BCR to PI3K-dependent signaling events such as Akt phosphorylation. PI3K must be recruited to the plasma membrane to convert PIP2 to PIP3 and to promote the activation of Akt. The ability of Gab1 to potentiate BCR-induced Akt activation presumably reflects the ability of Gab1 to recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane. This implies that Gab1 is localized at the plasma membrane in anti-IgM antibody-stimulated B cells and suggests that BCR signaling may recruit Gab1 to the plasma membrane. Two distinct mechanisms by which receptors can recruit Gab1 to the plasma membrane have been described (32Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). One involves the binding of PIP3 to the PH domain of Gab1, whereas the second is a PI3K-independent mechanism in which Gab1 binds either directly or via Grb2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane proteins. Since BCR engagement leads to the rapid production of PIP3 (39Gold M.R. Aebersold R.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that it is the binding of PIP3 to the PH domain of Gab1 that recruits Gab1 to the plasma membrane of B cells. This would presumably allow Gab1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated so that it could then amplify PI3K signaling by recruiting additional PI3K molecules to the plasma membrane. To test this model, we expressed in WEHI-231 cells a truncated form of Gab1 that lacks the PH domain (Gab1ΔPH). We found that the Gab1ΔPH protein was very poorly phosphorylated in response to BCR engagement and that, consequently, it bound other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to a much lesser extent than the wild-type Gab1 protein (Fig.4 A). In particular, the Gab1ΔPH protein did not bind significant amounts of PI3K after BCR ligation (Fig. 4 B), and this correlated with its inability to significantly increase BCR-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig.4 C). Anti-IgM antibody-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was only 11 ± 8% (n = 2) higher in the cells expressing Gab1ΔPH than in the vector control cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Gab1 uses its PH domain to come to the plasma membrane after BCR engagement and that this is required for Gab1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, to bind PI3K, and to contribute to Akt activation. The requirement that Gab1 have a PH domain to participate in BCR signaling is consistent with the idea that Gab1 is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to the production of PIP3 by PI3K. Since it is difficult to analyze the translocation of cytoplasmic proteins to the plasma membrane in B cells, we tested this hypothesis by expressing a Gab1-EGFP fusion protein in a derivative of the AtT20 endocrine cell line that had been transfected with DNAs encoding all four chains of the BCR as well as the Syk tyrosine kinase (28Richards J.D. Gold M.R. Hourihane S.L. DeFranco A.L. Matsuuchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6458-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that many aspects of BCR signaling, including PI3K-dependent Akt activation (28Richards J.D. Gold M.R. Hourihane S.L. DeFranco A.L. Matsuuchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6458-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Gold M.R. Scheid M.P. Santos L. Dang-Lawson M. Roth R.A. Matsuuchi L. Duronio V. Krebs D.L. J.

EGFP fusion proteins containing either full-length Gab1 (Gab1-EGFP) or Gab1 lacking its PH domain (Gab1ΔPH-EGFP) were expressed in the AtT20/BCR/Syk cells (Fig. 5 A). We then assessed whether these proteins behaved similarly to the wild-type Gab1 and truncated Gab1ΔPH proteins that were expressed in the WEHI-231 B cell line. When the BCR on the AtT20/BCR/Syk cells was cross-linked with anti-IgM antibodies, we found that the Gab1-EGFP protein became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 5 B). Reprobing these blots showed that these Gab1-associated proteins were SHP2 (Fig.5 B) and the p46 and p52 forms of Shc (data not shown). In contrast to the wild-type Gab1-EGFP fusion protein, the Gab1ΔPH-EGFP protein showed very littl"

Constitutive and regulated PAI-2 gene expression involves post-transcriptional events, and an AU-rich mRNA instability motif within the 3′-untranslated region of PAI-2 mRNA is required for this process (Maurer, F., Tierney, M., and Medcalf, R. L. (1999)Nucleic Acids Res. 27, 1664–1673). Here we show that instability determinants are present within various exons of the PAI-2 coding region, most notably within exon 4. Deletion of exon 4 from the full-length PAI-2 cDNA results in a doubling in the half-life of PAI-2 mRNA, whereas a 28-nucleotide region within exon 4 contains binding sites for cytoplasmic proteins. Inducible stabilization of PAI-2 mRNA in HT-1080 cells treated with phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor does not alter the binding of proteins to the exon 4 instability determinant, but resulted in a transient increase in the binding of factors to the AU-rich RNA instability element. Hence, PAI-2 mRNA stability is influenced by elements located within both the coding region and the 3′-untranslated region and that cytoplasmic mRNA binding factors may influence steady state and inducible PAI-2 mRNA expression. Finally a 10-nucleotide region flanking the exon 4 protein-binding site is homologous to instability elements within five other transcripts, suggesting that a common coding region determinant may exist.

The plasminogen activator system is an important proteolytic cascade that plays a role in the removal of blood clots from the circulation and the turnover of a variety of extracellular matrix proteins (2Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effector enzyme of this system is the powerful protease plasmin, generated from its inactive precursor plasminogen by the plasminogen activators, namely urokinase- or tissue type plasminogen activator (u-PA1and t-PA). These proteases are themselves regulated by the plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), PAI-1 and PAI-2. PAI-1 effectively inhibits both t-PA and u-PA; however, PAI-2 is widely considered to modulate u-PA activity in the extracellular compartments and plays a less important role in regulating t-PA. Although PAI-2 is found as a secreted glycosylated protein, a more abundant form exists within the cytosolic compartment (3Genton C. Kruithof E.K. Schleuning W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The predominant intracellular location of PAI-2 has fueled much speculation about additional functions for this inhibitor. Indeed, growing evidence has indicated a role for PAI-2 in the intracellular events associated with differentiation (4Jensen P.J. Wu Q. Janowitz P. Ando Y. Schechter N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), proliferation (5Hibino T. Matsuda Y. Takahashi T. Goetinck P.F. J. Invest.

Virol. 1999; 73: 7193-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding PAI-2 has generated particular interest, not only for its extracellular and presumed intracellular roles but also because of its impressive regulatory profile. PAI-2 gene transcription rates are markedly increased in response to the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (8Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R. Shaw A.

Med. 1988; 168: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and lipopolysaccaride (LPS) (11Schwartz B.S. Monroe M.C. Levin E.G. Blood. 1988; 71: 734-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)-responsive genes described. For the latter, this has been further confirmed by serial analysis of gene expression analysis of primary human monocytes, whereby PAI-2 mRNA levels were shown to be increased 105-fold by LPS (12Suzuki T.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), being the third most LPS-induced transcript produced in these cells. Notwithstanding the important contribution of transcriptional control of PAI-2 expression (13Dear A.E. Shen Y. Ruegg M. Medcalf R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Antalis T.M. Costelloe E. Muddiman J. Ogbourne S. Donnan K. Blood. 1996; 88: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of post-transcriptional regulation of the PAI-2 gene has recently been highlighted (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These investigations stemmed from earlier results whereby treatment of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with a combination of PMA and TNF produced a 50–100-fold increase in PAI-2 gene transcription but a 1500-fold increase in PAI-2 mRNA over a 24-h period (9Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12220-12226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy in the degree of mRNA production was suggestive of inducible stabilization of PAI-2 mRNA under these conditions. Subsequent studies have shown that the rate of PAI-2 mRNA decay can indeed be reduced by phorbol ester (15Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and dioxin (16Yang J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1990; 144: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Functional studies on the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA led to the identification of an AU-rich mRNA destabilizing determinant (15Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This element provides a binding site for a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins including HuR (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), an mRNA-stabilizing protein that can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (18Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 19Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Although the degree of PAI-2 mRNA instability is influenced by the AU-rich motif in the 3′-UTR, elements within the coding region and possibly the 5′-UTR are also likely to contribute to the control of PAI-2 mRNA stability since the PAI-2 transcripts lacking the 3′-UTR are still relatively unstable (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, functional mRNA stability determinants have been detected within the coding region of a growing list of mRNAs including the mRNAs of c-Myc (20Wisdom R. Lee W.

Here, we have analyzed exons within the PAI-2 coding region for functional mRNA instability elements. Our findings indicate that the control of PAI-2 mRNA stability is controlled bycis-elements located throughout the coding region, most notably within exon 4, whereas a 28-nt region within this exon provides a specific binding site for cytoplasmic factors. Hence PAI-2 mRNA decay is influenced by both coding region instability elements as well as the AU-rich instability element in the 3′-UTR. Of further interest is that the region immediately adjacent to the 5′ end of the exon 4-binding site bears homology to mRNA instability elements located within the coding region of five other mRNAs. This suggests that a common coding region instability motif may be involved in mRNA turnover. Mouse NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HI-FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin, in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For mRNA decay experiments, 4 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were plated onto 10-cm2 dishes and grown for 24 h in 10% HI-FCS DMEM, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline solution, serum-starved in 0.5% HI-FCS DMEM for 48 h prior to stimulation with 15% HI-FCS DMEM. Cells were then harvested at selected intervals up to 24 h (30Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Plasmid pfos-HGH (30Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Gregory Goodall (Hanson Center, Adelaide, Australia). This vector harbors the human growth hormone gene (HGH) placed under the control of the serum-responsive chicken c-fos promoter as well as the neomycin resistance gene (see Fig. 1, panel A). Plasmid pfos was generated by removing the HGH insert from pfos-HGH using the restriction enzymes HindIII and SacI (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Individual or groups of PAI-2 exons were amplified by PCR using the pJ7 PAI-2 cDNA (8Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R. Shaw A. Kruithof E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4564-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as a template. KpnI and SacI sites were engineered into the 5′ and 3′ sites of the PCR products, respectively, to facilitate the ligation into the c-fos HGH vector. The sizes of the exons are indicated in Fig. 1, panel A.

Lowercase extensions represent nucleotides added to facilitate improved digestion with restriction enzymes. DNA templates for the in vitro transcription of labeled RNAs for the RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSAs, see below) were prepared. The full-length exon 4 was amplified by PCR from the pJ7 PAI-2 cDNA template and inserted into the KpnI andHindIII sites of pBluescript (Stratagene). The sequence of the exon 4 sense primer used for this is provided in Table I. The antisense exon 4 primer is also indicated in Table I but hadHindIII restriction site added at the 5′ end, rather thanSacI. The generation of the shorter RNA probes containing the overlapping exon 4 sequences was prepared by annealing 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides encompassing the sense and antisense sequences of exon 4, regions 4A, 4B, and 4C, and then directly inserted into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The orientation of these inserts was assessed by DNA sequencing.

The plasmid containing the full-length PAI-2 cDNA driven by the fos promoter (pfos-PAI-2) has been described previously (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Removal of exon 4 from the PAI-2 cDNA using pfos-PAI-2 as a template was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer DNA kit (CLONTECH). The mutagenic primer designed to delete exon 4 had the following sequence: PAI-2 exon 4 deletion primer, 5′-CCTGATGCGATTTTGCAGGAATATATTCGACTCTGTC-3′. The selection primer used to prepare pfos-PAI-2 exon 4 mutant was designed to replace theBamHI site in pfos-PAI-2 with an EcoRI site (underlined) as follows: selection primer (pfos-HGH), 5′-CATGTCTGAATTCCGTCGACCTCG-3′. The pfos vector harboring the PAI-2 mutant cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Stable transfection of plasmids into NIH3T3 cells was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (31Sambrook J. Fritsch C.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.65Google Scholar) using 5 μg of DNA. Transfected clones were selected in medium supplemented with 600 μg/μl of G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and resistant colonies (>200) were pooled by trypsinization. Total RNA was purified from selected cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 μg of RNA were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels containing 20% formaldehyde and subsequently transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were hybridized with the 32P-labeled DNA probes as described (33Medcalf R.L. Richards R.I. Crawford R.J. Hamilton J.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membranes were processed by standard techniques and exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. Signals were quantitated using a Fujix BAS 1000 PhosphorImager or by densitometry using a Linotype-Hell scanner. The labeled inserts used for hybridization were obtained as follows: the 1.8-kilobase pair EcoRI cDNA fragment of plasmid pJ7 containing the full-length PAI-2 cDNA (8Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R. Shaw A. Kruithof E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4564-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); the various labeled PAI-2 exons were prepared by PCR amplifying using plasmid pJ7 as a template; the 679-bp BamHI/HindIII HGH cDNA fragment of pfos-HGH containing the human growth hormone cDNA (30Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar); the 1.2-kilobase pair PstI cDNA fragment of mouse β-actin (34Minty A.J. Alonso S. Guenet J.L. Buckingham M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 77-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); the 972-bp BamHI/HindIII cDNA fragment of neomycin from pCI-neo. The pBluescript DNA templates used to transcribe the PAI-2 exon 4 RNA probes were first linearized withEcoRI. For in vitro transcription, 500 ng of template was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (DuPont), 10 μm UTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 20 units RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 50 units of T3 RNA polymerase. Templates harboring the 29-nt AU-rich element in the 3′-UTR were linearized with XbaI, and labeled RNA was transcribedin vitro as described above, but using 50 units of T7 polymerase. RNA probes were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gel, eluted in 500 mmNH4CH3COO, 1 mm EDTA solution overnight at room temperature, ethanol-precipitated at −80 °C, and resuspended in water (500 cps/μl). Unlabeled RNA competitors were also prepared by in vitrotranscription, but using 3 μg of template. The relative concentrations of the cold RNAs were estimated by ethidium bromide staining on agarose gels. When used in the binding assays, cold competitors were preincubated with the protein extracts for 15 min at room temperature prior to adding the labeled probe. It was estimated that the cold competitor was used at a minimum of 50–1200-fold molar excess over the labeled probe in the competition experiments (see figure legends). However, it is difficult to calculate precisely the fold excess of the cold RNA over the labeled counterpart because of the different methodologies used during the in vitrotranscription reactions. To prepare protein extracts for the REMSAs, confluent cells were collected by trypsinization, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed for 5 min on ice in 100 μl/106cells of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (CEB: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 3 mm MgCl2, 14 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The nuclei were pelleted for 1 min at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from nuclei as described previously (35Costa M. Medcalf R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. For the binding assays, 2–4 μg (see figure legends) of protein extracts were preincubated with 5 μg/μl of heparin (Sigma) in a total volume of 20 μl, for 10 min at room temperature before addition of the RNA probe (500 cps). The probe was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then cooled on ice before adding to the sample. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, samples were treated with 1 unit of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min at room temperature and then subjected to electrophoresis through a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and protein-RNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. REMSA supershift experiments were performed as described (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antibodies (1 μl of 1:2 diluted material) were added to the samples immediately following the 30-min incubation of the extract with the labeled RNA and left for 1 h on ice. For supershift experiments, the RNase T1 step was omitted. This procedure was performed as described by Coulis et al. (36Coulis C.M. Lee C. Nardone V. Prokipcak R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Four overlapping antisense DNA oligonucleotides were prepared and annealed to the exon 4A RNA probe that includes the first 50 bp of PAI-2 exon 4 (see Table II). Oligonucleotides 1–3 are 15 nt in length, and oligonucleotide 4 is 16 nt in length (see Fig. 6, panel A). The sequence of these oligomers is as follows: oligo 1, 5′-GAATGGATTTTATCT-3′; oligo 2, 5′-GAGCGGAAGGATGAA-3′; oligo 3, 5′-TGCAGAGCTGAGAGAG-3′; and oligo 4, 5′-GTCATCACAGGGTCCTGA-3′. An unrelated DNA oligonucleotide 5′-GTCATCACAGGGTCCTGA-3′ was used as a negative control. The DNA oligonucleotides were added to give a final concentration of either 0.1, 1.0, or 10 pmol. Following annealing of the oligomers to the RNA template, cytoplasmic extracts and heparin were added as described in the REMSA protocol. UV-cross-linking of RNA cellular proteins to RNA probes followed by SDS-PAGE was performed as described (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, following the binding reaction (REMSA protocol) using 15–20 μg of cytoplasmic extract, samples were digested with 1.0 units of RNase T1 for 10 min at room temperature and then transferred to microtiter plate wells and placed on ice. Samples were placed 7 cm from a UV source (Ultra LUM modeUVB-20) and cross-linked for 15 min. RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added directly to the wells (final concentration of 100 μg/ml) and left at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing dithiothreitol before being resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Gels were dried and labeled RNA-protein complexes detected by autoradiography. For competition experiments, higher concentrations of unlabeled RNA were included in these experiments compared with the REMSAs due to the higher concentration of protein extract. Western blot analysis for PAI-2 antigen was performed as described previously (15Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 50 μg of cytoplasmic extract was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were initially blocked with TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed and incubated with a primary anti-PAI-2 antibody (American Diagnostica) at a final dilution of 1:4000 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Finally, membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL reagents, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pfos-HGH mRNA decay system was used to identify mRNA instability determinants within the PAI-2 coding region. To this end, a series of individual exons or groups of consecutive exons of the PAI-2 coding region were amplified by PCR and introduced into the 3′-UTR of the HGH gene (see Fig. 1, panel A). NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with these constructs were subjected to serum treatment, and the decay rate of HGH containing transcripts was determined by Northern blotting and quantitated by densitometric analyses. As shown in Fig. 1, panel B, serum treatment of cells transfected with the parent pfos-HGH plasmid produced a stable HGH transcript that displayed a half-life in excess of 3 h. Insertion of exon 2 alone into the 3′-UTR of HGH mRNA slightly increased the decay rate of the HGH reporter transcript (half-life 2½ h). However, insertion of a fragment containing exon 2 + 3 together did not alter the decay rate of the chimeric HGH mRNA. These results suggest that exon 2 possesses instability determinants that are counteracted by sequences present within exon 3. Interestingly, HGH transcripts containing PAI-2 exons 2 + 3 + 4 were particularly unstable, with the half-life of the chimeric transcript reduced to less than 1 h. These data suggests that exon 4 possesses particularly powerful destabilizing elements. Curiously, longer chimeric transcripts containing exons 2–5 or exons 2–6, although promoting destabilization of the reporter transcript (mRNA half-lives: 1½ and 2½ h, respectively), were not as effective as exons 2–4 alone. This also suggests that sequences within exon 5 or 6 contained motifs that counteract the instability elements present in exon 4. Insertion of fragments containing exons 7 and 8 into the 3′-UTR of the pfos-HGH plasmid conferred a destabilizing effect upon the reporter transcript to an extent similar to that produced by exons 2–4 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that instability and stability determinants are located throughout the PAI-2 coding region, with powerful instability elements associated with the presence of exon 4 and also within exons 7 and 8. In this study, we focused our efforts to assess the role of exon 4 in the control of PAI-2 mRNA stability. The instability elements within exons 7 and 8 will be investigated in a separate study. To assess the stability of exon 4 in isolation, the entire exon 4 sequence was introduced into the 3′-UTR of HGH and the mRNA half-life determined. As shown in the Northern blot experiment presented in Fig. 2 (panel A), HGH-exon 4 chimeric transcripts were induced after 1 h of serum treatment, but decayed very rapidly with the signal barely detectable after 2 h. Quantitation of the mRNA signals indicated that the half-life of the exon 4 containing transcript was ∼30 min (panel B). The observation that exon 4 in isolation produced greater instability to the reporter transcript than seen in the context of other exons further supports the notion that mRNA stability determinants exist within neighboring exons to counteract partially the effects of the destabilizing elements in exon 4. To provide more evidence that sequences within exon 4 play a role in PAI-2 mRNA stability, the 129-bp exon 4 was deleted in-frame from the full-length PAI-2 cDNA using plasmid pfos-PAI-2 as a template (Fig. 3,panel A). The resulting construct (pfos-PAI-2Δ4) as well as the construct containing the full-length wild-type PAI-2 cDNA were stably transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Two independent series of transfection experiments were performed. The collective results of two individual serum time courses and Northern blot experiments of both series of transfected cells indicated that the mRNA half-life of the wild-type PAI-2 transcript to be ∼1 h, which is in agreement with previous results (1Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the half-life of the mutant PAI-2 transcript was extended to 2 h, double that of its wild-type counterpart. These data indicate that sequences within exon 4 promote PAI-2 mRNA instability. Experiments were conducted to determine whether regions within exon 4 provided binding sites for cellular factors. To this end, RNA probes containing the full-length (129 nt) exon 4 sequence were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from both NIH3T3 cells and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and binding activit"

However, the signaling pathways leading to phagocytosis have not been characterized. Here we show that interaction of OpaI bacteria with neutrophils or CGM1a-transfected DT40 cells induces calcium flux, which correlates with phagocytosis of bacteria. We identified an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in CGM1a, and showed that the ability of CGM1a to transduce signals and mediate phagocytosis was abolished by mutation of the ITAM tyrosines. We also demonstrated that CGM1a-ITAM-mediated bacterial phagocytosis is dependent on Syk and phospholipase C activity in DT40 cells. Unexpectedly, the activation of the CGM1a-ITAM phagocytic pathway by Opa+ GC results in induction of cell death.

Unexpectedly, the activation of the CGM1a-ITAM phagocytic pathway by Opa+ GC results in induction of cell death. gonococcus or N. gonorrhoeae opacity protein polymorphonuclear leukocytes DT40 B cell line expressing human CGM1a antigen E. coli HB101 containing the vector pGEM-3Z E. coli HB101-expressing OpaI protein biliary glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen CEA-related cell adhesion molecule immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif Syk protein-tyrosine kinase phospholipase C-γ B cell receptor T cell receptor Fc receptor propidium iodide phosphatidylserine fluorescein isothiocyanate Gonorrhea is one of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted diseases (1Centers for Disease Control Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Rep. 1993; 42: 55-63Google Scholar). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus, GC),1 the etiologic agent of gonorrhea, can adhere to and penetrate mucosal cells (2Evans B.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1977; 136: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Ward M.E. Watt P.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1972; 126: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and attain access to submucosal sites. Among the GC surface proteins that mediate this process is the opacity (Opa) protein family. This family consists of 11 unlinked opa genes, whose sequences are known (4Bhat K.S. Gibbs C.P. Barrera O. Morrison S.G. Jahnig F. Stern A. Kupsch E.-M. Meyer T.F. Swanson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1889-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, each Opa protein is able to switch its expression on and off, resulting in the unavoidable tendency of GC to alter their phenotypes by antigenic variation. Opa-expressing GC and Escherichia coli (Opa+ GC or E. coli) can attach to and invade human fallopian tube epithelium (5Gorby G. Simon D. Rest R. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicating that Opa proteins alone are sufficient to promote adherence to and invasion of human cells. Furthermore human challenge experiments (6Swanson J. Barrera O. Sola J. Boslego J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Jerse A.E. Cohen M.S. Drown P.M. Whicker L.G. Isbey S.F. Seifert H.S. Cannon J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that in vivo expression of Opa proteins plays an important role in gonococcal pathogenesis on the mucosal surface. It is well recognized that Opa proteins have the ability to stimulate adherence and phagocytosis of the Opa+ bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). This interaction with PMN occurs in an opsonin-independent manner (8Swanson J. Sparks E. Young D. King G. Infect. Immun. 1975; 11: 1352-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Swanson J. King G. Zeligs B. Infect. Immun. 1975; 11: 65-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Virji M. Everson J.S. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 965-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Virji M. Heckels J.E. J. Gen.

In addition, Opa+bacteria stimulate a chemiluminescent response in human neutrophils as a result of oxidative burst activity. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CD66 family serve as receptors mediating adherence and possibly phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria (13Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J.P. Watt M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Chen T. Gotschlich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings were mainly obtained with HeLa transfectants expressing individual CEA family members. However, neither the nature of the signals nor the pathways that are involved in phagocytosis of the bacteria are clear. The CEA gene is a member of a family of 18 expressible closely related genes (17Hammarstrom S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) that belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily (18Paxton R. Mooser G. Pande H. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, the nomenclature of the CEA family has been revised to be CEACAM (CEA-related cell adhesion molecules) family (19Beauchemin N. others Zimmermann W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The human CEA family includes BGP (biliary glycoprotein), CGM6 (CEA gene family member 6), NCA (nonspecific cross-reacting antigens), CGM1, CEA and PSG (pregnancy-specific glycoproteins), which are also designated CD66a (CEACAM1), CD66b (CEACAM8), CD66c (CEACAM6), CD66d (CEACAM3), CD66e (CEACAM5), and CD66f, respectively. CEACAM (CEA-related cell adhesion molecules) was renamed from the CEA family (19Beauchemin N. others Zimmermann W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) recently. It is noteworthy that CGM1a (CD66d), which promotes the strongest phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria, is only expressed in human neutrophils (20Nagel G. Grunert F. Kuijpers T. Watt S. Thompson J. Zimmermann W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Various components of the B cell receptors (BCR), T cell receptors (TCR), and Fc receptors (FcR) contain common sequence motifs in their cytoplasmic tails, called the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM; Ref. 21Cambier J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues within ITAMs can recruit protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK), e.g. Syk, whereupon these become activated. Recruitment of substrates such as phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) by these kinases leads to stimulation of calcium flux from intracellular stores (22Bijsterbosch M. Meade C. Turner G. Klaus G. Cell. 1985; 41: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 23Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

Med. 1997; 186: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This calcium flux reflects an early event after activation of PTK. In this study, we demonstrate that CGM1a bears a functional ITAM in its cytoplasmic tail, which mediates phagocytosis of Opa+bacteria followed by cell death. GC strain MS11 was cultured and maintained as previously described (26Swanson J. Barrera O. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1405-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only pilus− GC and LOSb(lacto-N-neotetraose) phenotype were used (27Swanson J. Achtman M. Kohl P. Marchal C. Morelli G. Seiler A. Thiesen B. Proceedings of the Seventh International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference.in: Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 391-396Google Scholar). Recombinantopa genes from GC MS11 were constructed and expressed inE. coli HB101 as described previously (28Belland R.J. Chen T. Swanson J. Fischer S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The designations of Opa proteins of both GC and E. coli are based on Swansonet al. (6Swanson J. Barrera O. Sola J. Boslego J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Belland et al. (28Belland R.J. Chen T. Swanson J. Fischer S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Opa+ bacteria used in this study are Opa−, OpaC, OpaD, OpaF, and OpaI GC or Opa− and OpaI E. coli. The wild-type chicken B-cells DT40, their mutants DT40-Syk (Syk−/−) and DT40-PLC-γ(PLC-γ−/−) (29Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar,30Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and transfectants were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mml-glutamine. COL-1 monoclonal antibody (MAb), specific for CGM1 and CEA, was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories INC., California. B1.1 antibody, which reacts with BGP, NCA, CGM1, and CEA, was generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Schlom, NCI, National Institutes of Health. The YTH71.3. antibody, which recognizes BGP, NCA, and CGM1, was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts (Indianapolis, IN). Anti-Fc antibody 2.4G2 was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Neutrophils from human blood were purified by centrifugation through Polymorphprep (Life Technologies, Inc.). The purified PMN were suspended either in RPMI or Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Cellgro, Herndon, VA) at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml. CGM1a cDNA and its mutants were cloned into pBEH expression vector, and NCA and BGPa were cloned into pRC/CMV vector. 10 μg of expression plasmids were co-transfected with 1 μg of pBabe-puror vector (31Morgenstern J. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) into 5 × 106 DT40 cells by electroporation at 250 V and 960 μF in 0.5 ml. Stable transfectants were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin 24 h after electroporation. The presence of CD66 antigens in individual clones was determined by flow cytometry analysis using FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) analysis with COL-1, YTH71.3., and secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC. The CGM1a cDNA cloned in pBEH has been previously described (20Nagel G. Grunert F. Kuijpers T. Watt S. Thompson J. Zimmermann W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues Tyr-196 and Tyr-207 (position 1 corresponds to the first amino acid of the mature protein after removal of the leader peptide) in the wild-type cytoplasmic domain of CGM1a were changed to phenylalanine residues, giving rise to three different mutants: Y196F, Y207F, and Y196F/Y207F (Fig. 1 B). Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved with the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (from Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Three primer pairs were designed for obtaining the mutants Y196F, Y207F, and Y196F/Y207F: TyrI5′, 5′-GCAGCTTCCATCTTTGAGGAATTGC and TyrI3′, 5′-GACATTCCTCAAAGATGGAAGCTGC, TyrII5′, 5′-GACACAAACATTTTCTGCCGGATGGACC and TyrII3′, 5′GGTCCATCCGGCAGAAAATGTTTGTGTC,and TyrI-II5′, 5′-GCTTCCATCTTTGAGGAATTGCTAAAACATGACACAAACATTTTCTGCCG, and TyrI-II3′, 5′-CCGGCAGAAAATGTTTGTGTCATGTTTTAGCAATTCCTCAAAGATGGAAGC. The mutated sequences of CGM1a were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the primers CGM1a5′ (5′-TCCTGGAGCCCAGCCTCTTTT) and CGM1a3′ (5′-AGGCTGTCGAGGTCTCCA). DT40 cells or neutrophils (4 × 106) were suspended in 3 ml of RPMI medium. 6 fl of 1 μm Fura-2AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) dissolved in Me2SO were added to the suspension, which was then incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional shaking. Cells were washed twice with HBSS and resuspended in 3 ml of HBSS. 0.5 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MgCl2. For activation assays, 0.1 ml of the bacterial suspensions at a concentration of 4 × 108 was added to the labeled cells. The cytosolic calcium concentration was determined with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LB50B, Perkin Elmer, Foster City, California) at an excitation wavelength of 340 and 360 nm, and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Calculation of the calcium concentration was performed using the FL WinLab software (Perkin Elmer). We should state here that we usually test three (at least two) different transfectants of each mutant to make sure that they behave equally. It should be noted that anti-receptor antibodies are often used to stimulate the activation of receptors such as BCR and TCR. However, none of the anti-CEA antibodies we tested (COL-1, B1.1, 4–12-5, and YTH71.3) was able to stimulate calcium flux in DT40-CGM1a, even when cross-linked with secondary antibodies. DT40 cells transfected with CGM1a (DT40-CGM1a) and control DT40 cells were suspended in RPMI with 2% fetal calf serum at the concentration of 2–4 × 105/ml. 0.5 ml each of these cell suspensions was added to 24-well plates and after addition of 50 μl of bacterial suspensions in RPMI at the concentration of 8 × 107, the cells were allowed to incubate for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Then gentamicin was added into each well to the final concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated for another 90 min. The cells were washed three times with RPMI and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% saponin (CalBiochem Corp.), and dilutions were plated on LB-agar or CG-agar. The level of internalization of bacteria into cells was calculated by determining the colony-forming units (cfu) recovered from the DT40 cell lysates. Annexin V-FITC binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) was used as the cell death assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Annexin V-FITC was used in conjunction with propidium iodide (PI) to distinguish apoptotic cells (annexin V-FITC positive, PI negative) from necrotic cells (annexin V-FITC positive, PI positive). Cells exhibited apoptotic cell-specific phosphatidylserine on their surface and, therefore, bound annexin V-FITC or took up PI, which cannot penetrate live cells. However, in our experiment, the cells that were either annexin V-FITC positive or PI positive were classified as dead cells (see Fig. 6). Neutrophils or DT40 cells (1 × 105) were suspended in 0.1 ml of 2% fetal calf serum in RPMI containing 1.5 × 106 bacteria (GC) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with occasional shaking. 50 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2), 7.5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 15 μl of PI were added in each vial. The cell suspensions were gently mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, after addition of 550 μl of binding buffer, samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Studies have indicated that Opa protein-mediated binding and phagocytosis of GC by PMN occurs through the CEA family members on PMN (13Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J.P. Watt M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Chen T. Gotschlich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14851-14856Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Gray-Owen S. Dehio C. Haude A. Grunert F. Meyer T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both BGPa and CGM1a contain possible ITAM-like motifs (Fig.1 A). NCA, which is membrane anchored by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) moiety, is expressed on granulocytes and has also been shown to bind to Opa proteins. To examine whether the interaction between GC and neutrophils results in any signaling in the PMNs, measurement of calcium flux was performed. OpaI GC were used to stimulate neutrophils. As shown in Fig.2 A, OpaI GC but not Opa− GC induced calcium flux in neutrophils, suggesting that at least one of the three CEA family members in question conveys these signals, possibly by an ITAM. To determine which of the three CEA-related receptors is responsible for the calcium flux in neutrophils induced by Opa+ GC (Fig. 2 A), the DT40 B cell line was chosen to perform functional studies. There are several reasons why we chose this cell line. First, the ITAM, which could be responsible for the signaling through the CEA-related molecules, was originally identified in the Igα/Igβ heterodimer of the BCR (32Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 33Reth M. Seminars in Immunol. 1995; 7: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and DT40 B cells have proven to be suitable for studying the functionality of presumed ITAMs (34Cox D. Chang P. Kurosaki T. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16597-16602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) e.g. by induction of calcium flux as observed after BCR activation. Furthermore, human neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells and cannot be genetically manipulated. Manipulation of established myeloid lines of human origin such as HL60 cells cannot be performed readily either because endogenous CD66 antigen expression changes during induction of maturation by retinoic acid4. Finally, no Opa+ GC were found to interact exclusively with individual CEA antigens like CGM1a (36Bos M. Grunert F. Belland R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gray-Owen S. Lorenzen D. Haude A. Meyer T. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In short, a cellular system that lacks endogenous human CEA antigens and can be manipulated, like the DT40 cell line, is needed to understand the behavior of CEA-related molecules in neutrophils. We believe that the DT40 cell line is the best model available. CGM1a, BGPa (both represent splice variants that code for tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic tails) and NCA cDNAs were cloned into pBEH or pRc/CMV expression vectors, and the resulting plasmids were stably transfected into the DT40 B cell line, generating the DT40-CGM1a, DT40-BGPa, and DT40-NCA transfectants. All three cell lines expressed similar levels of the respective CEA-related antigens (Figs.2 B and 3). When OpaI GC were added to these three cell lines, calcium flux was only observed in the DT40-CGM1a transfectant (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Opa− GC could not stimulate any calcium flux. Likewise, no calcium flux was detected in untransfected DT40 cells treated with OpaI GC. These results show that only CGM1a is able to convey the calcium flux and suggest that it contains a functional ITAM. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within an ITAM is a key step for its activation. The cytoplasmic domain of CGM1a contains two tyrosine residues in its potential ITAM. To test whether these tyrosine residues were required for activation of the calcium flux, we substituted them with phenylalanine. Three different tyrosine mutants, CGM1a-Y196F, CGM1a-Y207F, and CGM1a-Y196F/Y207F (Fig.1 B), were constructed and the resulting expression plasmids were transfected into DT40 cells. Transfectants that expressed similar levels of the mutated molecules were selected for the calcium flux experiments (Fig. 3). As depicted in Fig. 3, mutation of tyrosine residue 196 (Y196F) or mutation of both tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CGM1a (Y196F/Y207F) completely abolished its signaling ability as measured by calcium flux. On the other hand, OpaI GC were able to stimulate a low level of calcium flux in the Y207F CGM1a mutant. These results indicate that both tyrosines are necessary to constitute a fully functional ITAM with Tyr-196 being the essential one. This mutation analysis of the cytoplasmic tyrosines of CGM1a confirms that the motif surrounding these tyrosines (YX2LX7YX2M) is a functional ITAM. CGM1a promotes strong phagocytosis of Opa+bacteria. We wanted to know whether signaling through the ITAM in the cytoplasmic domain of CGM1a is involved in this process. First, using a colony-forming assay to quantify the number of internalized bacteria, we demonstrated that DT40-CGM1a cells are also capable of phagocytosing OpaI GC or E. coli but not Opa− GC or E. coli (Fig. 4 A). This result was confirmed by electron microscopy analysis (Fig. 4,B and C). To elucidate the importance of the tyrosines in this process, the tyrosine mutants were tested in the phagocytosis assay. As in the calcium flux experiments, mutation of Tyr-196 or mutation of Tyr-196 and Tyr-207 in the ITAM severely impaired or abolished, respectively, the ability of CGM1a to confer phagocytosis of OpaI E. coli (Fig. 4 D). However, some capacity to phagocytose OpaI E. coli was still preserved in DT40 cells expressing CGM1a-Y207F. From these results, we conclude that the ITAM in CGM1a mediates both calcium flux and the phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria. We tested the ability of DT40-CGM1a cells lacking Syk and PLC-γ activity to mediate calcium flux and phagocytosis, because the downstream pathway of ITAM activation involves Syk, whose activation in turn leads to PLC-γ stimulation. DT40-Syk-CGM1a or DT40-PLC-γ-CGM1a cells are CGM1a-transfected DT40 cells in which the Syk or PLC-γ genes have been inactivated. As depicted in Fig. 5 A andB, DT40-Syk-CGM1a cells cannot be induced to generate a calcium flux or to phagocytose OpaI bacteria. However, DT40-PLC-γ-CGM1a cells can still phagocytose OpaI E. coliat low level although stimulation of calcium flux could not be detected (Fig. 5). This suggests that an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration is not essential for phagocytosis. These data demonstrate that both Syk and PLC participate in the pathways leading to phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria, but Syk is essential for this process. Signal transduction via BCR activation results very complicated consequences. However, one of them leads to apoptosis of B cells (38Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We examined whether activation of CGM1a ITAM had a similar effect on DT-40 cells. As shown in Fig.6, OpaI GC stimulated substantially more cell death in DT40-CGM1a as measured by both phosphatidylserine exposure and uptake of propidium iodine than Opa− GC did. Untransfected DT40 B cells, used as a control, could not be killed by OpaI or Opa− GC (Fig. 6). The observed cell death is dependent on ITAM activation because CGM1a-Y196F and CGM1a-Y196F/Y207F mutants (Fig. 1) lost the ability to promote cell death (Fig. 6). Some cell death was observed in DT40-CGM1a with Opa− GC, which might be because of low numbers of Opa+ GC in the Opa− GC suspension because GC are able to switch Opa gene expression on and off. Alternatively, CGM1a might be activated by other components on GC, which are still unidentified. It should be noted that the anti-CGM1a specific antibody COL-1, which was unable to induce calcium flux, could not stimulate the death DT40-CGM1a either (data not shown). To further validate the effects of the CGM1a-ITAM activation pathway, DT40-Syk-CGM1a and DT40-PLC-γ-CGM1a cells were tested for cell death. As shown in Fig. 5, OpaI GC was not able to promote death of cells lacking Syk, but still killed a significant fraction of DT40-PLC-γ-CGM1a cells. The similarity between the patterns of bacterial phagocytosis and cell death suggests that these two processes share the same initiating events. We showed that activation of the phagocytic pathway via CGM1a led to cell death in DT40 cells. Thus, the question arises whether the CGM1a-ITAM pathway to cell death can also be observed in neutrophils, which are the only cells naturally expressing CGM1a. However, neutrophils cannot be genetically manipulated and so far none of the myeloid cell lines currently available fully resemble neutrophils and thus can convincingly replace PMNs. Furthermore, antibodies specific for CGM1a do not activate neutrophils. Fortunately, recent data did show that various Opa proteins interacted differently with CGM1a and BGPa. For example, OpaC or OpaI interact with both CGM1a and BGPa, and OpaD or OpaF interact with BGPa only (36Bos M. Grunert F. Belland R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Gray-Owen S. Lorenzen D. Haude A. Meyer T. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the rational is that if the CGM1a-ITAM pathway, demonstrated in DT40 cells, also applies to neutrophils, only GC-expressing Opa proteins that interact with CGM1a (such as OpaC or OpaI) should stimulate the death of neutrophils, as opposed to OpaD or OpaF-expressing GC. Opa−, OpaC, D, F, and I GC were used to perform similar experiments with neutrophils as done with the B cell lines in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 7, OpaC and I GC killed many more neutrophils than Opa− and OpaD or OpaF GC did. It should be noted that GC expressing these different Opa proteins have the similar ability to associate with neutrophils (39Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of the ITAM in CGM1a also stimulates cell death in neutrophils. Internalization of microorganisms into either professional or non-professional phagocytic cells requires the interaction of phagocytosis-promoting receptors on the cell surface with ligands on the surface of the microorganisms. In the present study, we demonstrated that the neutrophil-specific receptor, CGM1a contains an ITAM, which is essential for CGM1a-mediated phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria. This conclusion is further validated by showing that CGM1a-transfected, Syk-deleted DT40 cells are no longer able to promote effectively either calcium ion influx or phagocytosis of OpaI bacteria. Finally, we showed that CGM1a-mediated phagocytosis of opacity (Opa) proteins-expressing Neisseria gonorrhoeaeleads to cell death. Because CGM1a is only expressed in PMNs, it is a concern whether CGM1a-mediated signaling data obtained from the B cell line DT40 reflects its biological properties in neutrophils. ITAM-containing receptors have nearly exclusively been identified in cells from immune system. Despite the differences in the structures they recognize and the effector functions they carry out, BCRs, TCRs, and several FcRs utilize remarkably similar signal transduction components to initiate and propagate their signaling responses. They use components that contain distinct recognition (ITAM) and signal transduction subunits such as Syk, with which the ITAM in CGM1a may be also associated (Fig.5). This type of receptors is crucial for transmission of activation signals in immune cells. Here, we show that the human CGM1a, although ectopically expressed in a chicken B cell line, exhibits the ITAM characteristics of BCRs, supporting the notion that ITAMs are highly conserved motifs, and that the CGM1a ITAM might play a similar role in neutrophils. Opa+ Neisseria interact with BGP and CGM1 on neutrophils during in vitro infection, and both antigens promote phagocytosis of Opa+ bacteria in HeLa transfectants (13Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J.P. Watt M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,14Chen T. Gotschlich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Do CGM1a and BGPa work independently or do they collaborate during phagocytosis of GC by neutrophils? What kind of collaboration could be envisaged? BGPa can deliver inhibitory signals through its ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail to counteract ITAM-mediated positive signals, which requires SHP-1 and SHP-2. 2Chen, T., Zimmerman, W., Chen, I., Parker, J., Grunert, F., Maeda, A., and Bolland, S. (2001) in press. The protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are typically involved in negative signaling, bind to the ITIM-like motif in the cytoplasmic tail of BGPa (40Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 41Huber M. Izzi L. Grondin P. Houde C. Kunath T. Veillette A. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has recently been shown that interaction of Opa+ GC with BGPa antigens down-regulates the activity of SHP-1 (42Hauck C. Gulbins E. Lang F. Meyer T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, BGPa may be co-ligated with CGM1a on the surface of neutrophils when they interact with Opa+ bacteria. Cross-linkage of the two molecules might regulate the phagocytosis process. Opa+ GC-stimulated signal transduction events in neutrophils might consequently be analogous to the positive (ITAM)versus negative (ITIM) signaling seen with lymphocyte receptors such as BCR and FcRIIB, respectively (43Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, this study raises an interesting issue. This is the first report of phagocytosis of bacteria by B cells. Antigen-immunoreceptor interaction is an important step for the establishment of the immune response, because there is signaling from the receptor to activate different cellular functions. Internalization of antigen-bound receptors by B cells is critical for antigen processing and presentation to T lymphocytes. Here we show that DT40-CGM1a B cells were able to phagocytose Opa+ bacteria (either GC orE. coli) in a very efficient manner. Although the cell line we used was manipulated to express CGM1a antigen, our data, nevertheless, suggest that B cells possess the machinery to phagocytose whole bacteria. Demonstration of the ability of B cells to phagocytose bacteria is a new information with a potential. What is the biological fate of Opa+ GC after phagocytosis by PMN? It is generally thought that the phagocytosed gonococci are killed. However, neutrophils are often packed with intact, seemingly viable, intracellular GC (44Shafer W.M. Rest R.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that these Opa+ GC may be protected from bactericidal attack by the granulocytes and instead use these cells as an intracellular niche or as vehicles to reach the next host. Alternatively, they could simply kill the PMNs. In fact, it was recently found that the ITAM activation pathway also induces cell apoptosis in immune cells (23Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 38Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25310-25318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For example, activation of the ITAM in the BCR of DT40 B cells results in apoptosis (38Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 48Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting to note that OpaI and OpaC GC but not OpaD and OpaF GC stimulate the death of neutrophils (Fig. 7) although the level of interaction of OpaC, D, F, and I GC with neutrophils is similar (39Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Perhaps, phagocytosis of Opa+ GC by neutrophils through CGM1a leads in part to apoptosis of these cells. In addition, compared with other cells from immune system, there is not much known of the mechanisms of cell death in PMNs, even though these cells are noted for their death fate. In humans, PMNs succumb to apoptosis within 72 h. Thus, finding that expression of ITAM-containing CGM1a, a specific PMN antigen, mediated the death in B-cell and possibly in neutrophils is very significant. Whether BGPa mediated internalization of Opa+ GC in neutrophils could reduce apoptosis of neutrophils remains to be determined, because BGPa contains an ITIM to counteract the activated ITAM.2 It may seem to a paradox that host cells phagocytosing microorganisms kill them and also may be killed by microorganisms. However, the two aspects might in reality represent two separate battlefields in the interaction between bacteria (GC) and host cells (PMNs). This phenomenon also occurs in interaction between other pathogenic bacteria and host cells. For example, whether the outcome of macrophages phagocytosing Shigella or Salmonella is the killing of the microorganisms or the death of the host cell (50Zychlinsky A. Prevost M. Sansonetti P. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 51Monack D. Raupach B. Hromockyj A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9833-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) remains to be defined in vivo. The study of the interaction of Opa+ bacteria with host cells through CEA (CEACAM/CD66) antigens addresses two facets of phagocytosis of GC by PMNs, which are critical for the understanding of the pathogenesis of gonococcal infection.

We also thank Dr. Stanley Spinola for useful suggestions and editorial comments. We always thank Emil Gotschlich for insightful scientific advice."

The sialyltransferases are localized in the Golgi apparatus and are type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic domain, an N-terminal signal anchor, and a large lumenal catalytic domain, characteristic of all glycosyltransferases localized to the secretory pathway (7Paulson J.C.

They contain two conserved homologous regions, termed L (long)- and S (short)-sialylmotifs, which are present in the catalytic domain (9Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

Mutational analysis has suggested that the sialylmotifs are involved in binding the donor and acceptor substrates (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

Although comparison of any two sialyltransferases reveals ∼30% amino acid identity, there are only six amino acids that are invariant in all 16 sialyltransferases. Two of the invariant amino acids are cysteines, with one found in each sialylmotif (Fig.1). Our previous analysis by site-directed mutagenesis of a secreted form of ST6Gal I showed that alanine substitution of either of the invariant cysteines, Cys181 or Cys332, produced immunoprecipitated protein but no detectable enzyme activity (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem.

The results raised the possibility that these two cysteines may be involved in the formation of a conserved intrachain disulfide bond. In this report, we provide evidence that the soluble recombinant ST6Gal I contains a single disulfide bond. Moreover, deletion of either of the conserved cysteine residues results in inactive recombinant enzyme, which fails to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and be transported to the Golgi apparatus (15Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucocq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), presumably because it is improperly folded. The combined results, suggest that the invariant cysteine residues in the L- and S-sialylmotifs of ST6Gal I form an intrachain disulfide bond that is essential for maintaining an active conformation of the enzyme. For expression of wild type ST6Gal I and its mutants (Fig. 2), the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used after modifications as follows; plasmid DNA for the vector pcDNA3 was digested with KpnI and EcoRV and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of T7 DNA polymerase (unmodified with 3′-5′ exonuclease activity) using synthesis buffer (0.5 mm each of deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol). This treatment deleted the unique restriction sites BamHI andEcoRI, besides KpnI and EcoRV, from the modified pcDNA3, hereafter denoted pcDNA3mod. A dog proinsulin signal sequence was then subcloned into this modified vector as follows. The plasmid DNA for pGIR201Nhe3′ containing proinsulin signal sequence (a gift from K. Drickamer; see Ref. 16Hsueh E.C. Holland E.C. Carrera Jr., G.M. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NheI, and the smaller fragment for the insulin signal sequence was gel purified and then subcloned intoXbaI-digested calf intestine phosphatase-treated pcDNA3mod, following the usual procedure (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Prior to this treatment, the plasmid DNAs were propagated through a dam negative strain of Escherichia coli GM2163, the competent cells of which were made according to Hanahan's procedure (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 80-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar). The clone containing the proinsulin signal sequence in the 5′-3′ orientation was selected by sequencing, hereafter termed pcDNAins. Two oligonucleotides were designed to incorporate into this vector pcDNAins, sites for nickel binding and enterokinase cleavage. The oligos (sense, 5′-CTAGCACATCATCATCATCATCATGATGATGATGATAAAGATTCTAGAGAATTCGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCCTCGAATTCTCTAGAATCTTTATCATCATCATC ATGATGATGATGATGATGTG-3′) were annealed at 37 °C and ligated with theXbaI- and BamHI-digested pcDNAins, using standard molecular biological techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resultant vector, termed pcDNAins-His, was confirmed by sequencing. For subcloning the soluble form of ST6Gal I into pcDNAins-His vector, two restriction sites,XbaI and BamHI, were introduced into its cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 as follows: a forward primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAATTCCAATCCTCAGTTACCACAG-3′ (nucleotides 214–236) with an internal XbaI site (underlined) and a reverse primer, 5′-CCAGGAGAGGATCCATAAAATGAC-3′ (nucleotides 1270–1247), with an internal BamHI site were used for amplification using as template the cDNA for the rST6Gal I (for nomenclature, see Ref. 1Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously subcloned in pBluescript (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions for PCR were 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 73 °C for 2 min for 20 cycles. Gel analysis showed the generation of a single band of 1.05 kilobases. This band was purified using Geneclean II (Bio 101, San Diego, CA), digested with XbaI and BamHI, and then subcloned into similarly digested mammalian expression vector pcDNAins-His, described above. The sequence of the resulting expression vector, termed His-spST, was confirmed by dideoxy double-stranded sequencing (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) of the entire subcloned fragment, including the restriction sites used. For construction of the full-length form of the wild type ST6Gal I, the cDNA was released from a previously made construct in pBluescript (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with BamHI and XhoI and then subcloned into similarly digested pcDNA3. Sequencing was performed to check for the desired 5′-3′ orientation of this construct, termed pcDNA:ST6Gal I. Single point mutations were introduced in the above His-spST by a two-step PCR, following the procedure outlined previously (21Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cDNA for rST6Gal I (22Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previously subcloned in pBluescript (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template for introduction of these mutations. The mutagenic antisense oligonucleotides (substituted nucleotides underlined) used for construction of the corresponding cDNAs were 5′-CCTGGTCAGACAGCGTCATC-3′ (nucleotides 1003–984) for C332S, and 5′-TATCTACCTGGGCACACAGCGTCAT-3′ (nucleotides 1009–985) for D333A. For C181A, C332A, and R180A, the mutagenic antisense oligonucleotides used were described previously (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem.

In the first step of PCR, 25–50 pmol of each of a forward primer 5′-GCTCTAGAATTCCAATCCTCAGTTACCACAG-3′ (sense, nucleotides 214–236) and the mutant antisense oligonucleotide for the desired mutation were used to generate a megaprimer using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The conditions used were 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 73 °C for 2 min for 20 cycles. Gel analysis showed the generation of a single band for each mutation. This double-stranded DNA fragment was purified using Geneclean II and used as a forward primer in the second step of PCR. After an initial five cycles of linear amplification with the megaprimer, the reverse primer, 5′-CCAGGAGAGGATCCATAAAATGAC-3′ (nucleotides 1270–1247), was added into the reaction tube, and the reaction was continued at 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min and 73 °C for 3 min for 20 cycles. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, which showed the generation of a major single band of expected size (1.05 kilobases). This band was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by Geneclean II to separate it from the megaprimer. For the cDNAs of R180A and C181A, the gel purified product was digested with two unique restriction enzymes DraIII (at nucleotide 477) and BstBI (at nucleotide 824), and the smaller 350-base pair fragment was purified using the MERmaid kit (Bio101, San Diego, CA). The fragment for each mutation was then subcloned into a similarly digested and purified larger fragment of His-spST. Similarly, for C332A, C332S, and D333A, the gel purified product was digested withBstBI and BspEI (at nucleotide 1188), and the 330-base pair fragment was purified and subcloned. The mutation was confirmed by dideoxy double-stranded sequencing of the entire fragment that was subcloned, including the restriction sites used. To construct the full-length form of the mutants C181A and C332A, the cDNAs were digested with BspEI (at nucleotide 1188) andPflMI (at nucleotide 477), and the smaller 711-base pair fragment for each mutant was gel purified and then subcloned into a similarly digested larger fragment of pcDNA:ST6Gal I, using standard molecular biological techniques. Transfection of CHO-K1 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (23Datta A.K. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12663-12668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and cultured for 20–24 h before transfection with 2.0 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish. During transfection, serum free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. Stable transfectants were selected 48–60 h post-transfection with 1 mg/ml of G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.1 mg/ml RCA120 (Sigma) in the medium for at least 2 weeks. Stable clones were isolated and then further selected by ELISA, using anti- rat Galβ1,4GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase antibody, characterized previously (15Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucocq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). For ELISA, stable clones (∼ 104 cells/well) resistant to both G418 and RCA120 were individually plated in 24-well plates containing DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (500 μl) with 5% fetal calf serum. After overnight growth, 100 μl of the medium from each stable clone were added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The media were removed, and the plates were blocked with PBS− containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. After washing the plates with PBS−three times, 50 μl of anti-rat Galβ1,4GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase antibody (1:500 in PBS−containing 1% bovine serum albumin) were added and incubated at room temp for 2 h. The plates were then washed thrice with PBS−, and 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (Sigma; 1:1000 in PBS− containing 1% bovine serum albumin) were added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing the plates, the color was developed with 50 μl/well 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (Pierce). Color was quenched with 1 m phosphoric acid (50 μl/well), and readings were taken at 450 nm using a microtiter ELISA reader (Labsystems, Titertex Multiscan MCC/340). ST6Gal I (0.5–0.7 μm) purified as described under “Results” was incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing varying concentration of each thiol specific reagent. After incubation for 20–30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by dilution with the assay mixture, and the remaining activity was assayed immediately, as described previously (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Control experiments were conducted under the same conditions but without thiol reagents. Purified ST6Gal I, obtained from stable CHO-K1 cell line expressing the protein, was used (0.18–0.2 mg) for this assay. Quantitative estimation of the disulfide bonds were done using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid, following the procedure described by Cavallini et al. (24Cavallini D. Graziani M.T. Dupre S. Nature. 1966; 212: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a solution of monopotassium phosphate containing 1.6 mm EDTA, 16.6 mm HCl, 24 mmol urea at pH 7.4, in the absence or presence of sodium borohydride. The reaction was monitored at 412 nm until a constant absorbance reading was achieved. For expression of the wild type His-spST and its mutants, COS-1 cells (1–2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with ∼2.0 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (12Datta A.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Expression of the proteins was allowed to continue for 40–60 h post-transfection before harvesting the cells. For the analysis of the soluble expressed proteins, the culture medium was collected and used for the enzyme assay as described previously (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,14Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These transfected cells were also used for metabolic labeling. The transfection experiments and subsequent analysis were repeated at least three times for each mutant using plasmid DNAs from different preparations. For the analysis of the membrane bound proteins, the transfected COS-1 cells were harvested 40–60 h post-transfection. For sialyltransferase assays, cells were washed with PBS− (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) and lysed as previously described (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation of expressed proteins were performed essentially following the procedure of Colley et al. (25Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modification as follows. 36–48 h post-transfection, the transfected COS-1 cells were washed thrice with methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated in the same medium for 1–2 h in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and fresh medium containing 100 μCi/ml Trans35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each dish. After 3 h of incubation in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed at least thrice with DMEM containing methionine. Fresh DMEM (5 ml) containing methionine and 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were incubated for 16–18 h (chase period) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The radiolabeled media were then collected and used for detection of ST6Gal I protein by immunoprecipitation, as described previously (14Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using affinity purified rabbit anti-rat ST6Gal I. In some experiments, the radiolabeled proteins were also analyzed by binding with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). Sialyltransferase fusion protein present in the radiolabeled medium was pelleted with Ni-NTA agarose by centrifugation and detected as follows. The medium (100 -500 μl) from the transfected cells was mixed with equal amounts of 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) containing 0.1% Triton CF-54, 25% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm imidazole. Ni-NTA agarose (20 μl) in a slurry was added, incubated by rotation at room temperature for 1–2 h, and centrifuged. The pellet was used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after washing twice with the above buffer. Proteins were eluted from the pellet by boiling for 5 min in 40 μl of 1× Laemmli gel sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and 25 mm EDTA. Ni-NTA agarose bound fusion proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 2,5-diphenyloxazole/dimethyl sulfoxide (27Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar), and the gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C. This was carried out using unlabeled medium from transfected COS-1 cells as described previously (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The sialyltransferase protein samples were separated from the transfected medium using Ni-NTA agarose, as described above. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, following the usual technique (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The membrane blot was developed by adsorption of the rabbit anti-rat Galβ1,4GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase antibody (1: 500), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein bands were finally visualized by ECL, as suggested by the supplier of the reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was performed as described by Colley et al. (25Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Approximately 0.5 × 105 COS-1 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine coated circular (18 mm) microscope cover glasses in 500 μl of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and allowed to reach 60–70% confluence by overnight incubation. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINETM, as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA. After 36–60 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS− and fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde for 35–50 min at room temperature. For detection of expressed wild type ST6Gal I and its mutants, the cells were washed twice with 0.1m glycine and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Fixed cells were incubated for 45 min in blocking buffer at room temperature. Blocking buffer was removed, and 150 μl of a 1:100 dilution of affinity purified rabbit anti-rat Galβ1,4GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase antibody in blocking buffer were added to each well, and incubation was continued for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed four times for 5 min with 500 μl of PBS− at room temperature, a 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in blocking buffer was added, and the incubation was allowed to continue for 45 min. For co-localization experiments, the cells were washed four times with PBS− (without calcium and magnesium salts), and then a 1: 200 dilution of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated lectin from Sambucus nigra (SNA; EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) in blocking buffer (0.5% goat serum in PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmCa2+/Mg2+, and 0.1 m lactose was added to stain the cells for detection of NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc containing glycoproteins. Cells were again washed four times for 5 min each with PBS− and then mounted on microscope slides using ∼20 μl of Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were visualized on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope and pictures taken with Ektachrome (P1600) film. The protein determination using the bicinchonic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and sialyltransferase assay, and the kinetic analysis were done essentially as described previously (12Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar, 14Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the wild type ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, His-spST, was transfected into CHO-K1, which lacks the endogenous ST6Gal I enzyme (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to G418, we have also used Ricinus communis agglutinin,RCA120, for selection of the transformants expressing the enzyme. It was noted that while using only RCA120, the frequency of obtaining untransfected CHO-K1 resistant cells was ≤0.001%. This lectin is known to bind terminal galactose on the oligosaccharide bound to the glycoprotein. Because CHO-K1 cells have endogenous sialyltransferases other than ST6Gal I that can sialylate the terminal Gal, some untransfected cells also become resistant to RCA120, although the frequency is very low. Using both G418 and RCA120, not a single resistant clone was obtained using 106 untransfected cells. With G418 selection only, ∼10–30% of the cells were resistant. In contrast, about 0.1% cells became resistant to both G418 and RCA120 when transfected cells were used, presumably because of increased expression of ST6Gal I. At least 30 resistant clones were selected for further screening by ELISA. The isolated resistant clones were grown individually in 48-well plates containing DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with G418, RCA120, and fetal calf serum. After about 48–36 h of growth, 100 μl of the medium from individual wells were used for ELISA using rabbit anti-rat ST6Gal I antibody to select the clone expressing the highest level of sialyltransferase, which was finally subcloned by limit dilution. ST6Gal I protein was purified from the culture medium of this clone using CDP-hexanolamine Sepharose as described previously (29Williams M.A. Kitagawa H. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Jamieson J.C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme obtained was >90% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The purified sialyltransferase was subjected to the thiol reducing reagents dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both reagents completely abolished enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition achieved at 0.35 mm dithiothreitol and 1.0 mm of β-mercaptoethanol (TableI). This inhibition was irreversible because no activity was regained following removal of these reducing agents by dialysis. The same results were obtained for the enzyme purified from rat liver (not shown). The results suggest that a disulfide linkage is essential for the enzyme activity. In contrast, the free sulfhydryl reagents, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (5 mm), N-ethylmaleimide (25 mm), and iodoacetamide (25 mm), had no effect on enzyme activity. Under the same reaction conditions, 0.5 mm14C-labeled N-ethylmaleimide covalently reacted with the enzyme as detected by SDS-PAGE (not shown). 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid also covalently reacted with the enzyme as detected spectrophotometrically (TableII). The results demonstrate the presence of free sulfhydryls and suggest that they are not essential for"

Two-hybrid interaction analysis and pull-down experiments showed a physical interaction between NtMEK1 and the tobacco MAP kinases p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4, but not p43Ntf3. In kinase assays NtMEK1 preferentially phosphorylated p43Ntf6. Functional studies in yeast showed that p43Ntf6 could complement the yeast MAP kinase mutantmpk1 when co-expressed with NtMEK1, and that this complementation depended on the kinase activity of p43Ntf6. Expression analysis showed that the NtMEK1 and ntf6 genes are co-expressed both in plant tissues and following the induction of cell division in leaf pieces. These data suggest that NtMEK1 is an MEK for the p43Ntf6 MAP kinase.AJ302651 Two-hybrid screening of a tobacco BY-2 cell suspension cDNA library using the p43Ntf6mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase as bait resulted in the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein with features characteristic of a MAP kinase kinase (MEK), which has been called NtMEK1.

A protein kinase cascade provides integration of different inputs, allows subtle changes in a stimulus to be transduced as a sharp switch in output, and allows the signal itself to reach different cellular compartments depending on the cascade (1Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 2Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The typical events of a MAP kinase cascade initiate at the plasma membrane with binding of a ligand to a receptor, which in turn leads to the activation of a G protein. The GTP-bound form of the G protein activates a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase (MEK). The terminal component of the kinase module, the MAP kinase, is phosphorylated by MEK and subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates transcription factors, or targets cytosolic proteins such as other kinases or cytoskeletal-associated proteins (3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 4Reszka A.A. Bulinski J.C. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). G proteins, MAPKKKs, MEKs, and MAP kinases have been cloned in plants by homology-based screening, and many of the stimuli leading to the activation of the MAP kinases have been identified (reviewed in Ref.5Meskiene I. Hirt H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 791-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, building up different pathways by the identification of the relevant binding partner(s) of the cascade and, above all, substrates for MAP kinases is still at a relatively early stage in plants. A possible MAP kinase three-component module composed of ATMEKK1 (a MAPKKK), ATMKK2/MEK1 (two MEKs), and the MAP kinase ATMPK4 has been reported (6Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). MEK1 was also reported to interact with CTR1, a MAPKKK similar to the Raf protein kinase family (7Pan Z. Chang C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid screening identified a MEK that interacted with the stress-activated SIPK MAP kinase from tobacco, although SIPK could not be phosphorylated by the MEK in in vitro kinase assays (8Liu Y. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In synchronized tobacco cell cultures, the p43Ntf6 MAP kinase (9Wilson C. Anglmayer R. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is activated at a late stage in mitosis, around the anaphase/early telophase transition, and localizes in the middle of two microtubule arrays characteristic of the phragmoplast (10Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a plant-specific structure involved in laying down the new cell wall. The timing of kinase activation and its intracellular localization suggest that p43Ntf6 plays a role in cell plate formation during cell division. With the aim of identifying possible partners for p43Ntf6, we undertook a two-hybrid screen that identified a protein kinase whose characteristics suggest it is a MEK for the p43Ntf6 protein. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutant proteins were created by mutating a conserved lysine residue in kinase subdomain II that is involved in the transfer of phosphate to the protein substrate. The ntf3 LOF mutant protein p43Ntf3-K61R has been described previously (9Wilson C. Anglmayer R. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LOF mutant constructs of ntf4 and ntf6 were made using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis kit from Promega to produce the LOF mutant proteins p43Ntf6-K67R and p45Ntf4-K89R. A gain-of-function (GOF) mutant protein of p43Ntf6 was made as for the LOFs except the mutated site was from a glutamate at position 328 to asparagine, corresponding to the Drosophila sevenmaker GOF mutant, D334N (11Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The GOF mutant protein was called p43Ntf6-E328N. For two-hybrid screening, thentf6 WT and GOF cDNAs were cloned into theSmaI site of the binding domain vector pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene) to give pBD-ntf6WT and pBD-ntf6GOF. The ntf4,ntf3, and ntf6 LOF cDNAs were cloned into the same site of pBD-GAL4 Cam for two-hybrid interaction analysis. MAP kinase proteins were produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in pGEX-2T′6 as described (9Wilson C. Anglmayer R. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The GST-NtMEK1 construct was obtained by PCR cloning of the cDNA into theBamHI-SalI sites of the vector pGEX-4-T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For complementation studies in yeast, the MAP kinase cDNAs for ntf6, ntf6-LOF,ntf6-GOF, and ntf4 were cloned by PCR into the yeast expression vector pVT103U (12Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), which contains the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and a uracil-selectable marker. Oligonucleotides were designed to change the nucleotides before the ATG codon of each cDNA to AAAA, which is a favored context for translation in yeast (13Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 423-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, the NtMEK1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned in the SmaI site of the pBAT vector (14Annweiler A. Hipskind R.A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to give pBAT-NtMEK1. All plasmids produced by PCR cloning were checked by sequencing. The pBD-ntf6WT and the pBD-ntf6GOF plasmids were used as bait to screen a tobacco BY-2 cell suspension library constructed in the CLONTECHactivation domain vector pACT2. Library and bait were co-transformed in the yeast strain HF7c according to the CLONTECHMatchmaker two-hybrid system protocol and transformants were plated on medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Approximately 1 million clones were screened for either bait. As the p43Ntf6-GAL4 fusion allowed some growth on medium lacking histidine, the colonies obtained after transformation were streaked on the same medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). The surviving colonies were further tested for the expression of β-galactosidase by filter lift assays (CLONTECH). Plasmids were rescued following growth of the transformants in liquid medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, plasmid DNA isolation, and transformation ofEscherichia coli. The plasmids recovered from E. coli were sequenced according to standard procedures. Two-hybrid interaction analysis between NtMEK1 and the MAP kinases p43Ntf3, p45Ntf4, and p43Ntf6 (and the LOF and GOF versions of p43Ntf6) was tested on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-AT, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in liquid assays (CLONTECH). pVTntf6WT, -LOF, -GOF, pVTntf4, and pACTNtMEK1 were transformed into the yeast strain DL456 (15Mazzoni C. Zarzov P. Rambourg A. Mann C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which has a disrupted MPK1 (slt2) gene, and plated on selective medium. The yeast MPK1 gene was expressed in DL456 from the high copy number plasmid pFL44 (15Mazzoni C. Zarzov P. Rambourg A. Mann C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The different plasmid combinations were as reported in the text. Transformants were streaked on YPD medium (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% agar) and on YPD medium containing 1 m sorbitol, and the plates were incubated at 28 °C or 37 °C for 2 days (16Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The pACTNtMEK1 plasmid was lost from pVTntf6WT/pACTNtMEK1 double transformants by growth in liquid minimal medium (2% glucose, 0.66% yeast nitrogen base) containing leucine (the selectable marker of the pACT2 plasmid), plated on the same solid medium, and then replica plated to solid minimal medium lacking leucine. The colonies that did not grow after replica plating were selected from the master plate to test for pACTNtMEK1-dependent complementation of the mpk1mutant. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were as described previously (9Wilson C. Anglmayer R. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Kinase-substrate reactions were carried out in 10 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), at 30 °C for 30 min. Myelin basic protein was used at a final concentration of 2 μg/reaction. Approximately 1 μg of each GST fusion protein was used in the reactions, unless otherwise stated. Protein extraction from plant tissues and immunoblot analysis were as described in Ref. 10Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. [35S]Methionine-labeled NtMEK1 protein was synthesized from the pBAT-NtMEK1 vector in vitro using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction system (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 2 μg of each GST-MAP kinase fusion protein or GST alone was incubated with one fifth of the [35S]methionine-labeled translation product in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Binding was performed at 4 °C overnight, and then 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 2 h. Finally, the reactions were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. The dried gels were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films. Leaf discs of tobacco SR1 plants grownin vitro were treated according to Ref. 17Nakashima N. Hirano K. Nakashima S. Banno H. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Briefly, they were incubated in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium or Murashige and Skoog medium under the following conditions: (i) no addition, (ii) 1 μm naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), (iii) 2.2 μm 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), (iv) 0.5 μm N6-benzyladenine (BA), (v) both NAA and BA, and (vi) both 2,4-D and BA. Samples were collected every 24 h over a 1-week period and further processed for RNA and protein extraction. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from different tissues of SR1 tobacco plants and from leaf pieces treated with hormones. RNA extraction was performed with Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (Dynal GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of each RNA per sample were fractionated on 1% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After UV cross-linking, membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes at 65 °C overnight in Church buffer (18Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). A two-hybrid interaction screen was used to search for molecules that interact with the tobacco MAP kinase p43Ntf6. Both the wild-type p43Ntf6 protein and a mutant construct of p43Ntf6 called p43Ntf6-E328N (see “Experimental Procedures”), analogous to the Drosophila sevenmaker (D334N, Ref. 11Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and mammalian ERK2 (D319N, Ref. 19Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) gain-of-function (GOF) mutants, were used as bait. Both p43Ntf6 constructs were cloned into the two-hybrid interaction binding domain vector pBD-GAL4 Cam and used to screen a cDNA library prepared from a BY-2 cell suspension culture constructed in the interacting domain plasmid pACT2. Co-transformants were selected on media lacking histidine. Due to the growth of a large number of colonies on this media, they were replated on media containing 3-AT, which provides a more stringent selection for histidine-expressing cells. Of the 1000 colonies originally selected on medium lacking histidine, 250 were scored as being able to grow in the presence of 3-AT. These colonies were tested for β-galactosidase production using a filter lift assay. Three colonies that were positive using this test turned out to harbor the same plasmid after rescue and sequencing. The open reading frame carried by all of these plasmids codes for a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 39.7 kDa and contains all the signature motifs of a protein kinase (Fig.1). Data base searches showed that this protein, which we have named NtMEK1, had the highest homology to MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK) from plants (Fig. 1). The highest homology was to an Arabidopsis sequence identified in the EMBL data base (here called AtMEKhom, 83%, accession no. BAB09875), then ZmMEK1 82.7% (20Hardin S.C. Wolniak S.M. Planta. 1998; 206: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); LeMEK1 68.1% (21Hackett R.M. Oh S.A. Morris P.C. Grierson D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1526Google Scholar); SIPKK 65% (8Liu Y.

Biol. 1997; 35: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The signature sequence (AIVT)(GA)(TC)XX(YF)M(SAG)PER(IL) diagnostic of all MAPKKs (22Hamal A. Jouannic S. LePrince A.S. Kreis M. Henry Y. Plant Sci. 1999; 140: 49-64Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is present in subdomain VIII. However, the plant MAPKK signature described as (SQY)(LIV)(ILAV)LE(YF)M(DN)(GKQR)GSL(AE)(DG)(IFAL)(LHIV)(KIV) in subdomain V (22Hamal A. Jouannic S. LePrince A.S. Kreis M. Henry Y. Plant Sci. 1999; 140: 49-64Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) differs in NtMEK1 in the third last and last amino acid of this motif (VIR). The MAPKK phosphorylation site motif ((S/T)XXXXX(S/T)) characteristic of plant MAPKKs is present between subdomains VII and VIII (Fig. 1). The NtMEK1 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-4-T1 expression vector and expressed in E. coli to produce a GST fusion protein. Purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography resulted in a protein with a molecular mass that approximated the mass predicted from a fusion of GST (27 kDa) with the NtMEK1 protein (39.7 kDa; Fig.2 A, top panel). This fusion protein showed autophosphorylation activity and was able to phosphorylate MBP, confirming the isolation of an active protein kinase (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel). We tested the ability of NtMEK1 to use three tobacco MAP kinases as substrates. GST fusions with the tobacco MAP kinases, p43Ntf3, p45Ntf4, and p43Ntf6 (9Wilson C. Anglmayer R. Vicente O. Heberle-Bors E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and with loss-of-function versions of the three kinases (p43Ntf3-K61R, p45Ntf4-K89R, and p43Ntf6-K67R) were produced in E. coli and affinity-purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. No autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of MBP by the loss-of-function MAP kinases was observed (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel). This enabled us to test the ability of NtMEK1 to use these three MAP kinases as substrates. The three MAP kinase loss-of-function proteins were incubated with the NtMEK1 protein in kinase assays. Phosphorylation of both p45Ntf4-K89R and p43Ntf3-K61R by NtMEK1 was weak, while p43Ntf6-K67R was strongly phosphorylated (Fig.2 B). This differential phosphorylation of the MAP kinases shows that p43Ntf6 is the preferred in vitrosubstrate for NtMEK1. The ability of NtMEK1 to interact with the different MAP kinases was tested using a GST pull-down experiment. The NtMEK1 protein was synthesized and isotopically labeled in vitro, and the resulting protein was incubated on its own, with the GST protein, or with each of the three GST-MAP kinase wild-type fusion proteins. The protein mixtures were then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resulting gel was then exposed. No signal was observed when GST alone was bound to the Sepharose, or when the reaction contained only the NtMEK1 protein. Strong signals were observed after incubation of NtMEK1 with p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4 (Fig. 3). NtMEK1 pulled down more p45Ntf4 than p43Ntf6. This result suggests that both p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4physically interact with NtMEK1. A very weak signal, of uncertain significance, was also observed for p43Ntf3. Since a physical interaction between NtMEK1 and both p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4 was indicated by the GST pull-down experiment, but NtMEK1 preferentially phosphorylated p43Ntf6, we extended this study using the two-hybrid system to investigate the interaction between NtMEK1 and the three tobacco MAP kinases. The ntf3, ntf4, and ntf6cDNAs, as well as the GOF and LOF versions of ntf6, were cloned into the pBD-GAL4 Cam plasmid and co-transformed either with the empty pACT2 plasmid or with pACT-NtMEK1 into yeast cells. Co-transformants were tested for growth in the absence of histidine. No growth occurred in the transformants containing an empty pACT2 plasmid in combination with any MAP kinase, in cells containing pACT-NtMEK1 with the pBD-GAL4 Cam plasmid, or in the pBDntf3/pACT-NtMEK1 combination (Fig. 4 A). Allntf6 versions (pBD-ntf6WT, -K67R, and -E328N) grew in the absence of histidine when co-expressed with pACT-NtMEK1 (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, so did the combination of pACT-NtMEK1 and pBDntf4. In filter assays, only those combinations that could grow on media without histidine produced β-galactosidase (data not shown). We measured the β-galactosidase activity from the transformants to estimate the strength of the interaction between these proteins. The pBDntf4/pACT-NtMEK1 combination showed the strongest interaction of all (Fig. 4 B). More curious was the observation that the loss-of-function version of p43Ntf6 interacted more strongly with NtMEK1 than either the wild-type or gain-of-function version of the protein, both of which resulted in roughly equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase production (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, in vitro and in vivo interaction assays showed a strong physical interaction between NtMEK1 and both p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4, even though p43Ntf6 was a preferred substrate for phosphorylationin vitro. A functional complementation assay was used to further investigate the interaction between NtMEK1 and p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4. Disruption of the gene for MPK1, coding for a MAP kinase involved in cell wall biosynthesis, in yeast cells (here described as the mpk1 strain), results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype that can be rescued by growing cells in the presence of sorbitol as an osmotic stabilizer (15Mazzoni C. Zarzov P. Rambourg A. Mann C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The NtMEK1, ntf6WT, ntf6K67R, ntf6E328N, and ntf4WT cDNAs were cloned into yeast expression vectors (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used to transform the mpk1 strain. None of the single transformants could rescue the defect of mpk1cells when grown at 37 °C in the absence of sorbitol (Fig.5). However, co-transformation ofmpk1 cells with NtMEK1 together with plasmids expressing either p43Ntf6-WT or p43Ntf6-E328N could complement the growth defect at 37 °C (Fig. 5). The growth of these double transformants was somewhat weaker than the growth of cells in which the wild-type MPK1 gene was expressed from a high copy number plasmid. By contrast, the cells expressing p45Ntf4 could not complement the mpk1 growth defect when co-expressed with NtMEK1. The complementation of mpk1 by p43Ntf6depended on the kinase activity of the protein since co-expression of p43Ntf6-K67R with NtMEK1 did not result in growth at 37 °C (Fig. 5). No growth of the mpk1 transformants was observed after plasmid-losing experiments in which the pACT-NtMEK1 construct was eliminated from the pBD-ntf6WT/pACT-NtMEK1 co-transformant (see “Experimental Procedures”), confirming that NtMEK1 was necessary for the complementation (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that NtMEK1 can activate p43Ntf6. Northern analysis of RNA isolated from different plant tissues was performed using ntf6 and NtMEK1 probes. They are expressed at a high level in cell suspension cultures. Expression of both ntf6 and NtMEK1 occurs in cotyledons and floral tissues, but not in roots or leaves (Fig.6). Although NtMEK1 showed a similar expression profile to ntf6, no NtMEK1 signal was observed in young stems where weak ntf6 expression was observed. The p43Ntf6 MAP kinase has been implicated in cell division processes in plant cells, showing activation during anaphase/telophase (10Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether NtMEK1 might be involved in this process, we induced cell division in leaf pieces by incubating them in media containing the plant hormones NAA and BA. The combination of these two plant hormones is absolutely required to induce cells to re-enter into the cell cycle (24Tréhin C. Planchais S. Glab N. Perennes C. Tregear J. Bergounioux C. Planta. 1998; 206: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Samples were taken over a period of days, RNA extracted, and used for Northern analysis. A B-type cyclin gene (cycB1) was used as a probe to follow changes in the cell cycle in the leaf pieces over the time course of the experiment. ThecycB gene is expressed during the M phase of the cell cycle (25Planchais S. Glab N. Tréhin C. Perennes C. Bureau J.M. Meijer L. Bergounioux C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Two peaks of cycB transcript accumulation were observed 4 and 7 days after the induction of cell division in leaf pieces (Fig. 7), suggesting that a degree of cell cycle synchrony occurs after this inductive process. Bothntf6 and NtMEK1 showed a similar pattern of transcript accumulation, indicating that they are also being induced in a cell cycle-regulated manner (Fig. 7). To further corroborate the cell cycle-regulated expression of p43Ntf6, Western and kinase assays were performed using an anti-p43Ntf6 antibody with protein extracts from the leaf pieces induced to divide in a manner similar to that described above. In this instance we used a combination of NAA and BA or a combination of the synthetic auxin 2,4-D and BA. The p43Ntf6 protein kinase activity (Fig.8 A) and p43Ntf6protein levels (Fig. 8 B) followed a similar pattern to that observed with the ntf6, NtMEK1, and cycBtranscript accumulation. This was observed in both hormone combinations (NAA with BA and 2,4-D with BA). No NtMEK1 or ntf6transcripts (data not shown), nor protein or kinase activity for p43Ntf6 (Fig. 8, A and B), were observed without hormone addition or when only one of the hormones was added. These data support a role for cell cycle-regulated expression and activation of p43Ntf6, and the co-expression of NtMEK1.Figure 8p43Nft6 expression and activity after inducing cell division in leaf pieces. Cell division was induced in leaf pieces by the addition of plant hormones as indicated (see also text). No hormone addition was used as a control. Protein extracts were prepared from samples taken over a period of days and immunoprecipitated with the anti-p43Ntf6 antibody and used in kinase assays with MBP as substrate (A) or used for immunoblot analysis with the anti-p43Ntf6 antibody (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The p43Ntf6 MAP kinase from tobacco appears to play a role in dividing cells (10Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is activated in mitosis and localizes to the phragmoplast, a plant-specific structure involved in laying down the new cell wall. It was therefore of interest to search for molecules that interact with p43Ntf6. We undertook a two-hybrid screen using p43Ntf6 as bait and isolated a cDNA that could encode a novel plant protein kinase that has been called NtMEK1 and presents all the characteristics of a MAP kinase kinase. A tobacco MAPKK was isolated previously by two-hybrid screening using the MAP kinase SIPK as a bait (8Liu Y. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These two proteins co-immunoprecipitated, but no phosphorylation of SIPK by SIPKK could be demonstrated. NtMEK1 and SIPKK are only 65% identical at the amino acid level. In vitro and in vivo binding assays showed that NtMEK1 could bind two out of three tobacco MAP kinases, p43Ntf6 and p45Ntf4, but not p43Ntf3. Despite the preferential phosphorylation of p43Ntf6 over p45Ntf4 by NtMEK1, the latter protein showed apparently stronger binding to NtMEK1 as measured by the production of β-galactosidase activity in a two-hybrid interaction assay. The observed weak phosphorylation of p45Ntf4 could be due to the slow release of phosphorylated p45Ntf4 from NtMEK1 resulting from this strong binding. MAPKKs may bind tightly to MAP kinases in their inactive form. The dissociation of the MAPKK and MAP kinase appears to be important for MAP kinase activation and subcellular localization. It has been suggested that the dissociation of MAPKK from a MAP kinase may involve the feedback phosphorylation of MAPKK by a MAP kinase (26Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 27Kieran M.W. Katz S. Vail B. Zon L.I. Mayer B.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6647-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and such phosphorylation of a MAPKK by a MAP kinase has been demonstrated (28Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). NtMEK1 might not be a substrate for p45Ntf4, thus preventing the feedback phosphorylation release mechanism that dissociates p45Ntf4and NtMEK1 and thus the interaction of active p45Ntf4 with its substrates. In support of this was the observation that the p43Ntf6 LOF version also interacted more strongly with NtMEK1 than the wild-type or gain-of-function protein when measured as β-galactosidase activity in a two-hybrid interaction assay. It has been shown previously that a MAPKK could bind to a MAP kinase but not activate it (29Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed could inhibit its activation (27Kieran M.W. Katz S. Vail B. Zon L.I. Mayer B.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6647-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A number of different docking domains between MAP kinases and MEKs have been described. One such domain located in the amino terminus of the protein is composed of a basic region followed by LXL (30Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of NtMEK1 contains a sequence, also present in most of the MEKs shown in Fig. 1, which shows similarities to this pattern. Amino-terminal portions of MEKs have been shown to be sufficient to bind MAP kinases (31Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The amino terminus before subdomain I of NtMEK1 and the remaining catalytic part of the protein were expressed separately from the pACT2 vector in combination with all of the MAP kinases (plus the p43Ntf6 LOF and GOF versions) expressed in pBD-Gal4 Cam in a two-hybrid interaction assay. No interactions were found for any of these combinations, except for the carboxy catalytic domain of NtMEK1 with p45Ntf4, and this interaction was much weaker than with the wild-type protein (data not shown). Therefore, the binding determinants of NtMEK1 are still unclear, and probably require multiple interacting sites to specifically interact with and phosphorylate different MAP kinases (32Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Significantly, p43Ntf6 was able to complement thempk1 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae while p45Ntf4 could not. This complementation depended on the presence of NtMEK1, and on a functional p43Ntf6 MAP kinase. Together, these data show that NtMEK1 can activate the p43Ntf6 MAP kinase. The data presented here are not sufficient to predict whether the complementation of mpk1 by p43Ntf6 is a reflection of functional conservation between the yeast and plant MAP kinases. An Arabidopsis MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) was shown to interact with and activate the MAP kinase ATMPK4 (33Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Huang Y. Li H. Gupta R. Morris P.C. Luan S. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly to the situation with p43Ntf6and NtMEK1, ATMPK4 could complement mpk1 only when co-expressed with MEK1 (33Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The alfalfa MMK2 MAP kinase, however, could complement mpk1 when expressed on its own (35Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Lloyd C. Chan J. Hirt H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, although it is a useful tool for examining interaction and activation of different members of the MAP kinase cascade, it is not clear whether complementation of the yeast mutant reflects functional conservation. Nevertheless, it may be significant that all plant MAP kinases that have complemented the mpk1 mutation to date belong to subgroup 2 of the plant MAP kinases (36Ligterink W. Hirt H. Results and Problems in Cell Differentiation. 27. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2000: 11-27Google Scholar). The MAP kinase MMK3 from alfalfa is closely related to p43Ntf6 and shows similar activation kinetics and localization and is expressed in actively dividing tissues (37Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S. Jonak C. Pollaschek C. Baker P. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Heberle-Bors E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The p43Ntf6 MAP kinase has been shown to be activated in late anaphase/telophase in synchronized cell suspension cultures (10Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we have shown here that the induction ofntf6 gene transcription occurs in a manner that follows the expression of a cell cycle-regulated gene, cycB, in leaves induced to re-enter the cell cycle. Both p43Ntf6 protein and activity measurements showed similar induction kinetics. The induction of NtMEK1 gene transcription is similar to ntf6and cycB induction, providing support for a role for NtMEK1 in activating p43Ntf6 in a cell cycle-regulated manner. In summary, a number of lines of evidence suggest that NtMEK1 is a MAPKK for p43Ntf6 and not p45Ntf4. (i) In a two-hybrid screen, three positive clones were isolated, all of them containing the NtMEK1 cDNA. (ii) p43Ntf6 was a much better in vitro substrate for NtMEK1. NtMEK1 only weakly phosphorylated the p45Ntf4 protein. (iii) NtMEK1 could activate p43Ntf6 in vivo, as shown by the complementation of a mpk1 mutant. This complementation depended on the presence of NtMEK1 and an active p43Ntf6kinase. p45Ntf4 could not complement mpk1. (iv) Both the NtMEK1 and ntf6 genes show similar expression patterns in plant tissues and after the induction of cell division. Thentf4 gene is expressed only in pollen and seeds (38Voronin, V., Touraev, A., Kieft, H., van Lammeren, A. A. M., Heberle-Bors, E., and Wilson, C. (2001) Plant Mol. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Future work on the activation and localization of NtMEK1 should provide further confirmation of the specificity of NtMEK1 for p43Ntf6. We thank Andrew J. Waskiewicz and Jonathan A. Cooper for helpful comments during the realization of the work."

These functions involve both the interaction of RPA with other proteins and binding to DNA. The equilibrium DNA binding affinity of RPA has been well characterized for single-stranded DNA substrates and reveals a sequence and length dependence. RPA displays a higher affinity for pyrimidine-rich DNA versus purine-rich DNA sequences, and RPA displays an increased affinity as DNA length increases (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). RPA duplex DNA binding has been observed but appears to be a result of DNA denaturation and the subsequent binding to the single-stranded structure of the DNA (2Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hubscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RPA has also been shown to preferentially bind to duplex-damaged DNA compared with undamaged DNA (4Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This preferential binding correlated well with the ability of RPA to denature the duplex-damaged DNA (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whether RPA can actually bind duplex DNA without denaturing the duplex structure remains to be determined. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the major cellular pathway for removing bulky DNA adduct damage and helps maintain genomic stability. NER involves multiple protein components and is divided into four distinct steps. These steps include damage recognition, incision, displacement, and resynthesis and ligation. The rate-limiting step of NER is the recognition of the damaged DNA (7Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 8Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15915-15918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This recognition process is poorly understood in eukaryotes but appears to involve the RPA, XPA, XPC·hHR23B, and potentially the XPE proteins (7Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

Slower rates of repair were observed when XPC·hHR23B was the first protein to bind the damaged DNA while preincubation of the RPA·XPA complex with damaged DNA resulted in faster repair, consistent with the RPA·XPA complex initiating repair (15Wakasugi M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18759-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data extend this model and suggest that, once localized denaturation occurs at the damaged DNA site, RPA binds to the undamaged DNA strand to protect this strand from incision and directs the XPG and XPF·ERCC1 proteins to cleave the damaged DNA strand 3′ and 5′, respectively (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This model is also supported by RPA binding polarity and the positions of the known protein·protein interactions (14He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J.

The biochemical process of distinguishing damaged DNA from the vast background of undamaged DNA still remains to be elucidated, because the affinities of the individual proteins for damaged DNA cannot account for the preference required. It appears that DNA adducts that distort the duplex DNA structure to the greatest degree are repaired more efficiently than those adducts that cause the least distortion (7Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 22Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protein components of NER may recognize the thermal instability of the duplex DNA structure created by the DNA adduct and initiate repair (23Gunz D. Hess M. Naegeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25089-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DNA adducts that cause the greatest distortion may only require the RPA·XPA complex, whereas non-distorting lesions may require the XPC·hHR23B protein followed by the recruitment of the RPA·XPA complex. Transcription coupled repair may also play a role in the repair of non-distorting adducts, which may help the coordinated action of the XPC·hHR23B and RPA·XPA proteins to account for the discrimination required for the DNA repair process. Understanding the kinetics of the protein factors in damaged DNA binding should provide insight into the mechanism of DNA damage recognition. Here, we report the use of a stopped-flow fluorescence assay to measure the pre-steady-state kinetics of RPA binding to various DNA substrates. The fluorescence assay relies on the intrinsic fluorescence of RPA and subsequent “quenching” when RPA binds to a DNA substrate (24Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25Kim C. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2058-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RPA displays a decreased kon and increasedkoff for a duplex substrate containing a 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct compared with a duplex containing a 1,3d(GXG) cisplatin-DNA adduct. In support of RPA binding to the undamaged DNA strand during NER, we show that RPA displays a decreased rate of association and an increased rate of dissociation for a single-stranded DNA substrate containing a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct compared with the undamaged DNA. The difference in affinity for DNA length appears to be manifested mainly from a difference in the rate of dissociation, koff. The kon for pyrimidine-rich sequences was determined to be near diffusion-limited but was reduced by a factor greater than 10 for a purine-rich DNA sequence of the same length. These results will be discussed with respect to DNA damage recognition and nucleotide excision repair. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), including the 5′-fluorescein-labeled DNA. All oligonucleotides were purified by 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea preparative sequencing gel electrophoresis. Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), and mung bean nuclease was purchased from Life Technologies Inc. The SP5.2 DNA sequence is 5′-GGGGAAGGAAGAGGCCAAGAAGGAGAGGGG-3′. Recombinant RPA was purified as described using the expression vector kindly provided by Marc Wold with the following modifications (26Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the RPA purification, protein was monitored via absorbance at 280 nm, and RPA DNA binding activity was assessed in EMSAs using labeled dT30 ssDNA. The supernatant from 2 liters of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced culture (15 ml) was applied to a 20-ml Affi-gel blue column equilibrated in HI buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% inositol) (26Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1 m KCl. The column was sequentially washed with HI buffer containing 0.8 m KCl and 0.5 m NaSCN. RPA was eluted with HI buffer containing 1.5m NaSCN. The peak fractions (30 ml) were pooled based on the absorbance at 280 nm and applied directly to a 5-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in HI buffer. After washing with HI buffer, RPA was eluted in HI buffer containing 100 mm potassium Pi. The DNA binding pool of RPA (15 ml) was loaded onto a 2-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in HI buffer and washed with HI buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. RPA was eluted with HI buffer using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 m KCl. The peak fractions of RPA were pooled and dialyzed in HI buffer. Platination reactions were performed as previously described (5Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, the SP10.2 DNA substrate (5′-TTTTTTGGTTTTTTT-3′) was either left undamaged or treated at a 3:1 molar ratio of cisplatin to GG sites in buffer containing 1 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.5) and 3 mm NaCl at a maximum concentration of 1 pmol/μl DNA for about 20 h at 37 °C in the dark. The platinated substrate was purified on a 18% preparative sequencing gel to separate the undamaged DNA from the DNA reacted with cisplatin and eluted and ethanol-precipitated (27Patrick S.M. Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The duplex cisplatin-damaged 1,2d(GpG) and 1,3d(GXG) 30-bp DNA substrates were purified as previously described to ensure 100% platination and less than 1% single-stranded DNA contamination (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow kinetic traces were obtained using a SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics). Equal volumes of RPA and DNA in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 from separate syringes were rapidly mixed at 24 °C. Fluorescence was measured following excitation at 290 nm (0.5 mm slit width) using a 350-nm long-pass cut-on filter (LG-350 from Corion, Franklin, MA). Constant RPA (6.25 nm final concentration) and varying DNA concentrations (31.25–200 nm) starting at a 5-fold excess of DNA were used to achieve pseudo-first order kinetics (28Fierke C.A. Hammes G.G. Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-35Google Scholar). The traces depicted for each concentration of DNA represents the average of 8–12 individual shots. The kinetic data were fit using Pro-K software (Applied Photophysics) to calculate the observed rate,kobs. The single-stranded DNA data fit to a single-exponential decay. Assuming a simple mechanism of single-stranded DNA binding, RPA + DNA ⇔ RPA·DNA then,kobs = kon [DNA] +koff, where the slope is the bimolecular association rate, kon, and they-intercept is the rate of dissociation,koff (28Fierke C.A. Hammes G.G. Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-35Google Scholar). The individual points on each graph represent the average and standard deviation of a minimum of three independent experiments. Rate constants were determined by linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel). The data are presented in Table I as the average and standard error of the fit of each line. Nearly identical values were obtained when each experiment was graphed independently, and rate constants were calculated and then the average and standard deviation calculated (analysis not shown). Results obtained for RPA-binding duplex DNA fit to a double-exponential decay. Both the fast and slow phase of RPA binding to the duplex DNA substrate were plotted versus DNA concentration to obtain rate constants. To confirm the calculated koffvalues, RPA was prebound to a 5′-fluorescein-labeled DNA at room temperature. The complex was then mixed with an excess of single-stranded unlabeled competitor DNA, typically 100–500 nm dT30. The reactions were excited at 495 nm, and emission was monitored using a 530-nm long-pass cut-on filter (OG 530 from Edmund Industrial Optics, Barrington, NJ). RPA binding to the fluorescein-labeled DNA resulted in either an increase or decrease in fluorescence dependent on DNA length and sequence. The change in fluorescence as RPA dissociated from the fluorescein-labeled DNA was monitored over time and was used to calculate thekoff. The experimentally determinedkoff values were consistent with the positivey-intercept values obtained using shorter DNA substrates. For the single-stranded platinated SP10.2 DNA and the duplex substrates, the y-intercept value determined from thekon experiments was used as thekoff value. For Table I, theKD values were calculated using thekon values and either thekoff values determined experimentally or from the y-intercept values using the following equation:KD =koff/kon (28Fierke C.A.

Here, we have employed the quenching of RPAs intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon binding DNA to analyze the kinetics of the interaction with DNA. We have previously shown that RPA preferentially binds to duplex DNA containing cisplatin intra-strand DNA adducts over undamaged DNA (5Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also showed that RPA displayed better binding to DNA containing the 1,3d(GXG) cisplatin-DNA adduct than DNA with the 1,2d(GpG) adduct (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This binding is consistent with the distortion in the duplex structure generated by the two different types of cisplatin-DNA adducts (32Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 33van Garderen C.J. van Houte L.P. Euro. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To assess the kinetics of RPA binding to duplex DNA containing both types of cisplatin adducts, stopped-flow analysis was performed using duplex DNA substrates containing either a single 1,2d(GpG) or 1,3d(GXG) adduct. The quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of constant amounts of RPA was monitored over time at a variety of DNA concentrations. The excitation wavelength was set at 290 nm, and the emission was monitored via a 350-nm cut-on filter. All reactions were performed in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm MgCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Fig.1 A reveal a DNA-dependent fluorescence quenching effect with the duplex DNA substrate containing a 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct. Control traces with buffer or DNA alone were performed and were identical (data not shown). The traces presented in each figure represent the fluorescence above this baseline value. The trace obtained with RPA alone (top trace) provides the initial fluorescence from which quenching was monitored. Each trace was fit to a double-exponential decay (thick line), and the residual values were presented in the panel beneath each trace. The data were not consistent with a single-exponential decay (not shown). Fig. 1 B represents the trace of RPA with duplex DNA containing a 1,3d(GXG) cisplatin-DNA adduct. Again, the top trace was obtained with RPA alone, and the bottom tracewas obtained by mixing RPA with DNA. The observed rate of quenching, kobs, for the fast phase of quenching was plotted versus the DNA concentration for both the 1,2d(GpG) (open circles) and the 1,3d(GXG) (filled circles) DNA adducts. The results revealed a linear relationship with the slope being equal to thekon and the y-intercept equal to thekoff (Fig.2 A) (28Fierke C.A. Hammes G.G. Purich D.L. Contemporary Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism. Academic Press, New York1996: 1-35Google Scholar, 29Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thekon for the duplex 1,2d(GpG) DNA substrate was 0.022 ± 0.002 nm−1 s−1, and the koff was 3.39 ± 0.55 s−1. The kon for the duplex 1,3d(GXG) DNA substrate was 0.062 ± 0.004 nm−1 s−1with a koff of 2.21 ± 0.26 s−1. The calculated KD values (TableI) for the two substrates reveal more than a 4-fold difference in affinity. The konfor the duplex undamaged DNA substrate was 0.013 ± 0.002 nm−1 s−1 with akoff of 9.48 ± 0.41 s−1, which provides about a 5-fold difference in KD value between the duplex undamaged and 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA substrates (data not shown). The data suggest a slower association rate and faster dissociation rate for the duplex undamaged DNA compared with the cisplatin-damaged DNA substrates, consistent with preferential binding of RPA to duplex damaged DNA (5Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The data also demonstrate a faster association and slower dissociation of RPA for the duplex 1,3d(GXG) substrate compared with the duplex 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA substrate. This is consistent with the distortion in the duplex generated by the 1,3d(GXG) cisplatin-DNA adduct, which causes about a 2–4 base localized denaturation, whereas the 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct causes no disruption in the hydrogen bonds but decreases the melting temperature of the duplex by 9 °C (32Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 33van Garderen C.J. van Houte L.P. Euro. J.

The single-stranded structure in the duplex 1,3d(GXG) DNA substrate most likely promotes the faster association and slower dissociation of RPA compared with the 1,2d(GpG) adduct. The observed rate constants for the slow phase (ks ) of RPA quenching were also plotted versus DNA concentration (Fig. 2 B) and, similar to the fast phase, the rate increased with DNA concentration. We considered a general two step process where RPA binding to DNA is followed by an isomerization of the complex such that increased quenching is observed in Model 1 (represented by Reaction 1) as follows.RPA+dsDNA⇔k−1k1RPA·dsDNA⇔k−sksRPA·dsDNA*REACTION 1This model predicts a hyperbolic curve ofkobs versus DNA concentration and the data were fit to Eq. 1 (35Fersht A.R. Requena Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).kobs=k−s+ks[DNA]KD+[DNA]Equation 1 Analysis revealed ks values of 2.27 s−1 for DNA containing a 1,3d(GXG) and 0.27 s−1 for DNA containing the 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin adduct. This demonstrates that the second transformation is faster for the DNA containing a 1,3 d(GXG) adduct. The k-s values obtained were near zero, indicating a negligible reverse reaction. To confirm the model, the individual traces were modeled using ProK software (Applied Photophysics). The analysis revealed a poor fit of the individual traces (data not shown). Therefore, we considered a more complex model that would still be consistent with a double-exponential fit of the data. Considering the data demonstrating that RPA can completely denature duplex DNA molecules and the irreversible nature of the second step, these processes were incorporated in the model.RPA+dsDNA⇔k−1k1RPA·dsDNA→k2RPA·ssDNA+ssDNAssDNA+RPA⇔k−3k3RPA·ssDNAREACTION 2Model 2 (represented by Reaction 2) involves the irreversible denaturation of double-stranded DNA to generate an RPA·ssDNA complex and free single-stranded DNA. The free single-stranded DNA can then bind a second molecule of RPA. The denaturation step was modeled as a transparent reaction with no change in fluorescence, and the binding of the second molecule of RPA to the free single-stranded DNA gives the same degree of tryptophan quenching. The values ofks and k−s obtained from the double-exponential fit of the data are therefore a combination ofk2, k3, andk−3 from the new model. Fitting the data to Model 2 revealed that the denaturation step was extremely slow and a rapid third step, which represents binding of RPA to the single-stranded DNA. Therefore, the values of ksrepresent the rate of denaturation, because this limits the final step of binding of the second molecule of RPA. This result is consistent with the decreased thermal stability of the 1,3d(GXG) compared with the 1,2d(GG) cisplatin adduct, and our previous results demonstrating RPA binding correlates with the ability to denature duplex DNAs (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analysis of the individual traces using Model 2 yielded excellent fits, which were indistinguishable from fitting the data to the simple A>B>C double-exponential model that was used to generate kobs values for each trace. In addition, plots of the residual values obtained using Model 2 indicated an excellent overall fit of the data (data not shown). Previously, we have shown that RPA binding is inhibited on a 24-mer single-stranded cisplatin-damaged DNA substrate compared with the undamaged DNA substrate (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of cisplatin on the kinetics of RPA binding, stopped-flow kinetic analysis was performed using a single-stranded 15-base pyrimidine-rich DNA substrate (SP10.2) in the presence or absence of a 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (Fig. 3 A). The kinetic trace of RPA binding the single-stranded damaged DNA is presented and illustrates a DNA-dependent fluorescence-quenching effect (the top trace represents the RPA alone, and thebottom trace is the RPA mixed with the DNA). Fig.3 B shows the graph of the kobsplotted versus DNA concentration for the undamaged (filled circles) and cisplatin-damaged DNA (open circles). The kon for the undamaged DNA was determined to be 1.71 ± 0.08 nm−1s−1 with a y-intercept orkoff of 1.57 ± 9.5 s−1. The cisplatin-damaged DNA resulted in a kon of 0.75 ± 0.04 nm−1 s−1 and akoff of 23.1 ± 4.2 s−1. The cisplatin adduct results in a rate of association ∼2.5 times slower and dissociates significantly faster when compared with the undamaged DNA, resulting in an approximate 20-fold difference inKD. This data supports our previous model that RPA binds the undamaged DNA strand during NER (6Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14972-14978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Considering the large error in the koff value obtained for the undamaged pyrimidine-rich single-stranded DNA, the value was determined using the dissociation kinetics experiments described under “Expe"

A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The cadA gene encodes a P-type ATPase that has been shown to transport Cd(II), Zn(II), and Pb(II) (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cadC gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that is a member of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins (6Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metalloregulation of Soft Metal Resistance Pumps: Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Google Scholar). When expressed in S. aureus, CadC responds to metals (7Corbisier P. Ji G. Nuyts G. Mergeay M. Silver S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 8Tauriainen S. Karp M. Chang W. Virta M. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1998; 13: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In contrast, induction of the cad operonin vivo by cadmium or zinc was difficult to observe inEscherichia coli, which is intrinsically resistant to those metals. We have shown that resistance in E. coli is caused by expression of the chromosomally encoded zntA gene, and azntA-disrupted strain exhibits increased sensitivity to zinc, cadmium, and lead (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The disruption has been used as a background strain for examining cadC function in E. coli. In that study CadC was shown to respond to soft metals with the order of effectiveness Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II). Here we investigate the role of cysteine residues in metal ion selectivity by CadC. CadC contains five cysteines at residues 7, 11, 52, 58, and 60. Each was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The effect of the substitutions on activity in E. coli andin vitro was examined. None of the cysteine residues was required for repression in vivo or for binding to thecad promoter in vitro. Neither Cys-11 nor Cys-52 seems to be required for soft metal recognition by CadC. Substitution of Cys-7, Cys-58, or Cys-60 resulted in loss of soft metal-dependent regulation by CadC both in vivoand in vitro. The results suggest that these three residues are involved in sensing Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Cells of E. coli were grown in LB medium (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (40 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (80 μg/ml), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase (80 μg/ml) were added as required. For determination of metal ion responsiveness, a basal salts medium was used (10Poole R.K. Williams H.D. Downie J.A. Gibson F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1865-1874PubMed Google Scholar) with the omission of zinc salts. Growth was monitored from the absorbance at 600 nm. A 406-nucleotide base pair (bp)1 fragment from plasmid pYPK11 (11Yoon K.P. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7636-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the plasmid pI258 cadC gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (12Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega), generating plasmid pMW0. The entire cadC gene was sequenced using a Pharmacia Cy5-labeled autosequence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an ALFexpress apparatus using the method of Sanger et al. (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52207) Google Scholar) to confirm that mutations had not been introduced during amplification. A 393-bp NdeI-PstI fragment then was isolated from pMW0 and ligated into the plasmid pT7–7 that had been digested with NdeI and PstI. A 448-bpXbaI-HindIII fragment, which includes both the ribosome-binding site from pT7–7 and cadC, was isolated from pMW0 and ligated into the plasmid pET-28a (Novagen) that was digested with XbaI and HindIII, generating plasmid pMW1. Plasmid pMW1 was transformed into E. coliHMS174(DE3) (14Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4767) Google Scholar) for protein expression. In this plasmid,cadC is under the control of the T7lac promoter, which is repressed by a lacI gene, and induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Production of CadC was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 18% acrylamide gels (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205394) Google Scholar). The amount of CadC was estimated by Western blot analysis. Purified CadC was used to produce a polyclonal rabbit antiserum by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The proteins were transferred overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 25 V and probed with a polyclonal antibody to CadC using anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the secondary antibody. Immunoblotting was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed on x-ray film at room temperature. Plasmid DNA was prepared with a Wizard DNA purification kit (Promega). Endo- and exonuclease digestions, DNA isolation, ligation, transformation, and Klenow fragment fill-in reactions were performed according to standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. Oligonucleotide-directed mutations in cadCwere introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). The 448-bp XbaI-HindIII fragment from pMW1 was subcloned into the pALTER™-1 vector (Promega), generating plasmid pMW2, and mutants were constructed using single-stranded DNA from pMW2. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire cadCgene. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54798) Google Scholar) using the ClustalW World Wide Web Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute. The gene for red-shifted green fluorescent protein (GFP) (17Delagrave S. Hawtin R.E. Silva C.M. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was used as a reporter for monitoring the regulatory properties of the cadC gene product. A 108-bp fragment from plasmid pYPK11 containing the pI258cad operator/promoter was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The fragment was engineered with EcoRI at the 5′ end and with a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The fragment was ligated into the plasmid pQF50/red-shifted GFP (18Lewis J.C. Daunert S. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that had been digested with EcoRI and BamHI, generating plasmid pYSG1, in which gfp is controlled by the cadoperator/promoter. A BglII-HindIII fragment from pMW1 was ligated into the vector plasmid pACYC184 that had been digested with BamHI and HindIII, generating plasmid pYSC1 (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, BglII-HindIII fragments from the pMW1 series plasmids containing mutantcadC genes were ligated into the pACYC184 (19Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that had been digested with BamHI and HindIII, generating the pYSCM series plasmids. All cadC genes were under the control of the T7 promoter. Cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)zntA::km (20Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) harboring compatible plasmids pYSG1 and pYSC1 or the pYSCM series were grown in LB medium and diluted 10-fold into a low phosphate minimal medium (10Poole R.K. Williams H.D. Downie J.A. Gibson F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1865-1874PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1% glucose plus the appropriate antibiotics. After 2 h at 37 °C, salts of soft metal ions were added to the indicated amounts followed by an additional 3 h of incubation at 37 °C. The samples then were diluted to A600 0.5 with the same medium. Expression from the cad promoter was quantified from the fluorescence of red-shifted GFP with an emission wavelength of 510 nm and excitation wavelength of 470 nm in an SLM8000 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity of GFP-containing cells was normalized to the fluorescence of cells carrying plasmids pYSG1 and pACYC184, which do not produce CadC. Wild-type CadC was produced in E. coli, either BL21(DE3) (Novagen) or HMS174(DE3), bearing plasmid pMW1. Cells were grown overnight in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 50-fold with fresh, prewarmed LB medium at 37 °C. AtA600 0.6–0.8, CadC expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. E. coli HMS174(DE3) was used for production of CadC mutant proteins using the same procedure as for the wild type. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT). The cells were suspended in 20 ml of buffer A and broken by a single pass through a French Press cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Membrane and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was fractionated by S-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1 m NaCl in buffer A. CadC-containing fractions were pooled, and DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Proteins were stored at −80 °C until use. From the intensity of staining with Coomassie Blue on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CadC was estimated to be ∼90% homogeneous. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm according to the methods of Gill and von Hippel (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5006) Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of 5,720 for wild-type CadC or 5,600 for single cysteine derivatives. The mass of CadC was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration. Wild-type CadC (2 μg) was applied to a Synchropak HPLC column (SynChrom, Inc.) equipped with a precolumn using a Waters HPLC. Samples were eluted with a degassed buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 m potassium acetate, and 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 1 ml/min. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ArsR-H6 (33 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and trypsin inhibitor (17 kDa) were used as standards (10 μg of each). Binding of regulatory proteins to promoters can be assayed by protection of the DNA from digestion by restriction enzymes (22Joachimiak A. Kelley R.L. Gunsalus R.P. Yanofsky C. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ability of CadC to protect the single SspI site in the cad promoter from SspI digestion was assayed in a total volume of 20 μl. The assay mixture contained 5 μm purified CadC, 8 units of SspI, 0.5 μg of purified plasmid pYSG1 in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm KCl. Deprotection was examined by the addition of the indicated amounts of salts of soft metals. At the concentrations used, the metals did not inhibit SspI activity. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, after which they were mixed with 4 μl of 6× sample solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, and 40% (w/v) sucrose in H2O) and electrophoresed on 1.4% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V for 60 min at 23 °C. After electrophoresis the gels were soaked in 1 mm MgSO4 for 20 min at 23 °C to remove excess ethidium bromide and photographed on a transilluminator using a Kodak DC120 scientific digital system. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry using UN-SCAN-ITTM gel (Silk Scientific, Inc.). Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) is a chemical modifying reagent that reacts specifically with cysteine residues in proteins (23Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It forms the smallest possible disulfide derivative and thus is considered to perturb protein structure minimally. CadC (50 μm) was reacted with 2 mm MMTS in a buffer consisting of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.25 mm DTT for 5 min at 23 °C. MMTS modification was reversed by addition of 5 mm DTT for 5 min at 23 °C. The effect of MMTS was determined using the SspI restriction site protection assay as described above. We have demonstrated previously that CadC repression of the plasmid pI258cad operator/promoter can be relieved by the addition of Pb(II), Cd(II), or Zn(II) (in order of effectiveness) (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Derepression required expression in a zntA-disrupted strain, which is unable to pump those soft metals out of the cytosol. In that study alacZ gene was used as a reporter. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity requires permeabilization of the cells. In contrast, GFP fluorescence is noninvasive and can be assayed in vivo. For these assays a two-plasmid system was used. One plasmid contained a gfp gene under control of the cadpromoter. The second plasmid had a wild-type or mutant cadCgene behind the T7 promoter. Although transcription of the T7 polymerase is under lac promoter control, there was sufficient basal level CadC expression to repress GFP in the absence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig.1 A). In vivo soft metal responsiveness was estimated from the amount of GFP fluorescence after growth in the presence of varying concentrations of Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II) (Fig. 1 A). Each value represents the mean of three separate experiments, with the standard deviation shown by the error bars. Pb(II) was the most effective with half-maximal derepression at 0.1 μmPb(OAc)2. About 10-fold more Zn(II) was required. Although Cd(II) derepressed, the response to Cd(II) was difficult to quantify because growth of the zntA-disrupted strain was much slower in the presence of Cd(II) than the other two metals. Addition of other soft metals including Ni(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), and As(III) did not produce an increase in gfp expression (data not shown). It should be emphasized that the added metal ion concentrations may not be the same as the cytosolic concentrations. The free intracellular concentration may be influenced by the rates of uptake, binding, and efflux so that quantitative comparisons among the metals should be made with caution. CadC has five cysteines at residues 7, 11, 52, 58, and 60 (Fig. 2). In the homologous plasmid R773 ArsR repressor, Cys-32 and Cys-34 have been shown to be required for derepression by As(III) or Sb(III), where the thiolates form part of the three-coordinate metalloid binding site (24Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsR residues Cys-32 and Cys-34 correspond to Cys-58 and Cys-60 in CadC. To investigate the possibility that cysteine thiols are ligands to Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II) in CadC, each of the cysteine codons was mutated to glycine. CadCs with glycine substitutions were able to repress expression of the gfp reporter from thecad promoter, except for the C58G CadC. However, a C58S CadC was able to repress and was used for subsequent studies. Because the C7G, C11G, C52G, C58S, and C60G mutants repressed expression, their ability to respond to the addition of Pb(II) (Fig.1 B) or Zn(II) (Fig. 1 C) to the growth medium was examined. Although each curve in Fig. 1, B and C, represents the results of a single experiment, each experiment was repeated 2–6 times with equivalent results. The Cys-11 mutation had no effect on metal responsiveness, and there was only a small effect of the Cys-52 mutation. In contrast, the Cys-7 and Cys-58 mutations exhibited a significant decrease in the ability to respond to either Pb(II) or Zn(II). The C60G mutant was unresponsive to either soft metal. Although it is possible that the mutations could have produced conformational changes in CadC that are only indirectly related to metal binding, these results suggest that Cys-7, Cys-58, and Cys-60, but not Cys-11 or Cys-52, are involved in metal sensing. To investigate the DNA- and metal-binding properties of CadC, the repressor was expressed and purified from E. coli as described under “Materials and Methods.” CadC purified as a homodimer, and no evidence of monomer was observed upon molecular sieve chromatography (data not shown). This is consistent with the reported dimerization of the homologous ArsR (25Xu C. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15734-15738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and SmtB (26Kar S.R. Adams A.C. Lebowitz J. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15343-15348Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CadC was present as both monomer and dimer (data not shown). If the amount of β-mercaptoethanol was increased to 1 m, the protein migrated predominately as a monomer (data not shown). Thus CadC is a noncovalent homodimer that can form disulfide bonds in vitro. The ability of purified CadC to bind to DNA containing thecad operator was measured by an enzyme protection assay (22Joachimiak A. Kelley R.L. Gunsalus R.P. Yanofsky C. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid pYSG1 has only a single HindIII site, so digestion with that enzyme generates a single restriction fragment of 4.6 kbp (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The plasmid has two SspI sites, one of which is located within the 108-bp cad operator/promoter fragment and the other in the vector. Digestion with SspI generates two restriction fragments of 3.6 and 1 kbp (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 7). In the presence of purified CadC, pYSG1 was cut only once by SspI (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 8). Protection from SspI digestion was specific for CadC; neither ArsR nor bovine serum albumin protected thecad DNA from SspI (data not shown). When Pb(II) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 9), Cd(II) (Fig.3 A, lane 5), or Zn(II) (Fig. 3 A,lane 6) was added, SspI digestion was again observed. This deprotection is consistent with the ability of these metals to alter the binding of CadC to the promoter. Hg(II), which we previously reported to act as a weak inducer of the cadoperon (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), also reduced CadC protection (Fig. 3 A,lane 14). Ni(II), Co(II), As(III), or Sb(III) had little or no effect on CadC protection (Fig. 3 A, lanes 10–13, respectively). Because other members of the ArsR family bind these metals, it was important to demonstrate that CadC does not respond to them in vitro. The effect of Pb(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II) was quantified (Fig. 3 B). In vitro, each of the three was nearly equally effective, varying only about 2-fold in contrast to the in vivo results, in which Pb(II) was 10-fold more effective than Zn(II). Each value represents the mean of three separate experiments, with the standard deviation shown by theerror bars. As mentioned above, one possible reason for the differences between in vivo and in vitro results may be that the metals are accumulated differentially or bound in vivo. The effect of the cysteine-modifying reagent MMTS on CadC protection of cad DNA and metal-induced deprotection was determined. MMTS converts cysteine residues to Cys–S–S–CH3 (23Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Addition of the small thiomethyl group should not greatly perturb protein structure. After reaction with MMTS, CadC exhibited the same protection from SspI digestion as the untreated protein (Fig.4 A), demonstrating that this chemical modification of CadC did not prevent DNA binding. However, the ability of Pb(II) to deprotect was lost. The disulfide formed with MMTS can be reduced quantitatively with DTT to regenerate the free cysteine thiolate. When MMTS-treated CadC was reduced with DTT, the repressor exhibited the same deprotection with Pb(II) as the untreated protein. These results are consistent with a role for cysteine thiolates in soft metal binding. Each of the five cysteine-substituted CadC proteins, C7G, C11G, C52G, C58S, and C60G, was purified, and their DNA-binding properties were examined (Fig. 4, B–D). Each was produced in normal amounts in the cytosol, suggesting that the mutations did not alter the structure appreciably. None of the mutations affected the ability of the purified CadCs to bind to cad DNA as determined by protection from SspI digestion. The C11G and C52G proteins responded nearly the same as the wild type to the addition of Pb(II) (Fig. 4 B), Cd(II) (Fig. 4 C), or Zn(II) (Fig. 4 D). The C7G and C58S proteins required considerably more soft metal for deprotection, and the C60G protein was nearly unresponsive to metals. Although each curve in Fig. 4represents the results of a single experiment, each experiment was repeated 2–6 times with equivalent results. Thus, the in vitro DNA-binding properties of the proteins were consistent with the in vivo effects of the mutations, suggesting that Cys-7, Cys-58, and Cys-60, but not Cys-11 or Cys-52, participate in soft metal binding. The ArsR family is a rapidly growing set of repressor proteins involved in transcriptional regulation of an assortment of unrelated types of soft metal resistances (6Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metalloregulation of Soft Metal Resistance Pumps: Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Google Scholar), including P-type ATPases (4Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), ArsAB pumps (27Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and metallothionines (28Gupta A. Whitton B.A. Morby A.P. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At last count, 24 homologues in bacteria and 18 in archaea have been identified. These repressors fall into several groups: ArsR repressors are As(III)/Sb(III)-responsive (29Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); CadC repressors are Pb(II)/Cd(II)/Zn(II)-responsive (5Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Corbisier P. Ji G. Nuyts G. Mergeay M. Silver S. FEMS Microbiol.

Bioelectron. 1998; 13: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); and SmtB/ZiaR repressors are Zn(II)-responsive (30Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). What is the molecular basis of metal ion sensing and selectivity in members of the ArsR family? The ions that derepress are all ions of soft Lewis acids, so it is likely ligands would be soft Lewis bases, which include the thiolates of cysteine residues and the imidazole nitrogens of histidines. An alignment of nine putative CadC proteins, ArsR, ZiaR, and SmtB identifies a number of conserved residues in some or all proteins (Fig. 2). Cys-7, Cys-58, and Cys-60 of the pI258 CadC are conserved in all CadCs. In the present study, mutagenesis of the three conserved cysteine residues is shown to result in loss of sensing soft metal ions in vivo and for deprotection of CadC fromcad operator DNA in vitro. Cys-11 and Cys-52, which are not conserved in all CadC proteins, are not required. These results are consistent with coordination of the three cysteine thiolates with Pb(II), Cd(II), or Zn(II). Two of the three are equivalent to thiols involved in As(III) and Sb(III) sensing by the plasmid R773 ArsR. Cys-58 and Cys-60 correspond to Cys-32 and Cys-34 of ArsR, both of which are required for As(III) and Sb(III) derepression and binding by ArsR (24Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZiaR, which is related more closely to SmtB than to CadC, has two cysteines at residues 71 and 73 that correspond to the CXC motifs of ArsR and CadC. A C71S/C73S double mutant is nonresponsive to Zn(II), indicating that one or both cysteine residues are involved in Zn(II) sensing by ZiaR (31Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SmtB does not have a CXC motif; the SmtB residue corresponding to Cys-60 of CadC is Gly-63. Furthermore, the SmtB residue corresponding to Cys-60 of CadC is Cys-61, and a C61S mutant is not defective in zinc sensing (30Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, theCXC motif seems widely but not universally utilized in metal sensing. How could metal binding at a CXC site of CadC or ArsR result in transcription? We modeled the structure of the ArsR homodimer (32Xu C. Zhou T. Kuroda M. Rosen B.P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) on the crystal structure of the SmtB aporepressor (33Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the model, the DNA-binding domain would be composed of helix 1 (residues 33–40)-turn (residues 41–43)-helix 2 (residues 44–55). In metallated ArsR, Cys-32, Cys-34, and Cys-37 form a three-coordinate site for As(III) or Sb(III), where the three sulfur atoms must be within 3.2–3.5 Å of each other (24Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, from the model of the ArsR aporepressor, this would not be possible without distortion of helix 1. If binding of metals to ArsR or CadC disrupts helix 1, the repressor would no longer be able to bind to DNA and would dissociate, allowing RNA polymerase to bind and transcription to proceed. However, the CXC motif cannot account for selectivity if it is utilized for both As(III)/Sb(III)- and Pb(II)/Zn(II)/Cd(II)-responsive repressors. In ArsR, the third ligand to As(III), Cys-37, is not present in CadC. From the present results, it seems that Cys-7 of CadC is involved in Pb(II)/Zn(II)/Cd(II) sensing, and this residue has no counterpart in ArsR. Cys-14 in SmtB and Cys-20 in ZiaR may correspond to Cys-7 of CadC (Fig. 2), and Cys-14 and Cys-20 are required for zinc sensing in the respective repressors (30Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It seems likely that this conserved cysteine residue contributes to the selectivity of CadC, ZiaR, and SmtB. Our data are consistent with a model in which 1) Cys-7, Cys-58, and Cys-60 are metal ligands in CadC, and 2) Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) share a common binding site. However Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) can be four-coordinate or higher, which implies that there could be additional protein residues involved in metal binding. Studies with SmtB suggest that oxygen and/or nitrogen ligands may be involved in Zn(II) binding (33Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A reasonable candidate for a fourth ligand in CadC is Asp-61, which is conserved as either an aspartate or glutamate in all identified members of the ArsR family. Asp-61 corresponds to Asp-64 of SmtB, which is a Hg(II) ligand in the crystal structure (33Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The quest for additional residues involved in metal sensing forms the basis of future studies on CadC.

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33601–33608). In this paper we report the results of CspB interactions with non-homogeneous ssDNA templates containing continuous and non-continuous stretches of T bases. The analysis of CspB-ssDNA interactions was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical centrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry. We show that (i) there is a strong correlation between the CspB affinity and stoichiometry and the T content in the oligonucleotide that is independent of which other bases are incorporated into the sequence of ssDNA; (ii) the binding properties of CspB to ssDNA templates with continuous or non-continuous stretches of T bases with similar T content is very similar, and (iii) the mechanism of interaction between CspB and the T-based non-homogeneous ssDNA is mainly through the bases (a stretch of three T bases located in the middle of the ssDNA templates makes the binding independent of the ionic strength). The biological relevance of these results to the role of CspB as an RNA chaperone is discussed.

The biological relevance of these results to the role of CspB as an RNA chaperone is discussed. cold shock protein untranslated region single-stranded DNA isothermal titration calorimetry The detailed mechanism by which living cells survive a cold shock remains controversial (1Inouye M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 191PubMed Google Scholar). It has been observed that in many bacteria cold shock is accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of a specific set of the so-called cold shock proteins (CSPs)1 (2Yamanaka K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar, 3Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). InBacillus subtilis the major CSP is a small acidic protein, CspB, whose induction increases dramatically when the temperature is down-shifted from 37°C to 15 °C (4Willimsky G. Bang H. Fischer G. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The first evidence of any activity of CspB was demonstrated using gel retardation experiments, and it was shown that CspB binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) containing the Y-box motif (ATTGG) (5Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Later, however, it was shown that CspB binding is not limited only to this sequence (7Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H. Schroder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol.

Several aromatic residues (Phe15, Phe17, Phe27, Phe30, Phe38, Trp8) and several basic amino acid residues (His29, Lys7, Lys13, Lys39, Arg56) have been proposed to be involved in the protein interaction with ssDNA (9Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the protein shows that these amino acid residues are located in the same side of the protein molecule (5Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, using four different techniques (gel shift mobility assays, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), analytical ultracentrifugation, and fluorescence spectroscopy), it was shown that CspB binds preferentially to polypyrimidine ssDNA (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CspB binding to poly(dC) and poly(dT) has different properties showing higher affinity for homogeneous T-based oligonucleotides with a binding site size of 6–7 T bases (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The analysis of such binding according to the Epstein model (10Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) showed that the CspB binding to T-based ssDNA template has high affinity (Ka ∼ 3 × 106m−1) and moderate cooperativity (ω ∼ 16). To further characterize the CspB binding to T-based ssDNA templates, two major questions must be answered. 1) How is CspB binding to continuous stretches of T bases affected by the presence of other bases in the oligonucleotide? 2) How is such a binding affected when the T bases form non-continuous stretches? To address these questions, we used fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical centrifugation, and isothermal titration calorimetry and measured the CspB binding properties to series of ssDNA (23-mers) in which the T bases were placed in the middle of the oligonucleotide (23CpTi, 23ApTi, and 23GpTi, where i = 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, and 17), forming a continuous stretch but varying its length. The results of these experiments were compared with the effect of non-continuous stretches of T bases, the effect of location of the T bases within short ssDNA template and the effect of the total length of the oligonucleotide on the CspB binding. In addition, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the CspB binding to non-homogeneous ssDNA template was investigated by comparing the binding profiles at high (1 m) and low (0.1 m) NaCl concentrations. Our results show that ssDNA binding properties of CspB are strongly correlated with the T-base content in the ssDNA templates. Indeed, ssDNA templates with similar T content have similar binding properties, independent of whether the T bases form continuous or non-continuous stretches. We also show that the forces involved in the CspB binding to most of the non-homogeneous T-based ssDNA template are not via electrostatic interactions of protein groups with the phosphate backbone because no difference in the binding profiles is observed under experimental conditions with different ionic strength. This implies that the interactions of CspB with non-homogeneous T-based ssDNA templates occur mainly through the bases. These observations combined with the sequence analysis of 5′-UTR of cold shock-inducible proteins suggests possible function of CspB as RNA chaperone. CspB was overexpressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,11Makhatadze G.I. Marahiel M.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2144-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 5,690m−1 cm−1(8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ssDNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Biosynthesis Inc. and purified as described previously (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ssDNA concentration was calculated considering the following extinction coefficients at 260 nm: 8400 m−1cm−1 (for T), 12010m−1 cm−1(for G), 7050 m−1cm−1 (for C), and 15,200m−1 cm−1(for A) (12Wallace R.B. Miyada C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The analytical centrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge. The runs were performed at 4 °C under two different speeds, 20,000 and 25,000 rpm, until equilibrium was achieved (usually >10 h). Absorbencies at 260 and 280 nm were recorded simultaneously for three cells. Each cell contained only ssDNA, CspB, or CspB-ssDNA complex. The ssDNA concentrations were 2 μm for 23ApT3 and 23ApT11 and 2.5 μm for 23CpT3, 23CpT7, and 23CpT11. The protein concentration was 20-fold higher than the ssDNA concentration. The CspB-ssDNA complex concentration was the same as in the other cells. To allow for the complex formation, the protein was incubated with the ssDNA at room temperature for 25 min prior to each run. The partial specific volume for the protein, ssDNA, and complex were 0.74, 0.55, and 0.65 cm3/g, respectively and calculated as described previously (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC (Microcal Inc. Northampton, MA) instrument. The protein and ssDNA were dialyzed simultaneously in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl buffer. The protein concentration was usually between 10 and 15 μm. Typical concentrations of the ssDNA were between 85 and 135 μm. Series of several injections of 5 or 10 μl each of solution containing ssDNA template into ITC cells containing CspB were made until no further heat effect was observed. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting identical amounts of ssDNA into the ITC cell containing only buffer. The heat of the reaction was obtained by integration of the peak area after each injection of ssDNA solution, using ORIGIN software provided by the manufacturer. ΔHcal was calculated by summing the individual heats, corrected for the heats of dilution, and dividing by the total number of moles of CspB present in the ITC cell during the experiment. Detailed description of the ITC experiment has been reported previously (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CspB fluorescence intensity was measured using a FluoroMax spectrofluorometer with DM3000F software and thermostated cell holder connected to a circulating water bath. The equilibrium titrations were performed at low (0.3 μm) protein concentration in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 100 mm NaCl (low ionic strength) or 1 m NaCl (high ionic strength). Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 287 nm, and the emission was recorded at 349 nm. Stoichiometric titrations were performed at high protein concentration (14 μm) in low ionic strength buffer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 300 and 349 nm, respectively. All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the initial volume in the sealed quartz cell was 1.1 ml. Small aliquots of concentrated solutions of ssDNA were added into the cell containing solution of CspB. The solution in the cell was gently stirred during the titration and the intensity values were corrected by dilution; inner filter effect and blanks were subtracted. The equilibrium titration profiles, under conditions when only one molecule of CspB was bound to the ssDNA template, were fitted to Equation 1 (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Q=max([CspB]tot+[ssDNA]tot+1/Ka)-([CspB]tot+[ssDNA]tot+1/Ka)2-4[CspB]tot[ssDNA]tot2[CspB]totEquation 1 Q represents the quenching effect on the CspB Trp fluorescence after each addition of ssDNA, Qmaxis the maximal quenching obtained upon complete saturation of the protein with ssDNA, [CspB]tot and [ssDNA]tot are the total concentration of protein and ssDNA in solution, respectively, and Ka is the equilibrium association constant for the CspB-ssDNA interaction. Previously, using a combination of four different techniques, we showed that CspB seems to bind T-containing homogeneous ssDNA template with much higher affinity (Kd = 42 nm at 25 °C) than C-, G-, or A-containing 23-mer homogeneous ssDNA templates (13Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study we used hetero-ssDNA templates to investigate how the change in length of a T stretch flanked by other nucleotides (A, C, and G), the relative position of the T stretches within the template and continuous versus non-continuous stretches of T bases affect the thermodynamics of the CspB-ssDNA interactions. With few exceptions the ssDNA templates were 23 nucleotides long (Table I). CspB-ssDNA interactions were monitored using three different techniques: fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and analytical centrifugation.Table ISequence of the oligonucleotides used throughout this studyNameSequenceLengthNo. of TSalt effect1-aThe effect of 1 mNaCl on the titration profiles of CspB as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. +++, complete elimination of binding in high salt; ++, significant decrease of binding in high salt; +, detectable decrease of binding in high salt; −, no change of binding in high salt; ND, not determined; ND23pT5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT2323−23pC5′-CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC230+++23CpT15′-CCCCCCCCCCCTCCCCCCCCCCC231++23CpT25′-CCCCCCCCCCCTTCCCCCCCCCC232+23CpT35′-CCCCCCCCCCTTTCCCCCCCCCC233−23CpT55′-CCCCCCCCCTTTTTCCCCCCCCC235−23CpT75′-CCCCCCCCTTTTTTTCCCCCCCC237−23CpT115′-CCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCC2311−23CpT155′-CCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCC2315−23CpT175′-CCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCC2317−23GpT55′-GGGGGGGGGTTTTTGGGGGGGGG235ND23GpT75′-GGGGGGGGTTTTTTTGGGGGGGG237ND23GpT115′-GGGGGGTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGG2311ND23GpT155′-GGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGG2315ND23GpT175′-GGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGG2317ND23ApT35′-AAAAAAAAAATTTAAAAAAAAAA233ND1-150, not determined because of the possible formation of dsDNA.23ApT55′-AAAAAAAAATTTTTAAAAAAAAA235ND1-150, not determined because of the possible formation of dsDNA.23ApT75′-AAAAAAAATTTTTTTAAAAAAAA237ND1-150, not determined because of the possible formation of dsDNA.23ApT115′-AAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAA2311ND1-150, not determined because of the possible formation of dsDNA.23ApT155′-AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAA2315−23ApT175′-AAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAA2317−23CT25′-CCCCCCCCCATTGGCCCCCCCCC232++23CT45′-CCCCCCCCTATTGGTCCCCCCCC234ND23CT85′-CCCCCCTTTATTGGTTTCCCCCC238−23CT125′-CCCCTTTTTATTGGTTTTTCCCC2312NDT5C7T55′-TTTTTCCCCCCCTTTTT1710−T7C7T75′-TTTTTTTCCCCCCCTTTTTTT2114NDT9C7T95′-TTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTT2518NDT14C7T145′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTT3528NDT18C7T185′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT4336ND23pT6G5′-TTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGTTT236++23pT8G5′-TTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGTTTT238+23pT12G5′-TTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGTTTTTT2312−23pT16G5′-TTTTTTTTGGGGGGGTTTTTTTT2316−23pT18G5′-TTTTTTTTTGGGGGTTTTTTTTT2318−23pT20G5′-TTTTTTTTTTGGGTTTTTTTTTT2320−1-a The effect of 1 mNaCl on the titration profiles of CspB as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. +++, complete elimination of binding in high salt; ++, significant decrease of binding in high salt; +, detectable decrease of binding in high salt; −, no change of binding in high salt; ND, not determined; ND1-150 , not determined because of the possible formation of dsDNA. Open table in a new tab The changes in the protein intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is a widely used to monitor protein-DNA interactions (e.g. Refs. 14Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 15Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 424-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cold shock protein CspB has only one Trp residue that is located in the putative nucleic acid binding face of the protein (9Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of this Trp is dramatically quenched upon interaction with T-based ssDNA templates (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This quenching of CspB Trp fluorescence correlates with the degree of binding upon the CspB-ssDNA interactions (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (A–C) shows the quenching effects caused by non-homogeneous ssDNA templates 23CpTi, 23GpTi, and 23ApTi (i = 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, and 17; see Table I for sequences) on the CspB intrinsic Trp fluorescence. In all cases there is a shift in the titration profiles toward lower ssDNA concentrations as the number of T bases in ssDNA template increases. The difference in the binding competences, defined as [ssDNA]0.5, betweenXT3 and XT17, where X represents C, G, or A bases, is about 1 order of magnitude (from ∼4 × 10−7m to ∼6 × 10−8m, respectively). Comparing the three series of ssDNA templates (23CpTi, 23GpTi, and 23ApTi), it is clear that ssDNA templates with the same T content behave in very similar fashion in the 23CpTi and 23GpTi series (Fig. 1, Aand B). In fact, there is a good correspondence between the binding competences for the ssDNA templates with the same number of T bases in both series (Fig. 2). The correlation coefficient is 0.98, indicating that the interaction is independent of the presence of C or G bases surrounding the stretches of T. This result strongly indicates that the CspB interactions with these ssDNA templates are probably independent of three-dimensional structure of ssDNA in agreement with previous results (13Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Figure 2Comparison of the CspB binding competencies for 23CpTi (black bars) and 23GpTi (gray bars) series of ssDNA templates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The titration profiles of CspB with the 23ApTi template series are different than the ones obtained with the 23CpTi or 23GpTi series (Fig.1, compare C with A and B). The titration profiles for the ssDNA templates 23ApT3, 23ApT5, 23ApT7, and 23ApT11 overlap. This result can be explained considering that, in the 23ApTi series, some of the ssDNA templates have the ability to form double-stranded DNA due to the classical Watson-Crick base pairing, as will be further supported by the analytical centrifugation data (see below). However, ssDNA templates with larger number of T bases (23ApT15 and 23ApT17) do show an enhancement in binding, as seen by the decrease in the [ssDNA]0.5 as the stretch of T bases becomes longer (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the [ssDNA]0.5 and the T content in the template when the T bases are located in the middle of the ssDNA template and form a continuous stretch. Observed differences in [ssDNA]0.5 for different templates can arise from the changes in the affinity of binding and/or in the stoichiometry of the interaction. It must be noted that the ssDNA templates used in this study are not homogeneous and relatively short (most of them are 23-mer). Unfortunately, no rigorous mathematical model has been developed for the analysis of the titration profiles in which more than one molecule of protein binds to the short and heterogeneous matrix (14Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Lohman T.M. Mascotti D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical models available to date have been developed either for homogeneous and infinitely long linear templates (17McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2695) Google Scholar), or for homogeneous and short lattices (10Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or even homogeneous templates for which linearity between the signal change and the fractional saturation does not necessarily hold during the binding reaction, but not for short non-homogeneous templates (for reviews, see Refs. 14Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 16Lohman T.M. Mascotti D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We thus are not able to estimate the CspB/ssDNA binding affinities. We can, however, experimentally estimate the stoichiometry of the CspB binding to non-homogeneous ssDNA templates using analytical centrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry. For homogeneous ssDNA templates, it was shown that three CspB molecules bind to 23pT and only one CspB molecule binds to 23pC (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the templates used in present study are not homogeneous, and thus different stoichiometry among templates with different T-content is expected. The stoichiometry for several of the 23CpTi-CspB and 23ApTi-CspB complexes was determined by analytical centrifugation. The apparent molecular masses of the ssDNA, CspB, and the ssDNA-CspB complex were measured simultaneously in the same experiment. The results are summarized in Table II. Under our experimental conditions, the average molecular masses for the protein and the 23CpTi ssDNA (8.0 ± 0.4 and 7.1 ± 0.2 kDa, respectively) are in good correspondence with the expected values for monomeric species (7.5 and 6.9 kDa, respectively) (Fig.3 A). Considering the apparent molecular masses of the CspB:23CpTi complexes and individual species (Table II), we find that two molecules of CspB bind to 23CpT3, 23CpT7, and 23CpT11. Although this result is clear for the 23CpT7 and 23CpT11 templates, a lower value was obtained for 23CpT3 (the ratio CspB:23CpT3 is 1.5). Nevertheless, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (see below) support our conclusion that more than one molecule of CspB binds to 23CpT3. We can therefore conclude that the difference in binding competences observed in the equilibrium titration profiles from 23CpT3 to 23CpT11 (Fig. 1 A) is due to an increase in the protein effective binding affinity and not due to a change in the stoichiometry of the interaction. It is notable that the increase in effective binding affinity directly correlates with the T-content in the ssDNA.Table IIMolecular masses obtained by analytical centrifugation for the ssDNA, ssDNA-CspB complex, and CspBssDNAMass of ssDNAMass of complexMass of CspBStoichiometry NCpsB/ssDNAkDakDakDa23CpT36.9 ± 0.418.6 ± 0.68.0 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.323CpT77.3 ± 0.121.2 ± 0.48.0 ± 0.51.7 ± 0.323CpT117.1 ± 0.122.4 ± 0.58.0 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.323ApT36.2 ± 0.213.7 ± 0.88.0 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.323ApT1110.1 ± 0.116.6 ± 0.38.0 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.3The experimental conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The experimental conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” The calculated stoichiometries for 23ApT3 and 23ApT11 show that these oligonucleotides bind only one CspB molecule (Table II). This is not surprising for 23ApT3 because CspB does not bind to homogeneous A-based templates (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). So, if one molecule of CspB binds to the three T bases in 23ApT3, this will represent an “imperfect” binding because we have shown previously using 23pT template that the CspB binding site size is 6–7 bases long (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An imperfect binding should translate into a lower affinity of the protein for this ssDNA, as is observed experimentally (Fig. 1 C). When only one molecule of protein binds to the ssDNA template, the interaction is accurately described by the classical binding equation (see Equation 1, under “Materials and Methods”), and it has been used to describe the thermodynamics of binding in different protein-DNA systems (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Ferrari M.E. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). From the fit of the titration profile of CspB with ssDNA templates to Equation 1, the calculated equilibrium association constant (Ka) for CspB interaction with 23ApT3 is (4.3 ± 0.1) × 106m−1, which is indeed lower than the effective affinity for 23pT ∼5 × 107m−1 (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, 23ApT11 has enough T bases to bind one molecule of CspB with the same affinity as 23pT. Experimentally, however, we observe that the normalized titration curve for 23ApT11 overlaps with that for 23ApT3 (Fig. 1 C), indicating that 23ApT3 and 23AT11 have comparable affinities. The fit of the CspB:23ApT11 titration curve to Equation 1gives an equilibrium constant Ka of (4.4 ± 0.1) × 106m−1, identical to that of 23ApT3 but an order of magnitude lower than the effective affinity for 23pT. The reason why the CspB molecule bound to 23ApT11 presents lower affinity than expected seems to be related to the fact that this non-homogeneous template has the ability to form double-stranded DNA. Indeed, the measured molecular mass for the 23ApT11 template is higher than that predicted for the ssDNA (10.1 ± 0.1 kDa versus 6.8 kDa, respectively, Table II), indicating probably the presence of a significant population of double-stranded DNA under our experimental conditions. CspB does not have detectable affinity to double-stranded DNA (5Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, if at least part of the 23ApT11 forms double-stranded DNA via classical Watson-Crick A-T base pairing, the effective concentration of ssDNA will be overestimated and that would result in a lower apparent affinity, as is observed experimentally (Fig. 1 C). The stoichiometry of the CspB interaction with some of the oligonucleotides within the 23CpTi series was also studied using ITC. The protein solution (in the calorimetric cell) was titrated with the ssDNA (in the syringe) until no heat effects were observed. Under experimental conditions with high protein concentration (11–15 μm CspB in solution), we observe that the titration profiles are very steep and rapidly level off (Fig. 3 B), allowing determination of the stoichiometry of the interaction from the breaking point in the titration profile. The breaking point for the 23CpT15 template is ∼ 0.3, indicating that 3 molecules of CspB bind to 23CpT15. The titrations with 23CpT11 and 23CpT5 are shifted toward lower stoichiometry. The breaking point for the titrations of these two templates is at a ratio ssDNA/CspB ∼ 0.5, indicating that 2 molecules of CspB bind to 23CpT11 and 23CpT5 templates. Finally, the titration with 23CpT3 is not as sharp as the other ones; however, the curve could not be fitted according to Equation 1 using 1:1 stoichiometry of CspB/ssDNA complex (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that more than one molecule of protein binds to the 23CpT3 template and supports our conclusion based on the analytical centrifugation experiments that probably two CspB molecules bind to 23CpT3 template. The enthalpies of the interaction per binding site for these oligonucleotides were −105 ± 9 kJ/mol, comparable to the values obtained for 23pT, −119 ± 6 kJ/mol (8Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarity of the enthalpies of interactions with different T-based ssDNA templates suggests similar structural features for the CspB-ssDNA complexes. In summary, the stoichiometries for the CspB interaction with the 23CpTi oligonucleotides determined by analytical centrifugation and ITC are in good agreement. The results show that 23CpT3, 23CpT5, 23CpT7, and 23CpT11 bind two CspB molecules. Knowing that the Csp"

R., Ash, D. E., and Christianson, D. W., (1996) Nature383, 554–557). A key feature of this structure is a novel S-shaped oligomerization motif at the carboxyl terminus of the protein that mediates ∼54% of the intermonomer contacts. Arg-308, located within this oligomerization motif, nucleates a series of intramonomer and intermonomer salt links. In contrast to the trimeric wild-type enzyme, the R308A, R308E, and R308K variants of arginase exist as monomeric species, as determined by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation, indicating that mutation of Arg-308 shifts the equilibrium for trimer dissociation by at least a factor of 105. These monomeric arginase variants are catalytically active, with kcat/Km values that are 13–17% of the value for wild-type enzyme. The arginase variants are characterized by decreased temperature stability relative to the wild-type enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry shows that the midpoint temperature for unfolding of the Arg-308 variants is in the range of 63.6–65.5 °C, while the corresponding value for the wild-type enzyme is 70 °C.

Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) catalyzes the divalent cation-dependent hydrolysis of l-arginine to form l-ornithine and urea in the final step of urea biosynthesis. Liver arginase is one of the most important enzymes of mammalian nitrogen metabolism, since it comprises the principal route for disposal of excess nitrogen resulting from amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. The flux of nitrogen through this pathway is considerable, given that the average individual excretes about 10 kg of urea per year (1Ash D.E. Scolnick L.R. Kanyo Z.F. Vockley J.G. Cederbaum S.D. Christianson D.W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 64: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS1).

An R291X mutation has been identified that would lead to the production of a truncated protein lacking the final 32 amino acids at the C terminus of the 323 amino acid subunit. The hyperargininemia patient with this mutation has both low levels of arginase activity and low levels of immuno-cross-reactive material (1Ash D.E. Scolnick L.R. Kanyo Z.F. Vockley J.G.

This latter finding suggests that the R291X mutant may be characterized by decreased stability that results from loss of the S-shaped tail. This S-shaped tail appears to stabilize and maintain the native oligomeric state of the enzyme via a network of salt bridges nucleated by Arg-308. The Arg-308 residue forms an intramonomer salt bridge with Glu-262 and an intermonomer salt bridge with Asp-204 on the adjacent subunit (4Kanyo Z.F. Scolnick L.R. Ash D.E. Christianson D.W. Nature. 1996; 383: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region may impact the oligomeric structure and stability of the enzyme as well as its kinetic properties. The goal of the present study has been to utilize gel filtration, enzyme activity assays, EPR, analytical ultracentrifugation, differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and x-ray crystallography to elucidate the role of Arg-308, located at the S-shaped tail, in maintaining the overall oligomeric state and kinetic properties of rat liver arginase. l-[guanidino-14C]Arginine (specific activity 1.9 GBq mmol− 1) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from FisherBiotech.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and E. coli BL-21(DE3) competent cells were from Stratagene. The DNA purification kit used was from Qiagen. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Centricon-30 microconcentrators were obtained from Amicon. Ecoscint scintillation solution was from National Diagnostics. Dialysis tubing was purchased from BioDesign of New York, Inc. All other reagents were of highest quality commercially available. Using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, mutations of Arg-308 to alanine, glutamate, or lysine were performed using the following oligonucleotides as mutagenic primers: 5′-GTCTTGTTTTGGAACGAAAGCTGAAGGTAATCATAAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTTATGATTACCTTCAGCTTTCGTTCCAAAACAAGAC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, for the Arg-308 to alanine mutation. Wild-type 2Wild-type arginase refers to the recombinant rat liver enzyme expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. arginase cDNA in a pRSET-C T7-based expression vector (Invitrogen) was used as the DNA template for this site-directed mutagenesis procedure. The underlined codon, coding for arginine, was changed to GAA and TTC in the forward and reverse directions, respectively for the Arg-308 to glutamate mutation. For the Arg-308 to lysine mutation, the underlined codon was changed to AAA and TTT in the forward and reverse directions, respectively. The mutant constructs were used to transform BL-21(DE3) cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated for each mutant construct using a Qiagen kit and analyzed by restriction mapping with NdeI andPstI, enzymes known to have unique restriction sites located outside the arginase cDNA. Positive constructs for each of the R308A, R308E, and R308K mutants, which had been identified by restriction mapping, were sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Pennsylvania to verify that only the specifically introduced mutations were present and that no other mutations had been introduced during polymerase chain reaction. The constructs for the R308A, R308E, and R308K arginase variants were used to transform competent BL-21(DE3) cells. Expression of the mutant proteins by the BL-21(DE3) cells was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mg/ml final concentration) for 3 h after the cell culture had reached anA600 of 0.8. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 35 min and the cell pellet was stored at −70 °C overnight. The cells were then thawed and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.5, and the arginase variants were purified from the lysed cells by a modification of the method described by Cavalli et al. (2Cavalli R.C. Burke C.J. Kawamoto S. Soprano D.R. Ash D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10652-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The partially purified protein samples were chromatographed on a Sigma-Red dye ligand column (3.5 × 25 cm), instead of the Amicon-Green dye ligand column described previously (2Cavalli R.C. Burke C.J. Kawamoto S. Soprano D.R. Ash D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10652-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and eluted with a 0–0.3 mlinear gradient of KCl in 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.5. The purity of the proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. All arginase samples were stored at 4 °C in ammonium sulfate at 85% saturation. The mutant R308A, R308E, and R308K enzymes and the recombinant wild-type enzyme were assayed for arginase activity by a modification of the method of Rüegg and Russell (18Rüegg U.T. Russell A.S. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture contained 200 mm CHES/NaOH at pH 9.0, 100 μm MnCl2, 0.05 μCi ofl-[guanidino-14C]arginine in a total volume of 40 μl per microcentrifuge tube. 5 μl of increasing concentrations (final concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm) of nonradiolabeled l-arginine was added to separate reaction mixtures to give total volumes of 45 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of a 1 μg/ml solution of enzyme and incubated for 5 min for wild type or 20 min for the R308A, R308E, and R308K mutants. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 μl of a stop solution at pH 4.5 containing 0.25m acetic acid, 7 m urea, and a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of Dowex 50 W-X8 in water and then vortexed. Reaction samples were then further gently mixed for 10 min and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min. 3 ml of Ecoscint solution was added to 200 μl from each supernatant for liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman model LS5000E counter. The arginase samples, stored as ammonium sulfate suspensions, were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.5 containing 10 mmMnCl2 and then incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. The samples were further centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to remove any precipitate that might have formed during the heat activation step. The supernatants were dialyzed exhaustively in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The samples were then washed six times with Chelex-100-treated 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.5 in Centricon-30 microconcentrators (2 ml in each wash) and then concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml each by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were then diluted 1:1 to a total volume of 400 μl with 6% perchloric acid. Manganese standards were prepared in HEPES buffer and treated with perchloric acid as described above for the enzyme samples. EPR samples were placed in quartz tubes and spectra were recorded on a Bruker ER-200D-SRC spectrometer. All EPR spectra were recorded at 9.47 GHz, 100-kHz modulation frequency, 10-Gauss modulation amplitude, 1000-Gauss sweep width, 90-s sweep time, 0.164-s time constant, and a temperature of 300 K. The manganese content for each arginase sample was determined by a comparison of EPR spectral amplitudes for the enzyme samples with a standard curve generated by plotting spectral amplitudes versus manganese concentration for the solutions of known manganese concentration (5Reczkowski R.S. Ash D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10992-10994Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry calculations are based on a subunit molecular mass of 35,000 Da. The protein samples were prepared by exhaustive dialysis of the ammonium sulfate-suspended proteins in 50 mm HEPES/KOH at pH 7.5. The samples were then concentrated to 12 mg/ml in Centricon-30 microconcentrators by centrifuging at 5000 × g (4 °C) for 30 min. The Superdex-200 column was equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES/KOH, 150 mmKCl at pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. 100-μl protein samples were chromatographed on the Superdex column using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Chromatography of the protein solutions was also performed in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, 150 mm KCl at pH 7.5 that contained 20 mm arginine and 20 mmMnCl2. The Superdex column was standardized using gel filtration standards from Sigma as well as transcription factor Rho. The molecular mass for each arginase sample was determined using a standard curve generated from the elution volumes for transcription factor Rho (282,000 Da), β-amylase (200,000 Da), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (110,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (66,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), and cytochrome c (12,400 Da). Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation of wild-type and mutant arginases was carried out using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorbance optics at 280 nm were used to measure the concentration of arginase. Enzyme was prepared for ultracentrifugation by exhaustive dialysis in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, to ensure that the samples and blanks were of identical composition. Arginase concentrations for the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/ml. The centrifuge was operated at 20,000 rpm, 20 °C, and data were collected over a 40-h period with 2-h sampling intervals. Equilibrium was reached when no further difference in the exponential distribution data was observed between two consecutive data acquisitions. Equilibrium data were analyzed with software written using IGOR (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). A partial specific volume of 0.743, determined using the SEDNTERP program (19Laue T.M. Shah B.

All calculations were based on the molecular composition of a single subunit. DSC data were measured with a Calorimetry Sciences Corp. NanoDSC instrument. Unfolding scans were taken at a rate of 1 degree/min, and unfolding was found to be irreversible based on the absence of transitions in reheating scans. Arginase concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 24,600 m − 1 calculated from the amino acid composition (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). DSC data were corrected for the instrumental base line by subtraction of water versus water scans. Final excess heat capacity scans were produced by subtracting linear-polynomial base lines using Calorimetry Sciences Corp. CpCalc software. Apparent unfolding enthalpy changes and midpoint temperatures were determined by integration of each unfolding peak. Circular dichroism experiments were conducted with a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter. Prior to each experiment, arginase was buffer-exchanged into 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5. All experiments were conducted in the exchange buffer at 23 °C, and data were collected in the range of 260–200 nm. Data analyses were carried out using the Jasco system software. R308K arginase was crystallized using conditions similar to those required for crystallization of the native enzyme (22Kanyo Z.F. Chen C.Y. Daghigh F. Ash D.E. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1175-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Crystals were nearly isomorphous with those of the native arginase trimer and belonged to space group P32(a = 87.9 Å, b = 87.9 Å,c = 112.1 Å; one trimer per asymmetric unit). Prior to data collection, crystals were gradually transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% glycerol and then flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory, beamline X12B, at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Upton, NY). Data integration and reduction were performed using the HKL suite of programs (23Otwinski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). With 69,842 measured reflections yielding 18,649 unique reflections, the completeness of data was 96% in the 20.0–3.0-Å range with Rsym = 0.089. Initial phasing was achieved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar,25Collaborative Computational Project, Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Using intensity data in the 20–3.5-Å shell withI > 3ς, the cross-rotation search yielded a 26.3ς peak with α = 117.17°, β = 168.52° γ = 337.74°. A subsequent translation search yielded a peak at 63.7ς with fractional coordinates x = 0.3333,y = 0.3385, z = 0.0000. Rigid body refinement lowered the initial crystallographic R factor from 0.438 to 0.411. Further refinement against 3.0-Å data was achieved using torsion angle molecular dynamics (Tinitial = 3000 K) with energy minimization, using the maximum likelihood algorithm as implemented in CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were employed in refinement. After initial rounds of refinement, electron density for the variant R308K side chain was clear and unambiguous. The Lys-308 side chain, 2 Mn2+ ions, and 10 water molecules per monomer were modeled into electron density maps generated with Fourier coefficients 2∣Fo∣ − ∣Fc∣ and ∣Fo∣ − ∣Fc∣ and phases calculated from the in-progress atomic model. Iterative rounds of refinement and rebuilding were performed with CNS and O, respectively (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Individual B factors were refined, and a bulk solvent correction was applied. Refinement converged to a final crystallographic R factor of 0.263 (Rfree = 0.296) with excellent stereochemistry; the root mean square deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles were 0.008 Å and 1.4°, respectively. The atomic coordinates of R308K arginase have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics with accession code 1HQX. The mutant arginases were purified to apparent homogeneity using the standard protocol for the wild-type enzyme. No modifications of the protocol were required. The kinetic constants for wild-type arginase and the R308A, R308E, and R308K mutant arginases are summarized in Table I. The wild-type protein had a Km of 1.1 mm forl-arginine, in good agreement with the values of 1–1.7 mm reported for rat liver arginase (2Cavalli R.C. Burke C.J. Kawamoto S. Soprano D.R. Ash D.E.

The mutant arginases showed Km values forl-arginine that were about 2.5-fold higher compared with wild-type enzyme. The catalytic activities (askcat) of all the mutants ranged between 33 and 41% of that for the wild-type enzyme, and thekcat/Km values ranged between 13 and 17% of that for wild-type enzyme.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters, manganese stoichiometry, and molecular weights for wild-type and Arg-308 mutant arginasesEnzymeKm 1-aFor each enzyme six sets of data were determined.kcat 1-aFor each enzyme six sets of data were determined. 1-bPercentage of wild-type value is shown in parentheses.kcat/Km 1-aFor each enzyme six sets of data were determined. 1-bPercentage of wild-type value is shown in parentheses.Mn/subunit1-cFor each enzyme three separate determinations were obtained, with the exception of R308K with 11 determinations.Molecular mass 1-dFor each enzyme five determinations were obtained except R308K with eight determinations. 1-eMonomeric molecular mass for arginase is 35000 Da.mms−1m −1s−1DaWild type1.07 ± 0.04220 ± 20(2.0 ± 0.1) × 1051.97 ± 0.0494,400 ± 500(100%)(100%)R308A2.5 ± 0.384 ± 10(3.4 ± 0.2) × 1042.1 ± 0.130,000 ± 100(39%)(17%)R308E2.6 ± 0.289 ± 3(3.4 ± 0.1) × 1042.1 ± 0.330,000 ± 200(41%)(17%)R308K2.7 ± 0.572 ± 7(2.7 ± 0.2) × 1041.25 ± 0.0434,000 ± 600(33%)(13%)1-a For each enzyme six sets of data were determined.1-b Percentage of wild-type value is shown in parentheses.1-c For each enzyme three separate determinations were obtained, with the exception of R308K with 11 determinations.1-d For each enzyme five determinations were obtained except R308K with eight determinations.1-e Monomeric molecular mass for arginase is 35000 Da. Open table in a new tab Because an intact binuclear Mn(II) center is essential for maximal catalytic activity (2Cavalli R.C. Burke C.J. Kawamoto S. Soprano D.R. Ash D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10652-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Reczkowski R.S. Ash D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10992-10994Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it is possible that the decreased activity of the R308A, R308E, and R308K mutants relative to wild-type enzyme resulted from altered manganese stoichiometries for the mutant enzymes. The Mn(II) stoichiometries for wild-type and the mutant arginases were determined by EPR spectroscopy using samples that were heat-activated in the presence of Mn(II) and then washed exhaustively to remove excess Mn(II). The results of the Mn(II) determinations are summarized in Table I. The wild-type enzyme had a full complement of 2 Mn(II)/subunit, in agreement with previously published stoichiometries (2Cavalli R.C. Burke C.J. Kawamoto S. Soprano D.R. Ash D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10652-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Reczkowski R.S. Ash D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10992-10994Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similar Mn(II) stoichiometries were also determined for the R308A and R308E mutants. A slightly lower stoichiometry of ∼1.3 Mn(II)/subunit was found with the R308K mutant. The native molecular weights for wild-type and the mutant arginases (Table I) were determined by gel filtration utilizing a Superdex-200 column. The molecular weight for each arginase protein was calculated from a standard curve generated with proteins of known molecular weights as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown in Fig.2 A. The elution profiles for wild-type and the mutant arginase R308A are shown in Fig.2 B. The wild-type protein eluted as a single peak corresponding to the trimeric molecular weight, while the R308A mutant eluted as a single peak with a molecular weight consistent with a monomeric species. The protein profiles for the R308E and R308K mutant arginases were the same as the R308A mutant shown in Fig.2 B. The monomeric state of the mutants did not change when chromatography was performed in the presence of added arginine and MnCl2 (data not shown). Wild-type arginase was determined to have a molecular mass of about 94–95,000 Da, which is consistent with previously reported molecular masses determined by gel filtration for the trimeric rat and human liver arginases (30Mora A. del Ara Rangel M. Fuentes J. Soler G. Centeno F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Penninckx M. Simon J. Wiame J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular masses determined for the mutant arginases were about 30,000–34,000 Da, consistent with the monomeric molecular mass for rat liver arginase (31Penninckx M. Simon J. Wiame J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation data (Fig.3) for wild-type arginase were best fit to a trimeric species only. Because no significant amount of monomer could be fit using the wild-type data, the monomer-trime"

Kinetic studies were conducted on the POP of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus(Pfu) 85 °C in both H2O and D2O.Pfu POP displayed many similarities to mammalian POPs, however the solvent isotope effect (k 0/k 1) was 2.2 at both high and low pH, indicating that general base/acid catalysis is the rate-limiting step. The pH-rate profiles indicated a three-deprotonation process with pK a values of 4.3, 7.2, and 9.1. The temperature dependence of these values revealed a heat of ionization of 4.7 kJ/mol for pK es1and 22 kJ/mol for pK es2, suggesting the catalytic involvement of a carboxyl group and an imidazole group, respectively. Temperature dependence of the catalytic rate was assessed at pH 6.0 and 7.6. Entropy values of −119 and −143 Jmol−1K−1 were calculated at the respective pH values, with a corresponding difference in enthalpy of 8.5 kJ/mol. These values suggest that two or three hydrogen bonds are broken during the transition state of the acidic enzyme form, whereas only one or two are broken during the transition state of the basic enzyme form.

Although it possesses the catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and aspartate that is characteristic of the serine proteases, its primary structure is otherwise unrelated to that of the chymotrypsin, trypsin, or elastase classes of serine proteases (6Koida M.

The presence of the enzyme in mammalian brain tissue and its ability to cleave proline-containing neuroactive peptides (18Blumberg S. Teichberg V.I. Charli J.L. Hersh L.B. McKelvy J.F.

Evidence is emerging that suggests that POP influences memory in mammals, because POP inhibitors have antiamnesiac properties (20Yoshimoto T. Kado K. Matsubara F. Koriyama N. Kaneto H. Tsuru D. J.

In addition, a structural model of Pfu POP was constructed based on the folding patterns from the POP crystal structure from Sus scrufa (pig) (21Fulop V. Bocskei Z. Polgar L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The two enzymes share 32% identity and 57% similarity at the amino acid level (7Robinson K.A. Bartley D.A.

The similarities of these enzymes from phylogenetically divergent sources are intriguing given their ∼55 °C difference in temperature optimum. Even more striking, however, are their differences, which may ultimately shed some light on the evolution of this class of serine proteases.

The presence of the enzyme in mammalian brain tissue and its ability to cleave proline-containing neuroactive peptides (18Blumberg S. Teichberg V.I. Charli J.L. Hersh L.B. McKelvy J.F. Brain Res. 1980; 192: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Hersh L.B. McKelvy J.F. Brain Res. 1979; 168: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have led to the suggestion that it plays a role in regulation of these peptides. Evidence is emerging that suggests that POP influences memory in mammals, because POP inhibitors have antiamnesiac properties (20Yoshimoto T. Kado K. Matsubara F. Koriyama N. Kaneto H. Tsuru D. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1987; 10: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As a first step in the detailed investigation of P. furiosus (Pfu) POP, its substrate specificity, pH activity profiles, temperature-dependent activity profile, and influences by anions were studied. In addition, a structural model of Pfu POP was constructed based on the folding patterns from the POP crystal structure from Sus scrufa (pig) (21Fulop V. Bocskei Z. Polgar L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The two enzymes share 32% identity and 57% similarity at the amino acid level (7Robinson K.A. Bartley D.A.

The similarities of these enzymes from phylogenetically divergent sources are intriguing given their ∼55 °C difference in temperature optimum. Even more striking, however, are their differences, which may ultimately shed some light on the evolution of this class of serine proteases.

In our species and in other higher primates, placentation is hemochorial, i.e. the endometrial stroma is penetrated by invasive cytotrophoblast cells that establish direct contact with the maternal blood (1Damsky C.H. Fisher S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 5: 660-666Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The intermixing of semiallogeneic cells at the maternal-embryonic interface creates a fundamental immunological paradox. What prevents embryonic rejection within the immunocompetent mother? This question was first posed formally by Sir Peter Medawar (2Medawar P. Society for Experimental Biology, Evolution Symposium. Academic Press, New York1953: 320-338Google Scholar), who postulated that cytotrophoblasts evaded recognition by cytotoxic maternal immune cells by lacking HLA class I surface proteins. This idea has since been modified following the discovery of monomorphic nonclassical HLA class I molecules expressed on the surface of human (HLA-G) (3Kovats S. Main E.K. Librach C. Stubblebine M.

It is now postulated that the immunotolerizing effect of human trophoblast HLA-G may be further enhanced by extensive polylactosamine units added co-translationally to the nascent protein (5McMaster M.

Glycodelin, a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, is essentially undetectable in proliferative phase endometrium and is dramatically up-regulated during the secretory phase of the ovulatory cycle and in early pregnancy (14Mueller, M., Vigne, J.-L., Vaisse, C., and Taylor, R.

Low glycodelin concentrations were observed in secretory phase uterine flushings from women with a history of recurrent miscarriages (20Dalton C.F. Laird S.M. Estdale S.E. Saravelos H.G. Li T.C. Hum. Reprod. ( Oxf ). 1998; 13: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although functional studies are limited, preliminary data indicate that glycodelin has immunosuppressive effects that are postulated to facilitate the embryonic evasion of the maternal immune response (21Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to investigate the hypothesis that glycodelin could inhibit immune cell migration and to assess the importance of its sugar moieties in this process. First trimester human maternal decidual tissues were separated from fetal placenta tissues by “floating” in cold saline, washed several times, and processed immediately. The tissues were minced into small pieces, resuspended in cold 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and homogenized with a Potter apparatus (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) at a concentration of 500 mg of tissue, wet weight/ml of buffer. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min in a 60-Ti rotor of a Beckman ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The final high speed supernatant (protein concentration, 10 mg/ml) was used to conduct the purification, as noted below. Protein concentration was determined according to the BCA method (Pierce). U937 and Ishikawa cell lines were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility at the University of California, San Francisco. U937 cells were treated with 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP for 48 h to induce a monocyte phenotype and up-regulate oligopeptide chemoattractant receptors (22Kay G. Lane B.C. Snyderman R. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycodelin was purified from human decidual tissue homogenates by using a modification of the procedures described by Westwood et al. (23Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Totty N. Philp R. Bolton A.E. Lazarus N.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 82: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Vigne et al. (24Vigne, J.-L., Mueller, M., Vaisse, C., and Taylor, R. (2001)Référ. Gynécol. Obstét., in press.Google Scholar). A Protein-Pak Q 8HR chromatography column (10 × 100 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA) was preequilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 10 ml of high speed supernatant were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of equilibration buffer, and the retained proteins were eluted by linearly increasing the salt concentration to 0.5 m NaCl. Pooled fractions containing the proteins of interest were acidified with diluted trifluoroacetic acid, centrifuged in a Micro16 apparatus (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) to remove denatured material, and then loaded onto a Vydac C-18 reverse phase column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (Solvent A). Retained proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of Solvent A and Solvent B (90% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to a final concentration of 80% acetonitrile. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In other experiments, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for protein sequencing, 0.2 μm (Bio-Rad) in the presence of 10 mm CAPS1buffer, pH 11, and 10% methanol. Blotted proteins were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol and 1% acetic acid and then destained in 50% methanol. Peptide bands were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and directly microsequenced on a vapor phase Beckman-Porton PI2090 Sequencer (Beckman Instruments) by using the Edman degradation procedure. Sequence homologies were searched in the PIR/Swiss Protein Database. N-Linked oligosaccharides were released from the purified glycodelin by digestion with PNGase (1 unit/250 μg of glycodelin) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.4) containing 2% Triton X-100 for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization, and the products were purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C-18 Vydac column. U937 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then centrifuged and resuspended in Buffer A (200 mm glycine, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm EGTA, 50 mm EDTA, and 300 mm sucrose, pH 9.0, containing protease inhibitors) at the concentration of 150 × 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension was sonicated twice with 8-s bursts, and the cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors by using a Dounce homogenizer. Five-hundred-μl aliquots were frozen immediately at −80 °C and stored for later use. Pure glycodelin (4 μg) was iodinated by using the chloramine-T method to a specific activity ranging between 100 and 200 μCi/μg.125I-Glycodelin was separated from free iodine by gel permeation chromatography using a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Binding assays were performed using U937 cells in 12-well plates. Each well contained 500,000 cells/600 μl of PBS/BSA. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with125I-glycodelin in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled glycodelin. Cells were then transferred to prebaked glass tubes and pelleted by centrifugation to separate the bound from the unbound radioactive glycodelin. Cell pellets were washed twice with 3 ml of PBS/BSA, and bound radioligand was measured using a γ counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Competition studies were performed similarly using Ishikawa cells as a negative control. Data were analyzed and Scatchard plots were generated using the PRISM for Windows program. Two hundred μg of U937 cell membranes were suspended in 300 μl of buffer (100 mmTris, MgCl2, pH 8.3), and labeled glycodelin was added at a final concentration of 300 nm in the presence or absence of 30 μm purified glycodelin and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. After incubation, 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were added, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS. The cross-linking reagent, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce), was added at the final concentration of 2 mm. 125I-Glycodelin and membranes were incubated on ice for 2 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, to achieve a final concentration of 20 mm. The reaction was continued for another 30 min. After cross-linking, the membranes were diluted with cold buffer PBS/BSA and sedimented by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were washed one more time with PBS/BSA and dissolved in Triton X-100/SDS sample buffer before they were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled proteins were identified by direct autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Glycodelin bioactivity was assessed by a chemotaxis assay using a human histiocytic cell line (U937). To induce monocytic differentiation, U937 cells were first activated by cAMP. For the measurements, 24-well plates assembled with Boyden chambers (0.4-μm pore size polycarbonate membranes) were used. Samples (600 μl) containing the chemotactic peptideN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (0.1 μm fMLP) (Sigma) or RANTES (30–60 nm)(R & D, Minneapolis, MN) in PBS/BSA were placed in the lower chamber as positive controls for cell migration. Previous studies have shown these concentrations to provide optimal monocyte chemotaxis (25Hornung D. Bentzien F. Kiesel L. Wallwiener D. Taylor R.N. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purified glycodelin was added to the lower chamber to test its activity. After assembly of the Boyden chambers, 200-μl suspensions of U937 cells (106 cells) in PBS/BSA were placed in the upper chamber. The chambers were then incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 90 min. Nonmigrating cells were removed by washes with PBS, and cells migrating across the membrane were fixed, stained, and counted directly or estimated by photometric absorption at 450 nm. In some experiments, purified glycodelin samples were preincubated with high affinity, anti-human glycodelin rabbit IgG (provided by Dr. MarkküSeppälä) or nonspecific rabbit IgG, and the chemotactic activity was measured as described above. The results were expressed as the percentage of chemotaxis obtained in response to a maximal stimulation with the fMLP chemoattractant alone. Results are presented as means ± S.E. of independent experiments. Several different methods have been described for the purification of glycodelin (23Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Totty N. Philp R. Bolton A.E. Lazarus N.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 82: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Bell S.C. Drife J.O. Baillières Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 1989; 3: 271-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, each of these is long and complex. We designed a two-step protocol that can be achieved in a day with a yield of hundreds of micrograms of purified glycodelin from 1.25 g of human decidual tissue. In a typical experiment, 10 ml of decidual homogenate were loaded onto a Protein-Pak Q-8HR column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2. Nonretained proteins were eluted by washing the column with the same equilibration buffer. Retained proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl. Fig.1 shows the profile of total proteins eluted from the anion exchange column and detected by absorption at 280 nm. Glycodelin concentrations in each fraction were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (inset). Verification of the 27-kDa glycodelin band was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing (Table I) and Western blotting analysis (15Taylor R.N. Savouret J.-F. Vaisse C. Vigne J.-L. Ryan I. Hornung D. Seppälä M. Milgrom E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 4006-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). About 50% of the total glycodelin eluted from the anion exchange column in fraction 18, which corresponded to a concentration of 125 mm NaCl. In this fraction, albumin was not detected and neither was the putative dimeric form of glycodelin previously reported by Westwood et al. (23Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Totty N. Philp R. Bolton A.E. Lazarus N.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 82: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in the subsequent fractions, we detected the presence of albumin as a major 68-kDa protein co-eluting with glycodelin. The identification of albumin was evidenced by amino acid sequencing (Table I).Table IAmino acid sequences of the major endometrial proteins eluted during chromatographic purification and their database matchesProtein sizeAmino acid sequenceDatabase match68 kDaDAHKSEVAHRFKDLGEENFKAlbumin precursor27 kDaMDIPQTKQDLELPKLAVTAHGlycodelin (PP14) Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows the elution profile obtained when fraction 18 from the anion exchange column was further separated by reverse phase chromatography. An SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the eluted fractions is also shown (inset). Fraction 55 off the latter column yielded a single homogeneous band migrating at about 27 kDa, which has been identified by NH2-terminal sequencing analysis as bona fide glycodelin. To assess the function of the complex glycan decoration of the glycodelin protein, we undertook a series of experiments to remove these sugar moieties. Digests of glycodelin by PNGase were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 A shows the products of digestion. After glycosidase digestion, we observed a shift in the molecular mass of glycodelin from 27 kDa (lane 1) to 18 kDa (lane 3), predicted by the glycodelin cDNA sequence (27Julkunen M. Seppälä M. Jänne O.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 626: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Gentler conditions yielded a major band at 18 kDa and two minor bands at 27 and 22 kDa (lane 2). The higher molecular mass band represents the undigested form of glycodelin with two N-glycosylated sites, one at Asn-28 and another at Asn-63. The lowest molecular mass band represents the fully deglycosylated form. The 22-kDa band represents glycodelin with only a single glycosylated site. The precise structure of the intermediate species has not yet been established. Immediately after digestion, the deglycosylated form was separated from the glycosylated forms by reverse phase chromatography on a C-18 Vydac column (Fig.3 B). The purified deglycosylated product eluted in fraction 36 and is shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in theinset of Fig. 3 B. The biological activity of glycodelin was evaluated by measuring its effect on the migration of activated U937 cells exposed to a chemotactic stimulus of fMLP, which previous studies demonstrated attracts human monocytes (25Hornung D. Bentzien F. Kiesel L. Wallwiener D. Taylor R.N. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, purified glycodelin inhibits the migration of U937 in a dose-responsive manner with a calculated IC50 of 550 nm. This may be an overestimate because it is based upon the assumption that all the purified glycodelin retains its bioactivity. That the chemorepellent activity is specific was demonstrated by the elimination of this effect when the purified protein was heat-inactivated or preincubated with specific anti-glycodelin IgG. When glycodelin was preincubated with nonspecific IgG, it retained almost all of its inhibitory activity. Furthermore, this effect is specific because other proteins tested (ovalbumin, human placenta lactogen, and bovine serum albumin) had no inhibitory activity on monocyte migration at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. By contrast, the deglycosylated form of glycodelin expressed the same biopotency as the intact glycoprotein. To substantiate this activity, we conducted binding experiments to verify if radiolabeled glycodelin was able to bind to the surface of U937 cells in a specific manner. Fig.5 shows the results of a representative competitive binding experiment using 125I-glycodelin and unlabeled purified glycodelin bound to the surface of U937 cells. We observed that the binding is saturable, and Scatchard analyses estimated a Kd of 48 ± 21 nm from three independent experiments. We were unable to demonstrate the binding of labeled glycodelin to a human endometrial cell line (Ishikawa cells), demonstrating the specificity of glycodelin receptor expression on the surface of monocytes. Scatchard analyses of125I-glycodelin binding to cell-free U937 plasma membranes yielded a Kd of 121 ± 65 nm (data not shown). U937 cell membranes were incubated with 125I-glycodelin in the presence or absence of unlabeled glycodelin. The labeled glycodelin was cross-linked to its receptor by treatment with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, and the cross-linked complexes were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7.5% acrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Fig. 6 shows high molecular weight cross-linked complexes measured by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The incubation of 125I-glycodelin in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled glycodelin reduced accumulation of the labeled complexes, indicating ligand-dependent specificity. We have calculated the size of the complexes to be ∼250 kDa. Ishikawa cell membranes failed to display specific 125I-glycodelin cross-linking. Metabolic labeling studies from our group (15Taylor R.N.

Furthermore, the role of relaxin in the secretion and synthesis of glycodelin also appears to be controversial (16Taylor R.N. Vigne J.L. Zhang P. Hoang P. Lebovic D.I. Mueller M.D. Am. J. Obstet.

Based upon its expression at the maternal-embryonic interface and preliminary evidence of immunomodulatory activityin vitro (13Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S.

Because glycodelin has been observed to interfere with sperm-oocyte binding, some authors have attributed the immunosuppressive activity of glycodelin to its complex GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc glycosylation pattern (13Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol.

In the present study, we report a modified method for the purification of glycodelin from human decidua. This two-step method is simple and rapid with a purification factor of 100 and a yield of about 15%. The highly purified material exhibits a unique band of 27 kDa following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, which was identified throughout all the purification steps as a monomeric form of glycodelin. This result differs from that published by Westwoodet al. (23Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Totty N. Philp R. Bolton A.E. Lazarus N.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 82: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in which a putative dimeric ∼60-kDa form of glycodelin was observed. Our experiments failed to reveal such a dimeric form; however, serum albumin (68 kDa) was noted to be a prominent contaminant in the first step of the purification. Our studies indicate that glycodelin purified from human decidual tissue can inhibit the chemotaxis of U937 cells in a Boyden chamber model. The data demonstrate that the ability of glycodelin to inhibit monocyte migration is not dependent upon its glycan moieties. Deglycosylated glycodelin was equally efficacious in the inhibition of U937 chemotaxis. This finding is consistent with the observations of Rachmilewitz et al. (21Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), who showed that recombinant glycodelin synthesized in Escherichia coli (and hence, not expressing eukaryotic posttranslational modifications) possessed inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte proliferation in response to lectin stimulation. Whereas synthetic sugars might be useful in the mapping and ultimate inhibition of sperm-oocyte interactions (31Seppälä M. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 3: 261-263Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this strategy is not likely to be successful for the interference of glycodelin actions on immune cell function. We detected a saturable, high affinity (Kd∼50–120 nm) receptor for 125I-glycodelin on U937 cells and purified plasma membranes. Miller et al. (32Miller R. Fayen J. Chakraborty S. Weber M. Tykocinski M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) identified a glycodelin receptor of similar affinity (Kd ∼7–28 nm) on circulating human monocytes. Our preliminary analysis of the molecular mass of the cross-linked glycodelin-receptor complex suggests that it is ∼250 kDa, but this may reflect the sum mass of multiple proteins involved in the complex. The apparent IC50 of the monocyte chemorepellent effect of glycodelin in our experiments was 550 nm. According to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Ki = IC50/(1 + [free ligand]/Kd)), the inhibition constant (Ki) for glycodelin is calculated to be 220 nm. This concentration is 6-fold higher than the peak circulating level of glycodelin in maternal blood during the first trimester of pregnancy (14Mueller, M., Vigne, J.-L., Vaisse, C., and Taylor, R. (2001)Semin. Reprod. Med., in press.Google Scholar) but is very likely to be attainable locally within the secretory endometrium and early pregnancy decidua. A similar IC50 of 200 nm was observed by Rachmilewitzet al. (21Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for glycodelin inhibition of T cell proliferation. The physiological implication of these calculations is that the inhibition of the maternal monocyte function in the peripheral circulation would not be anticipated, even during peak glycodelin biosynthesis. However, the local inhibition of monocyte migration into the endometrium would be predicted during the critical period of embryonic implantation. Teleologically such a mechanism preserves the normal systemic immunocompetence of the mother while providing local endometrial immunosuppression and tolerance of the semiallogeneic conceptus. It is of interest that glycodelin inhibits U937 migration in response to fMLP, recombinant human RANTES, or human peritoneal fluid. 2J.-L. Vigne, D. Hornung, M. D. Mueller, and R. N. Taylor, unpublished data. Hence, it appears that this endometrial protein can modulate monocyte chemotaxis independent of the specific chemotactic stimulus. It is conceivable that its site of action is in a pathway shared by each of these stimuli. Alternatively, glycodelin may activate an independent chemorepellent pathway unrelated to the chemotactic pathways that mediate monocyte migration. Further characterization of the glycodelin receptor and postreceptor pathways are the foci of ongoing investigations in our laboratory. We thank Professor Markku Seppälä(University of Helsinki) for providing anti-human glycodelin antibodies and Cynthia Voytek for assistance with the illustrations."

In catalyzing these oxygen transfer reactions, CPO behaves more like the P-450 cytochromes than like classical peroxidases such as the peroxidases from horseradish roots, soybeans, and the fungusCoprinus cinereus, which mostly catalyze one-electron oxidations, e.g. polymerization of phenol and anilinic compounds (18Dordick J.S.

The use of such an approach for the C. fumago CPO could help in revealing the structural basis of the unique properties of this enzyme and to explore further possibilities. For site-directed mutagenesis studies, an efficient expression system for the cpo gene is required. As CPO is a protein with several post-translational modifications, i.e. N- and O-glycosylation, disulfide bridge formation, cleavage of N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, and prosthetic group incorporation (1Kenigsberg P. Fang G.-H. Hager L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), prokaryotic hosts appear not suitable for synthesizing the active protein. Indeed, Zong et al. (45Zong Q. Osmulski P.A. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12420-12425Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), reporting the expression of cpo in Escherichia coli, showed that the non-glycosylated enzyme was secreted into the periplasm in its apoform and only after a tedious high pressure-assisted reconstitution process could limited amounts of the active holoenzyme be recovered. Therefore, other, eukaryotic, expression systems have been considered. Expression of the cpo using the baculovirus system resulted in the production of extracellular inactive CPO, which could not be reconstituted to active protein (46Sigle R.O. Expression of Chloroperoxidase for Site-directed Mutagenasis . PhD thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). Similarly, attempts to produce CPO in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris have been unsuccessful (46Sigle R.O. Expression of Chloroperoxidase for Site-directed Mutagenasis . PhD thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar, 47Zong Q. Expression of Recombinant Chloroperoxidase . PhD thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL1997Google Scholar). Recently, the genetic transformation of C. fumago and the expression of mutant forms of CPO in the parental host have been reported (48Yi X. Mroczko M. Manoj K.M. Wang X. Hager L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 22: 12412-12417Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, this system has the inconvenience of the presence of native CPO background, which hampers the screening for recombinant CPO producing strains, and has failed in providing specific CPO mutant proteins. 2L. P. Hager, personal communication.2L. P. Hager, personal communication. We have explored the possibility of producing CPO in another filamentous fungal expression host, namely Aspergillus niger. Filamentous fungi are capable of secreting large amounts of proteins in the extracellular medium. Since versatile DNA transfer and gene expression systems are available for these organisms, the necessary tools are available for the production of recombinant proteins. Furthermore, A. niger has no detectable extracellular peroxidases, and therefore, in contrast to the C. fumago system, no interference of endogenous oxidising activities when screening for CPO producing transformants. To date several reports on the expression of fungal metalloproteins in filamentous fungi have been published (49Saloheimo M. Niku-Paavola M.-L. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 987-990Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 50Stewart P. Whitwam R.E. Kersten P.J. Cullen D. Tien M. Appl. Environ.

However, although production of active recombinant enzymes was found in most cases, yield levels were still far from those obtained for less complex fungal proteins, making the secretion of metalloproteins an intriguing subject of study.

Primers CLP15E/A (5′-GGAATTCACATGTTCTCCAAGGTCC-3′) and CLP1CTERM3 (5′-CGCGCGGATCCAAGCTTAAAGGTTGCGGG-3′) were used to amplify the DNA sequence encoding the full-length CPO precursor (GenBank™ accession no. AJ300448) from pCf6 and introduce suitable cloning sites. The resulting PCR product wasEcoRI/BamHI-digested and cloned into pUC19 to render pCPO3. The amplified cpo fragment was checked by sequence analysis, excised from pCPO3 as anAflIII/HindIII fragment and cloned into the pAN52–10Not Aspergillus expression vector (55Punt P.J. Zegers N.D. Busscher M. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) at theNcoI/HindIII cloning sites, which resulted in pCPO3.I. In vector pCPO3.I, the CPO coding sequence is placed under control of the A. niger glucoamylase promoter and A. nidulans trpC terminator. Finally, the A. nidulans AmdS selection marker (56Kelly J.M. Hynes M.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was introduced in pCPO3.I at a unique NotI site to obtain the cpoexpression vector pCPO3.I-AmdS (Fig.1). Fungal co-transformation was carried out as described (57Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), using pCPO3.I-AmdS and pAB4–1 (58van Hartingsveldt W. Mattern I.E. van Zeijl C.M. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) plasmids. Transformants were selected on fructose minimal medium plates without uridine and containing acetamide as sole nitrogen source. Transformants were selected for multicopy integration of the expression cassettes on acrylamide plates (59Verdoes J.C. Punt P.J. Schrickx J.M. van Verseveld H.W. Stouthamer A.H. van den Hondel C.A. Transgenic Res. 1993; 2: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and for extracellular peroxidase activity on o-anisidine plates as described (52Conesa A. van Den Hondel C.A. Punt P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using 0.05% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.7, as developing buffer. Molecular methods were carried out essentially as described (60Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total fungal RNA was isolated using the RNAzol™ kit from Cinna/Biotecx. For Northern analysis experiments, a 1-kilobase StyI fragment from pCF6 containing most of the cpo coding region was used as a probe. SDS-PAGE was performed with a Bio-Rad MiniprotII system using the Tris-glycine method and 10% polyacrylamide gels. N-terminal determination of recombinant CPO (rCPO) was performed by Edman degradation after SDS-PAGE of the purified protein and blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For deglycosylation experiments, proteins were treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH; New England Biolabs) following manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of polyclonal antibodies, CPO from C. fumago IMI 089362 was purified according to van Deurzen et al. (61Van Deurzen M.P.J. Groen B.W. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Biocatalysis. 1994; 10: 247-255Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A 3-mg aliquot of the purified CPO was treated with acetone plus 0.3% HCl to remove the heme group (62Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and both holo- and apochloroperoxidase were used for rabbit immunization. Immunizations were performed in duplicate using 100 μg of protein in Freund's complete adjuvant-H2O2 (1:1). Boosters were administered after 2 and 16 weeks after immunization using 100 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were bled 1 week after the last booster, and optimal sera dilution was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fungal culturing was carried out in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml ofAspergillus minimal growth medium (63Bennett, J. W., and Lasure, L. L. (eds) (1991)More Gene Manipulation inFungi, pp. 441-457, Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FLGoogle Scholar) with 5% maltodextrin and supplemented with 0.5% casein amino acids and 500 mg/liter hemin. Cultures were inoculated with 5 × 108 conidia and grown for 48 h at 30 °C or 22 °C in a rotary shaker revolving at 300 rpm. Medium samples were obtained by filtering the fungal cultures through a Miracloth. To the filtered medium (1300 ml) cold acetone (1000 ml; 45% v/v; −20 °C) was slowly added at 4 °C, and after 1 h of incubation at −20 °C, precipitated impurities were removed by centrifugation (4400 min−1; 20 min; 0 °C). Cold acetone was then slowly added to the supernatant (1000 ml; final concentration 60% v/v; −20 °C), and CPO precipitation occurred overnight at −20 °C. The supernatant was removed by decanting, and the precipitated protein was dried for 10 min. The protein pellet was dissolved in phosphate buffer (300 ml; 10 mm; pH 5.2), adjusted to pH 5.8 with 10 mmH3PO4, and brought onto a DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 750 ml) fast flow column in phosphate buffer (20 mm; pH 5.8; flow 10 ml min−1). The column was washed with phosphate buffer (20 mm; pH 5.8; 10 ml min−1) for 1 h. The enzyme was eluted with a 20–200 mm phosphate buffer gradient (pH 5.8; 10 ml min−1) during 4 h. Fractions having peroxidase activity (MCD assay) above 0.25 units/ml were pooled, adjusted to pH 5.2, and concentrated over a 30-kDa membrane (Centriprep-30 concentrator, Amicon) at a speed of 1800 rpm. Further purification was done by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 10 × 300 mm; phosphate buffer, pH 5.2; 200 mm; 0.5 ml min−1). For sulfide oxidation reactions, 50 μmol of sulfide was dissolved at room temperature in 1.0 ml solvent (0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 5.2). 24 units of chloroperoxidase were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 5 min. The reaction was started by the continuous addition of H2O2 (0.15 m) at a rate of 1eq/2 h to a total of 1.1 eq. H2O2. The reaction was quenched after 2.5 h by the addition of an excess of Na2SO3. The reaction mixture was homogenized by the addition of isopropyl alcohol (400 μl) and analyzed by chiral HPLC. Oxidation of thioanisole with H218O2 was performed at 0.5-ml scale. Oxidation was started with the stepwise addition of H218O2 (1.0%; 5 μl/min to a total of 95 μl). 5 min after the last addition, the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and the reaction products were analyzed with GC-MS. Oxidation of substituted indoles were performed at room temperature in 1.0-ml aliquots containing 10 μmol of indole derivative dissolved intert-butyl alcohol, 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 (50:50, v/v). 8 units of chloroperoxidase were added to the reaction mixture, stirred for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the continuous addition of H2O2 (0.15m) at a rate of 1 eq/h, to a total of 1.1 eq of H2O2. The reactions were monitored by removing aliquots and analyzing by HPLC. The oxidation of indole with H218O2was performed at 0.5-ml scale. Oxidation was started with the stepwise addition of H218O2 (0.4%; 5 μl/min to a total of 55 μl). 5 minutes after the last addition, the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and the reaction products were analyzed with GC-MS. In a co-transformation experiment, A. niger strain MGG029 was transformed with a mixture of plasmids pCPO3.I-AmdS and pAB4–1. Several uridine prototrophic, acetamide utilizing transformants were obtained and were transferred to both acrylamide ando-anisidine containing plates. Efficient growth and esporulation on acrylamide plates reflects multicopy integration of the transforming vector (59Verdoes J.C. Punt P.J. Schrickx J.M. van Verseveld H.W. Stouthamer A.H. van den Hondel C.A. Transgenic Res. 1993; 2: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and colored halo formation ono-anisidine plates indicates extracellular peroxidase activity (52Conesa A. van Den Hondel C.A. Punt P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Four transformants growing vigorously on acrylamide and developing an intense halo with the o-anisidine test were selected. These four strains were cultured on maltose minimal medium for 48 h and analyzed for cpo mRNA synthesis by Northern blotting and extracellular CPO production by Western analysis (data not shown). From this analysis, the best producing transformant, strain [MGG029]pCPO3.I#5, was selected for production and purification of rCPO. Extracellular production of rCPO could be readily detected in shake-flask cultures of strain [MGG029]pCPO3.I#5 without the need of extra heme supplementation. However, rCPO production levels could be increased by 10-fold upon hemin addition to the culture medium at a concentration of 500 mg/liter. An additional 5-fold increase was achieved by switching the culturing temperature from 30 °C to 22 °C. Under these conditions up to 10 mg/liter rCPO could be produced from strain [MGG029]pCPO3.I#5. rCPO was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by acetone precipitation and column chromatography as reported for CPO fromC. fumago (47Zong Q. Expression of Recombinant Chloroperoxidase . PhD thesis. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL1997Google Scholar, 61Van Deurzen M.P.J. Groen B.W. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Biocatalysis. 1994; 10: 247-255Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The figures corresponding to the purification of rCPO are given in TableI.Table IPurification of rCPOVolumeActivityEnzymeYieldRzmlunits/mlunits%A400/A280Crude13001.62080100NDAcetone precipitation300ND<0.05DEAE-Sepharose974666320.31GPC639234110.54 Open table in a new tab Fig.2 shows the UV spectra of purified rCPO and native CPO (nCPO, commercial preparation withRz 1.23). As it can be seen, the ratio betweenA400 (indicating heme-containing protein) andA280 (indicating total protein), orRz value, is lower for rCPO (0.54) in comparison to nCPO. Homogeneous CPO from C. fumago has aRz of 1.44. This suggests that rCPO is only partly (∼40%) occupied with heme. Similarly to nCPO, the absorption spectrum of the ferrous-CO complex of rCPO showed a Soret peak at 450 nm (data not shown), indicating the correct formation of the heme thiolate ligand with Cys29 (64Stern J.O. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7495-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize rCPO, we compared the behavior on SDS-PAGE of the native and recombinant proteins. Two major protein bands could be detected in the nCPO preparate, possibly corresponding to isozymes A and B. These two CPO forms have the same amino acid composition and specific activity, but they differ in the carbohydrate composition (1Kenigsberg P. Fang G.-H. Hager L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). rCPO migrated as a single band at a position that is 5–10 kDa, respectively, higher than the native isozymes. As we suspected that this difference in size was due to a overglycosylation of the recombinant enzyme, we treated both rCPO and nCPO with EndoH to removeN-linked glycans. As previously reported (1Kenigsberg P. Fang G.-H. Hager L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), EndoH digestion of nCPO produced two species of reduced molecular weight. Both deglycosylated rCPO and nCPO shifted to a similar position on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), indicating that the differences in size could indeed be attributed to overglycosylation of the recombinant enzyme.

In the present study we have examined the mechanism by which growth factor-induced signals are propagated to the nucleus, leading to the activation of transcription factor, cis-acting cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), in immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells (H19-7). During the differentiation of H19-7 cells by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) a critical regulatory Ser133 residue of CREB was phosphorylated followed by an increase of CRE-mediated gene transcription. Expression of S133A CREB mutants blocked the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF. Although the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation by EGF was transient, bFGF induced a prolonged pattern of CREB phosphorylation. Interestingly, bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription is not likely to be mediated by any of previously known signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of CREB, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-p70S6K, calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase, and casein kinase 2. By using in vitro in gel kinase assay the presence of a novel 120-kDa bFGF-inducible CREB kinase was identified.

These findings identify a new growth factor-activated signaling pathway that regulates gene expression at the CRE. Growth factors act by binding to cell surface receptors to elicit the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. This, in turn, triggers a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately control cell physiology. Activation of signaling cascades results in the pattern of gene expression through the functional modulation of various transcription factors.

Mechanisms underlying these diverse actions of bFGF are not well understood but may result, at least in part, from distinct signaling pathways controlling gene expression. The bFGF receptor belongs to the tyrosine kinase class of membrane receptors. The binding of bFGF to its receptor results in the activation of Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (2Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Coupled phosphorylation events induce the sequential activation of Raf-1 kinase, MAPK kinase (MEK), and MAPK (or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)) (3Schaeffer H. Weber M.J. Mol.

CREB mediates cellular responses to a variety of physiological signals, including neurotransmitters, depolarization, synaptic activity, mitogenic and differentiating factors, and stressors (5Bonni A.

To identify signaling pathways transmitting extracellular FGF signal to nucleus, the induction mechanism of immediate early genepip92 by bFGF was previously studied in rat hippocampal progenitor H19-7 cells. Although signaling through Raf-1 occurs exclusively through the SRE, bFGF can also activate a region of thepip92 promoter that contains a CREB binding site near the site of transcription initiation (17Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the role for CREB in regulating genes that mediate a multitude of cellular responses and to investigate the signaling mechanisms by which bFGF regulates gene expression, we examined the effect of bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation on the activation of CREB and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription in neuronal H19-7 cells. The present study suggests that CRE-mediated gene transcription appears to be important during the differentiation of neuronal H19-7 cells induced by bFGF and the activation of novel protein kinase signaling pathway is required for the bFGF responsiveness.

Dominant-negative SEK mutant, pSEK1(AL)/EE-CMV, and pEE-CMV DNAs were kindly provided by D. Templeton, and dominant inhibitory Ras mutant was provided by C. Marshall. The rat neuronal hippocampal progenitor cell line (H19-7) was generated by transduction with the retroviral vectors containing temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T antigen that is functionally active at 33 °C and inactive at 39 °C as described elsewhere (18Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). ΔRaf-1:ER cells were made by stable transfection of H19-7 cells with estradiol-regulated Raf-1 generated by fusing a constitutively active, oncogenic portion of human Raf-1 to the hormone-binding domain of human estrogen receptor as described elsewhere (19Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The proliferating cells were cultured at 33 °C in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml of geneticin to maintain selection on the transduced immortalization vector. ΔRaf-1:ER cells were also grown in hygromycin. Prior to differentiation, cells were shifted to 39 °C in N2 medium for 2 days (H19-7 cells) or 1 day (ΔRaf-1:ER cells). The H19-7 cells were differentiated with 10 ng/ml bFGF. ΔRaf-1:ER cells were differentiated with 1 μm estradiol. As a measure of neuronal differentiation, morphological changes were quantitated by measuring the length of processes in differentiated cells, and the expression of neuronal markers were measured by immnuocytochmistry and immunoblotting. Differentiated cells are defined as those cells containing at least one neurite longer than the diameter of cell body. When specified, cells were pretreated with 30 μm of p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, or MEK inhibitor, PD98059, 30 min prior to bFGF stimulation to block the activation of p38 or MEK. When indicated, the cells were pretreated with LY294002, rapamycin, KT5720, or KN62 for 30 min to block the activation of PI-3K, pp70S6K, PKA, or CaM kinase 2, respectively. pCRE-TK-Luc, A reporter plasmid was transiently transfected by using a LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) either alone or with kinase-inactive SEK or MEKK mutant plasmid, as indicated. Plasmid pCMV-EGFP (CLONTECH), which contains jellyfish green fluorescent protein gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as an internal control to determine transfection efficiency. In every transfection experiment, the CRE-lacking thymidine kinase (TK) promoter construct (pTK-Luc) was used as a negative control. Luciferase activity was measured by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and luminometer (EG & G Berhold, Germany). When specified, the cells were stimulated with 10 μm forskolin as a positive control for CRE-mediated gene transcription. Cells were solubilized with lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 137 mmNaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate. Then cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with a suitable antibody, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PKA activity was measured using the colorimetric PKA assay kit. The treated cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, pH 7.2), sonicated, and centrifuged. Supernatants were subsequently taken as lysates. 30 μg of cell lysate was used to measure PKA activity. The activities of PKC and CaM kinase 2 were measured by using PKC and CaM kinase 2 assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The final volume of each incubation sample was 60 μl, and reaction was terminated by transfer of 25 μl onto phosphocellulose filter. The radioactive phosphopeptide bound to the filter was quantitated after 1% phosphoric acid wash. The assay for phosphotransferase activity of CK2 was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 5 mg/ml β-casein in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of cell lysate including enzyme and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by spotting 10 μl of the reaction mixture on to P-81 phosphocellulose paper. The paper was washed in 100 mm phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. A 12.5% gel for SDS-PAGE was prepared by using 50 μg of bacterially expressed wild type or mutant GST-CREB/ml as the substrate for phosphorylation. The cell extracts stimulated with bFGF in the absence or presence of various protein kinase inhibitors were applied to the gel. All gel renaturation and phosphorylation protocols were performed as described elsewhere (20Chao T.S. Abe M. Hershenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether bFGF exerts its stimulatory effect on the activation of transcription factor CREB and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription, we assayed the gene expression of CRE-containing TK promoter-reporter construct. Treatment of H19-7 cells with bFGF resulted in the increase of CRE-mediated gene transcription in a time-dependent manner, and it reached a plateau after 2 h (Fig. 1). To test the role of CREB phosphorylation on CRE-mediated gene transcription, cells were transfected transiently with pCRE-TK-Luc reporter plasmid plus mutant CREB expression vector, such as pCG-L, in which RRPSY amino acids 130–134 of CREB are replaced by RRSLY, or pCG-ΔCREB S119A, in which amino acids 88–101 of CREB are spliced out and Ser119, a target of protein kinase A that corresponds to Ser133 of CREB is replaced to Ala119. Expression of CREB proteins with the mutation of critically regulatory Ser133 residue significantly inhibited the activation of luciferase activity by bFGF (Fig. 1). These results imply that the stimulation of H19-7 cells with bFGF caused CREB activation, possibly through the phosphorylation of its Ser133 residue followed by the activation of CRE-mediated gene transcription. The functional role of CREB activation during FGF-induced differentiation of H19-7 cells was further examined. Treatment of H19-7 cells with bFGF induces differentiation at 39 °C at which large T antigen is inactivated (21Eves E.M. Kwon J. Downen M. Tucker M.S. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells are resistant to mitogenic stimulation by serum and express neuronal markers, such as neurofilament and brain type II sodium channel. A dominant-negative construct encoding CREB protein with Ser133 phosphorylation site mutated to Ala133(pRSV-CREB S133A) was used to block the activation of CREB, and a jellyfish green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) (pCMV-EGFP) was used as a marker for the transfected cells, respectively. Either empty or mutant CREB expression vector (pRSV-CREB S133A) was cotransfected along with pCMV-EGFP, and subsequently the formation of neurite outgrowth in GFP-positive cells was analyzed in H19-7 cells. Previously, it was determined that the efficacy for expressing cotransfected plasmids in the same cell is about 80% in H19-7 cells (22Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, untransfected control cells not expressing GFP had a similar percentage of differentiated cells (∼63%) in two separate transfection experiments. However, cells that express GFP in the mutant CREB-transfected population had only 27% differentiated cells, in contrast to 58% differentiated cells in the pCMV-transfected population. Taken together, these results suggest that a relatively stable CREB phosphorylation by bFGF is likely to play a role in the differentiation of neuronal H19-7 cells. To confirm the previous finding that bFGF exerts its stimulatory effect on the activation of CREB during CRE-mediated gene transcription, Western blot analysis was performed by using an antibody specific for the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB. During the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF, Ser133 residue in the CREB protein was phosphorylated rapidly and sustained for 1–2 h after growth factor stimulation (Fig. 3). Differences in CREB phosphorylation are known to be critical in the determination and regulation of EGF-mediated proliferation and NGF-induced differentiation of neuronal PC12 cells (5Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Like PC12, H19-7 cells respond differentially to EGF and bFGF. Although EGF treatment induces a proliferation at the permissive temperature (33 °C), the addition of bFGF, but not EGF, induces differentiation at the nonpermissive temperature (39 °C) (21Eves E.M. Kwon J. Downen M. Tucker M.S. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, it was examined whether CREB phosphorylation occurred differentially by EGF and bFGF in H19-7 cells. In contrast to prolonged CREB phosphorylation by bFGF, EGF treatment, leading to proliferation but not differentiation, induced transient CREB phosphorylation, and it was declined to basal levels within 30 min (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that stable CREB activation by bFGF is important to make a decision on the fate of hippocampal progenitor cell to terminally differentiate to neuronal cells. Upon binding to bFGF, its receptor dimerizes and activates an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity leading to the increase in intracellular calcium, phosphoinositide turnover, phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, and activation of immediate early genes, such as c-fos and myc (23Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To clarify the downstream signaling pathways of bFGF, the effect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors on bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, herbimycin A, a benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotic, which irreversibly and selectively inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases by reacting with thiol groups, completely blocked the CREB phosphorylation by bFGF in H19-7 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with tyrphostin 47, another selective inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, also decreased CREB phosphorylation to the basal levels, compared with that of bFGF alone (Fig. 4 A). Stimulation of bFGF receptors is known to activate Ras and a subsequent kinase cascade culminating in the activation of p42 and p44 ERKs (2Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To identify early events in the signaling pathway leading to CREB phosphorylation, the role of Ras activation was examined. Transient transfection of dominant-negative Ras mutant (pMT3RasN17) significantly inhibited the activation of ERK, but not CREB phosphorylation by bFGF (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that CREB is phosphorylated via Ras-independent signaling pathway during the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF. In neuronal PC12 cells, neurogenic NGF activates the ERKs, which in turn activate pp90 ribosomal S6 kinase family of Ser/Thr kinases (p90RSK), all three members of which were found to catalyze CREB Ser133 phosphorylation (14Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). A major pathway by which p90RSK is activated by growth factor receptors involves sequential activation of Raf, MEK, and ERK. It was previously shown that the stimulation of H19-7 cells with bFGF induced the activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, resulting in the differentiation (22Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To analyze the initial signals generated by Raf-1, H19-7 cells were transfected with a vector expressing ΔRaf-1:ER (24Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to estradiol (E2), ΔRaf-1:ER is activated within minutes, enabling one to monitor downstream signaling events after Raf-1 activation. As shown in Fig. 5 A, stimulation of ΔRaf-1:ER cells with bFGF caused a rapid and prolonged CREB phosphorylation, which was similar to that in H19-7 cells. To test whether CREB was phosphorylated by the Raf-1-MEK-ERK-p90RSKsignaling pathway, ΔRaf-1:ER cells were pretreated with 30 μm MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min before bFGF stimulation. Although PD98059 completely blocked the activation of ERK by bFGF in ΔRaf-1:ER cell (19Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), there was no significant inhibition of CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B), interestingly with a delay of initial CREB phosphorylation by ∼15 min. When ΔRaf-1:ER cells were stimulated with 1 μm estradiol leading to the activation of Raf-1 kinase followed by the sequential activation of ERK pathway and the differentiation of the cells (19Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), CREB was not phosphorylated at all (Fig. 4). The ERK induction by estradiol is due to selective Raf-1 activation, because no induction of ERK by estradiol was observed in the parent H19-7 cells lacking the ΔRaf-1:ER fusion protein (17Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicated that bFGF-induced signals leading to the CREB phosphorylation are not transmitted through Raf-MEK-ERK-p90RSK pathway in H19-7 cells. In addition, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP kinase-2), an enzyme that lies immediately downstream of p38 kinase, was recently shown to mediate CREB Ser133 phosphorylation in neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells exposed to bFGF (7Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of stress-activated protein kinases, such as JNK and p38 kinase, on bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation, H19-7 cells were pretreated with chemical p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580 or transiently transfected with kinase-deficient SEK mutant cDNA, and subsequently bFGF-dependent CREB phosphorylation and subsequent induction of luciferase activity by CRE-thymidine kinase promoter were measured. As shown in Fig.6, 30 μm SB203580 or kinase-deficient SEK mutant had no effect on the ability of bFGF to induce CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A) and to stimulate CRE-mediated luciferase activity (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that CREB phosphorylation is not mediated by the activation of stress-activated JNK or p38-MAPKAP kinase-2 pathway. As a control, we previously observed that pretreatment of SB203580 or transient transfection of kinase-inactive SEK results in a significant inhibition of p38 induced by anisomycin (25Chung K.C. Kim S.M. Rhang S. Lau L.F. Gomes I. Ahn Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4676-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or JNK activity by NMDA in H19-7 cells (26Chung K.C. Shin S.W. Yoo M. Lee M.Y. Lee H.W. Choe B.K. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, neither JNK nor p38 was shown to be significantly activated by activated Raf-1 (17Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or bFGF 2K. C. Chung, et al., unpublished observation. within the first few hours of stimulation in ΔRaf-1:ER and H19-7 cells. Consistent with the result in Fig. 5, pretreatment of the cells with 30 μm MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min did not inhibit the activation of reporter luciferase by bFGF (Fig. 6). As a positive control, the addition of adenylate cyclase activator, 10 μm forskolin, increased the luciferase activity ∼5-fold greater than that of FGF. Taken together, these results indicated that bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation is not mediated via the activation of stress-activated JNK or p38 signaling pathways. The binding of bFGF to its receptor is known to induce receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation at Tyr766, and activation of phospholipase C, which in turn activates PKC. Because Ser133 residue of CREB is contained within a consensus sequence of PKC phosphorylation and is phosphorylated by PKC (27Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H.I.II. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), we examined whether TPA-sensitive isoforms of PKC affect the levels of CREB phosphorylation during the FGF-induced differentiation of H19-7 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with competitive PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, or chelerythrine chloride failed to inhibit bFGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig.7 A), suggesting that bFGF stimulates CREB phosphorylation via a pathway distinct from that activated by PKC. In addition, bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation was not changed significantly with other PKC inhibitors, such as calphostin C and hypericine (data not shown). As a control, the PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was inhibited to the basal level by Ro-31-8220 and chelerythrine at a similar concentration (Fig.7 B). Many growth factors activate p70S6K, a protein kinase that is activated by a Ras-independent pathway (28Ming X.F. Burgering T. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and that appears to be triggered by the activation of PI-3K (29Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 30Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both CREB and CRE modulator, another member of the CREB family, were efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by p70S6K (15de Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The macrolide rapamycin is an efficient and specific inhibitor of the mitogen-induced activation of p70S6K (31Chung J.

https://openalex.org/W1509182464,"The Id proteins play an important role in proliferation, differentiation, and tumor development. We report here that Id gene expression can be regulated by the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), a receptor that also participates in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Specifically, we found that the IGF-IR activated by its ligand was a strong inducer of Id2 gene expression in 32D murine hemopoietic cells. This activation was not simply the result of cellular proliferation, as Id2 gene expression was higher in 32D cells stimulated by IGF-I than in cells exponentially growing in interleukin-3. The up-regulation of Id2 gene expression was largely dependent on the presence of insulin receptor substrate-1, a major substrate of the IGF-IR and a potent activator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The role of PI3K activity in the up-regulation of Id2 gene expression by the IGF-IR was confirmed by different methods and in different cell types. In 32D cells, the up-regulation of Id2 gene expression by the PI3K pathway correlated with interleukin-3 independence and inhibition of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2065472509,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcriptional mediators of interferon-responsive signaling pathways that are involved in antiviral defense, immune response, and cell growth regulation. To investigate the role of IRF proteins in the regulation of histone H4 gene transcription, we compared the transcriptional contributions of IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, and IRF-7 using transient transfection assays with H4 promoter/luciferase (Luc) reporter genes. These IRF proteins up-regulate reporter gene expression but IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 are more potent activators of the H4 promoter than IRF-2. Forced expression of different IRF combinations reveals that IRF-2 reduces IRF-1 or IRF-3 dependent activation, but does not affect IRF-7 function. Thus, IRF-2 may have a dual function in histone H4 gene transcription by acting as a weak activator at low dosage and a competitive inhibitor of other strongly activating IRFs at high levels. IRF-1/IRF-3 and IRF-1/IRF-7 pairs each mediate the highest levels of site II-dependent promoter activity and can up-regulate transcription by 120–150-fold. We also find that interferon γ up-regulates IRF-1 and site II-dependent promoter activity. This up-regulation is not observed when the IRF site is mutated or if cells are preloaded with IRF-1.

IRFs were initially identified as regulators of interferon genes in response to viral infection. However, it has subsequently been shown that there are at least nine cellular IRF proteins (IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, IRF-4/Pip/ICSAT, IRF-5, IRF-6, IRF-7, ICSBP/IRF8, and ISGF3γ/p48/IRF9), as well as virally encoded forms, with broad biological functions (1Vaughan P.S. van Wijnen A.J.

Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). All members of the IRF family share significant homology in the N-terminal 115 amino acids, which comprise the DNA-binding domain. For the IRF-3, IRF-4, IRF-5, IRF-8, and IRF-9 proteins, the homology extends into the C-terminal region with which these IRFs interact with other proteins or family members. Current data indicate that IRFs can function as transcriptional activators (e.g. IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-9), repressors (e.g. IRF-8), or both (e.g. IRF-2, IRF-4, and IRF-7). Studies with IRF-expressing cell lines and IRF knockout mice reveal that IRF family members have distinct roles in various biological processes, including cytokine signaling, responses to pathogens, cell growth regulation, and hematopoietic development (1Vaughan P.S. van Wijnen A.J.

Cell cycle control of histone gene transcription at the onset of S phase is required for the functional coupling of histone gene expression and DNA replication (26Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Marzluff W.F.

Transcriptional control of the human histone H4 gene designated FO108 (28Sierra F. Stein G. Stein J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7069-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has been extensively studied. The H4 gene is regulated by two multipartite proximal promoter elements (sites I and II), which together with two distal auxiliary domains (sites III and IV) modulate histone H4 promoter activity (27Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Site II mediates cell cycle control of histone H4 transcription by interacting with three distinct factors, including IRF-2/HiNF-M, CDP-cut/HiNF-D, and HiNF-P (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J.

Recently, other IRF proteins (e.g. IRF-3 and IRF-7) have been shown to contribute to transcriptional control via IRF-binding sites. For example, the formation of distinct heterodimers between activated IRF-3 and IRF-7 may lead to differential regulation of the IFN-α and IFN-β genes (2Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 35Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T.

Both IRF-3 and IRF-7 are constitutively present in several cell types and can be activated in response to different biological stimuli, including viral infection, type I interferons, and/or DNA damage (2Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These recent findings necessitate evaluation of the extent to which distinct combinations of IRF proteins may regulate histone H4 gene expression. To investigate the role of multiple IRF members in histone H4 gene transcription, we performed transfection studies with H4 promoter-luciferase reporter genes and a panel of IRF expression vectors. Our results suggest that IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, and IRF-7 can all actively regulate histone H4 gene expression and that specific IRF pairs (i.e. IRF-1/IRF-3 and IRF-1/IRF-7) are strong activators. The wild type H4 promoter/luciferase reporter gene construct wtH4/Luc was derived from pFO108 wt/CAT (30van Wijnen A.J. Ramsey-Ewing A.L. Bortell R. Owen T.A. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Cell.

The CAT gene was removed byPstI and HindIII cleavage and replaced by a 1.65-kilobase PstI/HindIII fragment spanning the luciferase (Luc) gene. The Luc gene was amplified from pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) by polymerase chain reaction amplification with two primers: forward PstI primer, 5′-gactgcagGCATTCCGGTACTGTTG-3′; reverse HindIII primer, 5′-gcaagcttACACGGCGATCTTTCC-3′; lowercase nucleotides were added to create restriction sites. The H4/Luc construct in which the IRF-binding site is mutated (IRF mutH4/Luc) was prepared from pMSP16-CAT (33Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Vaughan P.S. Wu S. Shakoori A.R. Lian J.B. Soprano K.J.

The 4X IRF/H4-Site II/Luc plasmid was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide cassette containing a tandemly repeated IRF-binding site (5′-gatccGCTTTCGGTTTTCAGCTTTCGGTTTTCAGATCCGCTTTCGGTTTTCAGCTTTCGGTTTTCa-3′; 5′-gatctGAAAACCGAAAGCTGAAAACCGAAAGCGGATCTGAAAACCGAAAGCTGAAAACCGAAAGCg-3′;BamHI/BglII overhangs) into theBamHI site of pFP201CAT (29Ramsey-Ewing A. van Wijnen A.J.

The FP201 segment of the H4 promoter spans nucleotides −97 to −38. All oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Beckman 1000M DNA synthesizer and all inserts were sequenced (ABI 100 model 377) to verify correct orientation and absence of polymerase chain reaction or chemical synthesis-related mutations. The 3X H4 distal site II wild type promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (3X H4 distal Site II/Luc) which contains three copies of an oligonucleotide spanning the distal segment of H4 site II (5′-CGCTTTCGGTTTTCAATCTGGTCCGATAC-3′) fused to the TATA box of the H2-L gene was a kind gift from Dr. Keiko Ozato (38Masumi A.

IRF expression constructs (pcDNA/IRF-1, pcDNA/IRF-2, and 6X-His-tagged human IRF-3 and IRF-7) were kindly provided by Dr. T. Maniatis (35Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M.

The expression constructs pcDNA IRF-1, pcDNA IRF-3, and pcDNA IRF-7 were subjected to coupled in vitrotranscription and translation with unlabeled methionine or [35S]methionine in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Aliquots of35S-labeled IRF-1 (5 μl), IRF-3 (20 μl), and IRF-7 (20 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel, which was subsequently dried and exposed for autoradiography. The bands for IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 were removed and incorporation of [35S]methionine for each protein was measured using an LS 6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The measured radioactivity (in cpm) was used to calculate the molar ratios of IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with unlabeled in vitrotranslated IRF proteins. Each reaction contained 10 fmol of32P-labeled double-stranded CCE oligomer, IRF protein, 2 μg of poly(dG-dC)·(dG-dC), 1 μg of poly (dI-dC)·(dI-dC), and 1 pmol of unlabeled competitor oligomers where indicated. CCE-wt is 5′-GATCCCGGCGCGCTTTCGGTTTTCA and CCE-mut is 5′-GATCCCGGCGCGCTTTCAGGTTTTCA. The binding reactions were separated in a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Actively proliferating cultures of NIH3T3 cells were maintained at subconfluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 0.2 μml-glutamine, at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1.5 × 105cells/well, and were transiently transfected 24 h later at ∼70% confluency by the Superfect transfection method (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). We co-transfected 0.8 μg of each H4/Luc reporter gene construct with different amounts of each IRF expression vector. The amount of DNA in each well was kept constant by supplementing the transfection mixture with the empty expression vector. Cells were also transfected with 50 ng/well of the pRL-CMV construct (Promega), which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter upstream of the Renilla luciferase gene, as an internal control for transfection efficiency (41Behre G. Smith L.T. Tenen D.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (, 28): 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared for luciferase assay or for Western blot analysis 24 h after transfection. To monitor the effect of IFN-γ, cells transfected with reporter gene constructs at 0.8 μg/well were incubated with 0–1.0 ng/ml IFN-γ at 24 h post-transfection, and analyzed 12 h after treatment. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS buffer 24 h after transfection and lysed with 1 × lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). The activity of Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency by calculating the ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C for 30 min), and protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total cellular protein were mixed with loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were saturated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (1 × PBS-T buffer) and 5% fat-free dry milk (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

After washing with 1 × PBS-T buffer containing 1% milk, blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:10,000 in milk/PBS-T buffer. Blots were then washed five times with the same buffer before visualization of immunoreactive protein bands by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Densitometry was performed by using the Alpha Imager 2000 densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein level of each IRF member in untransfected cells was set as control and the relative protein level of each IRF member in transfected cells was determined by dividing the densitometry measurements of IRF transfected cells by the densitometry measurements of the control. The CCE within site II of the histone H4 promoter has previously been shown to interact with IRF-1 and IRF-2 (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and has high similarity to the IRF-E and ISRE consensus elements. To determine whether more recently identified IRF family members (e.g.IRF-3 and IRF-7) are also capable of binding to the histone H4 promoter, we performed protein-DNA interaction studies with IRF proteins produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation. The IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel for radiometric quantitation (Fig.1, A and B). Approximately equimolar amounts of these IRF proteins were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for binding to an oligonucleotide spanning the CCE in the distal segment of histone H4 site II (Fig.1 C). All three proteins (Fig. 1), as well as IRF-2 (Ref. 14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S.

The relative intensities of the signals of protein-DNA complexes suggest that IRF proteins have different affinities for the same site (IRF-1 = IRF-2 > IRF-3 = IRF-7) (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Our results indicate that in addition to IRF-2 (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 are also capable of binding to the CCE in the histone H4 promoter. We have previously shown that the transcription factor IRF-2 can activate histone H4 gene expression (14Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L.

To determine whether IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 function as activators or repressors of histone H4 gene expression, we performed co-transfection assays with IRF expression vectors and histone H4 gene promoter/luciferase reporter gene constructs (Figs. 2 and3). We tested IRF-dependent activation in the context of the wild type histone H4 promoter spanning sites I and II, as well as with a mutant H4 promoter in which the IRF binding element in site II was altered by a two-nucleotide substitution that prevents IRF binding (33Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J.

The results show that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are each capable of activating transcription by 5–6-fold (Fig.3 A). For comparison, IRF-1 and IRF-2 increase transcription by ∼11- and 2-fold, respectively. When the IRF-binding site was mutated, activation of the histone H4 promoter by IRF factors was completely abrogated (Fig. 3 B). These results show that IRF-3 and IRF-7 can activate the histone H4 promoter via the IRF recognition motif in site II.Figure 3The effects of four IRFs on histone H4 transcription assayed with different promoter constructs. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 0.8 μg/well of different luciferase promoter constructs: A, wtH4/Luc; B, IRF mutH4/Luc; C, 4X IRF/H4-site II/Luc; D, 3X H4 distal site II/Luc. The cells were co-transfected with 0.4 μg/well of pcDNA/IRF-1, pcDNA/IRF-2, pcDNA/IRF-3, pcDNA/IRF-7, and pcDNA as control.

PARP-1 gene promoters from human, rat, and mouse have been cloned, and they share a structure common to housekeeping genes, as they lack a functional TATA box and contain multiple GC boxes, which bind the transcriptional activator Sp1. We have previously shown that, although Sp1 is important for rat PARP1 (rPARP) promoter activity, its finely tuned modulation is likely dependent on other transcription factors that bind the rPARP proximal promoter in vitro. In this study, we identified one such factor as NF1-L, a rat liver isoform of the nuclear factor 1 family of transcription factors. The NF1-L site on the rPARP promoter overlaps one of the Sp1 binding sites previously identified, and we demonstrated that binding of both factors to this composite element is mutually exclusive. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NF1-L has no effect by itself on rPARP promoter activity, but rather down-regulates the Sp1 activity by interfering with its ability to bind the rPARP promoter in order to modulate transcription of the rPARP gene.

All these studies show that, although PARP-1 is ubiquitously expressed, its modulation, likely through complex transcriptional regulation, is critical to major cellular functions. In order to better understand the transcriptional mechanisms regulating PARP-1 expression, the PARP-1 gene promoter has been identified and cloned from three mammalian species, human (29Ogura T.

In the case of the rat PARP-1 (rPARP) proximal promoter, we have shown that it is highly but not completely dependent on five Sp1 binding sites (35Potvin F. Roy R.J. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and that other nuclear proteins, including one likely belonging to the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) family of transcription factors (37Laniel M.A. Bergeron M.J. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), bind to and potentially regulate rPARP promoter transcription. In this study, we further characterize the rPARP promoter and demonstrate that it binds the rat liver form of NF1 known as NF1-L (38Paonessa G. Gounari F. Frank R. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3115-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we provide evidence that NF1-L does not actively modulate rPARP transcriptional activity but rather prevents Sp1 from binding the rPARP promoter in vitro and thus causes a concentration-dependent down-regulation of rPARP promoter activity. The rPARP promoter fragment pCR3 (Fig. 1), spanning region −103 to +13 relative to the mRNA start site, and its Sp1 triple-mutant derivative pCR3/F2-F3-F4m, have been described previously (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutant pCR3-L3m was produced by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using pCR3 as template and the synthetic oligomers L3m (5′-GCATGCCTGCAGTCGCGCTAAAAAAAAACCCCG-3′, mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface) and pCAT-3′ (5′-CTCAGATCCTCTAGAGTCG-3′). Unique PstI andXbaI sites (underlined in the primer sequences) were included for cloning purposes. Amplifications were performed in a final volume of 50 μl, and reaction mixtures contained 100 ng of DNA, 250 μm each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie-d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 μm each synthetic primer, and 3.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Using a GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler (PE Biosystems, Streetsville, Ontario, Canada), the samples were subjected to an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 180 s and were then processed through 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 61 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s, followed by a final elongation of 120 s at 72 °C. The resulting PCR products were run through a 1.5% agarose gel in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr) and were isolated using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The purified DNA fragments were then digested with PstI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) andXbaI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in thePstI-XbaI-linearized vector pCATbasic (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA insert of each recombinant plasmid was sequenced by chain-termination dideoxy sequencing (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) to confirm the mutations. The expression plasmid pPacNF1-L was constructed by amplifying the NF1-L insert from vector NF1–21/pBS (kindly provided by Dr Paolo Monaci, Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare, Rome, Italy), using the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-NF1 (5′-GAATTCCTCGAGGCAGTTATGTATTC-3′) and 3′-NF1 (5′-GAATTCCTCGAGGGTGGTCTGTCTGG-3′). A uniqueXhoI site (underlined in the primer sequences) was included for cloning purposes. The PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl, and the mixture contained 200 ng DNA, 250 μmeach dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2.5 μm each synthetic primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Using a GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler, the samples were subjected to an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and were then processed through 32 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 47 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 120 s, followed by a final elongation of 420 s at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product was run through a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE, 0.1 μg/ml EtBr, and was isolated using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit. The purified DNA fragment was then digested withXhoI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated into theXhoI-linearized vector pPac, which was obtained by removing the XhoI-inserted Sp1 cDNA from vector pPacSp1 (kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske, Institut für Tumorforschung, Philipps Universität, Marburg, Germany). The recombinant plasmid was then sequenced by chain-termination dideoxy sequencing (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) to confirm the reading frame. Crude nuclear extracts from rat pituitary GH4C1 cells (kindly provided by Dr David D. Moore, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were prepared essentially as described previously (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J.

BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar) and kept frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C until use. The NF1-l-containing rat liver carboxymethyl (CM)-Sepharose fraction has been described previously (41Roy R.J. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For EMSA, the 140-bp HindIII-XbaI pCR3 or pCR3/F2-F3-F4m fragments or double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides bearing either the L3 sequence from the rPARP promoter (5′-CACAGCAGTCGCGCTGGAACCCAACCCCGCCATG-3′; Ref. 37Laniel M.A. Bergeron M.J.

Methods in Molecular Biology. 148. Human Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 13-30Google Scholar) and used as probes. Approximately 2 × 104 cpm (except in Fig. 2, where 4 × 104cpm were used) of labeled DNA probe was incubated for ∼8 min at room temperature with GH4C1 nuclear extract or NF1-l-enriched CM-Sepharose fraction in the presence of 1 μg or 200 ng, respectively, of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 50 mm KCl in buffer D (10 mm HEPES, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels (4% for the pCR3/F2-F3-F4m probe, 6% for the pCR3 probe, 8% for the oligonucleotide probes) run against Tris/glycine buffer at 4 °C, as described previously (43Laniel M.A. Béliveau A. Guérin S.L. Moss T. Methods in Molecular Biology. 148. Human Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 13-30Google Scholar). Competition experiments were performed using EMSA conditions similar to those described above, except that the protein extracts were incubated with the pCR3-labeled probe in the presence of molar excesses (as specified in the caption to Figs. 2 and 5 A) of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the target sequence of CTF/NF-I (see above), the high affinity binding site for Sp1 (5′-GATCATATCTGCGGGGCGGGGCAGACACAG-3′) (44Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), the PARP-1 promoter initiator sequence (5′-GATCGCGCCGCCAGGCATCAGCAATCTATCCTG-3′),3 L3, or L3m (see above). In the case of the pCR3/F2-F3-F4m fragment, the GH4C1 protein extract was incubated with the labeled probe in the presence of molar excesses (as specified in the caption to Fig. 6) of theHindIII-XbaI pCR3 fragment (which was isolated from a 1.5% agarose gel in 1× TAE, 0.1 μg/ml EtBr and purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit), or the unlabeled oligonucleotides CTF/NF-I or Sp1 (see above).Figure 6Co-transfection experiments in rat GH4C1 andDrosophila SL2 cells. A, both the wild-type rPARP promoter-bearing plasmid pCR3 (black columns) and its mutated derivative pCR3-L3m (white columns) were transiently transfected into GH4C1 cells along with the NF1-L expression plasmid (0.5 or 1 μg). As a negative control, pCR3 was also cotransfected along with the empty vector pSI (which was used for constructing the NF1-L expression plasmid). CAT activities were measured and normalized as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as percentage of CAT activity relative to the level directed by either pCR3 and pCR3-L3m when cotransfected with the control plasmid pSI. Standard deviation is provided for each value shown. B, the rPARP promoter-bearing plasmid pCR3 was transfected into Drosophila SL2 cells along with the empty vector pPac, or with expression plasmids encoding either NF1-L (0.2, 0.5, or 1 μg) or Sp1 (1 μg), either individually or in combination. CAT activities were measured and normalized to β-galactosidase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviation is provided for each selected condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For supershift experiments, similar EMSA conditions as described above were used, except that following formation of the DNA-protein complexes, 1.5 μl of pre-immune rabbit serum, anti-NF1-L rabbit serum (kindly provided by Prof. P. C. van der Vliet, Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands) or anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added and incubation allowed to proceed for another 8 min. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) footprinting analysis of the rPARP promoter fragment pCR5 (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which encompasses the pCR3 region, was performed using 5 μl of the NF1-l-containing CM-Sepharose fraction. Briefly, after pCR5 was 5′-end-labeled on the top strand, 3 × 104 cpm labeled probe was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the protein extract and treated with DNase I (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) as described previously (45Guérin S.L. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Digestion products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. For dimethylsulfate (DMS) methylation interference, the 140-bpHindIII-XbaI pCR3 fragment was 5′-end-labeled on the top strand and partially methylated with DMS essentially as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 12.8-12.10Google Scholar). Once methylated, 6 × 104 cpm labeled probe was incubated with 10 μl of the NF1-l-containing CM-Sepharose fraction in buffer D and DNA-protein complexes were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. The NF1-l-DNA complex was then visualized by autoradiography and isolated by electroelution (47Harvey M. Brisson I. Guérin S.L. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 943-945Google Scholar). The isolated labeled DNA was finally treated with piperidine (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 12.8-12.10Google Scholar) and further analyzed on a 8% sequencing gel. Rat GH4C1 cells were grown in Ham's F-10 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and 20 μg/ml gentamycin, under 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells (SL2, ATCC CRL-1963) were grown in Schneider insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin at 27 °C without CO2. The GH4C1 cells were transiently transfected with either pCR3 or its mutant derivative pCR3-L3m by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (48Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), using 15 μg of test plasmid and 5 μg of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene-encoding plasmid pXGH5 (49Selden R.F. Burke-Howie K. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In the case where the expression vectors NF1-L/pSI (kindly provided by Dr Winnie Eskild, Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway) or NF1-X/pcDNA3 (kindly provided by Dr. Bin Gao, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA) were added, GH4C1 cells were transfected with GeneSHUTTLE-20 cationic liposome (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montréal, Quebec, Canada), using 1 μg of test plasmid, 0.5 μg of pXGH5, and the expression vectors as described in the caption to Fig. 5 B. The SL2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, using 13 μg of test plasmid, 5 μg of the β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene-encoding plasmid pAc5/V5-His/LacZ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the pPacSp1 or pPacNF1-L expression vectors as described in the legend to Fig. 6 A. CAT activities were measured as described previously (50Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.P. Guérin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and normalized to either hGH secreted into the culture medium (for GH4C1), which was assayed using a radioimmunoassay kit (Medicorp, Montréal, Quebec, Canada), or lacZ produced in the cells (for SL2), which was measured as described (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each single value is expressed as either 100× (% CAT in 4 h)/ng of hGH for GH4C1, or (% CAT in 4 h)/(lacZ/min/ml) for SL2, and corresponds to the mean of at least two individual transfection experiments performed in triplicate. Standard deviation for the CAT assay is provided for each transfected plasmid and for each cell type. Only values 3 times greater than the background level caused by the reaction mixture alone (usually corresponding to ∼0.15% chloramphenicol conversion) were considered significant. We have previously demonstrated that, although Sp1 specifically binds to (Fig. 2, A andB) and strongly transactivates the GC-rich rPARP promoter, it is not sufficient to account for all of its transcriptional activity (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a nuclear protein likely belonging to the NF1 family of transcription factors was shown to bind to the rPARP minimal promoter region, which extends from −103 to +13 (pCR3, see Fig.1 and Ref. 37Laniel M.A. Bergeron M.J. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fact, EMSA analysis, using a heparin-Sepharose- and CM-Sepharose-enriched rat liver nuclear extract, revealed the specific binding of a protein that is clearly distinct from Sp1 (Fig. 2 A). The interaction of this rat liver DNA-binding protein with the rPARP promoter likely occurs through a putative NF1 binding site (L3) previously identified on the pCR3 fragment (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Laniel M.A. Bergeron M.J. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), since formation of the DNA-protein complex was completely abolished by competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide bearing the target sequence for human CTF/NF-I (42de Vries E. van Driel W. van den Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, competition using unlabeled oligonucleotides bearing unrelated sequences such as that for Sp1 or the initiator sequence from the PARP promoter3 had no effect on pCR3-rat liver protein complex formation (Fig. 2 A). However, when using a crude nuclear protein extract from rat pituitary GH4C1 cells, only Sp1 forms a complex with the pCR3 fragment, since its formation is prevented by an Sp1-specific antiserum but not by a pre-immune or an NF1-l-specific antiserum (Fig. 2 B). Using DNase I and DMS methylation interference footprinting, we precisely mapped the binding site of the NF1-like protein to the L3 region of the rPARP proximal promoter (Fig.3, A and B), which we had previously identified (37Laniel M.A. Bergeron M.J. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as a potential NF1 target site due to its similarity both to the consensus sequence recognized by members of the NF1 family (42de Vries E. van Driel W. van den Heuvel S.J.L. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and to the proximal silencer-1 element from the rat growth hormone gene (52Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Anzivino M.J. Moore D.D. Guérin S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the footprinted L3 region completely overlaps the F2 region (see Figs. 1 and 3), which was shown to bind Sp1 (36Bergeron M.J. Leclerc S. Laniel M.A. Poirier G.G. Guérin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to unequivocally identify the rat liver L3-binding protein as a genuine member of the NF1 family, we performed supershift experiments using an antiserum specific to the rat liver form of NF1 known as NF1-L (38Paonessa G. Gounari F. Frank R. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3115-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the rat liver DNA-binding protein formed a complex (NF1-L) of similar electrophoretic mobility using either the NF1 consensus binding site or the L3 sequence as the labeled probe, and this complex was efficiently supershifted by the anti-NF1-L antiserum (C1). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the same rat liver protein bound the pCR3 DNA fragment to form a specific complex (NF1-L), which was supershifted by the anti-NF1-L antiserum (C1), but not by the pre-immune rabbit serum (PS) or by an anti-Sp1 antibody (Sp1Ab). We therefore conclude that the rat liver protein that binds to the rPARP p"

Mammals and amphibians contain, in the upper digestive tract mucosa, alcohol dehydrogenases of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, active with ethanol and retinol. In the present work, we searched for a similar enzyme in an avian species (Gallus domesticus). We found that chicken does not contain the homologous enzyme from the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family but an oxidoreductase from the aldo-keto reductase family, with retinal reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. The amino acid sequence shows 66–69% residue identity with the aldose reductase and aldose reductase-like enzymes. Chicken aldo-keto reductase is a monomer of M r 36,000 expressed in eye, tongue, and esophagus. The enzyme can oxidize aliphatic alcohols, such as ethanol, and it is very efficient in all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal reduction (k cat/K m = 5,300 and 32,000 mm−1·min−1, respectively). This finding represents the inclusion of the aldo-keto reductase family, with the (α/β)8 barrel structure, into the scenario of retinoid metabolism and, therefore, of the regulation of vertebrate development and tissue differentiation. Enzymes of the short chain and medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase families have been demonstrated to participate in the oxidoreduction of ethanol and retinoids. Mammals and amphibians contain, in the upper digestive tract mucosa, alcohol dehydrogenases of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, active with ethanol and retinol. In the present work, we searched for a similar enzyme in an avian species (Gallus domesticus). We found that chicken does not contain the homologous enzyme from the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family but an oxidoreductase from the aldo-keto reductase family, with retinal reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities.

ADH1 is the classical enzyme responsible for liver ethanol metabolism, which also exhibits activity with retinoids (6Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem.

The SDR superfamily contains an alcohol dehydrogenase that accounts for ethanol metabolism in Drosophila (18Schwartz M.F. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

Within the AKR superfamily, several groups of enzymes with related structure and function have been established (3Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Among them, the aldose reductase (AR), aldehyde reductase, and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) families have been profoundly characterized in mammals. The AR family has been suggested to be involved in the development of secondary diabetic complications (21Gabbay K.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) because of its ability to reduce glucose to sorbitol (22Wermuth B. Burgisser H. Bohren K. von Wartburg J.P. Eur. J.

Other roles in aldehyde detoxification, osmotic homeostasis, steroid conversion, and catecholamine metabolism have been also proposed for AR (23Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.K. Hunsaker L.A.

Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) sharing 70% amino acid identity with AR sequences. Vitamin A or retinol (ROL) is the precursor of retinal (RAL) and of retinoic acid (RA). RAL is necessary for vision, and RA is essential for growth, development, and cellular functions (32Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven, New York1994Google Scholar, 33Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemichal and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany1999Crossref Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of RA from vitamin A implies reversible oxidation of ROL to RAL and irreversible oxidation of RAL to RA. The latter compound, in the all-trans- and 9-cis-isomeric forms, exerts its regulatory function bound to nuclear receptors (34Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). In photoreceptor cells, 11-cis-RAL binds to opsin to form rhodopsin. When one photon is absorbed by rhodopsin, 11-cis-RAL is isomerized to all-trans-RAL, which dissociates from opsin. In all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA synthesis from ROL, and in rhodopsin regeneration, several oxidoreduction steps occur, which are catalyzed by MDR and/or SDR enzymes, important for the regulation of these processes (15Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 20Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). No activity with retinoids has been ever reported in enzymes from any AKR group. In this study we have recognized an activity in the upper digestive tract of chicken, similar to that of ADH from the MDR family previously identified in mammals (11Moreno A. Parés X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1128-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Julià P. Farrés J. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and amphibians (17Peralba J.M. Cederlund E. Crosas B. Moreno A. Julià P. Martı́nez S.E. Persson B. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26021-26026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, this avian enzyme was not an ADH of the MDR family, but, surprisingly, an AKR. Thus, we have here characterized the first member of the AKR superfamily with NADP(H)-dependent retinal reductase and ethanol dehydrogenase activities. Chicken (Gallus domesticus) tissues were obtained immediately after death from a local slaughterhouse. The tissues were cut, cleaned, rinsed in ice-cold distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For enzyme analysis, tissues were thawed, fragmented, and homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6 (1:1 w/v). Tissue samples (tongue and esophagus, 390 g) were pooled and homogenized in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. The homogenate was centrifuged (27,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), filtered through glass wool, ultracentrifuged (85,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and filtered again. The supernatant was dialyzed against the initial buffer and applied to a CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 400 ml of buffer followed by a linear gradient (500 ml) of increasing NaCl concentration (0–250 mm). The fractions exhibiting octanol dehydrogenase activity were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon concentrator (Diaflo PM10 membranes). The preparation was dialyzed against the initial buffer and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 20 cm). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the active fractions were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.2, and applied to an HPLC system (Waters 600) equipped with a Q column. Elution of the enzyme was performed with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (0–300 mm). The active fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.2, and applied to a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with a Sephacryl-S200HR column. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Homogeneity was assessed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and the silver stain technique. Electrophoresis on starch gel was performed as described (11Moreno A. Parés X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1128-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the gel buffer contained 0.74 mm NADP instead of NAD. Gel slices were activity stained with 1 m ethanol or 0.1 m 2-buten-1-ol and 0.1 mm NADP. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Biflex spectrometer equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) in linear positive ion mode and using a 19 kV acceleration voltage. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of a saturated solution of the matrix in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile, 2:1, and a protein solution at a concentration range of 1–10 μm. From this mixture, 1 μl was spotted on the sample slide and allowed to evaporate to dryness. Mass spectra were calibrated externally using appropriate protein standards. Protein for sequence analysis was reduced with dithiothreitol and carboxymethylated with iodoacetate as described for ADH (17Peralba J.M. Cederlund E. Crosas B. Moreno A. Julià P. Martı́nez S.E. Persson B. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26021-26026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Aliquots were then submitted to proteolytic digestions with trypsin, Lys-C protease, N-Asp protease, or Glu-C protease in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate or to treatment with CNBr in 70% formic acid. Peptide mixtures were purified by reverse phase HPLC on C18 columns with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions obtained were submitted to analysis in an ABI Procise HT sequencer, after prescreening in a Voyager DEPRO matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer to secure finding relevant fragments for sequence analysis. Several peptides were also submitted to collision-induced dissociation sequence analysis with a Micromass quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-ES ionization inlet. 2D. Hirschberg, E. Cederlund, A. P. Jonsson, B. Crosas, J. Farrés, X. Parés, T. Bergman, and H. Jörnvall, in preparation. Poly(A)+RNA was isolated from chicken tongue and esophagus with the Quickprep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first strand of the cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA poly(A)+ with You-Prime first strand beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a T17 primer or the R0R1-(dT)17 primer adaptor (37Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The resulting pools of cDNA were used as templates in a polymerase chain reaction with CHICK1 (5′-ATGCCIGTIYTIGGIYTIGGIACITGG-3′, amino acid positions 16–24) and CHICK2 (5′-TGIGGIACIGGDATIGCICKCCART-3′, amino acid positions 302–310), designed from peptide sequences. To obtain the 5′ and 3′ cDNA ends, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (37Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) was followed. For the amplification of poly(A) end, CHICK3 (5′-AGGTTCTGATCCGGTTC-3′, amino acid positions 244–249), CHICK4 (5′-GACTTCGAGCTGTCTAA-3′, amino acid positions 285–290) specific primers, and R0(5′-AAGGATCCGTCGACATC-3′) and R1 (5′-GACATCGATAATACGAC-3′), corresponding to the primer-adaptor sequence, were used in two nested PCR. To obtain the 5′ end, the first strand of cDNA was synthesized using a sequence-specific oligonucleotide primer (CHICK5, 5′-AAGTTTGAGATTCCAATGG-3′, amino acid positions 162–168) with AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), at 42 °C. A poly(A) tail was added to the cDNA pool with deoxynucleotide terminal transferase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The second strand of cDNA was synthesized with the R0R1-(dT)17 primer adaptor and Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplification of 5′ end was performed using CHICK6 (5′-ACTTAGTGACAACGAAGAGG-3′, amino acid positions 79–84), CHICK7 (5′-CCCAACCCCAACACCGGCAT-3′, amino acid positions 19–25), R0 and R1 primers, in two nested PCR. PCR amplifications were performed with the Expand High Fidelity kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR products were directly sequenced or phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(+), and sequenced (AlfExpress, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissues by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (38Chomczynski P. Sauhi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). RNA-poly(A)+ was isolated from 20-μg aliquots of total RNA with the Quickprep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA samples were run in 1× MOPS, 2.2 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and transferred onto Nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by means of a TurboblotterTM(Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was immobilized by a 20-s pulse of UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). A 870-bp chicken AKR DNA-specific probe (50 ng) was labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random priming method (Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Promega). Membrane prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% SDS, pH 7.2, at 65 °C, overnight. Membranes were washed in 40 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 7.2, at 65 °C, for 1 h and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. Activity was determined by monitoring the change in NADPH concentration at 25 °C in a Varian Cary 219 spectrophotometer by measurements at 340 nm, in 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was measured as reported (39Fernández M.R. Biosca J.A. Torres D. Crosas B. Parés X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37869-37875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of reduced coenzyme formed or utilized per min, at 25 °C, based on an absorption coefficient of 6220 m−1·cm−1 at 340 nm. Steroids were dissolved in 0.3 m methanol. Methanol was not a substrate nor an inhibitor of chicken AKR under the present conditions (maximum methanol concentration reached in the assay was 45 mm). ROL oxidation and RAL reduction were performed according to a published procedure (40Parés X. Julià P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), using reported absorption coefficients (14Crosas B. Allali-Hassani A. Martı́nez S.E. Martras S. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Farrés J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25180-25187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were obtained from activity measurements, with substrate concentrations that ranged from at least 0.1×K m to 8× K m. Each individual rate measurement was run in duplicate. Three independent determinations were performed for each kinetic constant. Kinetic constants were calculated using ENZFITTER (Elsevier Biosoft) and expressed as the means ± S.D. A three-dimensional model of chicken AKR was constructed by adopting its amino acid sequence into the known fold of human AR (Protein Data Bank entry code1ADS) (41Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 458-460Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar) using the ICM program (version 2.7, Molsoft LLC, 1997), as described (14Crosas B. Allali-Hassani A. Martı́nez S.E.

The quality of the model was assessed with the PROCHECK program (42Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). To study the interaction of retinoids with AKR, the Protein Data Bank coordinates of human AR and the chicken AKR model were used. To prepare human AR structure for docking simulations, hydrogen atoms were added, methyl groups were rotated, and the most severe atomic contacts were minimized. RAL in an extended conformation (carbon χ angles of single bonds = 180°) was placed into the substrate-binding pocket in the same orientation as the ternary ligand testosterone (43Bennett M.J. Albert R.H. Jez J.M. Ma H. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Structure. 1997; 5: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nonrigid docking simulations were based upon a Monte Carlo procedure (44Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), allowing free movement of the substrate, of its rotable bonds, and of the χ angles of the residues inside a 5 Å radius from the docked substrate. Additional distance restraints were imposed: 1.0–2.4 Å between the aldehyde oxygen of RAL and the catalytic hydroxyl group of Tyr48, and 2.0–2.4 Å between C-15 of RAL and C-4 of NADPH. Similarly, docking simulations with testosterone were performed. Energy values were calculated with the ICM program as reported (14Crosas B. Allali-Hassani A. Martı́nez S.E. Martras S. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Farrés J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25180-25187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein and DNA sequences were searched in the GenBank, EMBL, PIR, and SwissProt data bases with the FASTA (45Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9328) Google Scholar) and BLAST (46Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) algorithms. The Internet AKR Web page was regularly consulted to update information. Sequence alignments were performed using the GCG program PILEUP. Bootstrap (1000 trials) neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were calculated by means of the CLUSTALW program (47Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) and displayed with TREEVIEW program (48Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Several ADH-type bands were detected on starch gel electrophoresis (Fig.1) because of their NADP(H)-dependent activity staining with 2-buten-1-ol. A putative FALDH (or ADH3) appeared as an anodic band with variable intensity in all tissues analyzed. The nature of this band was assessed by glutathione-dependent activity staining with formaldehyde in duplicate gel slices (not shown). Moreover, a cathodic band detected in liver homogenates could correspond to ADH1 (49Estonius M. Karlsson C. Fox E.A. Hoog J.O. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Davidson W.S. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a previously unidentified anodic band with lower mobility than FALDH appeared in homogenates from eye, tongue and esophagus when 2-buten-1-ol or ethanol was used as a substrate. The novel enzyme form (later recognized as an AKR) was purified from tongue and esophagus (TableI). In the CM-Sepharose chromatography, an octanol dehydrogenase activity peak was detected in the gradient fractions. In agreement with the results of starch gel electrophoresis, another peak of activity corresponding to FALDH, which overlapped with the major protein peak, was eluted by the initial washing and, therefore, well separated from the novel enzymatic form. The 2′,5′-ADP-agarose resin bound weakly the chicken enzyme, which eluted in the washing step, delayed with respect to the major protein peak. The HPLC Q column step resulted in a 2-fold increase in the specific activity, but contaminating proteins remained in the fractions corresponding to the octanol dehydrogenase peak. Finally, the fast protein liquid chromatography purification step with a Sephacryl S200-HR column resulted in a homogeneous enzyme, as demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). The purified preparation showed a specific activity of 0.92 unit/mg with octanol (Table I).Table IPurification of chicken AKRVolumeTotal activityProtein concentrationSpecific activityPurificationYieldmlunitsmg/mlunits/mgfold%Homogenate80028.9270.00131100CM-Sepharose22.541.80.177142′,5′-ADP-agarose103.261.20.2720811HPLC (Q column)101.40.1320.534084.8FPLC (Sephacryl S200-HR)30.490.1740.927101.7Activity was measured using 500 μm octanol, 80 μm NADP+ in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10. Open table in a new tab Activity was measured using 500 μm octanol, 80 μm NADP+ in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10. With the Sephacryl S200-HR column chromatography, a molecular mass of 36.2 kDa was estimated for the native enzyme using a set of proteins as standards. Moreover, molecular mass values of 36 and 36.6 kDa were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) and mass spectrometry, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the native form is a monomer. Before any data from peptide sequences were available, the first attempt to clone the cDNA was based on degenerated primers deduced from consensus sequences of vertebrate ADH, which were used in the PCR with cDNA from tongue and esophagus. This strategy only produced DNA fragments corresponding to chicken ADH1, which could be marginally expressed in tongue and esophagus, because no active ADH1 was found by starch gel electrophoresis in these tissues (Fig. 1). These preliminary results suggested that no enzyme homologous to mammalian ADH4 or amphibian ADH8 is expressed in the upper digestive tract from chicken. We therefore decided to investigate the nature of the novel chicken enzyme by protein analysis. However, attempts at direct sequencer degradation gave no result, suggesting that the N terminus was blocked. Therefore, different sets of the carboxymethylated protein were cleaved with proteolytic enzymes. After fractionation with reverse phase HPLC and subsequent sequencer analysis, scans against data banks showed that the peptides obtained were homologs to fragments of AKR enzymes. Hence, the present enzyme was concluded to be a novel type of AKR, with ADH-like activity. Because of the initial failure to get a cDNA sequence with conventional ADH primers, impurities in the protein preparation, and initial unclarities between protein and cDNA data, the protein analysis was continued until essentially the entire amino acid sequence had been determined by sequencer analysis of 57 peptides from five separate digests (with CNBr, trypsin, N-Asp, Lys-C, or Glu-C proteases), covering 311 of 316 residues, i.e. all residues except positions 65–69. Finally, the N terminus was proven to be acetylated by collision-induced dissociation analysis in a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer of the N-terminal fragment from the Glu-C protease digest, which started with acetyl-Ala, by removal of the initiator Met from the primary translation product.2 Using oligonucleotide primers designed according to the peptide sequences, a DNA fragment of 870 bp was obtained by the PCR. The rapid amplification of cDNA ends method generated three additional DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ end (104 and 105 bp) and"
https://openalex.org/W2025974060,"a-Agglutinin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a cell adhesion glycoprotein expressed on the surface of cells of a mating type and consists of an anchorage subunit Aga1p and a receptor binding subunit Aga2p. Cell wall attachment of Aga2p is mediated through two disulfide bonds to Aga1p (Cappellaro, C., Baldermann, C., Rachel, R., and Tanner, W. (1994) EMBO J.13, 4737–4744). We report here that purified Aga2p was unstable and had low molar specific activity relative to its receptor α-agglutinin. Aga2p co-expressed with a 149-residue fragment of Aga1p formed a disulfide-linked complex with specific activity 43-fold higher than Aga2p expressed alone. Circular dichroism of the complex revealed a mixed α/β structure, whereas Aga2p alone had no periodic secondary structure. A 30-residue Cys-rich Aga1p fragment was partially active in stabilization of Aga2p activity. Mutation of either or both Aga2p cysteine residues eliminated stabilization of Aga2p. Thus the roles of Aga1p include both cell wall anchorage and cysteine-dependent conformational restriction of the binding subunit Aga2p. Mutagenesis of AGA2 identified only C-terminal residues of Aga2p as being essential for binding activity. Aga2p residues 45–72 are similar to sequences in soybeanNod genes, and include residues implicated in interactions with both Aga1p (including Cys68) and α-agglutinin. a-Agglutinin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a cell adhesion glycoprotein expressed on the surface of cells of a mating type and consists of an anchorage subunit Aga1p and a receptor binding subunit Aga2p.

The a- and α-agglutinins, expressed byMAT a and MATα cells, respectively, interact directly with 1:1 stoichiometry. Exposure to the pheromone expressed by the opposite mating type induces agglutinin expression and thus facilitates the agglutination reaction (1Lipke P.N. Kurjan J. Microbiol.

The 725-amino acid Aga1p precursor includes hydrophobic N and C termini implicated in transfer into the secretory pathway and GPI anchor attachment, respectively. The remainder of Aga1p has 55% serine and threonine residues, consistent with the high level of O-glycosylation reported in analogs from other yeasts (1Lipke P.N. Kurjan J. Microbiol.

A. 2000; 97: 12158-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Aga2p is a small glycoprotein expressed only byMAT a cells. It consists of 69 residues after cleavage of an 18-residue signal sequence, and at least 10 of the 21 serine and threonine residues are O-glycosylated (19Cappellaro C. Hauser K. Mrsa V. Watzele M. Watzele G. Gruber C. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4081-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cys residues at positions 7 and 50 of mature Aga2p (corresponding to positions 25 and 68 of the open reading frame) anchor it to the cell surface through Aga1p; both cysteine residues must be mutated to lose cellular agglutinability (20Cappellaro C. Baldermann C. Rachel R. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4737-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Aga2p is necessary and sufficient for binding to α-agglutinin, and binding is tight and practically irreversible over the time course of a mating reaction (21Lipke P.N. Terrance K. Wu Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 483-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zhao H. Shen Z.-M. Kahn P.C. Lipke P.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2874-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Synthetic or proteolytic peptides containing the ten C-terminal residues of Aga2p are sufficient to bind α-agglutinin, but at concentrations 4- to 5-fold higher than the full-length peptide (20Cappellaro C. Baldermann C. Rachel R. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4737-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that this region has a major binding determinant and that carbohydrate or structural features of the full-length protein contribute to binding. We purified and characterized Aga2p alone and in complexes with fragments of Aga1p to characterize its activity and structure. We have also characterized the effects of a number of mutations inAGA2. These studies have identified regions and specific residues in each subunit important in subunit interactions. The results have also clarified the role of specific Aga2p residues in interaction with the receptor α-agglutinin. Escherichia coli strains TG1 and DH5α were used for plasmid analysis and subcloning. Supercompetent E. coli strain XL2 Blue (Stratagene), was used to clone inverse PCR products. The a-agglutinin constructs were expressed in S. cerevisiae strains isogenic to W303-1A (MAT a ade2-1 can1-100 trp1-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112). The biochemical analysis of a-agglutinin utilized the W303MAT a/MATα diploid or the isogenicMATαagα1::LEU2 haploid. Assays of mutated AGA2 alleles were done in the isogenicMAT a strain W2-UL, which was created by replacing the aga2::URA3 allele in strain W2 (16de Nobel H. Pike J. Lipke P.N. Kurjan J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with an aga2::LEU2 derived from theNdeI-DraIIIura3::LEU2 fragment from pRS306ΔU-LEU (provided by S. Cunningham). Agglutinin subunits were expressed in S. cerevisiae from YEpPGK, a URA3-containing expression vector that contains the PGK promoter and terminator sequences (22Kang Y.S. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); pRS316, a URA3-containing centromeric plasmid (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). All primer sequences and construction details are available upon request from the corresponding author. N- and C-terminal Histidine-tagged versions of Aga2p were constructed in YEpPGK using pPGK-AGA2 as template with standard PCR and restriction techniques (16de Nobel H. Pike J. Lipke P.N. Kurjan J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct insertion. An AGA2 clone containing its homologous promoter was created by PCR amplification of about 1200 bp of the AGA2 upstream sequences from W303-1A genomic DNA. The product was subcloned into pRS316 to make pRS316-AGA2-us. An intact AGA2 gene was reconstructed by subcloning the EcoRI-BamHIAGA2 fragment from YEpPGK-AGA2 into pRS316-AGA2-us. The EcoRI-BamHI fragments from various AGA2 mutants were also subcloned into pRS316-AGA2-us to construct mutant genes expressed from theAGA2 promoter on a CEN plasmid. AGA1 DNA was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR (Expand Long Template PCR system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). The product was cloned into pGEM-T to make pGEM-AGA1 (Promega, Madison, WI) and was subsequently used as template for polymerase chain reactions in the construction of other plasmids. pRS424-AGA1(containing the entire open reading frame of AGA1) and pRS424-AGA1-(1–664) (which lacks the GPI anchor sequence) were constructed following amplification of pGEM-AGA1. To construct YEpPGK-AGA1-(1–149), which encodes the 22-residue signal sequence and the first 127 amino acid residues of the mature Aga1p, insert DNA was amplified using pGEM-AGA1 as template and subcloned into YEpPGK. The YEpPGK-AGA1-(1–149)XhoI-SalI fragment, which containsAGA1-(1–149) and the PGK promoter and terminator, was subcloned into pRS424 to create pRS424-AGA1-(1–149). All other truncation and deletion plasmids shown in Fig. 1 B, as well as a C-terminal HA-tagged version of pRS424-AGA1-(1–149) were constructed by PCR using pGEM-AGA1 as template with appropriate primers and subcloning the product into pRS-424-AGA1-(1–149). Random mutagenesis followed by gap repair recombination was performed as described in Muhlrad et al. (25Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Random PCR mutagenesis was carried out on YEpPGK-AGA2, varying ratios of MgCl:MnCl and limiting amounts of each nucleotide (25Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and isolated from an agarose gel with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). C-terminal AGA2mutants were generated using YEpPGK-AGA2 DNA as template in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using an upstream oligonucleotide containing an EcoRI site and downstream oligonucleotides with the desired mutation and a BamHI site. The resulting mutant AGA2 EcoRI-BamHI fragments were subcloned into YEpPGK. Additional mutants were made by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutantaga2 genes were sequenced to confirm that no extraneous mutations were present. Internal regions of AGA2 for which mutations obtained in the random mutagenesis affected agglutination were subjected to further mutagenesis using a double-PCR method (26Kallal L. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2897-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A primary PCR reaction with pPGK-AGA2 as a template used appropriate primers to create a fragment of ∼200 bp. This fragment was purified and used as an upstream mega-primer in a second PCR reaction; the products were cloned into YEpPGK and sequenced. 2.5 × 107/ml in synthetic medium before harvest and collection of the excreted protein in the culture supernatants. The supernatants were buffered to pH 5.8 with sodium acetate and concentrated ∼10-fold through a Millipore filter with a 30,000-Da cutoff. Aga2p expressed from pPGK-AGA2 was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mmEDTA, 0.01% NaN3. The suspension was lyophilized, resuspended in the same buffer with 10% (v/v) glycerol, clarified by centrifugation, and applied to a Bio-Gel P-60 column. The eluted fractions were examined by gel electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue or periodic acid Schiff reagent (PAS) (27Gander J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). (Coomassie Blue-stained Aga2p was not stably fixed in the gels, and bands disappeared after 24 h at room temperature). Extended storage or lyophilization of purified Aga2p generated in a ladder of bands of apparent molecular size 30 kDa, 60 kDa, and larger upon SDS-gel electrophoresis. These apparent multimers were reduced to 30 kDa following treatment with dithiothreitol. For His-tagged versions of a-agglutinin, the concentrated culture supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.45, 500 mm NaCl (buffer A), then centrifuged to clarify the suspension. The supernatant was applied to a His-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Upjohn, Inc., Downers Grove, IL), washed in buffer A, and eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, 0.01% NaN3). In some cases, the material was further purified by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-60. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins was according to the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by A280, using an extinction coefficient of 1 per mg/ml for impure solutions, and for pure polypeptides, the extinction coefficients were calculated from the amino acid composition (29Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. v. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Pyroglutaminase was used according to manufacturer's directions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Partial deglycosylation was effected with jack bean α-mannosidase (100 μg/ml, used according to manufacturer's directions; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Peptide sequences were generated on an ABI gas phase sequencer in the Hunter College Sequence and Synthesis Facility. CD spectra were obtained on a JASCO J710 spectropolarimeter. For immunoblots and dot blots, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose paper under standard conditions. The primary antibodies were anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-His-Tag (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and polyclonal antibodies to Aga2p (provided by W. Tanner (30Watzele M. Klis F. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or produced for this study); these polyclonals were multiply adsorbed with W303-1B and X2180-1B cells. An anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody, developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Sigma) or ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Agglutinins were assayed by published procedures (14Sijmons P.C. Nederbragt A.J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31Terrance K. Lipke P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 889-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant aga2genes expressed from the AGA2 promoter on CENplasmids were also tested for the ability to complement theaga2::LEU2 agglutination defect by cellular agglutination assays (14Sijmons P.C. Nederbragt A.J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Aga2p is unstable and most of the purified subunit is inactive. Aga2p can be stabilized in an active form by a small fragment of Aga1p, and the two subunits interact through a pair of disulfide bonds and at least one other region of Aga2p. Biochemical and molecular analyses imply that the C-terminal-most residues of Aga2p are critical for binding to its receptor α-agglutinin Aga2p expressed from plasmids had properties similar to that released from cell surfaces (14Sijmons P.C. Nederbragt A.J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Cappellaro C. Hauser K. Mrsa V. Watzele M. Watzele G. Gruber C. Tanner W.

For both Aga2p and Aga2p with His6 immediately following the secretion sequence (His6-Aga2p), the yield averaged 1–2 × 104 units/liter of culture, and the purified protein showed a single diffuse band on gel electrophoresis when stained with Coomassie Blue or the glycoconjugate stain PAS. The Mrapp was 30 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane 3), although the predicted size of the polypeptide is under 7 kDa, and the glycopeptide is probably less than 20 kDa (14Sijmons P.C. Nederbragt A.J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Cappellaro C. Hauser K. Mrsa V. Watzele M. Watzele G. Gruber C. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4081-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Purified Aga2p yielded the expected peptide sequence of residues 2–8 after glycoprotein was treated with pyroglutaminase to remove cyclized N-terminal pyroglutamate. The specific activity of purified Aga2p or His6-Aga2p ranged up to 1.4 × 1011 units/mol, comparable to most previous reports (14Sijmons P.C. Nederbragt A.J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Cappellaro C. Hauser K. Mrsa V. Watzele M. Watzele G. Gruber C. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4081-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Cappellaro C. Baldermann C. Rachel R. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4737-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, we found that the activity of both Aga2p and His6-Aga2p decreased during storage except at −70 °C. Activity was not restored or preserved by glycerol, dithiothreitol, EDTA, divalent metal ions, or peroxide oxidation of Cys residues. CD spectroscopy of the purified Aga2p or His6-Aga2p yielded spectra typical of denatured peptides, with only aperiodic structures (data not shown). These results implied that much of the isolated Aga2p was in an inactive and denatured form. Disulfide linkage of Aga2p to Aga1p involves two disulfide bonds (19Cappellaro C. Hauser K. Mrsa V. Watzele M. Watzele G. Gruber C. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4081-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The ten Cys residues in Aga1p are present in two repeats with five Cys residues each (Fig.1 A). We constructed short versions of Aga1p containing a single Cys repeat to determine whether such fragments might support secretion of higher levels of Aga2p activity. Aga1p-(1–149) contains the signal sequence, a Ser/Thr-rich region, and the first Cys-rich region. Strains expressing this form of Aga1p alone did not secrete measurable a-agglutinin activity. However, when this construct was co-expressed with His6-Aga2p, secreted activity was 10-fold higher than when His6-Aga2p was expressed alone. Nickel-affinity chromatography of the supernatant yielded a complex of His6-Aga2p with a larger component, presumably Aga1p-(1–149), as well as His6-Aga2p monomer and dimer (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), which were removed by gel filtration (lanes 6–10). The purified complex stained with PAS, indicating glycosylation (Fig.2 C), and upon reduction with DTT yielded two bands, one with the size of His6-Aga2p near 30 kDa, and a band of apparent size 105–110 kDa. The upper band was not stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2 C). The 30-kDa subunit was also stained by antibody to His6 or to Aga2p (data not shown). When His6-Aga2p was co-expressed with Aga1p-(1–149)-HA, the larger subunit was stained with antibody to the HA epitope (data not shown). Therefore, co-expression of His6-Aga2p with Aga1p-(1–149) resulted in secretion of an active complex of these two proteins. The specific activity of the His6-Aga2p·Aga1p-(1–149) complex was (6 ± 1) × 1012 units/mol (S.E., six independent determinations on two preparations), which was 43-fold higher than the activity of Aga2p or His6-Aga2p alone and similar to the specific activity of purified α-agglutinin. The far-UV CD spectrum of the His6-Aga2p·Aga1p-(1–149) complex showed a positive rise centered at 204 nm and negative peaks at 208, 212, and 217 nm (Fig. 3). A slight negative shoulder is visible at 222 nm. These positions and intensities resulted in an estimate based on the program SELCON that the structure included 13% α-helix, 27% β-sheet, 24% turn, and 35% aperiodic structures (32Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 33Woody R.W. Dunker K. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Macromolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 109-157Google Scholar). The His6-Aga2p component of the complex had smaller apparent size than the corresponding subunit when expressed alone (Fig.2 A, lane 5 versus lane 3). This result implied that the subunit in the complex might contain less carbohydrate than when expressed alone. When His6-Aga2p or the His6-Aga2p·Aga1p-(1–149) complex was digested with jack bean α-mannosidase, the apparent size was reduced (Fig.2 A). Aga2p expressed alone was reduced to about 19 kDa (lane 2), whereas Aga2p released from the complex generated heterogeneous material with apparent size ranging from the dye front up to 25 kDa (lane 4). Within the smear there were visible bands at 15 kDa (poorly visible in the photo), 23 kDa, and 25 kDa. Deglycosylated Aga2p isolated alone or in complex with Aga1p-(1–149) remained stainable by PAS reagent (data not shown). In addition to high specific activity and measurable secondary structure, the purified His6-Aga2p·Aga1p-(1–149) complex was stable for several months at −20 °C. To determine whether disulfide bonding of the subunits stabilized an active form ofa-agglutinin, the complex was treated with DTT for various times, diluted, and assayed (Fig. 4). The activity decreased with a half-time of about 20 min; the unreduced complex was much more stable under these conditions. To determine the minimal region of Aga1p needed to stabilize Aga2p, we constructed deletions within the AGA1 gene and co-expressed the various forms of Aga1p with His6-Aga2p. Aga1p-(1–136) terminates after the intact Cys-rich region and allowed secretion of activity equivalent to Aga1p-(1–149) (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, Aga1p-(1–132) lacks two Cys residues and supported activity only at a level equivalent to that of Aga2p alone. Therefore, it is likely that Cys133, Cys136, or both are important for maintenance of activity of Aga2p. To determine the N terminus of the domain required for stabilization of Aga2p, we constructed internal deletions that fused Aga1p residues 1–29, including the signal sequence, in-frame to various positions. Expression of Aga1p-(1–29,71–136), which consists only of the signal sequence and the intact cysteine-rich region, stabilized Aga2p activity, as did Aga1p-(1–29,106–136), which lacks the first Cys and 34 other residues but retains four Cys residues. More extensive deletions, to give Aga1p-(1–29,111–136) and Aga1p-(1–29,112–136), which retain three and two cysteine residues, respectively, still stabilized activity at levels about 25% of the constructs with four Cys residues (Fig. 1 B). In conclusion, activity ofa-agglutinin was maximal when the binding subunit Aga2p was coexpressed with fragments of Aga1p that contained the last four Cys residues of the first Cys-rich repeat. The last two Cys residues, at positions 133 and 136 are particularly important. The complex containing Aga1p-(1–29,111–136) with His6-Aga2p was purified to yield material with specific activity of 1.2 × 1012 units/mol, 8.6-fold greater than Aga2p alone and about 5-fold less that the complex with Aga1p-(1–149). The far-UV CD spectrum was consistent with a structure containing ∼7% α-helix, 31% β-sheet, and 15% β-turn (Fig. 3) (32Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 33Woody R.W. Dunker K. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Macromolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 109-157Google Scholar). Thus, a construct expressing only 31 residues of Aga1p, including five post-signal residues and the last three Cys of the first Cys-rich region, was sufficient to maintain secondary structure of the complex of 108 amino acid residues (75 from His6-Aga2p and 31 from Aga1p). Random mutagenesis of AGA2 produced three mutations, F56S, Y58C, and S61P, with an unexpected phenotype: Cells expressing these mutant genes showed increased agglutinin activity in the cell culture supernatants (Table I). Serial dilution dot blots (not shown) demonstrated proportional increases in the amount of protein compared with the wild type, implying that these mutations produced Aga2p with specific activity similar to wild type. To study these effects further, additional mutations of this region were constructed. Two- to 4-fold increases in secreted activity were observed with many of the single amino acid substitution mutations in this region. Overexpression of Aga1p-(1–149) in two of these mutants, Y58C and S61P, had no effect on secreted activity. Moreover, in cellular agglutination assays, mutant S61P did not complement theaga2::LEU2 agglutination defect, and mutant Y58C showed a significant reduction in activity relative to wild type. When residues 56–60 were deleted or when three Ala residues were inserted between Tyr58 and Tyr59, the secreted agglutinin had activity similar to wild type Aga2p. However, these mutations were unable to complementaga2::LEU2 cells, even though expressed from high copy plasmids. These results could be explained by a defect in the interaction with Aga1p. Such an effect would reduce or eliminate cell surface localization of Aga2p, increase the amounts of secreted Aga2p, and prevent complementation ofaga2::LEU2.Table IMutations that increased activity of secreted Aga2pMutant nameMutationPercent of wild type secreted activity1-aActivity in growth supernatant from strains harboring overexpression constructs.

We demonstrate that the dual-specificity kinase Mps1p is essential for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p in vivo and that Mps1p phosphorylates Spc110p in vitro. Phosphopeptides generated by proteolytic cleavage were identified and sequenced by mass spectrometry.

This is the first time that phosphorylation sites of an SPB component have been determined, and these are the first sites of Mps1p phosphorylation identified. Alanine substitution for any one of these phosphorylated residues, in conjunction with an alanine substitution at residue Ser36, is lethal in combination with alleles ofSPC97, which encodes a component of the Tub4p complex. Consistent with a specific dysfunction for the alanine substitution mutations, simultaneous mutation of all four serine/threonine residues to aspartate does not confer any defect.

In each mitotic cell cycle, the centrosome must duplicate once in preparation to form the spindle apparatus. The mitotic spindle is instrumental for proper segregation of the duplicated chromosomes into two euploid daughter cells, each receiving one of the centrosomes. Proper centrosome function is vital to cell proliferation, and errors in centrosome duplication, spindle formation, or spindle function can lead to chromosome instability, chromosome non-disjunction, and aneuploidy. Several lines of evidence from a wide variety of organisms suggest that protein phosphorylation plays a major role in centrosome control during the cell cycle.

In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the spindle pole body (SPB)1 is functionally equivalent to the centrosome. The SPB is a multilayered cylinder embedded in the nuclear envelope. Cytoplasmic microtubules emanate from an outer plaque, and nuclear microtubules emanate from the inner plaque. The 110-kDa spindle pole component Spc110p contains a large, central coiled-coil domain, which is located in the region of the SPB between the inner and central plaques (16Kilmartin J.V. Dyos S.L. Kershaw D. Finch J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).

The N-terminal globular domain of Spc110p interacts both genetically and biochemically with these components of the Tub4p complex (19Sundberg H.A. Davis T.N. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2201-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Spc110p is also a phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation of Spc110p at serine/threonine residues arises as cells form the mitotic spindle and disappears as cells enter anaphase (26Friedman D.B. Sundberg H.A. Huang E.Y. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,27Stirling D.A. Stark M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The dual-specificity kinase Mps1p is essential for SPB duplication and for mitotic checkpoint control in S. cerevisiae (6Lauz'e E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C. Weiss E. Schutz A.R. Winey M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells harboring the temperature-sensitive mps1-1 allele fail to duplicate the SPB at the restrictive temperature yet proceed through a doomed mitosis with a monopolar spindle (5Winey M. Goetsch L. Baum P. Byers B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mps1p is also involved in the mitotic checkpoint (28Weiss E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). High levels of Mps1p cause cells to arrest in metaphase, and these arrested cells contain hyperphosphorylated Mad1p, which is also associated with activation of the mitotic checkpoint (29Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In vitro, GST-Mps1p phosphorylates Mad1p (29Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as well as Spc98p, a component of the Tub4p complex (30Pereira G. Knop M. Schiebel E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite the recent boon in centrosome component identification (for example, see Ref. 31Wigge P.A. Jensen O.N. Holmes S. Soues S. Mann M. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and the implication that several kinases are involved in centrosome function, direct evidence of specific phosphorylation of a centrosome component by a specific kinase in vivo has been lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that the dual-specificity kinase Mps1p phosphorylates Spc110p in vitro and that these sites are important for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p in vivo. These phosphorylations occur within the N-terminal globular domain of Spc110p, which resides at the inner plaque of the SPB and interacts with components of the microtubule-organizing Tub4p complex. Mutating these phosphorylated residues to alanine (to prevent phosphorylation), but not to aspartate (to mimic phosphorylation), perturbs the function of Spc110p such that it can no longer support growth in the presence of mutant forms of Spc97p, a component of the Tub4p complex. This perturbation also requires another alanine substitution at Ser36 in the N-terminal globular domain, which is within an (S/T)PX(R/K) consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cdc2p/Cdc28p cyclin-dependent kinase (32Langan T.A.

Thus, proper interaction of the Tub4p complex with the yeast centrosome may require Spc110p phosphorylation at all four of these sites. SD complete, SD-uracil (34Davis T.N. J.

Neither single mutant confers a temperature-sensitive phenotype. The diploid was sporulated and the tetrads dissected giving 25 tetratypes (1:3 temperature-sensitive:non-temperature-sensitive), 4 non-parental ditypes (2:2), and 3 parental ditypes (0:4).

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2201-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) into theSmaI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Plasmids pJK2, pJK4, and pJK7 were made by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pDV29 using the USE kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. All other pJK plasmids (except pJK24) were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the parent plasmid using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Plasmid pJK21 carrying URA3, CEN, and an spc110 allele was converted to integrating plasmid pJK24 by replacing the AlwNI fragment containing part ofbla, CEN, and part of URA3 with the AlwNI fragment from pRS306 containing part ofbla and part of URA3 but no CEN.

Plasmid pDF30 (6xHIS-SPC110–201) was constructed by swapping a 1.6-kb HindIII fragment from pDF29 into pDF18. pDF47 expresses 12xHIS-Spc110–201p(756Δ) (missing residues 267–543 within the central coiled-coil and truncated at residue 756 of Spc110p) and was constructed by cloning the SphI-SspI fragment from pDF30 into the SphI and SmaI sites of the 6xHis bacterial expression vector pQE32. pDF48 expresses 12xHIS-Spc110 P-(1–225) (truncated at residue 225 of Spc110p) and was constructed by cloning the SphI-NsiI fragment from pDF30 into the SphI and PstI sites of pQE32.Table IIPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidParent plasmidRelevant markersSource or referencepMPS1MPS1(6Lauz'e E.

Cultures of E. coli strain GM1 were transformed to ampicillin resistance with plasmids pDF47 or pDF48 expressing recombinant 12xHIS-Spc110–201p(756Δ) or 12xHIS-Spc110p-(1–225), respectively. Cultures of isolated transformants were diluted 1:100 into 10 ml of LB amp, grown to a density of 20 Klett units and then induced with 1–2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β -d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, washed once in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed using a French Pressure cell (3/8-inch piston diameter; Aminco) at 11,000 p.s.i. to near 100% lysis. Wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant GST-Spc110p-(1–183) were co-expressed with plasmid pCL5 in strain GM1. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 into 200 ml of LB amp kan and grown at 37 °C to a density of 60–70 Klett units. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml, and cultures were incubated for an additional 1.5 h. Cells were then pelleted at 8500 ×g for 10 min, and pellets were stored at −80 °C. Thawed pellets were suspended in 3 ml of cold lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in a French Pressure cell as described above. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min. Cleared lysates were mixed for 1 h with 100 μl of glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The supernatant was then discarded, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. GST-Spc110p-(1–183) was eluted in 200 μl of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) by mixing for 10 min. The buffer was exchanged to storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% v/v glycerol) by gel filtration on G-25 Sephadex. Samples were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. All reactions were carried out as described previously (6Lauz'e E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C. Weiss E. Schutz A.R. Winey M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) except as follows. Kinase assays used to generate phosphorylated GST-Spc110p-(1–183) for analysis of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry used 200 μl of GST-Mps1p bound to GSH-Sepharose in a 50% slurry, which was washed once in kinase assay buffer without ATP (KAB-ATP: 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT) and resuspended in 50 μl of KAB-ATP and 10 μl of GST-Spc110p-(1–183) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 40 μl of 5× KAB (final concentration, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP containing 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 5 h. 20 μl was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis to assess stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation. Kinase assays used to compare incorporation of phosphate into wild-type and phosphorylation site mutants of GST-Spc110p-(1–183) used 10 μl of GST-Mps1p conjugated to GSH-Sepharose beads and ∼0.2 μg of GST-Spc110p-(1–183) (wild-type or mutant). The entire reaction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue prior to PhosphorImager analysis. Both kinase and substrate were expressed as GST fusions for these experiments, and both were bound to GSH-Sepharose resin during the reaction. Prior to proteolytic digestion the resin was washed twice and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmCaCl2 for digestion with trypsin, or in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.2, for digestion with endoproteinase Lys C (endoLys-C). Proteolytic digestion was performed at 30 °C overnight with shaking to keep the resin in suspension. The resin was removed by centrifugation, leaving the peptides in the supernatant, then washed once with 50 μl of H2O. The wash and supernatant were combined, reduced in a vacuum-concentrating microcentrifuge (Heto-Holten, Allerød, Denmark) to near dryness, and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1–1.0% trifluoroacetic acid. Electrospray ionization, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS/MS) were carried out using either a hand-packed 500-μm i.d. HPLC column containing C18 reverse phase resin (Columbus) interfaced to an API III+ triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Biosystems, Foster City, CA), or a 320-μm i.d. HPLC column (Micro-Tech, Sunnyvale, CA) packed with C18 reverse phase resin interfaced to an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was carried out on 0.5 μl of analyte mixed with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Agilent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard), using a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Previously we have shown that the 110-kDa SPB component Spc110p undergoes serine/threonine phosphorylation in cells containing pre-anaphase mitotic spindles, which results in a slower-migrating isoform (p120) during SDS-PAGE (26Friedman D.B. Sundberg H.A. Huang E.Y. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We analyzed the Spc110p mobility shift in cells carrying the mps1-1 mutation at the restrictive temperature to determine whether the essential dual-specificity kinase Mps1p played a role in the mitosis-specific Spc110p phosphorylation. Mps1-1p is a severely crippled conditional mutant kinase, both in vivo and in vitro (38Schutz A.R. Winey M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 759-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were first synchronized in G1 by the addition of the mating pheromone α-factor and then released into prewarmed 37 °C medium. At 37 °C, mps1-1 cells entered the cell cycle at the same time as the mps1-1 pMPS1 control cells (as evidenced by bud emergence at 30 min after release for both cultures), but unlike the wild-type control, the slower migrating mitosis-specific isoform of Spc110p never accumulated in mps1-1 cells (Fig.1). Thus, MPS1 is required for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p in vivo. MPS1 has at least two previously identified execution points during the cell cycle, one that is essential for SPB duplication (5Winey M. Goetsch L. Baum P. Byers B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and another that is involved in the mitotic spindle checkpoint (28Weiss E. Winey M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Because the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p does not occur until after SPB duplication is complete (26Friedman D.B. Sundberg H.A. Huang E.Y. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is possible that the dependence for Spc110p phosphorylation on Mps1p function merely reflects a prerequisite for SPB duplication. To test this hypothesis, we performed similar analyses for Spc110p phosphorylation at the restrictive temperature in two additional mutant backgrounds that block SPB duplication, mps2-1 and cdc31-2. Both mutations cause cells to arrest with large buds and a G2DNA content at the restrictive temperature. Cells carrying themps2-1 mutation arrest at the restrictive temperature with a malformed duplicated SPB that fails to insert into the nuclear envelope and lacks both the inner plaque and nuclear microtubules (5Winey M. Goetsch L. Baum P. Byers B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells carrying the cdc31-2 mutation fail completely in SPB duplication (39Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The slower migrating mitosis-specific isoform of Spc110p is present at the restrictive temperature in each mutant background despite failures in SPB duplication (Fig.2). Furthermore, ordering of execution points during the cell cycle place CDC31 function first, followed by MPS1 function and then by MPS2function (5Winey M. Goetsch L. Baum P. Byers B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus failure of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Spc110p in mps1-1 cells is not due simply to a failure in SPB duplication. We also tested if MPS1 expression could promote the production of the mitosis-specific Spc110p isoform in cells blocked in G1 by the addition of α-factor, a state where the mitosis-specific isoform is normally not present (26Friedman D.B. Sundberg H.A. Huang E.Y. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells expressingMPS1 from a galactose-inducible promoter while held at this G1 arrest clearly produce the mitosis-specific Spc110p isoform (Fig. 3, lane 9), whereas similarly arrested cells harboring control plasmids do not (Fig. 3, lane 7). A non-phosphorylatable form of Spc110p (4A, described below) is not shifted in this experiment (Fig. 3, lane 10), demonstrating that the Spc110p mobility shift promoted by the expression of MPS1 during G1 arrest does not result from phosphorylation at inappropriate sites. Because other mitosis-specific functions would be turned off during this G1 arrest, it is likely that the production of the slower-migrating Spc110p isoform, which normally results from mitosis-specific phosphorylation, here results directly fro"

However, not much is known about the structural basis of this behavior. We studied the influence of the physiological allosteric effectorl-lactate on the oxygenated quaternary structure of the 2×6-meric hemocyanin from the lobster Homarus americanus employing small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The presence of 20 mml-lactate resulted in different scattering curves compared with those obtained in the absence of l-lactate. The distance distribution functionsp(r) indicated a more compact molecule in presence ofl-lactate, which is also reflected in a reduction of the radius of gyration by about 0.2 nm (3%). Thus, we show for the first time on a structural basis that a hemocyanin in the oxy state can adopt two different conformations. This is as predicted from the analysis of oxygen binding curves according to the “nesting” model. A comparison of the distance distribution functions p(r) obtained from SAXS with those deduced from electron microscopy revealed large differences. The distance between the two hexamers as deduced from electron microscopy has to be shortened by up to 1.1 nm to agree well with the small angle x-ray curves.

Monod-Wyman-Changeax, SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering transmission electron microscopy Hemocyanins are the oxygen transport proteins of most molluscs and arthropods. They are enormous molecular structures, ranging in molecular mass from 4.5 × 105 to more than 107 Da; some contain more than 100 oxygen binding sites (1van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ellerton H.D. Ellerton N.F. Robinson H.A. Proc. Biophys. Mol.

Hemocyanins exhibit cooperative oxygen binding and respond to a variety of allosteric effectors (4Truchot J.P. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 377-410Crossref Google Scholar, 5Truchot J.P.

As a consequence of their structural complexity, hemocyanins have proved important in extending our understanding of allostery. For example, explanation of the cooperative oxygen binding by arthropod hemocyanin has required extension of the classical MWC1 model to the “nesting” model (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which reflects the hierarchical structure of these proteins. The nesting model requires four states (rT, rT, tR, rR) instead of the two states (T, R) of the MWC model. It makes the prediction that even fully oxygenated hemocyanin can exist in two conformational states. Although the model has served well to explain oxygen binding and its dependence on effector (see Ref. 8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, for example), it has never been tested directly. That is, no experiments have been performed to detect the two oxy conformations predicted by the nesting model. To be definitive, such experiments must be carried out in solution, under rigorously controlled oxygenation levels and with a sensitivity sufficient to detect even small conformational changes. A suitable method to detect conformational changes of large proteins in solution is small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). This technique has been applied successfully to monitor changes of the quaternary structure for several cooperative proteins such as hemoglobin and a number of allosteric enzymes (10Conrad H.

Different conformations have also been reported for the oxy- and deoxyhemocyanin from the tarantulaEurypelma californicum from SAXS measurements (19Decker H. Hartmann H. Sterner R. Schwarz E. Pilz I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 293: 226-230Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we present SAXS data of fully oxygenated 2×6-meric hemocyanin from the lobster Homarus americanus in the absence and presence of the physiological effector l-lactate. We will show that the fully oxygenated 2×6-meric hemocyanin can adopt two clearly distinguishable conformations, which differ in structural details. This observation indicates that the allosteric influence ofl-lactate on the oxygen binding behavior of this hemocyanin is based on a preferential binding of l-lactate to one of the two possible conformations present in the oxy state. Lobsters (H. americanus) were obtained from a local fish supplier. Hemolymph was obtained from heart puncture as described elsewhere (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cellular content of the hemolymph was removed from the sample by centrifuging for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Hemocyanin (2×6-mer) was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Bio-Gel A1.5 m, Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0 in presence of 20 mm CaCl2 and 20 mmMgCl2 at 4 °C. The hemocyanin solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2 (at 20 °C) in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2and 20 mm MgCl2. Protein solution for the measurement with l-lactate contained 20 mml-lactate. The pH was determined for all samples to be pH 7.2 at 20 °C. Under these condition the 12-meric lobster hemocyanin is stable at least for months. The degree of saturation with oxygen was determined by comparing the absorption at 280 and 340 nm. The ratioA280/A340 of about 4.5 shows that the hemocyanin was fully oxygenated under these conditions. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically usingA280 nm = 1.34 (20Morimoto K. Kegeles G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tris and MgCl2 were purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). CaCl2 was obtained from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany), andl-lactate acid was from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed at the SAXS camera JUSIFA at the synchrotron beamline B1 at Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor, Hamburg, Germany (21Haubold H.-G. Grünhagen K. Wagener M. Jungbluth H. Heer H. Pfeil A. Rongen H. Brandenburg G. Moeller R. Matzerath J. Hiller P. Hallwig H. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 1943-1946Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The scattered intensities were recorded by a two-dimensional multiwire proportional counter with 256 × 256 pixels. Two different distances between detector and sample (918 and 3618 mm) were used with a step in reciprocal space of Δq = 0.017 nm−1(q = 4πsinθ/λ) at a wavelength of λ = 0.1553 nm. Scattering curves were measured at two protein concentrations, 7.8 and 15.6 g/liter, both in the presence and absence of 20 mml-lactate. A quartz capillary flow cell was used for all experiments. The scattered intensities were corrected for detector sensitivity and instrumental background and normalized for monitor counts and transmission. Scattering curves of the buffer were measured under identical conditions and subtracted from the protein scattering curves. The total measurement times for the protein samples and the buffer were divided into several time slices to monitor possible shifts. Since no differences of the scattered intensity between the individual measurements were detected, the time slices were added to decrease the statistical error. Calculation of the distance distribution functions p(r) and desmearing of the intensity were performed with the method of indirect Fourier transformation using the program GNOM, which also delivers errors for the p(r) curves (22Svergun D.I. Pederson J.S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 241-248Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1995; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For comparison with the experimental data, model distance distribution functions were calculated from atomic models. For this the x-ray structure of the hexameric crustacean hemocyanin from Panulirus interruptus was used (24Volbeda A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). First, an atomic model of the dodecameric hemocyanin was constructed using the relative translations and rotations of the two hexamers as reported for the 2×6-meric hemocyanin from the closely related crab Cancer pagurus obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and three-dimensional reconstruction (25De Haas F. Bijholt M.M.C. van Bruggen E.F.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 86-94Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). From the atomic model a distance distribution function p(r) was calculated by counting all distances between the atoms, each weighted by the atomic form factor. To fit the experimental p(r), the center of mass distance between the two hexamers was varied in the direction of thez axes in a second step. The rotational parameters and the other two translational parameters describing the relative position of the hexamers were adjusted to the results obtained from TEM experiments. The radius of gyration of the molecular models was calculated directly from the coordinates using the distances between the atoms and the center of mass. Fig. 1a shows the original smeared scattering intensities of lobster hemocyanin in the presence and absence of 20 mml-lactate. The difference curves between the scattered intensities without and with the effector were calculated for both protein concentrations, 7.8 and 15.6 g/liter (Fig. 1 b). For both measurements with low and high protein concentration, the differences exceed the experimental errors up to a factor of five for q values between 0.15 and 0.4 nm−1. The shape of the two difference curves is very similar over the whole q range. The radius of gyration was determined from the distance distribution function p(r) (Fig. 2). For the low concentration of hemocyanin it was found to be 7.21 ± 0.05 nm in absence of l-lactate and 7.02 ± 0.07 nm in presence of l-lactate. The corresponding values for the high protein concentration are 7.19 ± 0.05 and 6.99 ± 0.04 nm. These values agree excellently with the radii of gyration calculated from the desmeared Guinier plot (7.19 and 7.01 nm for the low protein concentration; 7.17 and 6.98 for the high protein concentration). Although small, the differences in the radii of gyration in the absence and presence of l-lactate are highly significant, given the precision of the data. The decrease of the radius of gyration by about 0.2 nm in the presence ofl-lactate indicates that the hemocyanin molecule becomes more compact. In addition, the maximum diameters of lobster hemocyanin were calculated from the p(r) curves (Fig. 2). Although the value of 23.5 ± 0.5 nm in the presence of l-lactate is only slightly shorter than that observed in the absence ofl-lactate (24.0 ± 0.5 nm), the number of large distances in the range between 14 and 24 nm is significantly smaller, compensated by an increase of p(r) at shorter distances (Fig. 2). Because the maximum diameter of a hemocyanin hexamer is about 13 nm as calculated from the x-ray structures (24Volbeda A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 25De Haas F. Bijholt M.M.C. van Bruggen E.F.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 86-94Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), only interhexameric distances can contribute to p(r) above 13 nm. Thus, the observed differences in p(r) indicate that the centers of mass of the two hexamers are shifted together by the binding of l-lactate. These observations are supported by the following consideration: based on the subunit composition of the lobster hemocyanin, we can assume two identical hexamers (26Mangum C.P. Biol. Bull. 1993; 184: 105-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible to calculate the distance between the centers of mass of the hexamers,Dhex-hex, from the RG values when the radius of gyration for the hexamer is known (27Perkins S.J. Modern Physical Methods in Biochemistry , Part B. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1988: 143-265Google Scholar).Dhex­hex=2RG2(2×6­mer)−RG2(6­mer)Equation 1 From the x-ray structure of the related hexameric hemocyanin from another crustacean P. interruptus, the radius of gyration of 4.77 nm for RG(6-mer) was calculated (24Volbeda A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The distances between the centers of hexamers were then calculated to be 10.8 nm in the absence of l-lactate and 10.3 nm in presence of l-lactate. Thus, the hexamers are shifted toward each other by 0.5 nm in the presence ofl-lactate. This is consistent with the observed decrease of about 0.5 nm in the maximum diameter as determined above from the distance distribution function. We compared data obtained for lobster hemocyanin in absence ofl-lactate by SAXS with a model based on the three-dimensional reconstruction of the closely related hemocyanin from another crustacean, the crab Cancer pagurus, obtained by transmission electron microscopy TEM (25De Haas F. Bijholt M.M.C. van Bruggen E.F.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 86-94Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration for this TEM model was calculated to be 7.44 nm. The SAXS experiments, however, yielded values that are smaller in both cases, by 0.23 nm in the absence of l-lactate and 0.42 nm in presence ofl-lactate. In addition, the distance distribution function deduced from TEM showed an extremely pronounced shoulder (Fig.3), which was not found in the SAXS experiments. The following consideration supports the hexamer-hexamer contacts in our SAXS measurements. Obviously, the TEM model does not fit our experimental data. The closest Cα-Cα distances between the hexamers in the TEM model are in the range of about 1.2 nm, which is too large for reasonable contacts between subunits. Usually values of about 0.4 nm for the Cα-Cα distances between subunits are found in x-ray structures. To obtain a good agreement between the experimental distance distribution function and the p(r) calculated from the models, we reduced the center of mass distance between the hexamers from 11.5 nm as calculated from the TEM model to 10.4 nm (with l-lactate, Fig. 3) and to 10.9 nm (withoutl-lactate). These two fitted values agree well with the distances (10.3 and 10.8 nm, see above) obtained experimentally. In addition, the closest Cα contacts between the hexamers were then determined to 0.3 nm in the presence of l-lactate and to 0.6 nm in the absence of l-lactate. Small angle x-ray scattering demonstrates that oxygenated hemocyanin from H. americanus undergoes a conformational change in the presence of the allosteric effectorl-lactate. Different SAXS intensities and values for the radius of gyration were obtained in the presence and absence of 20 mml-lactate, a concentration that is higher than the values (5–10 mm) observed in crustacea after stress (1van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ellerton H.D. Ellerton N.F. Robinson H.A. Proc. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1983; 41: 143-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Morris S. Bridges C.R. Linzen B. Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer, Berlin1986: 353-356Crossref Google Scholar, 7Zeis B. Nies A. Bridges C.R. Grieshaber M.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 168: 93-110Google Scholar). Concentrations higher than 20 mm do not effect the oxygen binding curve anymore (7Zeis B. Nies A. Bridges C.R. Grieshaber M.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 168: 93-110Google Scholar). The effectorl-lactate seems to bind preferentially to a more compact hemocyanin molecule based on the decrease of the radii of gyration and the distance between the two hexamers. The inter-hexamer distance decreases by 0.5 nm, which corresponds to 2% of the total molecular dimensions. Besides the change in the hexamer-hexamer distance, additional rearrangements within the hexamers may occur during the conformational transition but cannot be identified with this method. The observed differences seem to be small. However, even when the oxy and deoxy states of the 24-meric hemocyanin from the tarantula E. californicum were compared, differences of similar magnitude were obtained (19Decker H. Hartmann H. Sterner R. Schwarz E. Pilz I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 293: 226-230Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To our knowledge we have provided here the first direct evidence that an allosteric effector can induce changes in the quaternary structure of a hemocyanin even though it remains fully oxygenated. The existence of two distinct, albeit fully oxygenated, conformations unequivocally rules out the applicability of the simple MWC model (28Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6149) Google Scholar), which in toto offers only two conformations: one high affinity (at high pO2) and one low affinity (at low pO2) conformation. The observed increase of the affinity upon addition of l-lactate for crustacean hemocyanin (6Morris S. Bridges C.R. Linzen B. Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer, Berlin1986: 353-356Crossref Google Scholar, 7Zeis B. Nies A. Bridges C.R. Grieshaber M.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 168: 93-110Google Scholar) means that in the frame of a MWC model the R state is stabilized compared with the T state. Thus, under fully oxygenated conditions addition of l-lactate cannot, according to an MWC model, change the conformational distribution to an observable amount, since the most favored conformation is already present to a large extent. Thus, both oxygen binding curves obtained at different pH values (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the SAXS experiments presented here rule out the simple MWC model. In principle extensions of the MWC model may be considered to explain these two conformations in the oxy state (9Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Richey B. Decker H. Gill S.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Brouwer M. Serigstad B,. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8819-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the dependence of the oxygen binding curves on pH can be better explained in terms of the nested MWC model (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Dainese E. di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato S. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding curves of the half-molecules can be predicted and confirmed by this model (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Dainese E. di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato S. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We could not find any other model that was in comparable agreement with all of these experimental data. The structural interpretation of the observed change inRG values is independent of the model used for the interpretation of the oxygen binding behavior. The models for cooperativity are based on functionally different conformations, which are distinguished on the basis of their oxygen affinities. No structural constraints are imposed by the SAXS data. But any structural difference between the hemocyanin in the absence and presence ofl-lactate is in accordance with the existence of two functionally different conformations in the oxy state as required in the nested MWC model. For other hemocyanins, the existence of different conformations within both the oxy and deoxy state was also supported by analysis of the oxygen binding (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Brouwer M. Serigstad B,. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8819-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Decker H. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Dainese E. di Muro P. Beltramini M. Salvato S. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Makino N. Ohnaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Other methods also confirmed the applicability of the nested MWC model for arthropod hemocyanins. For the 2×12-meric tarantula hemocyanin two different conformations in the oxy state were found using a fluorescence tag 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-chloride (34Leidescher T. Decker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This has also been confirmed by O2/CO replacement experiments (35Decker H. Connelly P. Robert C.H. Gill S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6901-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An isothermic titration calorimetry study of effector binding to 2×6-meric hemocyanin from Homarus vulgaris also indicates the existence of two conformations in the oxy state, which differ in their affinities for the effectors urate and caffeine (36Menze M. Hellmann N. Decker H. Grieshaber M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10806-10811Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,37Menze M. Hellmann N. Decker H. Grieshaber M.K. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1033-1038PubMed Google Scholar). However, our small angle x-ray results provide the first direct structural evidence for two different conformations in the oxy state and reveal that structural changes are involved. The simple MWC model describes well the oxygen binding properties of hexameric hemocyanins. For 1×6-meric hemocyanin of P. interruptus sophisticated O2/CO replacement experiments confirmed that the simple MWC model is the appropriate model (38Connelly P.R. Johnson C.R. Robert C.H. Bak H.J. Gill S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additionally, hexamers obtained from dissociation of 2×6-meric hemocyanin from H. americanus were also well described by the simple MWC model (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The binding parameters obtained for this hexamer correspond well to the predicted binding parameters of the two states (rR, tR) in the R conformation according to the nested MWC model when applied to the native 2×6-meric molecule (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two additional states (rT, tT) of the T conformation as postulated by the nested MWC model for the 1×6-mers must have been created by the assembly of the two hexamers accompanied by a functional coupling. The two conformations observed by SAXS can be assigned to the two high affinity states, rR and rT. On the basis of these considerations the nested MWC model seems the simplest to account for all the data. Therefore, other models were not considered for describing arthropod hemocyanins, especially from H. americanus. Two questions arise: why do larger aggregates than hexamers exist, and is there any advantage for respiratory proteins such as the hemocyanins to function according to the nested MWC model? Obviously, for a number of species the hexameric hemocyanin serves well for the oxygen delivery (1van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ellerton H.D. Ellerton N.F. Robinson H.A. Proc. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1983; 41: 143-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar, 4Truchot J.P. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 377-410Crossref Google Scholar, 5Truchot J.P. Lallier F.H. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 49-52Google Scholar). The reason to develop higher aggregates may to be found in keeping the osmotic pressure low in the hemolymph with respect to the extracellular proteins (39Snyder G.K. Magnum C.P. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 81: 173-18842PubMed Google Scholar). But no further advantage would result from increasing the size of the molecule or the allosteric unit while maintaining regulation by the simple MWC model. However, a more sophisticated regulation mechanism would also be established when the 1×6-meric allosteric units (each behaving according to the simple MWC model) will not only assemble structurally but will also establish a functional coupling according to the nested MWC model. As discussed in previous papers this offers the possibility to provide an influence of different allosteric effectors on the oxygen binding behavior at different levels of the quaternary structure (1van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,40Decker H. Sterner R. Naturwissenschaften. 1990; 77: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). An additional advantage for multihexameric hemocyanins working according to the nested MWC model is the ability to create cooperative behavior over a broad range of saturation levels as discussed previously (8Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Robert C.H. Decker H. Richey B. Gill S.J. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, extracellular hemocyanins working according to the nested MWC model posses a broader functional flexibility compared with a hypothetical molecule with a simple MWC mechanism. This might be a consequence of the fact that extracellular respiratory proteins in poikilothermic animals such as arthropods have to face more pronounced environmental fluctuations than do intracellular respiratory proteins in mammals. The larger functional flexibility may help to ensure the delivery of oxygen precisely to the tissues under a broad range of conditions. The importance of applying different methods for structural investigations is demonstrated in our study by a comparison of hemocyanin structures obtained from TEM and SAXS. The interhexameric distance as obtained by TEM had to be shortened to be in agreement with the SAXS data. Similar deviations of calculated distance distribution functions p(r) based on TEM from those obtained by SAXS have been reported previously for the tarantula hemocyanin (19Decker H. Hartmann H. Sterner R. Schwarz E. Pilz I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 293: 226-230Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As in the case of the 2×6-meric lobster hemocyanin, the half-molecules of the 2×12-meric tarantula hemocyanin had to be shifted together to yield contacts between the half-molecules and to be in reasonable agreement with the SAXS data (Fig. 4). The differences may arise from the fact that these TEM studies utilized negative staining. It may be that the hemocyanin molecules are slightly distorted by the preparation of the negatively stained specimen resulting in larger differences between the two loosely connected half-molecules. Such an artifact cannot arise when SAXS is applied, since untreated proteins are investigated in solution. Thus, SAXS, which analyzes molecules in solution, may be considered as an important check for the three-dimensional reconstruction of macromolecules based on negatively stained specimens by TEM. This seems to be important especially for proteins with a large and complex quaternary structure. We thank Dr. G. Goerigk at Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor/Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) and Dr. T. Nawroth, University of Mainz, for their experimental and organizational support as well as Dr. K. van Holde for his many very helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2062292451,"Interactions between rat polymerase β (pol β) and the template-primer, as well as gapped DNAs, were studied using the quantitative fluorescence titration technique. Stoichiometries of rat pol β complexes with DNA substrates are much higher than stoichiometries predicted by the structures of co-crystals. The data can be understood in the context of the two single-stranded (ss)DNA-binding modes of the enzyme, the (pol β)16and (pol β)5 binding modes, which differ by the number of nucleotides occluded by the protein. The 8-kDa domain of the enzyme engages the double-stranded (ds)DNA downstream from the primer, while the 31-kDa domain has similar affinity for the ss-ds DNA junction and the dsDNA. The affinity of rat pol β for the gapped DNA is not affected by the size of the gap. The results indicate a plausible model for recognition of the gapped DNA by rat pol β. The enzyme binds the ss-ds DNA junction of the gap using the 31-kDa domain. This binding induces an allosteric transition, resulting in the association of the 8-kDa domain with the dsDNA, leading to an amplification of the affinity for the gap. The 5′ terminal phosphate, downstream from the primer, has little effect on the affinity, but affects the ssDNA conformation of the gap."

Because dynamitin overexpression dissociates dynein from the mitotic kinetochore (20Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4673-4685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed as a link between dynein and its cargo. However, interactions between motor proteins and membranes are usually reversible, and one or more regulatory mechanisms may exist. The interaction between dynamitin and MacMARCKS may aid the reversible link, because MacMARCKS is a membrane-bound protein. Both the membrane association of MacMARCKS and MacMARCKS-dynamitin interaction are regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Vergeres G. Manenti S. Weber T. Sturzinger C. J. Biol.

Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interaction between MacMARCKS and dynamitin has been shown in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation from total lysate (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, whether these two proteins truly interact in living cells and the spatial and temporal information of such interaction remain unknown. Therefore, we decided to examine whether these two proteins are in proximity in cells, using the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon of radiationless energy transfer from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule via an induced-dipole interaction. Two conditions must be satisfied for FRET to occur. First, two fluorophores must have the proper spectral overlap, i.e. the emission spectrum of the first fluorophore (donor) must overlap with the excitation spectrum of the second (acceptor) fluorophore. Second, the spatial distances and the relative orientation of the two fluorophores' transition dipoles must be sufficiently close. The efficiency of FRET depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance R between the donor and acceptor. Thus, the distance should not be more than 10 nm. By labeling proteins with fluorophores, FRET can be used to determine the proximity of two proteins. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) greatly enhance the use of FRET. This pair of proteins has been widely used to obtain information both about the existence of FRET and the localization of FRET in live cells, including the interaction of calmodulin and calmodulin-binding peptide (25Miyawaki A.

In this paper, we report that when a chimera of MacMARCKS-YFP and a chimera of CFP-dynamitin were expressed in RAW macrophages and in 293 epithelial cells, FRET was observed between these two proteins. When phorbol ester was added to disrupt the interaction of these two proteins (28Kadi A. Pichard V. Lehmann M. Briand C. Braguer D. Marvaldi J. Rognoni J.B. Luis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), FRET disappeared. These data suggest that MacMARCKS and dynamitin indeed interact in the cells. RAW macrophage cells and 293 epithelial cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). cDNA encoding MacMARCKS (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and dynamitin (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol.

Prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-2 and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pProEX Hta was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit anti-MacMARCKS antibody was generated in collaboration with Dr. S. Slivka (Tenabe Laboratory, La Jolla, CA) against His-MacMARCKS fusion protein and was affinity-purified as described (29Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Goat anti-dynamitin antiserum was generated using purified GST fusion protein of dynamitin in Ferrell Farms (Oklahoma City, OK). Other secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunological Laboratory (West Grove, PA). SuperFect transfection reagents were purchased from Qiagen. All other routine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. cDNA encoding MacMARCKS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the 5′-primer, 5′-TCC TTC GGA TCC ATG GGC AGC CAG AGC TCT AAG GCT-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-GCC TTG GGA TCC CAC TCA TTC TG-3′, using wild type MacMARCKS in pcDNA II as template (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The primers contained a BamHI site for easy cloning into the pEYFP-N1 upstream of YFP. The term “MacMARCKS-YFP” indicates that YFP is at the C terminus of MacMARCKS. Dynamitin or its mutant cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the 5′-primer, 5′-GGA CTC GGA TCC CCG GAA TTC-3′, and the 3′-primer, 5′-CTG TTC TCC GGA TCC CAA ATG-3′, using wild type dynamitin or MacMARCKS-binding domain deletion (MBD) mutant in pGEX plasmid as template (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The primers contained a BamHI site for easy cloning into pECFP-C1 downstream of CFP. The term “CFP-dynamitin” indicates that the CFP is at the N terminus of dynamitin. The sequences of all polymerase chain reaction products were confirmed before use. The MacMARCKS plasmid (1 μg) and dynamitin plasmid (1 μg) described above were cotransfected into 106 RAW cells or into 5 × 105 293 cells using the SuperFect liposome method as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The RAW cells were analyzed by FRET and Western blot 15 h after transfection, and the 293 cells were analyzed by FRET and Western blot 20 h after transfection. cDNA encoding CFP-dynamitin containing a blunt end at its 5′ andSalI sticky end at its 3′ were inserted downstream of GST into pGEX-4T-2 cut with SmaI site at the upstream end andXhoI at the downstream end. cDNA encoding MacMARCKS-YFP containing EcoRI site at its 5′ end and NotI at its 3′ end were inserted into pProEX HTa plasmid downstream of the His tag by using matching restriction sites. After being transformed into the DH5α strain, expression of the fusion proteins was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The GST-CFP-dynamitin fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described (30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The His6 fusion protein of MacMARCKS-YFP was purified using Ni/NTA-Sepharose as described in the manufacturer's manual (Qiagen). The His6 fusion proteins of MacMARCKS-YFP (2 μg each) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl of 50% slurry) conjugated with GST fusion proteins of CFP-dynamitin in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in Eppendorf tubes for 1 h at 4 °C. Meanwhile, glutathione-GST beads were used as negative control. After three washes, Sepharose beads were transferred to fresh tubes and washed again. The GST-dynamitin and the dynamitin-bound MacMARCKS were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9%) and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. MacMARCKS was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-MacMARCKS antibody. The GST-dynamitin fusion proteins and GST on the Sepharose beads were detected by Coomassie blue staining of the same membrane. The spectrofluorometric study was carried out on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. RAW cells (5 × 106) were transiently transfected with both CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP. After 20 h, the culture was stimulated with or without 100 nm PMA for 15 min. The cells were then scraped off the plate and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The emission spectra of CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP in lysate were then measured using an excitation wavelength of 425 nm, which was chosen to maximize the excitation of CFP and minimize the direct excitation of YFP. The spectrofluorometer was set at the ratio mode of 2 nm wavelength intervals, the emission bandpass was 2 nm at 5 s integration. With an ideal pair of fluorophores, the emission spectrum of the donor should overlap largely with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor and absolutely should not overlap with the emission spectrum of the acceptor. At the same time, the excitation spectrum of the acceptor absolutely should not overlap with the excitation wavelength of the donor. However, CFP and YFP showed certain overlapping spectra that needed to be corrected (Fig. 1). We used three sets of filters in our FRET experiments. The CFP filter set was for observing the location and intensity of CFP-dynamitin: excitation filter 440 ± 21 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm DRLP, and an emission filter of 480 ± 30 nm. The YFP filter set was for the MacMARCKS-YFP: excitation filter 500 ± 25 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 525 nm DRLP, and an emission filter of 545 ± 35 nm. The FRET was observed by exciting cells at the CFP wavelength and detecting at the YFP emission wavelength. Thus, the FRET filter set contained the excitation filter at 440 ± 20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm DRLP, and an emission filter of 535 ± 25 nm. When cells was observed under the FRET filter set, a certain amount of the CFP emission leaked through the FRET filter, and a certain amount of YFP was directly excited by the FRET excitation wavelength (Fig.1). To eliminate these two contributions, the following calculation was used, FRET=IFRET−CCFP−CYFPEquation 1 where IFRET is the intensity of FRET with the FRET filter set of CFP/YFP-coexpressed cells andCCFP and CYFP are the contributions from CFP and YFP, respectively, because of overlapping spectra. The contribution of these two could not be directly measured in cells coexpressing the YFP and CFP. However, they can be measured in cells expressing only CFP or YFP. The contribution of YFP and CFP to FRET in coexpressed cells is proportional to that in single expression cells (31Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.-H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar).

Thus, CCFP=30.84%×ICFPand CYFP=13.97%×IYFPEquation 4 where ICFP is the intensity of CFP observed under the CFP filter set in coexpressing cells andIYFP is the intensity of YFP observed under the YFP filter set in coexpressing cells. In our experiments, the cells were cultured on coverslips overnight. Fifteen hours after transfection with both cDNAs encoding CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP, a coverslip was placed face down in a steel chamber on a heated stage in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, buffered with 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. The bottom of the chamber was an 0.15-mm thick glass that allowed the use of a 100× object lens. We first measured the FRET with the FRET filter, then the ICFP with the CFP filter, and finally the IYFP with the YFP filter under the exact same exposure time using a CCD camera (Optronic DE750). The FRET was then calculated by FRET=IFRET−30.84%ICFP−13.97%IYFPEquation 5 To obtain information about the localization of FRET in a cell, the FRET value of each pixel of the total 307,200 pixels was calculated individually using a computer program written in-house and based on the above formula. 2The software is free to all researchers upon request. The calculated FRET value was then plotted pixel by pixel so that a net image of FRET could be presented. In addition, because FRET intensity is a function of the expression level of CFP and YFP, it is not possible to compare FRET intensity between cells expressing different levels of CFP and YFP. To compare FRET between cells, FRETN (normalized FRET) was introduced (31Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.-H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) as follows. FRETN=FRET/(ICFP×IYFP)Equation 6 In a sense, FRETN has the same meaning as the equilibrium constant in a chemical reaction. Keq=[product]/[reactant1][reactant2]Equation 7 Therefore, the larger the FRETN, the higher the ratio of complex between CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP. Although a previous report has shown that His6-tagged MacMARCKS binds to GST-tagged dynamitin on glutathione-Sepharose beads (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was not known whether the fluorescent tag would affect the binding between these two proteins. To verify that attaching fluorescent protein to dynamitin and to MacMARCKS would not affect their binding, we first assayed the binding between purified the GST-CFP-dynamitin fusion protein the and His-MacMARCKS-YFP fusion protein. We used the same method as previously described (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except that this time a YFP was tagged at the C terminus of MacMARCKS and a CFP was inserted between the N terminus of dynamitin and the C terminus of GST. Fig. 2 shows that the His-MacMARCKS-YFP protein was specifically retained on the GST-CFP-dynamitin beads but not on the GST beads, even though the GST was used in excess amounts. Therefore, tagging fluorescent protein on dynamitin and on MacMARCKS does not inhibit their ability to bind to each other. Once we determined that CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP interact in vitro, we then packaged the cDNA, encoding each of them into the cytomegalovirus-driven expression vectors and transiently expressed them in RAW cells. The expression levels of CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP were determined both by immunoblotting with antibodies against MacMARCKS and dynamitin (Fig.3) and by surveying with a microscope for cells expressing both blue and green fluorescence. By Western blot, MacMARCKS-YFP in transfected cells migrated at a molecular mass of about 67 kDa, roughly equal to the total of the apparent molecular mass of MacMARCKS (42 kDa) and YFP (26 kDa). In untransfected cells, no corresponding band was observed (Fig. 3). The cotransfected dynamitin was also expressed in these cells; CFP-dynamitin (76 kDa) migrated at the total apparent molecular mass of dynamitin (50 kDa) and CFP (26 kDa). Again, no corresponding band was seen in untransfected cells (Fig. 3). With microscopy, we found that ∼20% of the RAW cells expressed both proteins. All transfected cells expressed both fluorescent proteins, and we did not find any cells expressing only one of the transfected constructs. With regard to the ratio of the two proteins in the transfected cells, MacMARCKS-YFP was approximately equal to CFP-dynamitin in RAW cells as determined by their fluorescent intensity quantitated by a CCD camera. When we attempted to culture the transfected cells for more than 2 weeks under the G418 selection pressure, all transfected cells eventually died, a result that agreed with a report that overexpression disrupts normal cell division (20Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The FRET assay under a microscope observes only the increase in YFP emission. To be sure that an increased emission at the YFP emission peak indeed results from authentic FRET, one must show a simultaneous decrease in CFP emission and an increase in YFP emission. Therefore, we first examined the fluorescent spectral properties of the MacMARCKS-YFP·CFP-dynamitin complex using a spectrofluorometer. Because portions of these two proteins exist as a complex in lysate from untreated cells but not in cells treated with PMA (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we therefore studied the MacMARCKS-YFP·CFP-dynamitin complex in RAW cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding MacMARCKS-YFP and CFP-dynamitin. These cells presumably contain a mixture of unbound MacMARCKS-YFP, CFP-dynamitin, and bound MacMARCKS-YFP·CFP-dynamitin. Because the light scattering caused by intact cells in solution interfered with the measurement, 1% Triton X-100 was used to dissolve the cells, and the solution was measured for the emission spectrum excited at 425 nm. The excitation wavelength was selected at the blue side of the CFP excitation wavelength to avoid excessive cross-excitation of YFP (Fig. 1, arrow). Under this condition, we observed an emission peak at 475 nm, which corresponded to the CFP emission, and another peak at 527 nm, which corresponded to YFP emission (Fig. 4). This emission at YFP wavelength should represent a mixed emission of directly excited YFP resulting from a slight overlapping of the YFP excitation spectrum in 425 nm, emission of CFP at the YFP region from the overlapped emission spectrum of CFP, and true FRET. If the interaction between MacMARCKS and dynamitin is blocked, the FRET should disappeared, which should translate to a decrease in the YFP emission peak and an increase in the CFP emission peak. Therefore, we treated the cells with 100 nm of PMA for 15 min before adding Triton X-100, because PMA-promoted MacMARCKS phosphorylation decreases the binding between these two proteins (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed an ∼10% decrease in the YFP emission peak and a corresponding increase in the CFP emission peak. These data indicate that the increase in YFP emission observed using microscopic methods indeed resulted from FRET. Next we examined the FRET of the transfected cells under the microscope. The FRET and FRETN value of each cell were represented by averaging the 30 areas at the size of 20 × 20 pixels with the highest FRETN value. Then the average FRET and FRETN values of ∼30 cells of each sample group were compared with those of the negative control group (cells cotransfected with empty CFP and YFP plasmid). In RAW cells, we found that the FRETN value of CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP-coexpressing cells was 67-fold greater than the control group, which is a statistically significant difference (TableI). To be sure that the positive FRET is not limited only to RAW cells, we also examined 293 cells cotransfected with wild type dynamitin and MacMARCKS. Similar data were obtained in which the FRETN was 159-fold greater than its negative control (TableI).Table IFRET and FRETN comparison of different cellsCellsConstructsPMAFRETNFRETp value10−3RAWMacMARCKS-YFP−23.2 ± 19.512.04 ± 6.59<0.001 (n = 30)CFP-DynamitinRAWMacMARCKS-YFP+0.612 ± 1.602.32 ± 7.82>0.05 (n = 30)CFP-DynamitinRAWMacMARCKS-YFP−1.72 ± 3.101.33 ± 2.41>0.05 (n = 15)CFP-MBDRAWED-YFP−1.13 ± 1.873.99 ± 6.03>0.05 (n = 29)CFP-DynamitinRAWYFP−0.43 ± 9.202.00 ± 4.25– (n = 19)CFP293MacMARCKS-YFP−45.9 ± 39.010.08 ± 7.67<0.001 (n = 26)CFP-Dynamitin293MacMARCKS-YFP+1.62 ± 2.562.35 ± 4.12>0.05 (n = 24)CFP-Dynamitin293CFP−0.44 ± 1.322.74 ± 4.83– (n = 15)YFPThe FRETN and FRET value in each row is an average of n cells.

Open table in a new tab The FRETN and FRET value in each row is an average of n cells. To obtain the FRETN and FRET value of each cell, 30 areas (20 × 20 pixels) with the highest FRETN value within cell boundary were used. The average FRETN and FRET of the 30 areas represents the FRETN and FRET of this cell. For statistical analysis, each group of cell was compared with the group transfected with CFP/YFP empty plasmids using the standard t test provided in SigmaPlot software. Because the directly observed image was a mixture of contributions from FRET and from CFP and YFP, we calculated the FRET values pixel by pixel and plotted them using in-house software. This process provided spatial information about the interaction site in live cells. Non-PMA-treated RAW cells maintained their spherical shape, and MacMARCKS-YFP concentrated on the plasma membrane in these cells when compared with the uniform distribution of CFP and YFP mock transfected cells (Fig.5). Although CFP-dynamitin was primarily distributed in the perinuclear region, the FRET was concentrated at the cell periphery where MacMARCKS was located, thereby suggesting that the portion of dynamitin interacting with MacMARCKS is that located at the periphery (Fig. 5). Because the interaction between MacMARCKS and dynamitin is regulated by PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we then tested whether PMA treatment also abolishes the FRET observed in cells coexpressing CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP. After being treated with 100 nm PMA for 15 min, the RAW cells spread out. Most MacMARCKS-YFP was concentrated at the perinuclear region with small residual amounts left on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). Although CFP-dynamitin was also concentrated at the perinuclear region, no FRET was observed in the perinuclear region or anywhere else in these cells. The FRETN values of these PMA-treated cells were at the same level as the negative control groups (Table I). This observation suggested that merely having two proteins colocalized in the same subcellular localization was not sufficient to induce FRET. Again, PMA also abolished the FRET between CFP-dynamitin and MacMARCKS-YFP in 293 cells (Table I). To be sure that the FRET observed had indeed resulted from a true protein-protein interaction and not from a random encounter between two overexpressed proteins in a crowded space, we expressed the MacMARCKS-binding domain deletion mutant of dynamitin (CFP-MBD) instead of wild type dynamitin in RAW cells. Although MacMARCKS was still concentrated at the plasma membrane in RAW cells and the mutant dynamitin still at the perinuclear zone, the mutant dynamitin no longer caused the FRET (Fig. 5), because the mutant dynamitin did not bind to MacMARCKS (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The FRETN values were extracted from these cells coexpressing the mutant dynamitin and wild type MacMARCKS; the values were close to those of the negative control (Table I). These data provided convincing negative control to support the hypothesis that the FRET between MacMARCKS and wild type dynamitin resulted from actual protein-protein binding. Thus, we conclude that the interaction between MacMARCKS and dynamitin indeed exists in cells and is subjected to the regulation of MacMARCKS phosphorylation. In this report, we have show that MacMARCKS and dynamitin occur in proximity in the peripheral membrane in live macrophage cells and on the perinuclear vesicles of live 293 cells. As required by the FRET principle, these two molecules must be within 10 nm of each other for FRET to occur. Considering in vitro binding data and coimmunoprecipitation data supporting their binding (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we conclude that these two proteins indeed interact in cells. In addition, thein vivo interaction is regulated by PMA-stimulated MacMARCKS phosphorylation, because FRET no longer occurred after cells were treated with PMA. These data correlate with previously reported data that PMA regulates the direct binding of these two proteins in binding assays with both purified proteins and coimmunoprecipitation. Thus, this report provides the first evidence of in vivointeraction of MacMARCKS and dynamitin in live cells. We can safely say that these two proteins interact with each other in unstimulated macrophages near the cell periphery. During PMA-stimulated cell spreading, the localization of FRET at this site disappears. This observation also agrees with our finding that when the interaction of these two proteins is inhibited, the cells spread (12Yue L. Lu S. Garces J. Jin T. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23948-23956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the interaction is a mechanism of maintaining the cells in a spherical shape. Because intact microtubule is required for the maintenance of cell shape (32Ingber D.E. Prusty D. Sun Z. Betensky H. Wang N. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), microtubules must be anchored to the plasma membrane or to the microfilaments beneath the plasma membrane. We speculate that dynamitin may be such an anchor, because it is linked to microtubules through a dynactin complex on one end and to the plasma membrane through its interaction with MacMARCKS on the other end. There are two possible ways for this anchor to mediate the involvement of microtubules in cell spreading. One possibility is integrin activation, which is the initial step of cell spreading (33Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Our recent work showed that the intact microtubule cytoskeleton is indeed responsible for keeping integrin from being activated. 3X. M. Zhou, J. Li, and D. F. Kucik, manuscript submitted for publication. The intact microtubule cytoskeleton could exert its influence by linking to dynamitin through dynactin and dynein. Then interaction of dynamitin with MacMARCKS translates the effect of the microtubule to the integrin. This possibility is supported by reports that MacMARCKS is also required for integrin activation (2Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol.

The second possible mechanism for microtubules keeping cells in a spherical shape is to interfere with focal adhesion. It is known that intact microtubule cytoskeleton is required for the disassembly of focal adhesion (34Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Dynamitin-MacMARCKS may be responsible for anchoring the microtubules to the focal adhesion. Because the assembly of focal adhesion, which promotes cell spreading, and disassembly of focal adhesion, which returns cells to spherical shape, are a balanced process, when dynamitin mutation interferes with disassembly, cell returns to a spherical shape. All of these possible mechanisms are dynamic processes in living cells. The FRET assay of the MacMARCKS and dynamitin interaction thus provides us with a good tool for further studying these possible mechanisms of the involvement of microtubules in cell spreading. We appreciate Dr. Y. Liu's (University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK) help in setting up the FRET assay. We also thank Drs. S. Olson and S. Raja for help with the spectrofluorometer. We thank Dr. D.
