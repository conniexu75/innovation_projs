Gessner [11 May 1973, p. 569], sentence 4, paragraph 2, column 1, should read as follows: It would seem likely that such an evaluative device would not differentiate between students able to solve the first problem presented to them and those who, although they may have been able to solve the fifth problem variant presented to them, failed to solve the first four."

They can be studied by their electron spin resonance spectra and, in the case of electrons, by their optical spectra, recombination luminescence, and electrical conductivity. The decay kinetics of these reaction intermediates serve to distinguish those trapped as geminate pairs or in spurs of high concentration from those formed with random distributions. Electron spin resonance studies of relaxation times and of the spectra of radical pairs provide further evidence on geometrical distributions. The decay rates of radicals combining with reactive geminate partners are dependent on the size and shape of the radical, the temperature, and the nature of the matrix. Decay is much slower in deuterated matrices than in protiated matrices. The factors that control the physical trapping of electrons in organic glasses are under intensive investigation. There is evidence that many electrons trapped relatively weakly during irradiations at 4Â°K deepen their traps by orientation of dipoles when the matrix is warmed; that most electrons are trapped in the field of the geminate positive ion; that in some matrices the traps have a bound excited state to which the electron can be promoted without detrapping; and that trapped electrons can tunnel to solute molecules with a higher electron affinity than the trap depth."

The question naturally arises: Is the Diaporthe a native species of this country which had escaped the observation of mycologists, or is it an introduced exotic species ? If it is a native species we must next ask how it happens that so severe an epidemic has appeared suddenly, for, if the fungus has always existed here, the important practical question is: What temporary conditions have arisen which have enabled it to increase at a rate previously unknown? Although there are some vague references to diseased chestnut trees in agricultural journals published a good many years ago, there is nothing in them to warrant us in believing that a disease at all comparable with the present chestnut epidemic ever prevailed here. One thing, at least, is certain. Had there been within the last fifty or sixty years a disease of chestnuts in the region now devastated similar to the present epidemic, there would have been left no large trees to be attacked now."

https://openalex.org/W2050513054,"This brief survey of integrated and electronic data processing has touched on such matters as the origin of the concepts, their use in business, machines that are available, indexing problems, and, finally, some scientific uses that surely foreshadow further development. The purpose of this has been to present for the consideration of scientists a point of view and some techniques which have had a phenomenal growth in the business world and to suggest that these are worth consideration in scientific data-handling problems (30). To close, let me quote from William Bamert on the experience of the C. and O. Railroad once more (8, p. 121): ""Frankly, we have been asked whether we weren't planning for Utopia-the implication being that everyone except starry-eyed visionaries knows that Utopia is unattainable. Our answer is that of course we are! Has anyone yet discovered a better way to begin program planning of this nature? Our feeling is that compromise comes early enough in the normal order of things."""

https://openalex.org/W3033691810,The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the American Physical Society (APS) both met in Washington in the week after Easter. Beyond the coincidence of time and place it is fair to say that the meetings shared a common mood. The truce in Vietnam is generally regarded as the principal cause of a muting of the voices of protest that have been heard at so many scientific meetings in recent years and finally had disturbed the even tenor of the academy's ways. Particularly at APS there seems to be new interest and energy directed to exploring ways to work within the system.
