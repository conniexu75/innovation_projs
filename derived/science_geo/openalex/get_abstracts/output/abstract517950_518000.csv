Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria, the organelles primarily responsible for cellular respiration and energy production, are also critical centres for antibacterial and antiviral innate immune responses. This study describes a link between mitochondrial stress and antiviral innate immunity. Specifically, mitochondrial DNA stress in herpes virus infected mice is shown to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance through activation of the DNA sensor cGAS and the STING–IRF3 stress pathway. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally present at thousands of copies per cell and is packaged into several hundred higher-order structures termed nucleoids1. The abundant mtDNA-binding protein TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation2. Complete mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses3. However, the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined4. Here we show that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as TMEM173)–IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic trigger of antiviral signalling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage antiviral innate immunity."

We detect 230 selective sweeps and 162 selected copy number variants by analysis of 302 resequenced wild, landrace and improved soybean accessions at >11× depth. A genome-wide association study using these new sequences reveals associations between 10 selected regions and 9 domestication or improvement traits, and identifies 13 previously uncharacterized loci for agronomic traits including oil content, plant height and pubescence form. Combined with previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) information, we find that, of the 230 selected regions, 96 correlate with reported oil QTLs and 21 contain fatty acid biosynthesis genes. Moreover, we observe that some traits and loci are associated with geographical regions, which shows that soybean populations are structured geographically. This study provides resources for genomics-enabled improvements in soybean breeding."
https://openalex.org/W1982957001,"In studies in mammalian cells, polymerase theta (Polθ, also known as POLQ) is identified as the polymerase responsible for non-homologous end joining DNA repair; this DNA repair pathway acts in many tumours when homologous recombination is inactivated and the identification of the polymerase responsible may aid the development of new therapeutic approaches. The error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway is used as an alternative when the error-free homologous recombination pathway is compromised, or is the pathway of choice in some cellular contexts, such as in the immune system. After broken ends are paired via microhomology, NHEJ depends on DNA synthesis, but the identity of the polymerase involved was unclear. Two studies, from the laboratories of Agnel Sfeir and Alan D'Andrea, now implicate the mammalian POLQ gene, encoding the error-prone polymerase Polθ, in this process. Sfeir and colleagues show that upon telomere deprotection, Polθ is needed to prevent alternative end joining at telomeres, and chromosomal translations at non-telomeric sequences. D'Andrea and colleagues focus on the role of Polθ in cancer cells, and show that in a homologous-recombination-deficient background, the absence of Polθ results in a synthetic lethality, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach. Large-scale genomic studies have shown that half of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) have alterations in genes regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair1. Loss of HR accounts for the genomic instability of EOCs and for their cellular hyper-dependence on alternative poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA repair mechanisms2,3,4,5. Previous studies have implicated the DNA polymerase θ (Polθ also known as POLQ, encoded by POLQ)6 in a pathway required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks7,8,9, referred to as the error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway10,11,12,13. Whether Polθ interacts with canonical DNA repair pathways to prevent genomic instability remains unknown. Here we report an inverse correlation between HR activity and Polθ expression in EOCs. Knockdown of Polθ in HR-proficient cells upregulates HR activity and RAD51 nucleofilament assembly, while knockdown of Polθ in HR-deficient EOCs enhances cell death. Consistent with these results, genetic inactivation of an HR gene (Fancd2) and Polq in mice results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, Polθ contains RAD51 binding motifs and it blocks RAD51-mediated recombination. Our results reveal a synthetic lethal relationship between the HR pathway and Polθ-mediated repair in EOCs, and identify Polθ as a novel druggable target for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2168396953,"The alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery facilitates several genomic rearrangements, some of which can lead to cellular transformation. This error-prone repair pathway is triggered upon telomere de-protection to promote the formation of deleterious chromosome end-to-end fusions. Using next-generation sequencing technology, here we show that repair by alternative NHEJ yields non-TTAGGG nucleotide insertions at fusion breakpoints of dysfunctional telomeres. Investigating the enzymatic activity responsible for the random insertions enabled us to identify polymerase theta (Polθ; encoded by Polq in mice) as a crucial alternative NHEJ factor in mammalian cells. Polq inhibition suppresses alternative NHEJ at dysfunctional telomeres, and hinders chromosomal translocations at non-telomeric loci. In addition, we found that loss of Polq in mice results in increased rates of homology-directed repair, evident by recombination of dysfunctional telomeres and accumulation of RAD51 at double-stranded breaks. Lastly, we show that depletion of Polθ has a synergistic effect on cell survival in the absence of BRCA genes, suggesting that the inhibition of this mutagenic polymerase represents a valid therapeutic avenue for tumours carrying mutations in homology-directed repair genes."
https://openalex.org/W2072675976,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein that is involved in neuronal and synaptic vesicle plasticity, but its aggregation to form amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The interaction between α-syn and lipid surfaces is believed to be a key feature for mediation of its normal function, but under other circumstances it is able to modulate amyloid fibril formation. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we identify the mechanism through which facile aggregation of α-syn is induced under conditions where it binds a lipid bilayer, and we show that the rate of primary nucleation can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude or more under such conditions. These results reveal the key role that membrane interactions can have in triggering conversion of α-syn from its soluble state to the aggregated state that is associated with neurodegeneration and to its associated disease states."

https://openalex.org/W2060931853,"Insertion of AMPA receptors into the synaptic membrane is thought to be a central mechanism for controlling experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength, yet this has never been observed in real time in the intact brain. Using two-photon imaging, Zhang and colleagues were able to provide this missing piece of information by tracking the insertion of GluA1 in spines in mouse barrel cortex neurons during repetitive whisker stimulation. Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) membrane trafficking is critical for synaptic plasticity, as well as for learning and memory. However, the mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking in vivo remain elusive. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in the mouse somatosensory barrel cortex, we found that acute whisker stimulation led to a significant increase in the intensity of surface AMPAR GluA1 subunit (sGluA1) in both spines and dendritic shafts and a small increase in spine size relative to prestimulation values. Interestingly, the initial spine properties biased spine changes following whisker stimulation. Changes in spine sGluA1 intensity were positively correlated with changes in spine size and dendritic shaft sGluA1 intensity following whisker stimulation. The increase in spine sGluA1 intensity evoked by whisker stimulation was NMDA receptor dependent and long lasting, similar to major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. In this study we were able to observe experience-dependent AMPAR trafficking in real time and characterize, in vivo, a major form of synaptic plasticity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2035352715,"To examine the interaction between molecular, electrical and behavioral circadian rhythms, we combined optogenetic manipulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) firing rate with bioluminescence imaging and locomotor activity monitoring. Manipulating firing rate reset circadian rhythms both ex vivo and in vivo, and this resetting required spikes and network communication. This suggests that SCN firing rate is fundamental to circadian pacemaking as both an input to and output of the molecular clockworks."
https://openalex.org/W2002701925,"The authors investigated the role of glycinergic preBötC neurons in respiratory rhythmogenesis in mice using viral delivery of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or Archaerhodopsin (Arch) genes. They conclude that glycinergic preBötC neurons modulate inspiratory pattern and are important for reflex apneas but that the rhythm can persist after significant dampening of their activity. Inhibitory neurons make up a substantial fraction of the neurons in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a site that is critical for mammalian eupneic breathing. We investigated the role of glycinergic preBötC neurons in respiratory rhythmogenesis in mice using optogenetically targeted excitation and inhibition. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or Archaerhodopsin (Arch) were expressed in glycinergic preBötC neurons of glycine transporter 2 (Glyt2, also known as Slc6a5)-Cre mice. In ChR2-transfected mice, brief inspiratory-phase bilateral photostimulation targeting the preBötC prematurely terminated inspiration, whereas expiratory-phase photostimulation delayed the onset of the next inspiration. Prolonged photostimulation produced apneas lasting as long as the light pulse. Inspiratory-phase photoinhibition in Arch-transfected mice during inspiration increased tidal volume without altering inspiratory duration, whereas expiratory-phase photoinhibition shortened the latency until the next inspiration. During persistent apneas, prolonged photoinhibition restored rhythmic breathing. We conclude that glycinergic preBötC neurons modulate inspiratory pattern and are important for reflex apneas, but that the rhythm can persist after substantial dampening of their activity."
https://openalex.org/W1988926385,"Comprehensive analysis of epigenetic regulation demonstrates a series of complex, interacting chromatin mechanisms by which chronic exposure to opiates downregulates Bdnf gene transcription in the ventral tegmental area. This regulatory cascade is also shown to play a role in controlling opiate-induced behavioral plasticity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a crucial role in modulating neural and behavioral plasticity to drugs of abuse. We found a persistent downregulation of exon-specific Bdnf expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in response to chronic opiate exposure, which was mediated by specific epigenetic modifications at the corresponding Bdnf gene promoters. Exposure to chronic morphine increased stalling of RNA polymerase II at these Bdnf promoters in VTA and altered permissive and repressive histone modifications and occupancy of their regulatory proteins at the specific promoters. Furthermore, we found that morphine suppressed binding of phospho-CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) to Bdnf promoters in VTA, which resulted from enrichment of trimethylated H3K27 at the promoters, and that decreased NURR1 (nuclear receptor related-1) expression also contributed to Bdnf repression and associated behavioral plasticity to morphine. Our findings suggest previously unknown epigenetic mechanisms of morphine-induced molecular and behavioral neuroadaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2034329045,"An important goal of synthetic biology is the rational design and predictable implementation of synthetic gene circuits using standardized and interchangeable parts. However, engineering of complex circuits in mammalian cells is currently limited by the availability of well-characterized and orthogonal transcriptional repressors. Here, we introduce a library of 26 reversible transcription activator-like effector repressors (TALERs) that bind newly designed hybrid promoters and exert transcriptional repression through steric hindrance of key transcriptional initiation elements. We demonstrate that using the input-output transfer curves of our TALERs enables accurate prediction of the behavior of modularly assembled TALER cascade and switch circuits. We also show that TALER switches using feedback regulation exhibit improved accuracy for microRNA-based HeLa cancer cell classification versus HEK293 cells. Our TALER library is a valuable toolkit for modular engineering of synthetic circuits, enabling programmable manipulation of mammalian cells and helping elucidate design principles of coupled transcriptional and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2008690634,"This study shows that cocaine strengthens glutamatergic transmission, reduces K+ channel function and drives hyperexcitability in lateral habenula neurons projecting to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. The authors also show that GluA1 trafficking mediates these cellular modifications and is instrumental in a drug-mediated depressive-like phenotype. Addictive substances mediate positive and negative states promoting persistent drug use. However, substrates for aversive effects of drugs remain elusive. We found that, in mouse lateral habenula (LHb) neurons targeting the rostromedial tegmental nucleus, cocaine enhanced glutamatergic transmission, reduced K+ currents and increased excitability. GluA1 trafficking in LHb was instrumental for these cocaine-evoked modifications and drug-driven aversive behaviors. Altogether, our results suggest that long-lasting adaptations in LHb shape negative symptoms after drug taking."
https://openalex.org/W2037701255,"microRNAs control synaptic signaling through regulation of postsynaptic responsiveness. This study provides evidence that the conserved microRNAs miR-1000 and miR-137 act presynaptically via glutamate transporters to regulate glutamate release. miR-1000 expression is activity dependent, perhaps allowing activity to fine-tune the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission. Evidence has begun to emerge for microRNAs as regulators of synaptic signaling, specifically acting to control postsynaptic responsiveness during synaptic transmission. In this report, we provide evidence that Drosophila melanogaster miR-1000 acts presynaptically to regulate glutamate release at the synapse by controlling expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut). Genetic deletion of miR-1000 led to elevated apoptosis in the brain as a result of glutamatergic excitotoxicity. The seed-similar miR-137 regulated VGluT2 expression in mouse neurons. These conserved miRNAs share a neuroprotective function in the brains of flies and mice. Drosophila miR-1000 showed activity-dependent expression, which might serve as a mechanism to allow neuronal activity to fine-tune the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2053054361,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common latent virus in humans, causes certain severe diseases. Extensive use of acyclovir (ACV) results in the development of drug-resistant HSV strains, hence, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat HSV infection. Houttuynia cordata (H. cordata), a natural herbal medicine, has been reported to exhibit anti-HSV effects which is partly NF-κB-dependent. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H. cordata inhibits HSV infection are not elucidated thoroughly. Here, we report that H. cordata water extracts (HCWEs) inhibit the infection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 mainly via blocking viral binding and penetration in the beginning of infection. HCWEs also suppress HSV replication. Furthermore, HCWEs attenuate the first-wave of NF-κB activation, which is essential for viral gene expressions. Further analysis of six compounds in HCWEs revealed that quercetin and isoquercitrin inhibit NF-κB activation and additionally, quercetin also has an inhibitory effect on viral entry. These results indicate that HCWEs can inhibit HSV infection through multiple mechanisms and could be a potential lead for development of new drugs for treating HSV."
https://openalex.org/W2063288985,"When paired with dart biopsying, quantifying cortisol in blubber tissue may provide an index of relative stress levels (i.e., activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis) in free-ranging cetacean populations while minimizing the effects of the act of sampling. To validate this approach, cortisol was extracted from blubber samples collected from beach-stranded and bycaught short-beaked common dolphins using a modified blubber steroid isolation technique and measured via commercially available enzyme immunoassays. The measurements exhibited appropriate quality characteristics when analyzed via a bootstraped stepwise parallelism analysis (observed/expected = 1.03, 95%CI: 99.6 – 1.08) and showed no evidence of matrix interference with increasing sample size across typical biopsy tissue masses (75–150mg; r2 = 0.012, p = 0.78, slope = 0.022ngcortisol deviation/ultissue extract added). The relationships between blubber cortisol and eight potential cofactors namely, 1) fatality type (e.g., stranded or bycaught), 2) specimen condition (state of decomposition), 3) total body length, 4) sex, 5) sexual maturity state, 6) pregnancy status, 7) lactation state, and 8) adrenal mass, were assessed using a Bayesian generalized linear model averaging technique. Fatality type was the only factor correlated with blubber cortisol, and the magnitude of the effect size was substantial: beach-stranded individuals had on average 6.1-fold higher cortisol levels than those of bycaught individuals. Because of the difference in conditions surrounding these two fatality types, we interpret this relationship as evidence that blubber cortisol is indicative of stress response. We found no evidence of seasonal variation or a relationship between cortisol and the remaining cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2099547989,"Objective We investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in the neonatal period. Study design Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (≤32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. Concentrations of lactoferrin, LL-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of AMPs. Samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent LOS were compared for levels of AMPs and inhibition of bacterial growth. Results Levels of most AMPs and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. Lactoferrin was the only AMP that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. Levels of AMPs were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without LOS, however, infants who developed LOS consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk AMPs than those who were free from LOS. Conclusions The concentrations of lactoferrin and defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2000912972,"Introduction Upper limb evaluation of patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is crucially important to evaluations of efficacy of new treatments in non-ambulant patients. In patients who have lost ambulation, there are few validated and informative outcome measures. In addition, longitudinal data demonstrating sensitivity to clinical evolution of outcome measures over short-term periods are lacking. Patients and Methods We report here the results of a one-year multicenter study using specifically designed tools to assess grip, pinch strength, and hand function in wheelchair-bound patients. Our study assessed 53 non-ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 17.1 ± 4.8 years (range: 9 – 28.1 years). The average Brooke functional score of these patients was 4.6 ± 1.1. The average forced vital capacity was 44.5% predicted and 19 patients used non-invasive ventilation. Patients were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and one year using the Motor Function Measure and innovative devices (namely the MyoSet composed of MyoGrip, MyoPinch, and MoviPlate). Results Our study confirmed preliminary data previously reported regarding feasibility of use and of reliability of the MyoSet and the correlation at baseline between distal strength and clinical outcomes such as FVC, Brooke score, age, and duration since loss of ambulation. A significant correlation was observed between the distal upper limb strength and clinical variables. The sensitive dynamometers (MyoGrip and MyoPinch) and MoviPlate captured a 12-month change in non-ambulant Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients of all ages.

https://openalex.org/W1967763328,"Infections are a frequent cause for prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality after stroke. Recent studies revealed a stroke-induced depression of the peripheral immune system associated with an increased susceptibility for infections. In a mice model for stroke, this immunosuppressive effect was reversible after beta-blocker administration. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of beta-blocker therapy on the risk of infections and death after stroke in humans.625 consecutive patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, admitted to a university hospital stroke unit, were included in this historical cohort study. The effect of beta-blocker therapy on post-stroke pneumonia, urinary tract infections and death was investigated using multivariable Poisson and Cox regression models.553 (88.3%) patients were admitted with ischemic stroke, the remaining 72 (11.7%) had a hemorrhagic stroke. Median baseline NIHSS was 8 (IQR 5-16) points. 301 (48.2%) patients received beta-blocker therapy. There was no difference in the risk of post-stroke pneumonia between patients with and without beta-blocker therapy (Rate Ratio = 1.00, 95%CI 0.77-1.30, p = 0.995). Patients with beta-blocker therapy showed a decreased risk for urinary tract infections (RR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.43-0.98, p = 0.040). 7-days mortality did not differ between groups (Hazard Ratio = 1.36, 95%CI 0.65-2.77, p = 0.425), while patients with beta-blocker therapy showed a higher 30-days mortality (HR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.20-3.10, p = 0.006).Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce the risk for post-stroke pneumonia, but significantly reduced the risk for urinary tract infections. Different immune mechanisms underlying both diseases might explain these findings that need to be confirmed in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2058901570,"Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella are one of the most important public health problems in developed countries. ESBL-producing Salmonella strains have been isolated from humans in Asian countries neighboring Japan, along with strains harboring the plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistance gene, ampC (pAmpC). However, only a few studies have investigated the prevalence of ESC-resistant Salmonella in chicken products in Japan, which are the main vehicle of Salmonella transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ESBL-producing, pAmpC-harboring, or carbapenem-resistant Salmonella in chicken products in Japan. In total, 355 out of 779 (45.6%) chicken product samples collected from 1996–2010 contained Salmonella, resulting in 378 distinct isolates. Of these isolates, 373 were tested for resistance to ESCs, cephamycins, or carbapenems. Isolates that showed resistance to one or more of these antimicrobials were then examined by PCR and DNA sequence analysis for the presence of the blaCMY, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV resistance genes. Thirty-five resistant isolates were detected, including 26 isolates that contained pAmpC (blaCMY-2), and nine ESBL-producing isolates harboring blaCTX-M (n = 4, consisting of two blaCTX-M-2 and two blaCTX-M-15 genes), blaTEM (n = 4, consisting of one blaTEM-20 and three blaTEM-52 genes), and blaSHV (n = 1, blaSHV-12). All pAmpC-harboring and ESBL-producing Salmonella isolates were obtained from samples collected after 2005, and the percentage of resistant isolates increased significantly from 0% in 2004 to 27.9% in 2010 (P for trend = 0.006). This increase was caused in part by an increase in the number of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis strains harboring an approximately 280-kb plasmid containing blaCMY-2 in proximity to ISEcp1. The dissemination of ESC-resistant Salmonella containing plasmid-mediated blaCMY-2 in chicken products indicates the need for the development of continuous monitoring strategies in the interests of public health."

We immunized mice genetically deficient for lubricin (Prg4-/-) with purified human lubricin, and generated several mAbs. We determined each mAb’s binding epitope, sensitivity, and specificity using biologic samples and recombinant lubricin sub-domains, and we also developed a competition ELISA assay to measure lubricin in synovial fluid and blood. We found the mAbs all recognized epitopes containing O-linked oligosaccharides conjugated to the peptide motif KEPAPTTT. By western blot, the mAbs detected lubricin in 1 μl of synovial fluid from several animal species, including human. The mAbs were specific for lubricin since they did not cross-react with other synovial fluid constituents from patients with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP), who genetically lack this protein. The competition ELISA detected lubricin in blood samples from healthy individuals but not from patients with CACP, indicating blood can be used in a diagnostic test for patients suspected of having CACP. Lubricin epitopes in blood do not represent degradation fragments from synovial fluid. Therefore, although blood lubricin levels did not differentiate patients with inflammatory joint disease from healthy controls, epitope-specific anti-lubricin mAbs could be useful for monitoring disease activity in synovial fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2007874814,"Sport-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion is a significant health concern to athletes with potential long-term consequences. The diagnosis of sport concussion and return to sport decision making is one of the greatest challenges facing health care clinicians working in sports. Blood biomarkers have recently demonstrated their potential in assisting the detection of brain injury particularly, in those cases with no obvious physical injury. We have recently discovered plasma soluble cellular prion protein (PrPC) as a potential reliable biomarker for blast induced TBI (bTBI) in a rodent animal model. In order to explore the application of this novel TBI biomarker to sport-related concussion, we conducted a pilot study at the University of Saskatchewan (U of S) by recruiting athlete and non-athlete 18 to 30 year-old students. Using a modified quantitative ELISA method, we first established normal values for the plasma soluble PrPC in male and female students. The measured plasma soluble PrPC in confirmed concussion cases demonstrated a significant elevation of this analyte in post-concussion samples. Data collected from our pilot study indicates that the plasma soluble PrPC is a potential biomarker for sport-related concussion, which may be further developed into a clinical diagnostic tool to assist clinicians in the assessment of sport concussion and return-to-play decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2017391774,"It is believed that transferring the C4 engine into C3 crops will greatly increase the yields of major C3 crops. Many efforts have been made since the 1960s, but relatively little success has been achieved because C4plant traits, referred to collectively as C4 syndrome, are very complex, and little is known about the genetic mechanisms involved. Unfortunately, there exists no ideal genetic model system to study C4 syndrome. It was previously reported that the Haloxylon species have different photosynthetic pathways in different photosynthetic organs, cotyledons and assimilating shoots. Here, we took advantage of the developmental switch from the C3 to the C4 pathway to study the genetic mechanisms behind this natural transition. We compared the transcriptomes of cotyledons and assimilating shoots using mRNA-Seq to gain insight into the molecular and cellular events associated with C4 syndrome. A total of 2959 differentially expressed genes [FDR≤0.001 and abs (|log2(Fold change)|≥1)] were identified, revealing that the transcriptomes of cotyledons and assimilating shoots are considerably different. We further identified a set of putative regulators of C4 syndrome. This study expands our understanding of the development of C4 syndrome and provides a new model system for future studies on the C3-to- C4 switch mechanism."

In the low-iodine group, 50 patients received CM containing 270 mg I/mL and were scanned at low tube voltage (100 kVp). In the high-iodine CM group, 50 patients received CM containing 370 mg I/mL and were scanned at the tube voltage (120 kVp). The filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm was used for reconstruction in both groups. In addition, the IR algorithm was used in the low-iodine group. Image quality of the aorta was analyzed subjectively by a 3-point grading scale and objectively by measuring the CT attenuation in terms of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios (SNR and CNR, respectively). Radiation and CM doses were compared.The CT attenuation, subjective image quality assessment, SNR, and CNR of various aortic regions of interest did not differ significantly between two groups. In the low-iodine group, images reconstructed by FBP and IR demonstrated significant differences in image noise, SNR, and CNR (p<0.05). The low-iodine group resulted in 34.3% less radiation (4.4 ± 0.5 mSv) than the high-iodine group (6.7 ± 0.6 mSv), and 27.3% less iodine weight (20.36 ± 2.65 g) than the high-iodine group (28 ± 1.98 g). Observers exhibited excellent agreement on the aortic image quality scores (κ = 0.904).CT images of aorta could be obtained within 2 s by using a DSCT Flash protocol with low tube voltage, IR, and low-iodine-concentration CM. Appropriate contrast enhancement was achieved while maintaining good image quality and decreasing the radiation and iodine doses."

Nasopharyngeal carriage studies provide insight into the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes. There are very few data on the concurrent carriage of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and serotype distribution of pneumococci carried in the nasopharynx of young healthy Nepalese children prior to the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine using a microarray-based molecular serotyping method capable of detecting multi-serotype carriage. We conducted a cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 6 weeks to 24 months from the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal between May and October 2012. Nasopharyngeal swabs were frozen and subsequently plated on selective culture media. DNA extracts of plate sweeps of pneumococcal colonies from these cultures were analysed using a molecular serotyping microarray capable of detecting relative abundance of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. 600 children were enrolled into the study: 199 aged 6 weeks to <6 months, 202 aged 6 months to < 12 months, and 199 aged 12 month to 24 months. Typeable pneumococci were identified in 297/600 (49·5%) of samples with more than one serotype being found in 67/297 (20·2%) of these samples. The serotypes covered by the thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were identified in 44·4% of samples containing typeable pneumococci. Application of a molecular serotyping approach to identification of multiple pneumococcal carriage demonstrates a substantial prevalence of co-colonisation.

We aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in the serum of HCC patients with different Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and to investigate the potential of serum miRNAs as biomarkers for patient outcomes. In the discovery stage, TaqMan Low-Density Array was used to test the difference in levels of serum miRNAs between 20 patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and 20 patients without PVTT. The detected serum miRNAs then were validated in 182 patients. Fifteen serum miRNAs showed more than two-fold higher expression in patients with PVTT, and miR-128-2 was found to be significantly up-regulated and was selected for further validation. In the validation stage, patients were divided into two groups with low or high serum miR-128-2 using the median expression level of all 182 cases as the cut-off point. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with low level of serum miR-128-2 had favorable trends of survival (log rank = 13.031, p < 0.001). The median survivals for patients with a low and high level of serum miR-128-2 were 625 (95% CI, 527–722) days and 426 (95% CI, 362–491) days, respectively. MiR-128-2 was also an independent factor of overall survival (p = 0.001, HR 2.793, 95%CI 1.550, 5.033). Serum levels of the ubiquitously expressed miR-128-2 showed no significant correlation with parameters of liver damage or liver function. In addition, expressions of miR-128-2 in HCC tissues were up-regulated in comparison with adjacent non-tumor tissues. In conclusion, serum level of miR-128-2 serves as a noninvasive biomarker for the overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2070453195,"The diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma is complicated by its mechanistically distinct subtypes (endotypes) driven by genetic susceptibility and modulating environmental factors. Clinical biomarkers and blood gene expression were collected from a stratified, cross-sectional study of asthmatic and non-asthmatic children from Detroit, MI. This study describes four distinct asthma endotypes identified via a purely data-driven method. Our method was specifically designed to integrate blood gene expression and clinical biomarkers in a way that provides new mechanistic insights regarding the different asthma endotypes. For example, we describe metabolic syndrome-induced systemic inflammation as an associated factor in three of the four asthma endotypes. Context provided by the clinical biomarker data was essential in interpreting gene expression patterns and identifying putative endotypes, which emphasizes the importance of integrated approaches when studying complex disease etiologies. These synthesized patterns of gene expression and clinical markers from our research may lead to development of novel serum-based biomarker panels."
https://openalex.org/W2033893958,"Vaccination with DNA is an attractive strategy for induction of pathogen-specific T cells and antibodies. Studies in humans have shown that DNA vaccines are safe, but their immunogenicity needs further improvement. As a step towards this goal, we have previously demonstrated that immunogenicity is increased with the use of an alphavirus DNA-launched replicon (DREP) vector compared to conventional DNA vaccines. In this study, we investigated the effect of varying the dose and number of administrations of DREP when given as a prime prior to a heterologous boost with poxvirus vector (MVA) and/or HIV gp140 protein formulated in glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA-AF) adjuvant. The DREP and MVA vaccine constructs encoded Env and a Gag-Pol-Nef fusion protein from HIV clade C. One to three administrations of 0.2 μg DREP induced lower HIV-specific T cell and IgG responses than the equivalent number of immunizations with 10 μg DREP. However, the two doses were equally efficient as a priming component in a heterologous prime-boost regimen. The magnitude of immune responses depended on the number of priming immunizations rather than the dose. A single low dose of DREP prior to a heterologous boost resulted in greatly increased immune responses compared to MVA or protein antigen alone, demonstrating that a mere 0.2 μg DREP was sufficient for priming immune responses. Following a DREP prime, T cell responses were expanded greatly by an MVA boost, and IgG responses were also expanded when boosted with protein antigen. When MVA and protein were administered simultaneously following multiple DREP primes, responses were slightly compromised compared to administering them sequentially. In conclusion, we have demonstrated efficient priming of HIV-specific T cell and IgG responses with a low dose of DREP, and shown that the priming effect depends on number of primes administered rather than dose."
https://openalex.org/W2083227017,"Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive brain tumors. We have previously found up-regulation of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in glioblastoma cells treated with the anticancer agent fenofibrate. Sequence analysis of GDF15 revealed the presence of a microRNA, miR-3189, in the single intron. We then asked whether miR-3189 was expressed in clinical samples and whether it was functional in glioblastoma cells. We found that expression of miR-3189-3p was down-regulated in astrocytoma and glioblastoma clinical samples compared with control brain tissue. In vitro, the functionality of miR-3189-3p was tested by RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, and miR-3189-3p coimmunoprecipitated with Argonaute 2 together with two of its major predicted gene targets, the SF3B2 splicing factor and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF. Overexpression of miR-3189-3p resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and migration through direct targeting of SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF, respectively. Interestingly, miR-3189-3p levels were increased by treatment of glioblastoma cells with fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering drug with multiple anticancer activities. The attenuated expression of miR-3189-3p in clinical samples paralleled the elevated expression of SF3B2, which could contribute to the activation of SF3B2 growth-promoting pathways in these tumors.

Because novel therapeutic treatments for glioblastoma are needed desperately, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms supporting growth and survival of this highly malignant and practically incurable brain tumor. MicroRNAs are short single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by incomplete base pairing with mRNAs. Alterations in microRNA expression have been associated with a variety of pathologies, including cancer. In addition to their effect on carcinogenesis, microRNAs have been investigated for their potential values in diagnosis, prognosis, and cancer therapy. In this study, we found miR-3189-3p down-regulated in astrocytoma and glioblastoma clinical samples in comparison with unaffected brain tissue. Genomic sequence analysis revealed that the miR-3189 stem loop is located in the intron of the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) gene. Interestingly, we have previously reported increased expression of GDF15 in the LN-229 glioblastoma cell line following the treatment with fenofibrate (4.Jeansonne D. Pacifici M. Lassak A. Reiss K.

The precursor sequence encoded by miR-3189 contains two mature microRNA sequences within the stem loop: miR-3189-3p and miR-3189-5p, 21 and 25 nucleotides in length, respectively. The biological function of these microRNAs has never been described. Here we show that ectopic expression of miR-3189-3p inhibited glioblastoma cell growth and migration through down-regulation of SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF, respectively. In comparison with normal brain tissue, we also found that astrocytoma and glioblastoma clinical samples have increased levels of GDF15 and decreased levels of miR-3189-3p and that these changes correlated with increased expression of SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF. Finally, the subcutaneous and intracranial growth of glioblastoma cells expressing miR-3189-3p was reduced significantly when compared with the parental control cells, further supporting the role of this microRNA as a tumor suppressor. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation immunoprecipitation fenofibrate guanine nucleotide exchange factor. LN-229 and U87MG cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured under standard growth conditions. Fenofibrate was from Sigma and was used in all experiments at a concentration of 50 μm. The miR-3189-3p mirVana miRNA mimic and miR-3189-3p mirVana miRNA inhibitor (anti-miR-3189-3p) were purchased from Life Technologies. For transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish or 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF siRNAs and controls were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at a final concentration of 10 nm. Human PPARα siRNA was the ON-TARGET Plus SMARTpool from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and it was used at a final concentration of 100 nm. The PPARα inhibitor GW 9662 was from Cayman Chemical (St. Louis, MO).

For the clinical samples, relative quantification was represented as 1/ΔCt to maintain real differences in Ct values between samples. Cells were collected by gently scraping in the presence of PBS (Gibco, Life Technologies) followed by centrifugation and disruption of the cell pellet in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.4), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (NA3VO4), and phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Whole-cell lysates (30–70 μg) were separated on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). GDF15 and E2F-1 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibody to detect p63RhoGEF was obtained from GeneTex (Irvine, CA). The GDF15 antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and anti-GRB2 was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). SF3B2 and 14-3-3ζ antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mature GDF15 was detected in the cell culture medium using the GDF15 Quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Sample absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus microplate reader. RIP assay was performed using Argonaute 2 (Ago2) antibody from Millipore (RIPAb+Ago2 RIP). This kit includes a negative control mouse IgG antibody and control primers specific for human FOS, which were utilized for the optimization of Ago2-IP in our cellular model. The RIP Ago-IP was performed essentially as described previously (17.Curtale G. Mirolo M. Renzi T.A. Rossato M. Bazzoni F. Locati M. Negative regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling by IL-10-dependent microRNA-146b.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 11499-11504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 × 106 LN-229 cells were used for Ago2-IP and for the IgG isotype control. 2 × 106 cells were used for the extraction of total RNA and for total protein lysates. The cell monolayer was washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm DTT) supplemented with 10 mm protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm PMSF, 10 mm phosphatase inhibitor, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 100 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Applied Biosystems). After 30 min of incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. 30 μl of protein A/G magnetic beads (Pierce, Thermo Scientific) were washed three times with blocking solution (0.5% BSA dissolved in Dulbecco's PBS+/+) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-Ago2 mouse monoclonal IgG1κ or with isotype IgG1κ control antibodies (Millipore). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with blocking solution. Immunoprecipitations with specific lysates were carried out overnight at 4 °C. Next day, the immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer supplemented with the inhibitors. Leftover IP samples before the first wash were collected to determine the efficiency of Ago2 depletion from the cellular lysate. After the last wash, immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer, of which 20 μl was used for the RNA extraction and 20 μl for Western blot analysis. RNA extraction from the beads and from the leftover samples was followed by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR, which were performed as described above. Total RNA was isolated from LN-229 cells and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit containing random hexamers. The cDNA sequence corresponding to the ORF of p63RhoGEF was PCR-amplified. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-GGTGGAATTCTGCAGATATGCGGGGGGGGCACAAA; reverse, 5′-CCACTGTGCTGGATTTACAGCTCATCTTCATCCAGCTTGG. Sequences compatible with pcDNA3.1(+) are underlined. Next, the pcDNA3.1(+) vector was digested with EcoRV. This vector and the PCR product (above) were digested with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to generate single-stranded 3′ overhangs compatible between the two DNA molecules. These products were annealed by incubation at incremental reducing temperatures from 95 °C to 45 °C using a PCR cycler (Bio-Rad). The ORF sequence corresponding to the SF3B2 gene was also cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector using the approach described above. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-GGTGGAATTCTGCAGATATGGCGACGGAGCATCCC; reverse, 5′-CCACTGTGCTGGATCTAAAACTTGAACTCCTTATATTTCTTGCTGCC. Sequences compatible with pcDNA3.1(+) are underlined. The genomic sequence corresponding to the 3′UTR of p63RhoGEF was PCR-amplified from LN-229 cells. This PCR product was ligated into multiple cloning sites downstream of the Renilla luciferase reporter gene in the psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). This vector also contains a firefly luciferase reporter sequence that allows for normalization of transfection efficiency. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGTGAAAACCATGGGGGTG containing the XhoI restriction site; reverse, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGCAGCCTCGGTGATATAACAAAACC containing the NotI restriction site. The genomic sequence corresponding to the 3′UTR of SF3B2 was also cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCAA GTTTTAGGTCCCCTCAC containing the XhoI restriction site; reverse, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGGAGGCTCAGGAGTGTTAAATATTCATCTC containing the NotI restriction site. The XhoI and NotI restriction sites are underlined. Mutations of the miR-3189-3p putative binding sites in the p63RhoGEF and SF3B2 3′UTR sequences were generated using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using the respective psiCHECK2/3′UTR plasmids as a template. The oligonucleotides for the mutagenesis of p63RhoGEF sites were as follows: site 1 forward, 5′-TCAGCCGCCTATTCCCCTTCCAG CTTCAGGGCAGTCCT; site 2 forward, 5′-TGGAGGAGAACACCTAGACCCTTCCACTTTTTTCTGCCCAAGGAAC; and site 3 forward, 5′-CCCAAGGACTTTTTTCTGCCCTTCCAACACAGTTTCCTTCAGCTCC. The oligonucleotides for the mutagenesis of SF3B2 sites were as follows: site 1 forward, 5′-GAACCACCTCTCCCGCAGTTCC CTTCCACTTGTCATTTCATGTTCTTATT; and site 2 forward, 5′-GACCTGTTTTGTAAATAAA GCTGTTTCCCTTCCAAAGAGATGAATATTTAACACT CCTGAGC. Mutated bases in the miR-3189-3p binding sites are underlined. The reverse oligonucleotide primers were complementary to the forward primers. LN-229 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well plate and transfected with psiCHECK-2 vector expressing the target 3′UTR (160 ng/well) alone, the target 3′UTR with the miR-3189-3p mimic (30 nm), or the target 3′UTR with the miRNA mimic and anti-miR-3189-3p using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, cells were harvested, and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Relative units of Renilla luciferase activity were normalized to the firefly luciferase internal control in each sample. Experiments were performed in duplicate. LN-229 or U87MG cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well plate and transfected with mock or miR-3189-3p mimic ± anti-miR-3189-3p. 72 h after transfection, cells were incubated with medium containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) reagent (Promega) diluted according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min, and absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus microplate reader. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Cells were then centrifuged at 300 × g, resuspended in 150 μl of Guava cell cycle reagent (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA), and stained for 45 min at 25 °C while protected from light. Cells were counted by flow cytometry using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) in the Comprehensive Alcohol Research Center Analytical Core Laboratory at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated using the ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). LN-229 or U87MG cells were transfected with miR-3189-3p and plated in a 35 mm glass bottom dish (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) at a density of 1.8 × 105 cells/dish. The scratch assay was performed by moving a pipette tip across the cell monolayer. Migration into the cell-free area was monitored for up to 24 h using live cell time-lapse imaging (VivaView FL incubator fluorescent microscope, Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Female Fox1nu athymic nude mice at 6–8 weeks of age (Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were injected subcutaneously with 2 × 106 LN-229 glioblastoma cells stably expressing the mCherry fluorescent protein and mock-transfected, or transfected with miR-3189-3p mimic. All experiments were performed in accordance with institutional ethical guidelines. Intracranial implantation of mice was performed as described previously (6.Wilk A. Wyczechowska D. Zapata A.

Briefly, female nude-Foxn1nu athymic mice 6–8 weeks of age (Harlan Laboratories) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and secured in a stereotaxic head frame (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The tumor cells (3 × 104 in 2 μl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid) were injected into the left striatum through a burr hole in the skull using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe. In vivo growth of LN-229/mCherry and U87MG/luciferase tumors was monitored by biophotonic imaging using a Xenogen IVIS 200 system (Xenogen, Palo Alto, CA). Prior to imaging, mice bearing U87MG/luciferase tumors received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 μl of d-luciferin (30 mg/ml solution) and were anesthetized by 3% isoflurane inhalation. Anesthesia was sustained at 1.5% isoflurane inside the imaging chamber using nose cones. Images were captured and quantified with Xenogen Living Image 4.1 software on the basis of equivalent regions of interest over the lower dorsal flank or cranium of the mouse. Image intensities were expressed as photon flux per second per square centimeter and steradian. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Comparison between two experimental groups was performed using Student's t test. One way ANOVA was used to compare three or more groups. p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from astrocytomas, glioblastomas, and normal brains were utilized for total RNA isolation and were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR. Fig. 1A shows significantly less miR-3189-3p levels in astrocytoma and glioblastoma tissue samples compared with controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), with a trend of down-regulation that correlated with the tumor progression. We next evaluated the function of miR-3189-3p in cell growth and migration of the human glioblastoma cell lines LN-229 and U87MG. 48 h post-transfection morphology of miR-3189-3p-expressing cells was visibly altered, presenting a more polygonal shape compared with the typical spindle-shaped cells under normal growth conditions or when both miR-3189-3p and anti-miR-3189-3p were coexpressed (Fig. 1B). In addition, the expression of miR-3189-3p resulted in a 50% reduction in cell proliferation (percent decrease in cell number over control, Fig. 1C) accompanied by a significant, 40% reduction in S phase, as determined by cell cycle distribution analysis (Fig. 1, D and E). No significant changes were observed when miR-3189-3p was cotransfected with anti-miR-3189-3p, and the cells expressing this inhibitor behaved essentially as the control, mock-transfected cells. Similarly, transfection with miR-3189–5p did not elicit changes in cell morphology, nor did it inhibit cell proliferation and migration (data not shown). To minimize possible off-target effects, we repeated this set of experiments using another commercially available miR-3189-3p mimic (mission miRNA mimic, Sigma) and obtained the same results (data not shown). Because glioblastoma cells are characterized by high migratory potentials, we evaluated the possible effects of this microRNA on cell migration using a scratch assay and by monitoring both cell locomotion and cell division using time-lapse imaging. Fig. 1F shows representative images for LN-229 cells. Although control cells populated the entire scratched area in 18 h, LN-229 cells transfected with miR-3189-3p covered only 42% of the scratched surface (Fig. 1F) in the same time. Although with decreased efficiency compared with LN-229 cells, miR-3189-3p expression also inhibited U87MG cell migration, and, after 18 h of transfection, cells covered only 62% of the available surface. Note that both decreased cell motility and decreased cell proliferation contributed to delayed invasion of the cell-free space. According to microRNA gene target predictions, the splicing factor SF3B2 and the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 25, ARHGEF25 (also known as p63RhoGEF) are the top targets of miR-3189-3p and were chosen for validation studies. The direct contribution of miR-3189-3p to SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF mRNA and protein levels was evaluated in miR-3189-3p-transfected LN-229 and U87MG cells by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. In comparison with controls, nearly 5-fold and 2.5-fold lower levels of SF3B2 mRNA and p63RhoGEF mRNA were detected in miR-3189-3p-expressing cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). Importantly, we were able to counteract down-regulation of these two transcripts by overexpressing the anti-miR-3189-3p (miR-3189-3p inhibitor), further supporting the presence of miR-3189-3p-specific regulation. A remarkable down-regulation of SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF at the translational level was confirmed by Western blots in cells transfected with miR-3189-3p compared with control or cells cotransfected with the anti-miR-3189-3p (Fig. 2B). Notably, the down-regulation of SF3B2 and p63RhoGEF was more pronounced in LN-229 cells, and this cell line was selected for the next experiments. There are two putative binding sites for miR-3189-3p in the 3′UTR sequence of SF3B2 mRNA, one conserved (MS2) and one non-conserved (MS1) (Fig. 2C), and their expression was tested by a luciferase-based reporter assay (Fig. 2D). A reduction of ∼75% of luminescence was observed in cells expressing miR-3189-3p, and, again, this inhibition was almost completely alleviated in the presence of anti-miR-3189-3p. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of the microRNA binding sequences in the 3′UTR showed a slightly different, although cumulative, inhibitory activity. The conserved microRNA binding site (MS2) appeared to be slightly more effective in microRNA-induced transcript degradation because mutation of this site significantly reversed a decrease in luciferase signal (compare MS1 and MS2). As expected, mutation of both microRNA binding sequences (double mutation) abrogated inhibition by miR-3189-3p. The p63RhoGEF 3′UTR contains three putative binding sites for miR-3189-3p, one conserved and two non-conserved (Fig. 2E). Similarly to SF3B2 3′UTR, we tested the p63RhoGEF 3′UTR (Fig. 2F). Here the inhibition was also reversed efficiently, either in the presence of anti-miR-3189-3p or by mutating the three binding sequences (triple mutation) of the p63RhoGEF 3′UTR. Quantitatively, one of the non-conserved binding sites did not appear to be required for miR-3189-3p-induced gene regulation because mutation of this site (MS1) failed to revert the expected inhibition. Conversely, mutation of the other two microRNA binding sites (MS2 and MS3), one conserved and one non-conserved, showed a stronger and cumulative reversal of inhibition by miR-3189-3p (Fig. 2F). Because SF3B2 expression is strongly down-regulated by miR-3189-3p, we hypothesized that forced expression of SF3B2 might reverse the microRNA-mediated effects on cell proliferation. The results from the growth rate analysis in Fig. 3A confirm this assumption. Moreover, we measured that constitutive expression of SF3B2 was enough to rescue cell growth to steady-state levels despite the addition of miR-3189-3p. Conversely, down-regulation of SF3B2 by siRNA mimics the biological effects of miR-3189-3p expression by inducing a 55% reduction in cell growth (Fig. 3B). When tested on a migration assay, cells in which SF3B2 was silenced behaved essentially as the control cells,"
https://openalex.org/W2066404455,"Objective This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) to treat muscle spasticity after brain injury (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-11001310). Methods A total of 60 patients with muscle spasticity after brain injury were randomized to the following 3 groups: 100, 2, and 0 Hz (sham) TEAS. The acupoints Hegu (LI4)—Yuji (LU10) and Zusanli (ST36)—Chengshan (BL57) on the injured side were stimulated at 0, 2, or 100 Hz, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. The patients were followed up for 1 and 2 months after the treatments. The effects of the treatments on muscle spasticity at the wrist, thumb, the other 4 fingers, elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle were evaluated by the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the effects on disability were assessed by the Disability Assessment Scale. The walking capability was evaluated by the Holden functional ambulation classification score. The overall performance was assessed by the Global Assessment Scale score and the improved Barthel Index. The safety of the treatments administered was also monitored. Results The wrist spasticity was significantly reduced from baseline at weeks 2, 3, and 4 of treatment and at the 1- and 2-month follow-up visits in the 100 Hz group (P < 0.01). Compared with 2 Hz or sham TEAS, 100 Hz TEAS decreased wrist spasticity at weeks 2, 3, and 4 of treatment and 1 month after treatment (P < 0.001). The other endpoints were not affected by the treatments. No treatment-emergent adverse events were reported during treatments and follow-up visits. Conclusions TEAS appears to be a safe and effective therapy to relieve muscle spasticity after brain injury, although large-scale studies are required to further verify the findings.

https://openalex.org/W2055520874,"The p53 protein is a master regulator of the stress response. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, with roles in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and metabolism. The discovery of at least 12 isoforms of p53, some of which have tumor-promoting properties, has opened new avenues of research. Our previous work studied tumor phenotypes in four mouse models with different p53 backgrounds: wild-type p53, p53 null, mutant p53 lacking the proline domain (mΔpro), and a mimic for the human Δ133p53α p53 isoform (Δ122p53). To identify the major proteins affected by p53 function early in the response to DNA damage, the current study investigated the entire proteome of bone marrow, thymus, and lung in the four p53 models. Protein extracts from untreated controls and those treated with amsacrine were analyzed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. In the bone marrow, reactive proteins were universally decreased by wild-type p53, including α-enolase. Further analysis of α-enolase in the p53 models revealed that it was instead increased in Δ122p53 hematopoietic and tumor cell cytosol and on the cell surface. Alpha-enolase on the surface of Δ122p53 cells acted as a plasminogen receptor, with tumor necrosis factor alpha induced upon plasminogen stimulation. Taken together, these data identified new proteins associated with p53 function. One of these proteins, α-enolase, is regulated differently by wild-type p53 and Δ122p53 cells, with reduced abundance as part of a wild-type p53 response and increased abundance with Δ122p53 function. Increased cell surface α-enolase on Δ122p53 cells provides a possible explanation for the model's pro-inflammatory features and suggests that p53 isoforms may direct an inflammatory response by increasing the amount of α-enolase on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2135144484,"Microbial community profiling identifies and quantifies organisms in metagenomic sequencing data using either reference based or unsupervised approaches. However, current reference based profiling methods only report the presence and abundance of single reference genomes that are available in databases. Since only a small fraction of environmental genomes is represented in genomic databases, these approaches entail the risk of false identifications and often suggest a higher precision than justified by the data. Therefore, we developed MicrobeGPS, a novel metagenomic profiling approach that overcomes these limitations. MicrobeGPS is the first method that identifies microbiota in the sample and estimates their genomic distances to known reference genomes. With this strategy, MicrobeGPS identifies organisms down to the strain level and highlights possibly inaccurate identifications when the correct reference genome is missing. We demonstrate on three metagenomic datasets with different origin that our approach successfully avoids misleading interpretation of results and additionally provides more accurate results than current profiling methods. Our results indicate that MicrobeGPS can enable reference based taxonomic profiling of complex and less characterized microbial communities. MicrobeGPS is open source and available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/microbegps/ as source code and binary distribution for Windows and Linux operating systems."

https://openalex.org/W2020945671,"Purpose Retinal venous pulsation detection is a subjective sign, which varies in elevated intracranial pressure, venous obstruction and glaucoma. To date no method can objectively measure and identify pulsating regions. Method Using high resolution video-recordings of the optic disk and retina we measured fluctuating light absorption by haemoglobin during pulsation. Pulsation amplitude was calculated from all regions of the retinal image video-frames in a raster pattern. Segmented retinal images were formed by objectively selecting regions with amplitudes above a range of threshold values. These were compared to two observers manually drawing an outline of the pulsating areas while viewing video-clips in order to generate receiver operator characteristics. Results 216,515 image segments were analysed from 26 eyes in 18 research participants. Using data from each eye, the median area under the receiver operator curve (AU-ROC) was 0.95. With all data analysed together the AU-ROC was 0.89. We defined the ideal threshold amplitude for detection of any pulsating segment being that with maximal sensitivity and specificity. This was 5 units (95% confidence interval 4.3 to 6.0) compared to 12 units before any regions were missed. A multivariate model demonstrated that ideal threshold amplitude increased with increased variation in video-sequence illumination (p = 0.0119), but between the two observers (p = 0.0919) or other variables. Conclusion This technique demonstrates accurate identification of retinal vessel pulsating regions with no areas identified manually being missed with the objective technique. The amplitude values are derived objectively and may be a significant advance upon subjective ophthalmodynamometric threshold techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1969148341,"Background Knowledge of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV), in particular the role of immunity, is crucial in estimating the (cost-) effectiveness of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening strategies, because naturally acquired immunity after clearing an infection may already protect part of the risk population against new HPV infections. Methods We used STDSIM, an established stochastic microsimulation model, quantified to the Netherlands. We explored different assumptions regarding the natural history of HPV-16 and HPV-18, and estimated the transmission probabilities and durations of acquired immunity necessary to reproduce age-specific prevalence. Results A model without acquired immunity cannot reproduce the age-specific patterns of HPV. Also, it is necessary to assume a high degree of individual variation in the duration of infection and acquired immunity. According to the model estimates, on average 20% of women are immune for HPV-16 and 15% for HPV-18. After an HPV-16 infection, 50% are immune for less than 1 year, whereas 20% exceed 30 years. For HPV-18, up to 12% of the individuals are immune for less than 1 year, and about 50% over 30 years. Almost half of all women will never acquire HPV-16 or HPV-18. Conclusions Acquired immunity likely plays a major role in HPV epidemiology, but its duration shows substantial variation. Combined with the lifetime risk, this explains to a large extent why many women will never develop cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021195285,"Nardostahyos Radix et Rhizoma (NRR; the root and rhizome of Nardostachys jatamansi DC.) is a widely used medicinal herb. Historically, NRR is being used for the treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. To search for active ingredients of NRR, we investigated the vascular benefit of NRR volatile oil in (i) the vasodilation in rat aorta ring, and (ii) the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). By measuring the fluorescence signal in cultures, application of NRR volatile oil resulted in a rapid activation of NO release as well as the phosphorylation of eNOS: both inductions were markedly reduced by L-NAME. In parallel, the phosphorylation level of Akt kinase was markedly increased by the oil treatment, which was partially attenuated by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. This inhibitor also blocked the NRR-induced NO production and eNOS phosphorylation. In HUVECs, application of NRR volatile oil elevated the intracellular Ca(2+) level, and BAPTA-AM, a Ca(2+) chelator, reduced the Ca(2+) surge: the blockage were also applied to NRR-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. These findings suggested the volatile oil of NRR was the major ingredient in triggering the vascular dilatation, and which was mediated via the NO production."
https://openalex.org/W2042792326,"Introduction Successful graft ingrowth following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is governed by complex biological processes at the tendon-bone interface. The aim of this study was to investigate in an in vitro study the effects of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) on tendon-bone integration. Materials and Methods To study the biological effects of BMP-7 on the process of tendon-bone-integration, two independent in vitro models were used. The first model involved the mono- and coculture of bovine tendon specimens and primary bovine osteoblasts with and without BMP-7 exposure. The second model comprised the mono- and coculture of primary bovine osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactate and osteocalcin (OCN) were analyzed by ELISA. Histological analysis and electron microscopy of the tendon specimens were performed. Results In both models, positive effects of BMP-7 on ALP enzyme activity were observed (p<0.001). Additionally, similar results were noted for LDH activity and lactate concentration. BMP-7 stimulation led to a significant increase in OCN expression. Whereas the effects of BMP-7 on tendon monoculture peaked during an early phase of the experiment (p<0.001), the cocultures showed a maximal increase during the later stages (p<0.001). The histological analysis showed a stimulating effect of BMP-7 on extracellular matrix formation. Organized ossification zones and calcium carbonate-like structures were only observed in the BMP-stimulated cell cultures. Discussion This study showed the positive effects of BMP-7 on the biological process of tendon-bone integration in vitro. Histological signs of improved mineralization were paralleled by increased rates of osteoblast-specific protein levels in primary bovine osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Conclusion Our findings indicated a role for BMP-7 as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in the treatment of ligamentous injuries, and they emphasized the importance of the transdifferentiation process of tendinous fibroblasts at the tendon-bone interface."
https://openalex.org/W2004217847,"The intracellular pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, relies on numerous secreted effector proteins to manipulate host endomembrane trafficking events during pathogenesis, thereby preventing fusion of the bacteria-laden phagosome with host endolysosomal compartments, and thus escaping degradation. Upon expression in the surrogate eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that the L. pneumophila LegC7/YlfA effector protein disrupts the delivery of both biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the yeast vacuole. We demonstrate that the effects of LegC7 are specific to the endosome:vacuole delivery pathways; LegC7 expression does not disrupt other known vacuole-directed pathways. Deletions of the ESCRT-0 complex member, VPS27, provide resistance to the LegC7 toxicity, providing a possible target for LegC7 function in vivo. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in LegC7 abrogates both its toxicity and ability to alter endosomal traffic in vivo, thereby identifying a critical functional domain. LegC7 likely inhibits endosomal trafficking during L. pneumophila pathogenesis to prevent entry of the phagosome into the endosomal maturation pathway and eventual fusion with the lysosome."
https://openalex.org/W2143714546,"Gastric slow waves (GSW) are known to regulate gastric motility and are impaired with rectal distention (RD). Electroacupuncture (EA) at body acupoints, such as ST 36, has been shown to improve gastric dysrhythmias; however, little is known about the possible effects of auricular electroacupuncture (AEA) on GSW. To study effects and possible mechanisms of AEA on RD-induced gastric dysrhythmias in rats, ten male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats implanted with gastric serosal electrodes were studied in two different experiments in fed state. Four sessions were performed in experiment 1 as follows: control (RD, no stimulation), RD+AEA, RD+EA at body points and RD+sham AEA. Two sessions were included in experiment 2 to study mechanisms of AEA: RD + atropine and RD + atropine + AEA. It was found that 1) RD significantly decreased the percentage of normal GSW from 89.8±3.5% to 76.0±3.3% (P<0.05); 2) AEA increased the percentage of normal GSW during RD to 94.0±2.1% (P<0.05 vs. RD) via a reduction in the percentages of tachygastria and arrhythmia (P<0.05 vs. RD); 3) atropine blocked the ameliorating effect of AEA on RD-induced gastric dysrhythmias. Our results demonstrated that RD induces gastric dysrhythmias in fed state in rats. AEA improves RD-induced gastric dysrhythmias via the vagal pathway. AEA may have a therapeutic potential in treating gastric dysrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2039363719,"Objectives The analysis of categorization of everyday sounds is a crucial aspect of the perception of our surrounding world. However, it constitutes a poorly explored domain in developmental studies. The aim of our study was to understand the nature and the logic of the construction of auditory cognitive categories for natural sounds during development. We have developed an original approach based on a free sorting task (FST). Indeed, categorization is fundamental for structuring the world and cognitive skills related to, without having any need of the use of language. Our project explored the ability of children to structure their acoustic world, and to investigate how such structuration matures during normal development. We hypothesized that age affects the listening strategy and the category decision, as well as the number and the content of individual categories. Design Eighty-two French children (6–9 years), 20 teenagers (12–13 years), and 24 young adults participated in the study. Perception and categorization of everyday sounds was assessed based on a FST composed of 18 different sounds belonging to three a priori categories: non-linguistic human vocalizations, environmental sounds, and musical instruments. Results Children listened to the sounds more times than older participants, built significantly more classes than adults, and used a different strategy of classification. We can thus conclude that there is an age effect on how the participants accomplished the task. Analysis of the auditory categorization performed by 6-year-old children showed that this age constitutes a pivotal stage, in agreement with the progressive change from a non-logical reasoning based mainly on perceptive representations to the logical reasoning used by older children. In conclusion, our results suggest that the processing of auditory object categorization develops through different stages, while the intrinsic basis of the classification of sounds is already present in childhood."

By using this idea, we proposed three generalized prisoner’s dilemma (GPD, for short) games based on the weak Prisoner’s dilemma game, the full prisoner’s dilemma game and the normalized Prisoner’s dilemma game, written by GPDW, GPDF and GPDN respectively. Our games consist of two players, each of which has three strategies: cooperator (C), defector (D) and super cooperator (denoted by Q), and have a parameter γ to measure the entangled relationship between the two players. We found that our generalised prisoner’s dilemma games have new Nash equilibrium principles, that entanglement is the principle of emergence and convergence (i.e., guaranteed emergence) of super cooperation in evolutions of our generalised prisoner’s dilemma games on scale-free networks, that entanglement provides a threshold for a phase transition of super cooperation in evolutions of our generalised prisoner’s dilemma games on scale-free networks, that the role of heterogeneity of the scale-free networks in cooperations and super cooperations is very limited, and that well-defined structures of scale-free networks allow coexistence of cooperators and super cooperators in the evolutions of the weak version of our generalised prisoner’s dilemma games."
https://openalex.org/W1964846145,"Objectives Units deployed to armed conflicts are at high risk for exposure to combat events. Many battle casualties (BCs) have been reported in the recent deployment to Afghanistan. The long-term impact of these combat injuries, at their five-year end point, is currently unknown. To date, no systematic inventory has been performed of an identified group of BCs in comparison to non-injured service members from the same operational theatre. Design Observational cross-sectional cohort study. Setting Open online survey among Dutch BCs that deployed to Afghanistan (2006–2010). Participants The Dutch BCs (n = 62) were compared to two control groups of non-injured combat groups (battle exposed [n = 53], and non-battle exposed [n = 73]). Main Outcome Measures Participants rated their impact of trauma exposure (Impact of Events [IES]), post deployment reintegration (Post Deployment Reintegration Scale [PDRS]), general symptoms of distress (Symptom Checklist 90 [SCL-90]), as well as their current perceived quality of life (EuroQol-6D [EQ-6D]). Also cost effectiveness (Short From health survey [SF-36]) and care consumption were assessed (Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire). Results Over 90% of BCs were still in active duty. The mean scores of all questionnaires (IES, EQ-6D, SF-36, and SCL-90) of the BC group were significantly higher than in the control groups (p<0.05). The PDRS showed a significantly lower (p<0.05) outcome in the negative subscales. The mean consumption of care was triple that of both control groups. A lower score on quality of life was related to higher levels of distress and impact of trauma exposure. Conclusions This study showed a clear long-term impact on a wide range of scales that contributes to a reduced quality of life in a group of BCs. Low perceived cost effectiveness matched with high consumption of care in the BC group in comparison to the control groups. These results warrant continuous monitoring of BCs."
https://openalex.org/W2021963178,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by dysregulated and chronic systemic inflammatory responses that affect the synovium, bone, and cartilage causing damage to extra-articular tissue. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and assists in the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), which include neutrophils, are the largest population of white blood cells in peripheral blood and functionally produce their inflammatory effect through phagocytosis, cytokine production and natural killer-like cytotoxic activity. TREM1 (triggering receptor expressed by myeloid cells) is an inflammatory receptor in PMNs that signals through the use of the intracellular activating adaptor DAP12 to induce downstream signaling. After TREM crosslinking, DAP12's tyrosines in its ITAM motif get phosphorylated inducing the recruitment of Syk tyrosine kinases and eventual activation of PI3 kinases and ERK signaling pathways. While both TREM1 and DAP12 have been shown to be important activators of RA pathogenesis, their activity in PMNs or the importance of DAP12 as a possible therapeutic target have not been shown. Here we corroborate, using primary RA specimens, that isolated PMNs have an increased proportion of both TREM1 and DAP12 compared to normal healthy control isolated PMNs both at the protein and gene expression levels. This increased expression is highly functional with increased activation of ERK and MAPKs, secretion of IL-8 and RANTES and cytotoxicity of target cells. Importantly, based on our hypothesis of an imbalance of activating and inhibitory signaling in the pathogenesis of RA we demonstrate that inhibition of the DAP12 signaling pathway inactivates these important inflammatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2125548413,"Ancient chlamydiae diverged into pathogenic and environmental chlamydiae 0.7-1.4 billion years ago. However, how pathogenic chlamydiae adapted to mammalian cells that provide a stable niche at approximately 37 °C, remains unknown, although environmental chlamydiae have evolved as endosymbionts of lower eukaryotes in harsh niches of relatively low temperatures. Hence, we assessed whether an environmental chlamydia, Parachlamydia Bn9, could grow in human HEp-2 cells at a low culture temperature of 30 °C. The assessment of inclusion formation by quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the numbers of bacterial inclusion bodies and the transcription level of 16SrRNA significantly increased after culture at 30 °C compared to at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy showed that the bacteria were located close to HEp-2 nuclei and were actively replicative. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed replicating bacteria consisting of reticular bodies, but with a few elementary bodies. Cytochalasin D and rifampicin inhibited inclusion formation. Lactacystin slightly inhibited bacterial inclusion formation. KEGG analysis using a draft genome sequence of the bacteria revealed that it possesses metabolic pathways almost identical to those of pathogenic chlamydia. Interestingly, comparative genomic analysis with pathogenic chlamydia revealed that the Parachlamydia similarly possess the genes encoding Type III secretion system, but lacking genes encoding inclusion membrane proteins (IncA to G) required for inclusion maturation. Taken together, we conclude that ancient chlamydiae had the potential to grow in human cells, but overcoming the thermal gap was a critical event for chlamydial adaptation to human cells."

The morphological characteristics of both young and adult thalli were observed and compared. Three species (P. flabellata, P. aurea and P. epiphyton) shared a symmetrical development with dichotomously branching vegetative cells during early stages; conversely, P. prostrata had dishevelled filaments with no dichotomously branching filaments and no symmetrical development. The adult thalli of the former three species shared common morphological characteristics, such as equally dichotomous filaments, absence of erect hair and gametangia formed in prostate vegetative filaments. Phylogenetic analyses based on SSU and ITS rDNA sequences showed that the three morphologically similar species were in a clade that was sister to a clade containing T. umbrina and T. abietina, thus confirming morphological monophyly. Conversely, Phycopeltis prostrata, a species with erect filaments, sessile gametangia on the basal erect hair, larger length/width ratio of vegetative cells and very loosely coalescent prostrate filaments, branched separately from the core Phycopeltis group and the T. umbrina and T. abietina clade. Based on morphological and molecular evidence, the genus Phycopeltis was paraphyletic. Furthermore, the traditional taxonomic criteria for Phycopeltis must be reassessed based on phylogeny using more species. A new circumscription of the Phycopeltis and the erection of new genera are recommended."

Here we identify and characterize by database search analysis, mutagenesis and calmodulin (CaM) pull-down assays a calcium-dependent CaM binding site in the α-helices 1–2 of TRADD death domain. We also show that oxidation of CaM methionines drastically reduces CaM affinity for FADD and TRADD suggesting that oxidation might regulate CaM-FADD and CaM-TRADD interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2121527867,"The fission (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and budding (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) yeasts have served as excellent models for many seminal discoveries in eukaryotic biology. In these organisms, genes are deleted or tagged easily by transforming cells with PCR-generated DNA inserts, flanked by short (50-100bp) regions of gene homology. These PCR reactions use especially designed long primers, which, in addition to the priming sites, carry homology for gene targeting. Primer design follows a fixed method but is tedious and time-consuming especially when done for a large number of genes. To automate this process, we developed the Python-based Genome Retrieval Script (GRS), an easily customizable open-source script for genome analysis. Using GRS, we created PRIMED, the complete PRIMEr D atabase for deleting and C-terminal tagging genes in the main S. pombe and five of the most commonly used S. cerevisiae strains. Because of the importance of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in many biological processes, we also included the deletion primer set for these features in each genome. PRIMED are accurate and comprehensive and are provided as downloadable Excel files, removing the need for future primer design, especially for large-scale functional analyses. Furthermore, the open-source GRS can be used broadly to retrieve genome information from custom or other annotated genomes, thus providing a suitable platform for building other genomic tools by the yeast or other research communities."

However, the exact cause of death is not completely understood and does not correlate with specific clinical and histological parameters of disease. Here we show, by using a semi-allogeneic mouse model of GVHD, that mortality and morbidity can be experimentally separated. We injected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from NOD2/CARD15-deficient donors into semi-allogeneic irradiated chimaeras and observed that recipients were protected from death. However, no protection was observed regarding clinical or pathological scores up to 20 days after transplantation. Protection from death was associated with decreased bacterial translocation, faster hematologic recovery and epithelial integrity maintenance despite mononuclear infiltration at day 20 post-GVHD induction with no skew towards different T helper phenotypes. The protected mice recovered from aGVHD and progressively reached scores compatible with healthy animals. Altogether, our data indicate that severity and mortality can be separate events providing a model to study transplant-related mortality."
