One hundred and fifty rats received unlimited amounts of this mixture; fifty had the control diet consisting of powdered cubes mixed with absolute alcohol in the same ratio as in the experimental mixture. Groups of animals were killed at regular intervals from each batch for a careful study of the liver pathology."

Methyl cellulose has been used by Earle3 to increase the viscosity of tissue-culture fluids for suspended-cell cultures, and appears to be harmless to animal tissue. An investigation of its properties showed it to be capable of forming highly viscous aqueous solutions which would gel spontaneously on raising their temperature. The presence of salts at physiological concentrations lowers the temperature of gelation. Thus one can make a solution of methyl cellulose containing tissue nutrients which, after being added as a liquid at room temperature to the tissue, will set quite firmly soon after being placed in an incubator at 37° C. A further advantage is that this overlay can be removed entirely without disturbing the tissue; this is achieved by cooling the culture in a refrigerator for a short time, during which the gel liquefies, enabling it to be removed by pipetting."

Erikson1 and Moore2 found that certain Actino-mycetes could utilize picric acid, trinitroresorcinol, and nitrobenzene, and Simpson and Evans3 have reported briefly on species of Pseudomonas that decompose o- and p-nitrophenol with the formation of nitrite; the last workers also mention nitrite production from 2,4-dinitrophenol and chloramphenicol."

https://openalex.org/W1987640710,WILD and co-workers1 have reported observing a fundamental and its second harmonic in the radio spectrum of some solar disturbances. Three characteristic features of the observations are: (i) the frequency bands drift towards the lower frequencies with time; (ii) the received intensities of the fundamental and second harmonic are similar; (iii) the harmonic peak usually occurs at slightly less than twice the frequency of the fundamental peak.

This brain factor activates the thoracic gland, which is then believed to secrete the definitive growth and moulting hormone1. But the possibility remains that there may be yet further links in the chain of endocrine organs, located in the abdomen."

The colour of the aqueous solution varies conformably with the pH, from blue (pH 1—2) to garnet red (pH 8—12.0)."
https://openalex.org/W2742075073,"HEVESY1 considers the determination of the rate of renewal, or turnover, as one of the most important applications of tracers. A clear definition of the term ‘turnover’ is therefore of obvious interest. In the present literature the term ‘turnover’ is used with two different meanings. This leads to confusion."

https://openalex.org/W1993713752,"TRACERS are used extensively for the purpose of measuring the absolute flux of a substance through a membrane from, say, side A to side B in the presence of a flux from B to A. Often the system is in a steady state and the two fluxes are equal; but the rate of appearance of tracer atoms (x′) on side B remote from their origin (side A) is used as a measure of the flux A → B, with due mathematical allowance for any back flow of x′, B → A."

https://openalex.org/W2063753534,"AFTER a single dose of a substance, its urinary excretion is commonly highest during the subsequent twenty-four hours, and then decreases with time. It is often desirable to compare different urinary excretion-rates, to extrapolate or interpolate, etc., so that any method of plotting the data such that the relationship is linear between some functions of urinary excretion and time has obvious advantages."
