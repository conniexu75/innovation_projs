https://openalex.org/W2108490725,"A DNA binding and dimerization motif, with apparent amphipathic helices (the HLH motif), has recently been identified in various proteins, including two that bind to immunoglobulin enhancers (E12 and E47). We show here that various HLH proteins can bind as apparent heterodimers to a single DNA motif and also, albeit usually more weakly, as apparent homodimers. The HLH domain can mediate heterodimer formation between either daughterless, E12, or E47 (Class A) and achaete-scute T3 or MyoD (Class B) to form proteins with high affinity for the kappa E2 site in the immunoglobulin kappa chain enhancer. The achaete-scute T3 and MyoD proteins do not form kappa E2-binding heterodimers together, and no active complex with N-myc was evident. The formation of a heterodimer between the daughterless and achaete-scute T3 products may explain the similar phenotypes of mutants at these two loci and the genetic interactions between them. A role of E12 and E47 in mammalian development, analogous to that of daughterless in Drosophila, is likely."
https://openalex.org/W1990845205,"Vasodilators are used clinically for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The effects of some vasodilators seem to be mediated by membrane hyperpolarization. The molecular basis of this hyperpolarization has been investigated by examining the properties of single K+ channels in arterial smooth muscle cells. The presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels in these cells was demonstrated at the single channel level. These channels were opened by the hyperpolarizing vasodilator cromakalim and inhibited by the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker glibenclamide. Furthermore, in arterial rings the vasorelaxing actions of the drugs diazoxide, cromakalim, and pinacidil and the hyperpolarizing actions of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and acetylcholine were blocked by inhibitors of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, suggesting that all these agents may act through a common pathway in smooth muscle by opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2093909923,"A complementary DNA (cDNA) for the rat luteal lutropin-choriogonadotropin receptor (LH-CG-R) was isolated with the use of a DNA probe generated in a polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers based on peptide sequences of purified receptor protein. As would be predicted from the cDNA sequence, the LH-CG-R consists of a 26-residue signal peptide, a 341-residue extracellular domain displaying an internal repeat structure characteristic of members of the leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) family, and a 333-residue region containing seven transmembrane segments. This membrane-spanning region displays sequence similarity with all members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. Hence, the LH-CG-R gene may have evolved by recombination of LRG and G protein-coupled receptor genes. Cells engineered to express LH-CG-R cDNA bind human choriogonadotropin with high affinity and show an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate when exposed to hormone. As revealed by RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization, the 4.4-kilobase cognate messenger RNA is prominently localized in the rat ovary."

On the basis of this observation, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with early Parkinson's disease was initiated to determine whether deprenyl (a selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor) would delay the need for L-dopa therapy by slowing the progression of the disease. Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to deprenyl (10 mg/day) or placebo treatment groups and followed until L-dopa therapy was indicated or until the patient had been in the study for 3 years. Analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each group showed that deprenyl delayed the need for L-dopa therapy; the average time until L-dopa was needed was 312.1 days for patients in the placebo group and 548.9 days for patients in the deprenyl group. Disease progression, as monitored by five different assessment scales, was slowed (by 40 to 83% per year) in the deprenyl group compared to placebo. Therefore, early deprenyl therapy delays the requirement for antiparkinsonian medication, possibly by slowing progression of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2034209707,"The purine analog 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), which has anti-retroviral activity in vitro was administered for up to 42 weeks to 26 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex (ARC). Ten of these individuals were AZT-intolerant. Eight dose regimens were studied. The drug was orally bioavailable and penetrated into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparatively little evidence of an effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was seen at the lowest four doses. However, patients in the four highest dose groups (ddI at 1.6 milligrams per kilogram intravenously and then greater than or equal to 3.2 milligrams per kilogram orally at least every 12 hours or higher) had increases in their circulating CD4+ T cells (P less than 0.0005), increased CD4/CD8 T cell ratios (P less than 0.01), and, where evaluable, more than an 80% decrease in serum HIV p24 antigen (P less than 0.05). The patients also had evidence of improved immunologic function, had reduced viremic symptomatology, and gained a mean of 1.6 kilogram with these comparatively infrequent dosing schedules (every 8 or 12 hours). The most notable adverse effects directly attributable to ddI administration at the doses used in this study included increases in serum uric acid (due to hypoxanthine release) and mild headaches and insomnia. These results suggest that serious short-term toxicity at therapeutic doses is not an inherent feature in the profile of agents with clinical anti-HIV activity. Further controlled studies to define the safety and efficacy of this agent may be worth considering."
https://openalex.org/W2056975726,"Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions. Fe(II)-EDTA, a solvent-based reagent which cleaves both double- and single-stranded RNA, was used to investigate the structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme. Regions of cleavage alternate with regions of substantial protection along the entire RNA molecule. In particular, most of the catalytic core shows greatly reduced cleavage. These data constitute experimental evidence that an RNA enzyme, like a protein enzyme, has an interior and an exterior. Determination of positions where the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA is on the inside or on the outside of the molecule provides major constraints for modeling the three-dimensional structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme. This approach should be generally informative for structured RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1520904574,"Seven cDNA clones corresponding to the rab1, rab2, rab3A, rab3B, rab4, rab5, and rab6 genes were isolated from a human pheochromocytoma cDNA library. They encode 23-25 kDa polypeptides which share approximately 30-50% homology and belong to the ras superfamily. The rab1, rab2, rab3A, and rab4 proteins are the human counterparts of the rat rab gene products that we have previously characterized. Comparison of the seven human rab proteins with the yeast YPT1 (YPT1p) and SEC4 (SEC4p) proteins reveals highly significant sequence similarities. H-rab1p shows 75% amino acid identity with YPT1p and may be therefore considered as its human counterpart. The other proteins share approximately 40% homology with YPT1p and SEC4p. The homology (approximately 30%) between these rab proteins and p21ras is restricted to the four conserved domains involved in the GTP/GDP binding. Human rab proteins were produced in Escherichia coli. Large amounts of rab proteins in soluble form can be extracted and purified without the use of detergents. All six proteins bind GTP and exhibit GTPase activities. A possible involvement of the rab proteins in secretion is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2076944748,"Sex-specific alternative splicing of RNA from the Drosophila transformer gene involves competition between two 3' splice sites. In the absence of Sex-lethal activity (as in males), only one site functions; in the presence of Sex-lethal activity (as in females), both sites function. Information for sex-specific splice site choice is contained within the intron itself. Deletions of the splice site used in males lead to Sex-lethal-independent use of the otherwise female-specific site. The relative amounts of unspliced and spliced RNA derived from these mutant genes do not change with changes in Sex-lethal activity. Specific nucleotide changes in the non-sex-specific splice site do not affect splicing activity but eliminate Sex-lethal-induced regulation. A deletion removing material between the two splice sites does not eliminate sex-specific regulation, while a deletion of the female splice site leads to a female-specific increase in unspliced RNA. These results are consistent with a model in which female-specific factors block the function of the non-sex-specific 3' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W2153990155,"Abstract Glucocorticoid hormones and Ca2+ ionophores stimulate a suicide process in immature thymocytes, known as apoptosis or programmed cell death, that involves extensive DNA fragmentation. We have recently shown that a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration stimulates DNA fragmentation and cell killing in glucocorticoid- or ionophore-treated thymocytes. However, a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ level also mediates lymphocyte proliferation, suggesting that apoptosis is blocked in proliferating thymocytes. In this study we report that phorbol esters, which selectively stimulate protein kinase C (PKC), blocked DNA fragmentation and cell death in thymocytes exposed to Ca2+ ionophore or glucocorticoid hormone. The T cell mitogen, concanavalin A, which stimulates thymocytes by a mechanism that involves PKC activation, caused concentration-dependent increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ level that did not result in DNA fragmentation, but incubation with concanavalin A and the PKC inhibitor H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) resulted in both DNA fragmentation and cell death. Phorbol ester directly inhibited Ca2+-dependent DNA fragmentation in isolated thymocyte nuclei. Our results strongly suggest that PKC activation blocks thymocyte apoptosis by preventing Ca2+-stimulated endonuclease activation."
https://openalex.org/W1968802467,"Patterns of histone binding to DNA of transcriptionally active D. melanogaster hsp70 genes within the nuclei have been analyzed by two methods of histone-DNA chemical cross-linking. When cross-linking is restricted to the central, “globular” regions of histones, it drops most for H1, to an intermediate extent for H2A and H2B, and least for H3 and H4 in transcriptionally active versus transcriptionally silent chromatin. When it occurs via histone terminal regions as well, cross-linking is quantitatively similar for active and inactive chromatin. Neither cross-linking method detects histones on the hsp70 promoter region. It appears that chromatin activation decreases histone binding to DNA via the “globular” regions, known to be essential for the folding of nucleosomes and the 30 nm chromatin fibril, but does not significantly affect the interaction of flexible and loosely bound histone “tails” with DNA. The role of these histone-DNA interaction changes in the unfolding of active chromatin and RNA polymerase reading through histone-bound DNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2038403184,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, the Abelson tyrosine kinase (abl) is localized in the axons of the central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in abl have no detectable effect on the morphology of the embryonic CNS, and the mutant animals survive to the pupal and adult stages. In the absence of abl function, however, heterozygous mutations or deletions of disabled (dab) exert dominant effects, disrupting axonal organization and shifting the lethal phase of the animals to embryonic and early larval stages. Embryos that are homozygous mutant for both abl and dab fail to develop any axon bundles in the CNS, although the peripheral nervous system and the larval cuticle appear normal. The genetic interaction between these two genes begins to define a process in which both the abl tyrosine kinase and the dab gene product participate in establishing axonal connections in the embryonic CNS of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1590628671,"In most mammalian ovaries, the cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) expands at the time of ovulation by depositing an extensive extracellular matrix between the cumulus cells. This phenomenon can be reproduced in vitro by culturing COCs with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum. Biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA) and proteoglycans by mouse COCs in vitro was studied using [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate as metabolic precursors. Radiolabeled complex carbohydrates were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography, specific enzyme digestion followed by high performance liquid chromatography, and gel filtration. The specific activities of [3H]hexosamines in the labeled molecules were determined by measuring the incorporation of 3H and 35S into chondroitin 4-sulfate disaccharides. When COCs were stimulated with FSH, HA biosynthesis increased 20-30-fold between 3-12 h later when expansion occurs, reaching a maximum rate of approximately 780 pmol (as glucosamine)/COC/h compared with the unstimulated rate of approximately 26 pmol/COC/h. The final concentration of HA in the expanded COC was calculated to be approximately 250 micrograms/ml. The effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) on COC expansion and HA synthesis were similar to those of FSH, suggesting that the effects of FSH are mediated by cAMP. However, FSH significantly decreased the specific activity of the incorporated hexosamines while Bt2cAMP did not. Serum is necessary for the accumulation of HA in the COC matrix. HA synthesis in FSH-stimulated COCs was as high or higher in the absence of serum, but most was recovered in the medium and not in the COC matrix. The molecular size of the HA was greater than 2 million dalton in either case, suggesting that the serum did not alter physical properties of HA. Stimulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis by either FSH or Bt2cAMP was less pronounced (three to four times control) than for HA and was sustained throughout an 18-h culture period. A reduction of 80% in the deposition of newly synthesized PGs in the COC matrix by 0.5 mM beta-xyloside treatment did not affect the expansion of the cumulus."

https://openalex.org/W1996815527,"High-resolution differential interference contrast microscopy and digital imaging of the fluorescent calcium indicator dye fura-2 were performed simultaneously in single rat salivary gland acinar cells to examine the effects of muscarinic stimulation on cell volume and cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Agonist stimulation of fluid secretion is initially associated with a rapid tenfold increase in [Ca2+]i as well as a substantial cell shrinkage. Subsequent changes of cell volume in the continued presence of agonist are tightly coupled to dynamic levels of [Ca2+]i, even during [Ca2+]i oscillations. Experiments with Ca2+ chelators and ionophores showed that physiological elevations of [Ca2+]i are necessary and sufficient to cause changes in cell volume. The relation between [Ca2+]i and cell volume suggests that the latter reflects the secretory state of the acinar cell. Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, by modulating specific ion permeabilities, result in solute movement into or out of the cell. The resultant cell volume changes may be important in modulating salivary secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1499411585,"Preincubation of human platelets with activators of protein kinase C such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been shown previously to attenuate the ability of agonists both to suppress formation of cAMP and to stimulate hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. In the present study, we have examined whether the attenuation caused by PMA can be attributed to the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit(s) of Gi, a GTP-binding regulatory protein implicated in several pathways of signal transduction. PMA was found to promote the phosphorylation of several proteins within saponin-permeabilized and intact platelets incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and [32P]H3PO4, respectively. None of the phosphoproteins, however, was precipitated by either of two antisera containing antibodies differing in specificities for epitopes within Gi alpha, despite precipitation of a substantial fraction of the subunit itself. In contrast, other antisera, containing antibodies specific for the recently described Gz alpha or both Gz alpha and Gi alpha, precipitated a 40-kDa phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation of this protein occurred not only in response to PMA, but to thrombin and the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. These data suggest that activators of protein kinase C lead to the phosphorylation within platelets of a select population of G alpha subunits. The identified phosphoprotein is not Gi alpha, but is similar or identical to Gz alpha. Because Gz alpha does not contain the consensus site for ADP-ribosylation by the Bordetella pertussis toxin islet-activating protein, the data also suggest that effects of PMA on processes otherwise sensitive to this toxin are not exerted at the level of G proteins responsible for transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1593025724,"The relationship of extramitochondrial Ca2+ to intramitochondrial Ca2+ and the influence of intramitochondrial free Ca2+ concentrations on various steps of the citric acid cycle were evaluated. Ca2+ was measured using the Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 trapped inside the rat heart mitochondria. The rate of utilization of specific substrates and the rate of accumulation of citric acid cycle intermediates were measured at matrix free Ca2+ ranging from 0 to 1.2 microM. A change in matrix free Ca2+ from 0 to 0.3 microM caused a 135% increase in ADP stimulated oxidation of 0.6 mM alpha-ketoglutarate (K0.5 = 0.15 microM). In the absence of ADP and the presence of 0.6 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, Ca2+ (0.3 microM) increased NAD(H) reduction from 0 to 40%. On the other hand, when pyruvate (10 microM to 5 mM) was substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase flux was insensitive to Ca2+ and isocitrate dehydrogenase was sensitive to Ca2+ only in the presence of added ADP. In separate experiments pyruvate dehydrogenase activation (dephosphorylation) was measured. Under the conditions of the present study, pyruvate dehydrogenase was found to be almost 100% activated at all levels of Ca2+, thus explaining the Ca2+ insensitivity of the flux measurements. However, if the mitochondria were incubated in the absence of pyruvate, with excess alpha-ketoglutarate and excess ATP, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was only 20% active in the absence of added Ca2+ and activity increased to 100% at 2 microM Ca2+. Activation by Ca2+ required more Ca2+ (K0.5 = 1 microM) than for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The data suggest that in heart mitochondria alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase may be a more physiologically relevant target of Ca2+ action than pyruvate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1504796212,"Abstract We recently demonstrated that 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) constricts rat aortic rings. The contractile response was partially dependent on the presence of endothelium and was abolished by pretreatment of the rings with either indomethacin or the endoperoxide/thromboxane receptor antagonist, SQ29548. Addition of GSH or SnCl2 to the organ bath diminished the contractile response of 20-HETE, whereas preincubation of the rings with a thromboxane synthase inhibitor did not affect the 20-HETE induced contractions. Short time incubation (2 min) of 20-HETE with ram seminal vesicle microsomes in the presence of p-hydroxymercurybenzoate yielded metabolites which migrated similarly on thin layer chromatography to the known arachidonate endoperoxides prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGH2 and possess vasoconstrictory properties. The vasoconstriction was dose-dependent with a half-life of approximately 6.3 +/- 0.6 min. Addition of SQ29548 to the aortic ring bath 1 min after metabolite elicited vasoconstriction produced immediate relaxation. Furthermore, pretreatment of the rings with SQ29548 totally abolished the contraction. SnCl2 reduction of the metabolites produced in incubation of rat seminal vesicles with 20-HETE and p-hydroxymercurybenzoate resulted in a single radioactive peak which was further identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as 20-hydroxy-PGF2 alpha. The inhibitory effect of SQ29548, the appearance of labile metabolites with a half-life of approximately 6 min and the production of 20-hydroxy-PGF2 alpha by SnCl2 reduction clearly indicate that the vasoconstrictor metabolites of 20-HETE are the labile endoperoxides of 20-HETE, 20-hydroxy-PGG2, and 20-hydroxy-PGH2."
https://openalex.org/W1642811251,"Full-length cDNAs encoding either dog cardiac or rabbit skeletal muscle phospholamban were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. The expressed protein displayed the mobility of a pentamer when dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate and separated in polyacrylamide gels, and of a monomer when boiled prior to polyacrylamide gel separation. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to analyze the roles of several amino acids in the structure and function of the protein. Ser16 and Thr17 were shown to be phosphorylated uniquely by cAMP- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, respectively, confirming earlier observations on the native protein (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, J.L., Wegener, A.D., and Jones, L.R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333-13341). Arg13 and Arg14 were shown to be essential for both types of phosphorylation, and Arg9 was shown to be essential for calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation. In studies of pentamer stability, mutation of Gln22-Gln23 to Ala-Ala or Glu-Glu, of Gln26-Asn27 to Glu-Asp, or of Gln29-Asn30 to Glu-Asp had no effect on thermal stability of the pentamer, suggesting that hydrogen bonding involving these residues in domain IB is not important for pentamer stability. By contrast, mutation of Cys36, Cys41, and Cys46 in transmembrane domain II to Ser, Ala, or Phe diminished the stability of the pentamer when microsomal proteins were dissociated in sodium dodecyl sulfate and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In particular, the Cys41 to Phe mutant existed as a monomer at ambient temperature. These results suggest that the intramembranous cysteine residues are important for pentamer formation even though they are not disulfide-bonded."
https://openalex.org/W1578809256,"Abstract Incubation of the streptococcal NADH peroxidase with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate under anaerobic denaturing conditions leads to the rapid incorporation of 1 eq/FAD of the aromatic thiol. Addition of dithiothreitol to the resulting conjugate, following ultrafiltration, demonstrates that a mixed disulfide has been formed. Analysis of the denatured NADH peroxidase by iso-electric focusing reveals the presence of two predominant species differing in isoelectric point by approximately 0.1 units. Preincubation with 20 mM hydrogen peroxide gives essentially complete and irreversible conversion to the more acidic species. Treatment of the native peroxidase with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide also leads to irreversible enzyme inactivation; the low extinction long wavelength absorbance associated with the enzyme as purified is lost in the process. Anaerobic dithionite and NADH titrations of the peroxide-inactivated enzyme indicate that, while the cysteinyl redox center is nonfunctional, the enzyme is still capable of forming a binary complex with NADH. We propose that the redox-active cysteinyl derivative which serves as the second redox center in the native peroxidase is a stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid derivative of Cys42. This determination is consistent with the covalent modifications observed with both 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and with H2O2 and is supported by mass spectrometric analysis of a chymotryptic cysteinyl peptide derived from the unmodified peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1500411229,"The human c-Ha-ras protooncogene product p21C was truncated at the C terminus by 23 amino acids. The resulting G-binding domain, p21 (1-166) = p21C', can be crystallized as a complex with the slowly hydrolyzing GTP analogues guanosin-5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate, guanosin-5'-[beta,gamma-methylene]triphosphate, and guanosin-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). We show here that this protein has biochemical properties very similar to those of the intact protein. Activating mutations in position 12 (Gly12----Val; Gly12----Arg) have the same effect on the properties of the truncated protein as on intact protein. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements show no apparent effect of the C-terminal deletion on the solution structure of p21. This suggests that neither the structure of the G-binding domain nor any of its biochemical properties are markedly influenced by the truncation."
https://openalex.org/W1493499787,"Abstract We examined the biosynthetic processing and assembly of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex in [35S]methionine-labeled HEL cells, a human cell line with features of megakaryocytes. Both GPIIb and GPIIIa were synthesized as single-chain precursors to which high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides were added in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A 5-fold excess of the major IIb precursor, preIIb, was synthesized relative to GPIIIa. Two smaller proteins immunologically related to GPIIb were synthesized in smaller amounts. Assembly of the GPIIb and GPIIIa precursors required 4-6 h for completion. All GPIIIa molecules were eventually assembled; the excess GPIIb precursors were degraded without reaching the cell surface. Following assembly, preIIb-IIIa complexes were rapidly transported to the Golgi apparatus where preIIb underwent modification of high mannose chains into complex oligosaccharides and proteolytic cleavage to yield disulfide-linked heavy and light chains. Pretreating cells with the ionophore monensin blocked cleavage of preIIb but not its carbohydrate modification or its assembly with GPIIIa. These studies suggest that 1) assembly of the precursors of GPIIb and GPIIIa in the ER is a slow process requiring conformational maturation of one or both subunits, and 2) only heterodimers assembled in the ER are transported to the Golgi apparatus for additional processing and, ultimately, expression on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1549940137,"Turkey erythrocyte membranes possess a phospholipase C that is markedly activated by P2Y-purinergic receptor agonists and guanine nucleotides. Reconstitution of [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocyte membranes with guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein) beta gamma subunits resulted in inhibition of both AlF-4-stimulated adenylate cyclase and AlF-4-stimulated phospholipase C activities. The apparent potency (K0.5 approximately 1 microgram or 20 pmol of beta gamma/mg of membrane protein) of beta gamma subunits for inhibition of each enzyme activity was similar and occurred with beta gamma purified by different methodologies from turkey erythrocyte, bovine brain, or human placenta membranes. In contrast to the effect on AlF-4-stimulated activity, the stimulatory effect on phospholipase C of the P2Y-purinergic receptor agonist 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate in the presence of guanine nucleotides was potentiated by 50-100% in a concentration-dependent manner by reconstitution of beta gamma subunits. beta gamma subunits did not affect the K0.5 value of 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate for the stimulation of phospholipase C activity. These results indicate that beta gamma subunits influence phospholipase C activity in a concentration range similar to that necessary for regulation of adenylate cyclase activity and suggest the involvement of a G-protein possessing an alpha beta gamma heterotrimeric structure in coupling hormone receptors to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1626710467,"Abstract A desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium Nostoc commune accumulates a novel group of acidic proteins when colonies are subjected to repeated cycles of drying and rehydration. The proteins occur in high concentrations; they have isoelectric points between 4.3 and 4.8 and apparent molecular masses between 30 and 39 kDa. The purification of three of these proteins with molecular masses of 33, 37, and 39 kDa is described. The amino-terminal sequence of the 39-kDa protein is Ala-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Gly-Glu. Peptide mapping of the 39- and the 33-kDa proteins, using different protease, gave similar patterns of digestion fragments. The amino acid compositions of the proteins isolated were similar, and each cross-reacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against the largest (39-kDa) protein. The results indicate that the microheterogeneity observed was generated by in vivo proteolysis of the 39-kDa protein. It is suggested that this protein is a water stress protein with a protective function on a structural level."
https://openalex.org/W1580522854,"Abstract Procollagen N-proteinase (EC 3.4.24.14), the enzyme that cleaves the NH2-terminal propeptides from type I procollagen, was purified over 20,000-fold with a yield of 12% from extracts of 17-day-old chick embryo tendons. The procedure involved precipitation with ammonium sulfate, adsorption on concanavalin A-Sepharose, and five additional column chromatographic steps. The purified enzyme was a neutral, Ca2+-dependent proteinase (5-10 mM) that was inhibited by metal chelators. It had a molecular mass of 500 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The enzyme contained unreduced polypeptides of 61, 120, 135, and 161 kDa that were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The 135- and 161-kDa polypeptides were catalytically active after elution from the polyacrylamide gel. Other properties of 500-kDa enzyme are: 1) the Km for type I procollagen is 54 nM at pH 7.5 and 35 degrees C, and the kappa cat is 350 h-1; 2) the activation energy for reaction with type I procollagen is 7,100 cal mol-1; 3) the isoelectric point is 3.6; and 4) the enzyme specifically cleaves the NH2-terminal propeptides of type I and II procollagen, but not of type III procollagen. A minor form of N-proteinase with a 300-kDa mass was also purified and was found to contain a 90-kDa polypeptide as the major active polypeptide. The enzyme appeared to be a degraded form of the 500-kDa N-proteinase. The properties of the 300-kDa enzyme were similar to those observed for the 500-kDa enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1494474117,"Plasma membranes were isolated and separated from thylakoid membranes by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation of crude membranes prepared by French pressure cell extrusion of lysozyme-treated Anacystis nidulans. Two distinct populations of chlorophyll-free plasma membrane vesicles were obtained exhibiting buoyant densities of 1.087 and 1.100 g/cm3 as opposed to a uniform density of 1.192 g/cm3 for thylakoid membranes. Plasma and thylakoid membranes were characteristically different also with respect to fatty acid and protein composition, cytochrome oxidase activity, and pigment content as analyzed by spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, and high performance liquid chromatography. Apart from carotenoids, chlorophyll a was the only major photosynthetic pigment detected in thylakoid membranes while plasma membranes contained virtually no chlorophyll a but (besides large amounts of carotenoids) protochlorophyllide a and chlorophyllide a as revealed by solvent partition (between n-hexane and acetone or methanol), room and low temperature fluorescence emission and excitation spectra, and analytical separation and identification by high performance liquid chromatography and comparison with authentic standards. The protochlorophyllide in the plasma membrane could be transformed into chlorophyllide in the dark in vitro by incubating the membrane preparation with NADPH; NADP+ effected the reverse transition."
https://openalex.org/W1573383201,"Abstract Serine substitutions for the five conserved cysteins (residues 38, 85, 97, 132, and 184) have been made in the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase Fe-protein by site-specific mutagenesis. At least moderate levels of enzyme activity (greater than 10% of wild type enzyme) were found for enzymes with serine substitutions at residues 38, 85, and 184; whereas, no activity was detected for enzymes with serines at residues 97 and 132. This is consistent with cysteines 97 and 132 being the four ligands to the Fe:S cluster (two ligands from each of the two identical subunits). Although previous chemical modification studies had implicated these residues as ligands, the earlier results did not portend the new finding that of all the conserved cysteines only these 2 residues are required for a second function of the Fe-protein. Namely, if either cysteine 97 or 132 is replaced, it appears that a functional Fe:S cluster cannot be incorporated into the apo-Fe-protein. The consequence is that these altered Fe-proteins cannot participate either in substrate reduction or in the biosynthesis of FeMo-cofactor, a metallocofactor of the MoFe-protein. These results implicate the Fe:S center of Fe-protein in the biosynthesis mechanism as either a redox partner or Fe:S donor. Additional results suggest that the posttranslational modification of Fe-protein by nifM product is not the insertion of the Fe:S center."
https://openalex.org/W1622224404,The well-established mechanism of regeneration of the parent nitro compound by the reaction of the nitro anion radical with oxygen in aerobic systems is the basis of the correlation of kinetic parameters of purified flavoenzymes with electron affinities of some selected nitroaryl and nitroheterocyclic compounds. We have found that there is a linear relationship between log Vmax/Km and the one-electron reduction potentials of these compounds and that the measured values of redox dependence for these compounds is similar to that determined by other methods. Our results support the proposal of a rate-determining single electron-transfer as the initial step in the reduction of nitro compounds by purified flavoenzymes and are discussed in terms of the Marcus electron transfer theory.
https://openalex.org/W1586200373,"Abstract Expression and secretion of human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was achieved by linking an actin (ACT) promoter to an MF alpha 1 prepro leader peptide/IGF-I gene fusion. Purified human IGF-I from yeast culture media was found to contain, in addition to the native form, also a glycosylated variant. Structural studies showed that both IGF-I forms were processed identically, resulting in 70-amino-acid long polypeptides, with intact N-terminal and C-terminal residues of glycine and alanine, respectively. The glycosylation site was determined to threonine-29 (Thr29), by 1H NMR spectroscopy and protein sequence analysis of an isolated tryptic peptide(22-36). No other glycosylation sites were found. Only mannose was detected in the sugar analysis, with an estimated content of 4.5% w/w corresponding to 2 mannose residues per molecule of IGF-I. The carbohydrate structure, determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, was found to be alpha-D-Manp(1----2)alpha-D-Manp(1----3)Thr corresponding to an O-linked glycoprotein structure. No other post-translational modifications could be identified in the glycosylated IGF-I form. Furthermore, this form was highly active, comparable to native IGF-I, exhibiting a specific activity of 20,500 units/mg, as determined by a radio-receptor assay."
https://openalex.org/W1597653479,"Abstract Identification of three overlapping clones in a canine genomic lambda phage library allowed us to determine a detailed restriction enzyme map of the primary transcriptional unit of the pancreatic lipase gene (15.5 kilobase pairs) as well as 15 and 6 kilobase pairs of 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, respectively. DNA sequence analysis provided the primary structure of (a) 1,345 nucleotides (nt) of 5'-flanking sequence including CAAT and TATA boxes at positions -112 and -35, respectively, and a class 2 glucocorticoid receptor binding sequence at position -97, (b) 13,127 out of approximately 15,500 nt of the transcriptional unit which is organized into 13 exon sequences, and (c) 1,270 nt of 3'-flanking sequence. Exon 1 encodes the entire 5'-nontranslated mRNA sequence; exon 2, the ATG initiation codon and the hydrophobic portion of the signal peptide; and exon 6, Ser154 which shows homology to the active Ser152 in the porcine enzyme. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human lipoprotein lipase, rat hepatic lipase, and Drosophila yolk proteins 1, 2, and 3 with canine pancreatic lipase shows that the central region of highest homology (encoded by exons 6-8 in the dog gene) contains four highly conserved subregions which may play a critical role in enzyme-substrate and protein-ligand binding for lipases and yolk proteins, respectively. Comparison of the sequences of 10 lipases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes identifies a 9-residue consensus sequence surrounding the active serine which includes the previously identified sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly. The hydrophobic nature of this sequence in the 10 lipases contrasts with the hydrophilic nature of the corresponding sequences in serine proteases and thus defines an active site serine consensus sequence specific for lipases. An analysis of 5'- and 3'-flanking and intron 1-4 sequences in transient expression studies with AR4-2J and 266-6 cells was unable to reveal tissue-specific promoter or enhancer sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1547621415,"Exposure of human HL60 cells to dimethyl sulfoxide results in their differentiation to mature granulocyte-like cells that concomitantly acquire the capacity to synthesize leukotrienes. The appearance of 5-lipoxygenase mRNA during differentiation indicated that these cells provide a useful model system for the biosynthesis and regulation of 5-lipoxygenase. Immunoblot analysis of protein from differentiated HL60 cells detected a 78,000-Da species comigrating with 5-lipoxygenase purified from human peripheral blood leukocytes. Metabolic labeling studies indicated that both undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells synthesized 5-lipoxygenase; however, the differentiated cells incorporated approximately 4.4-fold more [35S]methionine into 5-lipoxygenase protein than did controls. In addition, the differentiated HL60 cells contained approximately 3.3-fold more 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity than undifferentiated cells. Metabolic labeling studies failed to demonstrate any post-translational modifications of 5-lipoxygenase, including proteolysis, mannose glycosylation, myristic acid acylation, or phosphorylation. When differentiated HL60 cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 4 versus 16 h, no difference was observed in the pattern of total radiolabeled supernatant protein; however, there was a significant increase in the incorporation of radioactivity into immunoprecipitable 5-lipoxygenase protein from cells labeled for 16 as compared with 4 h. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the t1/2 of 5-lipoxygenase in these cells is approximately 26 h. Activation of differentiated HL60 cells with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in the loss of 5-lipoxygenase protein and activity from the cytosol and the accumulation of inactive protein in a membrane fraction. Following ionophore stimulation, no augmentation in the rate of 5-lipoxygenase synthesis occurred in order to compensate for the loss of the translocated/inactive enzyme. Finally, additional 5-lipoxygenase was able to translocate to the membrane in response to subsequent ionophore challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2163448787,"The question of how the presence of nucleosomal packing of DNA modifies carcinogen interaction at specific sites cannot be answered by studies on whole chromatin or bulk nucleosomes because of the heterogeneity of DNA sequences in the particles. We have circumvented this problem by using nucleosomes that are homogenous in DNA sequence and hence in DNA-histone contact points. A cloned DNA fragment containing a sea urchin 5 S gene which precisely positions a histone octamer was employed. By using 32P end-labeled DNA and genotoxins that allow cleavage at sites of attack, the frequency of adduction at every susceptible nucleotide can be determined on sequencing gels. The small methylating agent dimethyl sulfate and the bulky alkylating agent aflatoxin B1-dichloride (AFB1-Cl2) were used to probe the influence of DNA-histone interactions on DNA alkylation patterns in the sequence-positioned core particle. We find dimethyl sulfate to bind with equal preference to naked or nucleosomal DNA. In contrast, AFB1-Cl2 binding is suppressed an average of 2.4-fold at guanyl sites within nucleosomes compared with AFB1-Cl2 affinity at the corresponding site in naked DNA. The DNA is more accessible in regions near the particle boundary. We observe no other histone-imposed localized changes in AFB1-Cl2 sequence specificity. Further, sites of DNase I cleavage or proposed DNA bending show neither enhanced nor reduced AFB1-Cl2 adduction to N7-guanine. Since AFB1-Cl2 binding sites lie in the major groove, nucleosomal DNA appears accessible to AFB1-Cl2 at all points of analysis but with an access which is uniformly restricted in the central 100 nucleotides of the core particle. The data available do not indicate further localized or site-specific perturbations in DNA interactions with the two carcinogens studied."
https://openalex.org/W1535327323,"Hyaluronate synthetase was solubilized with digitonin from crude membranes of mouse oligodendroglioma cells. Detergent extraction was carried out in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline with an optimal digitonin to protein ratio (w/w) of 0.7-0.8. The solubilized synthetase was partially purified approximately 230-fold by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The solubilized enzyme displayed similar properties to membrane-bound enzyme: (a) it synthesized high molecular weight hyaluronate which eluted in the void volume of a Sepharose CL-2B column; (b) the apparent Km values obtained for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were 50 and 100 microM, respectively; and (c) treatment of intact cells with hyaluronidase prior to extraction with digitonin resulted in a 3-fold increase in solubilized synthetase activity. Furthermore, gel filtration chromatography of the solubilized hyaluronidase-treated synthetase complex showed that it was smaller than the solubilized untreated synthetase complex, due to shorter nascent-bound hyaluronate. The solubilized synthetase was shown to be associated with hyaluronate in the form of a complex. Both hyaluronidase-treated and -untreated synthetase-hyaluronate complexes after solubilization were adsorbed by an affinity matrix using the hyaluronate binding domain of rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycan as ligand. This solubilized active enzyme preparation should allow the identification and characterization of the components of the hyaluronate-synthetase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1533862222,"Species lacking either 8 or 10 residues at the amino terminus of recombinant human interferon-gamma (Hu-IFN-gamma) were generated by limited digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. A crude digest, consisting predominantly of these species, were completely inactive in inducing antiviral activity and the expression of HLA-DR antigens on HL-60 cells. The NH2-terminal deletion fragments were separated from residual intact IFN-gamma and from smaller polypeptides by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at pH 2.2. Intact IFN-gamma, purified by HPLC and subsequently refolded by dilution in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was similar to untreated IFN-gamma in terms of binding to its cell surface receptor and in inducing antiviral activity and the expression of HLA-DR molecules. Conversely, biological activity was not detected in purified fragments 8-139 and 10-139. Examination of fragments 8-139 and 10-139 by far-UV circular dichroism revealed that cleavage of 8-10 residues at the amino terminus accompanied a dramatic change in secondary structure (6% alpha-helical and 36% beta-sheet content) as compared to untreated or HPLC-purified IFN-gamma (66% alpha-helix and 0% beta-sheet content). In summary, these results indicate that the amino terminus contributes to the structural integrity of the IFN-gamma molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1601998050,"Abstract Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proacrosin has been identified in extracts of intact guinea spermatozoa as a major silver staining band which reacted immunologically with antibodies made against purified proacrosin from guinea pig testis. Proacrosin exhibited an approximate Mr of 50,000 and was rapidly converted to an Mr 45,000 protein following induction of the acrosome reaction with 2.0 mM CaCl2 and 1 micrograms/ml A23187. Apical segments isolated at pH 6.0 from guinea pig spermatozoa also contained a major silver staining band of Mr 50,000 which cross-reacted with antibodies to guinea pig testis proacrosin. Subcellular fractionation of spermatozoa indicated that proacrosin remained in the particulate fraction of homogenized spermatozoa and was enriched within the isolated acrosomal apical segment. When apical segments isolated at pH 6.0 were incubated at pH 7.5, proacrosin was rapidly converted to the Mr 45,000 form observed in spermatozoa undergoing the acrosome reaction. The conversion process in isolated apical segments was inhibited by leupeptin and was accelerated in the presence of calcium, magnesium, and manganese. Zinc completely inhibited the conversion of proacrosin to the Mr 45,000 protein. Neither proacrosin nor the Mr 45,000 protein were released into the supernatant fluid during the incubation of apical segments at pH 7.5. Furthermore, the proteins were resistant to solubilization by 150 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 but were solubilized by treatment of apical segments with 1 M NaCl. These results provide evidence as to the identity and subcellular distribution of proacrosin in intact guinea pig sperm prior to zymogen conversion and suggest that isolated apical segments exhibit a subset of the exocytotic reactions leading to completion of the acrosome reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1556694423,"Abstract Human DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme follows an ordered sequential terreactant mechanism of substrate recognition and binding (Wong, S. W., Paborsky, L. R., Fisher, P. A., Wang, T. S.-F., and Korn, D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7958-7968). We confirmed this mechanism for the DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme purified from Drosophila melanogaster embryos and studied the interaction of Drosophila pol alpha with synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers containing modified tetrahydrofuran moieties as model abasic lesions chemically engineered at a number of defined sites. Abasic lesions in the template had relatively little effect on the polymerase incorporation reaction at sites proximal to the lesion. However, incorporation opposite an abasic site was undetectable relative to that which occurred opposite a normal template nucleotide. Moreover, abasic residues in the primer region of the template-primer construct as far as 4 base pairs removed from the 3'-primer terminus prevented detectable nucleotide incorporation relative to that seen on an unmodified template-primer. Primer-region lesions had qualitatively similar effects whether they were located on the primer strand itself or on the complementary template strand. Data from polymerase incorporation experiments were corroborated by competitive binding assays performed under steady state reaction conditions. Results of these experiments suggested that polymerase binding to synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers was essentially unaffected by lesions located at sites that did not block incorporation. Lesions that did block incorporation apparently did so by abrogating template-primer binding. These observations have implications for understanding the mechanisms whereby DNA polymerase alpha recognizes noninformational template sites in vivo and prevents DNA synthesis from proceeding past these points."
https://openalex.org/W1561346054,"Abstract The behavior of 131I-labeled follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) after binding to cell-surface receptors in cultured Sertoli cells of C57BL/6NCrj mice was investigated. Sertoli cells cultured in F12/DME were pulse-labeled with 131I-FSH for 10 min at 4 degrees C, followed by cold chase for various periods of time. After the cold chase Sertoli cells were treated with 0.2 M acetate (pH 2.5) to dissociate membrane-bound 131I-FSH (surface radioactivity). The medium containing radioactivity after cold chase was mixed with 20% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured (degraded hormone). The radiolabeled materials associated with each process (surface binding, internalization, and degradation) were concentrated with ultrafiltration and characterized with gel filtration and/or thin layer chromatography. The effects of lysosomotropic agents, NH4Cl and chloroquine, were studied. The cold chase study at 32 degrees C showed that the surface radioactivity was the largest among the three kinds of radioactivities associated with each process immediately after pulse labeling, but the surface radioactivity rapidly decreased, while the internalized radioactivity increased. The cold chase study at 4 degrees C did not show such time-related changes in radioactivities, and a high level of surface radioactivity constantly persisted. The surface and internalized radioactivities were due to 131I-FSH, and the degraded radioactivity was mainly due to [131I]monoiodotyrosine. When Sertoli cells were cultured with lysosomotropic agents, the internalized radioactivity increased, while the degraded radioactivity decreased. Based on these observations, a kinetic model was proposed and the relationships among the surface, internalized, and degraded radioactivities and cold chase time were calculated algebraically. The rate constants of dissociation, internalization, and degradation were calculated to be 8.28 x 10(-4), 4.30 x 10(-2), and 6.46 x 10(-3) min-1, respectively. The simulated theoretical values of surface, internalized, and degraded radioactivities were almost the same as our experimental data. The present results indicate that 131I-FSH bound to the cell-surface receptors internalizes into Sertoli cells and that the degraded products are instantaneously released from the cells as [131I]monoiodotyrosine. The intracellular processes may be subdivided into 1) translocation, 2) net degradation of internalized hormone in the lysosomes, and 3) release of degraded hormone mainly as [131I]monoiodotyrosine. The rate-limiting step of these serial reactions was in the degradation of 131I-FSH, which consisted of a few substeps."
https://openalex.org/W1531379526,"Abstract Platelet-activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (AGEPC)) is a potent lipid mediator which stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis, causes hepatic vasoconstriction, and stimulates the production of cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid, primarily prostaglandin (PG) D2 in the perfused liver. Following infusion of platelet-activating factor (1 nM) in the perfused rat liver the production of PGD2, measured in the effluent perfusate, increased 4-fold after only 2 min. Infusion of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (50 microM), abolished the stimulated production of PGD2 and thromboxane B2 in response to AGEPC without significantly affecting the hepatic glycogenolytic or vasoconstrictive responses to AGEPC. Contrary to previous reports, these observations do not support the suggestion that cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites mediate directly either the glycogenolytic or the vasoactive effects of AGEPC in the perfused rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1654820388,"Abstract Equilibrium dialysis and isothermal microcalorimetry experiments have been carried out to characterize the thermodynamics of the binding of AMP to glycogen phosphorylase b (EC 2.4.1.1) at pH 6.9 over the temperature range of 25-35 degrees C. Thermal titrations were performed at each temperature in various buffer systems, which have afforded the calculation of the number of protons exchanged when the AMP binds to each site in the protein. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained for the binding of AMP to the two nucleotide and the two inhibitor sites of the dimeric enzyme. The former show positive cooperativity while the latter behave as independent binding sites. A positive delta Cp value was obtained for the AMP binding to the two N sites (1.3 and 1.4 kJ K-1 mol-1), while the delta Cp was negative for the binding to the I sites (-1.9 kJ K-1 mol-1). The application of Sturtevant's method to our data (Sturtevant, J. M. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 2236-2240) and their comparison with a similar analysis undertaken with phosphorylase a (Mateo, P. L., Gonzalez, J. F., Baron, C., Lopez-Mayorga, O., and Cortijo, M. (1986) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1555519079,"Abstract Previous studies demonstrated that phorbol esters and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulated phosphatidylcholine synthesis via protein kinase C in GH3 pituitary cells (Kolesnick, R. N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14525-14530). Since phosphatidylcholine may serve as the precursor for sphingomyelin synthesis, studies were performed to assess the effect of protein kinase C on sphingomyelin synthesis. The potent phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), stimulated time- and concentration-dependent incorporation of 32Pi into the head group of sphingomyelin in cells short term labeled with 32Pi and resuspended in medium without radiolabel. TPA (10(-7) M) increased incorporation at a rate 1.4-fold of control after 2 h; EC50 congruent to 2 x 10(-9) M TPA. This correlated closely to TPA-induced phosphatidylcholine synthesis; EC50 congruent to 9 x 10(-10) M TPA. TRH (10(-7) M), which activates protein kinase C via a receptor-mediated mechanism, similarly stimulated 32Pi incorporation into sphingomyelin at a rate 1.5-fold of control; EC50 congruent to 5 x 10(-10) M TRH. This correlated closely with TRH-induced phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol synthesis; EC50 congruent to 2 x 10(-10) and 1.5 x 10(-10) M TRH, respectively. In cells short term labeled with [3H]palmitate, TRH induced a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in the level of [3H]ceramide and a quantitative increase in the level of [3H]sphingomyelin. Compositional analysis of the incorporated [3H]palmitate revealed that TRH increased radiolabel into both the sphingoid base and the fatty acid moieties of sphingomyelin. Similarly, TRH increased incorporation of [3H] serine into sphingomyelin to 145 +/- 8% of control after 3 h. TPA also stimulated these events. Like the effect of TRH on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, TRH-induced sphingomyelin synthesis was abolished in cells down-modulated for protein kinase C. In contrast, TRH-induced phosphatidylinositol synthesis still occurred in these cells. These studies suggest that protein kinase C stimulates coordinate synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. This is the first report of stimulation of sphingomyelin synthesis via a cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1530938755,"Abstract Random in vitro mutagenesis of a cloned Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 beta-lactamase II gene was used to select defective genes unable to confer ampicillin or cephalosporin C resistance to Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing of mutant genes identified histidine at position 28 as important to beta-lactamase II function. In addition, the isolation of six identical frameshift mutants established that the carboxyl-terminal end of beta-lactamase II is critical for enzyme function. Random mutagenesis also revealed that His88 (implicated previously as one of 4 residues acting as a zinc ligand) is crucial to enzymatic activity and that a glycine to glutamic acid substitution at position 148 produced a defective beta-lactamase. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis directed at Glu37 and Glu212 suggests that these residues are inconsequential to enzyme function but that histidine at position 28 may be involved in substrate binding or recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1503285491,"Abstract Myxococcus xanthus, a myxobacterium, contains a peculiar branched RNA-linked DNA called msDNA. Reverse transcriptase has been shown to be required for the production of msDNA. Existence of proteins that bind to one of the two msDNAs in M. xanthus, msDNA.Mx162, was examined by gel retardation assays. Total cell-free extract yielded two distinct retarded bands. Both bands were sensitive to treatment with proteinase K, indicating that there is a protein(s) that is able to bind to msDNA. Further, the formation of the bands was inhibited by the addition of nonradioactive msDNA but not by a large excess of poly(dA) in the presence of a 5000-fold excess of poly(dI.dC).poly(dI.dC). In vivo footprinting using dimethyl sulfate revealed that the deoxynucleotide stretch from 60 to 161 is protected. When a M. xanthus cell lysate was centrifuged in a 16-30% glycerol gradient, msDNA was found to sediment in two peaks: a major peak corresponding in size to 14 S, and a minor one at 5 S. These results indicate that msDNA.Mx162 exists as a complex with specific proteins in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1561746220,"We have examined the region surrounding codon 12 in the human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene in vitro to determine the reaction intensities at the guanine nucleotides after exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, to one of its human metabolites aflatoxin M1, to dimethyl sulfate, and to the major ultimate carcinogen of benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide. Among the adducts produced, those at N-7-guanyl sites are alkali-labile and can be identified using a variation of the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing procedure. Data indicate that the guanine nucleotides of codon 12 have above average potential for adduct formation by the genotoxins when compared to other guanine sites, but were not the strongest sites. This codon 12 region has been inserted into single-stranded M13 phage, exposed to several of the genotoxins, and used as a template for DNA synthesis in vitro. There is a sequence-specific variation in polymerase inhibition at various adducted nucleotide sites, but replication blocks are not preferentially seen at the carcinogen-adducted guanines of codon 12. These results indicate that the predominance of point mutations which are detected in vivo at codon 12 do not reflect sequence-mediated preferential susceptibility of these sites to initial DNA adduction or to replication errors. The mechanisms controlling these sequence effects are not currently understood, and attempts to predict relative alkylation or termination frequencies based solely on local DNA sequence are not reliable."

https://openalex.org/W1646610592,"Abstract We have reacted acrolein with human carbonic anhydrase II using conditions reported to result in maximal formylethylation of exposed histidine and lysine residues (Pocker, Y., and Janjic, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6169-6176). Pocker and Janjic proposed that the decrease by 95-98% in the steady-state turnover number for the hydration of CO2 caused by this chemical modification is due predominantly to the alkylation of one residue, the imidazole side chain of histidine 64. We measured the rate of 18O exchange between CO2 and water catalyzed by these enzymes at chemical equilibrium using membrane inlet mass spectrometry. The catalyzed rate of interconversion of CO2 and HCO3- at chemical equilibrium was the same for the acrolein-modified and the unmodified carbonic anhydrases, but the rate of release of 18O-labeled water from the active site had decreased by as much as 85% for the acrolein-modified enzyme. The 18O-exchange kinetics catalyzed by the acrolein-modified carbonic anhydrase II was similar to that catalyzed by a mutant human carbonic anhydrase II in which histidine at residue 64 was replaced with alanine. Moreover, modification of this mutant carbonic anhydrase II with acrolein did not alter to a significant extent its 18O-exchange pattern. These results support the proposal of Pocker and Janjic and the suggested role of histidine 64 in carbonic anhydrase II as a proton shuttle residue that transfers a proton from zinc-bound water to buffer in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1578204532,"Abstract Previous work has shown that when Vero cells with surface-bound diphtheria toxin are exposed to low pH, toxin entry across the plasma membrane is induced and that this entry involves two steps, insertion of the B-fragment of the toxin into the membrane and translocation of the enzymatically active A-fragment to the cytosol. Here we have studied the role of permeant anions in this process. It was found that when the B-fragment was inserted into the membrane, part of it, a 25-kDa polypeptide, was shielded from externally added Pronase. This insertion did not require permeant anions. The translocation of the A-fragment was monitored by measuring either its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in the cells or the appearance of radioactively labeled 21-kDa fragment after treatment of the cells with externally applied Pronase. The translocation of the A-fragment was dependent on the presence of permeant anions in the medium. However, when the cells were depleted of Cl- by incubation in Cl- free buffer at high pH, translocation of the A-fragment did not require permeant anions in the medium. The possibility that translocation of the A-fragment is inhibited by an outward directed chloride gradient rather than by the absence of chloride is discussed."
