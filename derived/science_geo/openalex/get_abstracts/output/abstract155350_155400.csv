https://openalex.org/W1993655108,"Surface expression of GABA(B) receptors requires heterodimerization of GB1 and GB2 subunits, but little is known about mechanisms that ensure efficient heterodimer assembly. We found that expression of the GB1 subunit on the cell surface is prevented through a C-terminal retention motif RXR(R); this sequence is reminiscent of the ER retention/retrieval motif RKR identified in subunits of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. Interaction of GB1 and GB2 through their C-terminal coiled-coil alpha helices masks the retention signal in GB1, allowing the plasma membrane expression of the assembled complexes. Because individual GABA(B) receptor subunits and improperly assembled receptor complexes are not functional even if expressed on the cell surface, we conclude that a trafficking checkpoint ensures efficient assembly of functional GABA(B) receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2115168491,"Experience-dependent plasticity in somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortex involves rapid depression of responses to a deprived sensory input (a closed eye or a trimmed whisker). Such depression occurs first in layer II/III and may reflect plasticity at vertical inputs from layer IV to layer II/III pyramids. Here, I describe a timing-based, associative form of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) at this synapse in S1. LTP occurred when excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) led single postsynaptic action potentials (APs) within a narrow temporal window, and LTD occurred when APs led EPSPs within a significantly broader window. This long LTD window is unusual among timing-based learning rules and causes EPSPs that are uncorrelated with postsynaptic APs to become depressed. This behavior suggests a simple model for depression of deprived sensory responses in S1 and V1."
https://openalex.org/W2146367411,"We recorded from single neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) of rats to investigate the role of these structures in navigation and memory representation. Our results revealed two novel phenomena: first, many cells in CA1 and the EC fired at significantly different rates when the animal was in the same position depending on where the animal had come from or where it was going. Second, cells in deep layers of the EC, the targets of hippocampal outputs, appeared to represent the similarities between locations on spatially distinct trajectories through the environment. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus represents the animal's position in the context of a trajectory through space and that the EC represents regularities across different trajectories that could allow for generalization across experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2139474686,"Mice that are mutant for Reelin or Dab1, or doubly mutant for the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), show disorders of cerebral cortical lamination. How Reelin and its receptors regulate laminar organization of cerebral cortex is unknown. We show that Reelin inhibits migration of cortical neurons and enables detachment of neurons from radial glia. Recombinant and native Reelin associate with alpha3beta1 integrin, which regulates neuron-glia interactions and is required to achieve proper laminar organization. The effect of Reelin on cortical neuronal migration in vitro and in vivo depends on interactions between Reelin and alpha3beta1 integrin. Absence of alpha3beta1 leads to a reduction of Dab1, a signaling protein acting downstream of Reelin. Thus, Reelin may arrest neuronal migration and promote normal cortical lamination by binding alpha3beta1 integrin and modulating integrin-mediated cellular adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2092326283,"Time-lapse microscopy, retrospective immunohistochemistry, and cultured hippocampal neurons were used to determine the time frame of individual glutamatergic synapse assembly and the temporal order in which specific molecules accumulate at new synaptic junctions. New presynaptic boutons capable of activity-evoked vesicle recycling were observed to form within 30 min of initial axodendritic contact. Clusters of the presynaptic active zone protein Bassoon were present in all new boutons. Conversely, clusters of the postsynaptic molecule SAP90/PSD-95 and glutamate receptors were found on average only approximately 45 min after such boutons were first detected. AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors displayed similar clustering kinetics. These findings suggest that glutamatergic synapse assembly can occur within 1-2 hr after initial contact and that presynaptic differentiation may precede postsynaptic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1964330366,"Compartmentalization of glutamate receptors with the signaling enzymes that regulate their activity supports synaptic transmission. Two classes of binding proteins organize these complexes: the MAGUK proteins that cluster glutamate receptors and AKAPs that anchor kinases and phosphatases. In this report, we demonstrate that glutamate receptors and PKA are recruited into a macromolecular signaling complex through direct interaction between the MAGUK proteins, PSD-95 and SAP97, and AKAP79/150. The SH3 and GK regions of the MAGUKs mediate binding to the AKAP. Cell-based studies indicate that phosphorylation of AMPA receptors is enhanced by a SAP97-AKAP79 complex that directs PKA to GluR1 via a PDZ domain interaction. As AMPA receptor phosphorylation is implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity, these data suggest that a MAGUK-AKAP complex may be centrally involved."
https://openalex.org/W1977172528,"We report the subcellular localization of enzymes involved in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphatidylserine synthase-1 (PSS1) is highly enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and is largely excluded from the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Taking advantage of the substrate specificity of PSS1, we showed that (i) MAM contain choline exchange activity, whereas this activity is very low in the bulk of the ER, (ii) serine exchange activity is inhibited by choline to a much greater extent in MAM than in ER, and (iii) MAM use phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as substrates for phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, whereas the ER utilizes only phosphatidylethanolamine. According to immunoblotting of proteins from both CHO-K1 cells and murine liver, PSS1 is localized to MAM, and in hepatoma cells stably expressing PSS1 this protein is highly enriched in MAM. Since the ER contains serine and ethanolamine exchange activities, we had predicted that PSS2 would account for the serine exchange activity in the ER. Unexpectedly, using immunoblotting experiments, we found that (i) PSS2 of CHO-K1 cells is present only in MAM and (ii) PSS2 is restricted to MAM of McArdle cells expressing recombinant PSS2. These data leave open the question of which enzyme imparts PSS activity to the ER and suggest that a third isoform of PSS might be located in the ER.

Upon closer examination, however, some of these enzyme activities are found to be present in additional cellular locations such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, or mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) (3Vance J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 423-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MAM are ER-like membranes that co-isolate with mitochondria but can be separated from the latter by centrifugation of crude mitochondria on a Percoll gradient (1Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAM have many, but not all, properties of the ER (1Vance J.E. J. Biol.

In particular, MAM are enriched, compared with the bulk of ER, in several lipid biosynthetic enzyme activities, such as acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (2Rusiñol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H.

Smith T.K. Baumann N.A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15203-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS). The specific activity of PSS is typically 2–4-fold higher in MAM than in ER (1Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rusiñol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unique protein marker for MAM is PtdEtn N-methyltransferase-2 (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an isoform of the enzyme that converts PtdEtn to phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) in liver (6Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although ER and MAM contain similar specific activities for PtdEtn methylation, an antibody generated against PtdEtnN-methyltransferase-2 recognizes a protein in MAM that is not detectable in the ER (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that two isoforms of PtdEtn N-methyltransferase exist; one is specifically located in MAM and excluded from the ER, whereas the other is presumably responsible for the phospholipid methylation activity in the ER. The function of MAM has not been firmly established, but an attractive hypothesis is that MAM are involved in the import of PtdSer into mitochondria via a membrane collision-based mechanism (1Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, essentially all mitochondrial PtdEtn is produced from decarboxylation of imported PtdSer (7Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAM appear to be associated with contact sites between mitochondrial inner and outer membranes (8Ardail D. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7978-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ardail D. Gasnier F. Lerme F. Simonot C. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two PtdSer synthases with distinct substrate specificities have been identified in mammalian cells. Each catalyzes a base exchange reaction between serine and preexisting phospholipids. The existence of two isoforms of PSS was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of two distinct PSS cDNAs encoding PSS1 and PSS2 that share limited (32%) sequence identity (10Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PSS1 and PSS2 both catalyze serine exchange activity, whereas only PSS1, and not PSS2, catalyzes choline exchange (11Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In CHO-K1 cells expressing either only PSS1 or only PSS2, PSS1 uses almost exclusively PtdCho as the donor of the phosphatidyl group, whereas PSS2 uses only PtdEtn (12Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reason why PSS1 can use both PtdEtn and PtdCho in in vitro enzymatic assays but only PtdCho in intact cells is not clear. We now report the subcellular localization of the two PSS isoforms, PSS1 and PSS2. Previous immunoblotting studies of CHO cells by Saitoet al. (13Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Letts. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) detected PSS1 in microsomes as well as in MAM. However, since microsomes contain MAM, as well as ER and other organelle membranes, these studies did not exclude the possibility that the microsomal PSS1 was contributed by MAM alone and was absent from the ER per se. On the basis of our previous findings that both MAM and the ER contain PSS activity, we hypothesized that the two PSS isoforms might be present in spatially distinct locations in the cell, with one isoform being located in MAM and the other in the ER. We demonstrate that PSS1 protein is found exclusively in MAM and is not detectable in the ER. In addition, and contrary to our predictions, we found that PSS2 is also restricted to MAM. These findings leave open the question of which PtdSer biosynthetic enzyme is responsible for serine exchange activity in the ER and suggest that this activity might be due to a third, presently unknown, PtdSer synthase isoform. CHO-K1 cells and McArdle rat hepatoma 7777 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture collection (Manassas, VA). Fetal bovine serum, horse serum, tissue culture media, and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The radiochemicals [3-3H]serine, [1-3H]ethanolamine, and [methyl-3H]choline were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bovine pancreatic trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher. M.9.1.1 cells (a gift from Dr. D. R. Voelker, National Jewish Research Center, Denver, CO), CHO-K1 cells, and McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells were maintained as described previously (14Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Anti-PSS1 and anti-PSS2 antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. M. Nishijima (National Institute of Health, Japan). These antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 1–17 of PSS1 from CHO-K1 cells and amino acids 458–474 of PSS2 from CHO-K1 cells. The rabbit anti-rat protein-disulfide isomerase polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. M. Michalak (University of Alberta) (15Baksh S. Burns K. Andrin C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31338-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Anti-mycantibody was obtained from clone 9E10 hybridoma tissue culture supernatant and used directly for immunoblotting experiments. The rabbit anti-rat PtdEtn N-methyltransferase-2 polyclonal antibody, generated against a C-terminal dodecapeptide of PtdEtnN-methyltransferase-2, was provided by Dr. D. E. Vance (University of Alberta) (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-rat calnexin polyclonal antibody was from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). The myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was appended to the 5′-end of murine PSS1 cDNA (14Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and either the 5′- or 3′-end of murine PSS2 cDNA (16Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction. Amyc-PSS1 mutant was generated by deleting the last two codons (encoding two lysine residues) of murine PSS1 cDNA. The cDNA fragments were sequenced by the DNA core facility at the University of Alberta to confirm the modifications. Each of the cDNAs encoding myc-PSS1, myc-PSS1 with two C-terminal lysine residues deleted (myc-PSS1:ΔcKK), andmyc-PSS2 with the myc tag appended to either the N terminus (N-myc-PSS2) or the C terminus (C-myc-PSS2) was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). McArdle rat hepatoma cell lines were transfected with 10 μg of the cDNAs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. Individual colonies were isolated. When cell lines had been established, the concentration of G418 was reduced to 200 μg/ml. Control cells for experiments with McArdle cells were transfected with the expression vector lacking a cDNA insert. McArdle cells (80% confluent) expressing myc-PSS1 and C-myc-PSS2 were diluted 1:10 with fresh medium and plated on coverslips in 100-mm dishes and then allowed to attach overnight. Cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature and then preincubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 1 h. The cells were incubated with a mixture of anti-myc (1:10 dilution) and anti-rat calnexin (1:250 dilution) antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 1 h. After five washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v), cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution)) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 30 min. The cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) and then mounted on microscope slides in phenylenediamine mounting medium and processed for confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope). Microsomes, MAM, and mitochondria were isolated from cultured cells by slight modifications of a method previously described (7Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 8 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)). The cells were gently disrupted by 15 up-and-down strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem motor-driven homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 600 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,300 × g for 10 min to pellet crude mitochondria. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor at 4 °C to pellet microsomes, which were resuspended in homogenization buffer. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of isolation medium (250 mm mannitol, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mm EGTA) and layered on top of 8 ml of Percoll medium (225 mm mannitol, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, and 30% Percoll (v/v)) in a 10-ml polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and then centrifuged for 30 min at 95,000 ×g. A dense band containing purified mitochondria was recovered from approximately ¾ down the tube. The mitochondrial band was removed, diluted with isolation medium, and washed twice by centrifugation at 6300 × g for 10 min to remove the Percoll, after which the mitochondria were resuspended in isolation medium. MAM were removed from the Percoll gradient as the diffuse white band located above the mitochondria. Isolation medium was added, and the suspension was centrifuged at 6300 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant containing MAM was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor, and the resulting MAM pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. MAM and mitochondria were isolated from murine liver as described previously for rat liver (1Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ER fractions enriched in rough ER (ER1) and smooth ER (ER2) were prepared by the method of Croze and Morre (18Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as modified by Vance and Vance (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ER1 was isolated from the final discontinuous sucrose gradient at the interface between sucrose solutions of 1.5 and 2.0 m. ER2 was isolated from the same gradient at the interface between sucrose solutions of 1.3 and 1.5m. PtdSer synthase activity was measured in subcellular fractions of mouse liver as described previously (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells were scraped from 100-mm dishes and disrupted by sonication (2 × 10 s) with a probe sonicator in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.25m sucrose. Lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 600 × g to pellet cellular debris, and PSS activity was measured in the supernatant in the presence of 10 mmcalcium using [3-3H]serine (50 μCi/μmol), [1-3H]ethanolamine (20 μCi/μmol), or [methyl-3H]choline (10 μCi/μmol) as substrates (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, as indicated, unlabeled choline or ethanolamine was added to the reaction mixture to final concentrations of 0.5, 5, or 50 mm at pH 7.4. 100 μl of 50 mm PtdCho or PtdEtn dissolved in chloroform were evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2. The phospholipid residue was resuspended in 0.04% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 7 mm, incubated on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing, and then sonicated until the solution cleared. PtdCho or PtdEtn (60 μl of solution) was added to each PSS assay to a final concentration of 2 mm. An aliquot of ER membranes or MAM was incubated with trypsin (ratio of membrane protein to trypsin, 2:1 (w/w)) at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of trypsin inhibitor (40 mg/ml). Treated membranes were diluted in isolation medium, and 25 μg of protein from each fraction was used for the PSS assay. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in ice-cold 62.5 mm boric acid (pH 8.0) at 60 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in T-TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h with one antibody (anti-PSS1 (1:2500 dilution), anti-PSS2 (1:2500 dilution), anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (1:1000 dilution), or anti-myc (1:50 dilution) antibody) in T-TBS containing 5% (w/v) milk. The membranes were subsequently washed with T-TBS containing 5% (w/v) milk and then incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for PSS1, PSS2 or protein-disulfide isomerase (1:10,000 dilution), or goat anti-mouse IgG for myc (1:10,000 dilution). Membranes were washed with T-TBS containing 5% (w/v) milk, and bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have previously shown that serine exchange activity is present in the ER and is relatively enriched in MAM (1Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rusiñol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first approach to determining the subcellular locations of PSS1 and PSS2, we compared the substrate specificities for base exchange in subcellular fractions by assessing the ability of unlabeled choline or ethanolamine to inhibit serine exchange activity. Since PSS1 exchanges all three bases (serine, choline, and ethanolamine) in in vitro assays, unlabeled choline and ethanolamine would be expected to compete with radiolabeled serine in a serine exchange assay (11Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, since PSS2 catalyzes the exchange of serine and ethanolamine, but not choline, one would expect that ethanolamine, but not choline, would compete with radiolabeled serine in the in vitro serine exchange assay. The addition of 5 mm ethanolamine to the serine exchange assay mixture inhibited the serine exchange activity of the ER and MAM by 92 and 85%, respectively (Fig. 1). Although 0.5 and 5 mm choline inhibited the serine exchange activity in MAM by ∼40 and 70%, respectively, the serine exchange activity in the ER was not inhibited by 0.5 mm choline and inhibited only slightly, if at all, by 5 mm choline (Fig.1). Additional data presented below demonstrate that MAM also contain PSS2; therefore, one would not expect the serine exchange activity of MAM to be completely inhibited by choline. These observations suggest that choline exchange activity (i.e. PSS1) is primarily concentrated in the MAM, since the serine exchange activity was much more potently inhibited by choline in the MAM than in the ER. When the choline concentration was increased to 50 mm, inhibition of the serine exchange activity in the MAM increased to 83%, whereas the activity in the ER was inhibited by ∼40%. We found that 50 mm choline modestly inhibits the serine exchange activity in M.9.1.1 cells (which lack PSS1), by ∼20%. Kuge et al. (11Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in PSA3 cells (in which PSS1 is defective and choline exchange is <1% of that in parental CHO cells) 5 mm choline inhibited serine exchange activity by ∼20%. The partial inhibition by 50 mm choline of the serine exchange activity in the ER probably reflects a combination of some inhibition of PSS2 serine exchange activity by the very high concentration of choline and the presence of small amounts of PSS1 in the ER. In order to establish further the biochemical properties, subcellular locations, and topology of PSS1 and PSS2, ER and MAM were incubated with trypsin. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that trypsin proteolysis of ER membranes results in the loss of only ∼60% of serine exchange activity, whereas the same treatment inactivates another ER membrane protein, cholinephosphotransferase, by almost 100% (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choline, ethanolamine, and serine exchange activities were measured in ER and MAM that had been preincubated with or without trypsin. The data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that MAM contain choline exchange activity, whereas this activity is essentially absent from the ER, supporting the idea that PSS1 is localized to MAM, whereas the ER is almost devoid of PSS1. After proteolysis, the serine and choline exchange activities of MAM and ER were decreased by >80% (Fig. 2). In MAM, ∼85% of the ethanolamine exchange activity was inactivated by trypsin treatment. In contrast, the ethanolamine exchange activity of the ER was reduced by only 35%. As a positive control to confirm that the trypsin was proteolytically active, trypsin treatment under the same conditions reduced the PtdEtnN-methyltransferase activity by 96% in the ER and by 84% in MAM. The relative resistance of the ethanolamine exchange activity in the ER to proteolysis suggests that the PSS(s) responsible for ethanolamine exchange in the ER and MAM might be either structurally distinct or have different topological arrangements in the membrane. In addition to using the free bases for the base exchange reaction, PSS also uses phospholipids as substrates. PSS1 uses both PtdCho and PtdEtn, whereas PSS2 uses only PtdEtn (20Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serine exchange activity was measured in the ER and MAM with exogenously added PtdEtn and PtdCho in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100. Very little serine exchange activity was detected in membranes assayed in the absence of exogenously added phospholipid (Fig.3) because Triton X-100 inhibits the reaction (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdEtn stimulated the serine exchange activity of both ER and MAM, but the enzyme-specific activity was 39% less in the ER than in MAM (Fig. 3). In addition, PtdCho stimulated the serine exchange activity in MAM (by ∼18-fold) to a greater extent than in the ER (by ∼6-fold). A combination of the results presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 suggests that the bulk of PSS1, which is responsible for choline exchange activity, resides in MAM, whereas the ER contains little PSS1. In addition, ethanolamine exchange activity, which is contributed by both PSS1 and PSS2 in vitro, is present in both ER and MAM. These experiments do not, however, permit us to determine whether the ethanolamine exchange activity in the ER and MAM is contributed by PSS1 or PSS2. The subcellular localization of PSS1 and PSS2 was further investigated using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Amyc epitope tag was appended to the 5′-end of the cDNA encoding murine PSS1 and to the 3′-end of the cDNA encoding PSS2 (C-myc-PSS2), and the constructs were stably transfected into McArdle rat hepatoma cells. The localization of these proteins was compared with that of calnexin, a resident ER membrane chaperone protein, using double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with antibodies directed against the myc epitope and calnexin. Staining for calnexin showed a punctate pattern of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm, consistent with that expected for an ER protein (Fig. 4, B andE). No immunoreactivity was observed in cells from which the primary antibody had been omitted (data not shown). myc-PSS1 (Fig. 4 A) and C-myc-PSS2 (Fig. 4 D) showed similar staining patterns that were somewhat more diffuse than that of calnexin (Fig. 4, B and E). Overall, however, PSS1 and PSS2 extensively co-localized with each other and with the ER marker, calnexin (Figs. 4, C andF). We next determined by immunoblotting experiments if PSS1 protein was localized to MAM or was distributed throughout the ER. Proteins of MAM isolated from CHO-K1 and M.9.1.1 cells (mutant CHO cells defective in PSS1 activity) (20Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were immunoblotted with anti-PSS1 antibody. Fig.5 A shows that PSS1 was present in MAM of wild-type CHO-K1 cells but was not detectable in MAM of M.9.1.1 cells (Fig. 5 A). In addition, small amounts of PSS1 were detected in microsomes isolated from CHO-K1 cells but not in microsomes from M.9.1.1 cells (not shown). These results were as expected, since PSS1 activity is greatly reduced in M.9.1.1 cells (14Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,20Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and these cells also lack detectable PSS1 mRNA (16Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the report of Saito et al. (13Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Letts. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who showed that PSS1 was present in MAM and, to a lesser extent, in microsomes of CHO-K1 cells. Microsomes are ER-enriched membranes that in addition to ER contain other organelle membranes including MAM. Consequently, the possibility existed that the presence of PSS1 in microsomes was due to MAM rather than the bulk of the ER. We therefore isolated MAM, mitochondria, and two membrane fractions highly enriched in ER from murine liver (18Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar): ER1, which is enriched in rough ER, and ER2, which is enriched in smooth ER. Immunoblotting with anti-PSS1 antibody showed that PSS1 is localized to MAM (Fig. 5 B); neither ER1 nor ER2 contained any detectable PSS1 protein (Fig. 5 B). Included in Fig.5 B are immunoblots of the same membrane proteins probed with an antibody directed against rat liver PtdEtnN-methyltransferase-2, a specific marker protein for MAM (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to PSS1, and in agreement with previous observations (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PtdEtn methyltransferase-2 was present in MAM but was absent from ER1 and ER2 (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that the ER1 and ER2 fractions were indeed derived from the ER, the membrane proteins were also immunoblotted with an antibody directed against protein-disulfide isomerase, a resident ER protein. Protein-disulfide isomerase immunoreactivity was observed in ER1, ER2, and MAM and was absent from mitochondria (Fig. 5 B), confirming that ER1 and ER2 are derived from the ER. These immunoblotting data demonstrate that in murine liver PSS1 resides in MAM but is undetectable in the ER and suggest that the PSS1 detected in microsomes of CHO-K1 cells was due to MAM being a constituent of the microsomal preparation. One possible explanation for the apparent absence of PSS1 from the ER is that proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus of PSS1 occurs, generating a truncated protein that would not be recognized upon immunoblotting with the antibody used (the data in Fig. 5 were generated using an antibody directed against a peptide consisting of amino acids 1–17 of PSS1 from CHO-K1 cells). Therefore, if the ER had contained an isoform of PSS1 that lacked this N-terminal epitope, no immunoreactive protein would have been detected in the ER. However, this scenario is unlikely because Saito et al. (13Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Letts. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) previously examined the subcellular location of PSS1 in CHO cells using two different antibodies, one directed against a peptide close to the N terminus (amino acids 4–18) of PSS1 and the other directed against a peptide close to the C terminus (amino acids 447–463). Immunoreactive PSS1 protein with a molecular mass of 42 kDa was detected in membrane fractions of CHO cells using either antibody, suggesting that neither the N nor the C terminus of PSS1 in the membranes had been cleaved. In this study by Saito et al., the immunoreactive protein exhibited an anomalously low apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis compared with the size predicted from the cDNA sequence (55.3 kDa). This atypical behavior of PSS1 upon electrophoresis was attributed to the exceptionally high content of hydrophobic amino acids in PSS1 (13Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Letts. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PSS1 detected in our immunoblotting studies, using an antibody directed against the N terminus of PSS1 (amino acids 1–17), also has an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. In addition, data presented in Fig.6, in which myc-tagged PSS1 was expressed in McArdle hepatoma cells and detected by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody, also support the conclusion that PSS1 is highly enriched in the MAM but undetectable in the ER. Moreover, the observation that the ER contains little choline exchange activity (Fig. 2) supports the conclusion that PSS1 is highly enriched in MAM and is largely absent from the ER. However, the possibility that an N-terminally truncated isoform of PSS1 is present in the ER, which would not have been detected by our immunoblotting experiments, cannot be discounted. PSS1 contains two lysine residues at the carboxyl terminus of PSS1 (residues 472 and 473, i.e. -KK-COOH) (14Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This motif is similar to that of reported ER-targeting consensus sequences (-KXKXX-COOH or -XXKKXX-COOH) (22Schutze M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 24Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Since the results presented in Fig. 5 show that PSS1 is highly enriched in MAM, we hypothesized that the KK motif might be required for targeting PSS1 to MAM. The MAM marker protein, PtdEtn N-methyltransferase, similarly contains a highly positively charged C-terminal sequence (-RRKATRLHKRS-COOH) (5Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore generated a cDNA encoding a mutant form of murine PSS1 in which the two lysine residues at positions 472 and 473 were deleted (this mutant is designated as PSS1:ΔcKK). In addition, a myc epitope tag was appended to the N terminus of PSS1 and PSS1:ΔcKK, and the cDNA constructs were stably expressed in McArdle rat hepatoma cells. To confirm that these modifications did not affect the activity of the expressed PSS1 protein, serine exchange activity was measured in cellular lysates. Fig. 6 A shows that the expressed myc-PSS1 and the deletion mutant, myc-PSS1:ΔcKK, possessed approximately equal serine exchange activities, at levels ∼5-fold higher than in cells transfected with empty expression vector. Immunoblotting of cellular lysates with anti-myc antibody confirmed that the transfected cells also expressed approximately equal amounts of the two recombinant myc-tagged proteins (apparent molecular mass 42 kDa) (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether or not the C-terminal lysine residues at positions 472 and 473 of PSS1 were required for the targeting of PSS1 to MAM, subcellular fractions (MAM, microsomes, and mitochondria) were isolated from the transfected cells, and immunoblotting experiments were performed using anti-mycantibody. In cells expressing either myc-PSS1 ormyc-PSS1:ΔcKK, the majority of recombinant PSS1 protein was found in MAM. Both proteins were also present at lower levels in microsomes but were absent from mitochondria (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, deletion of the lysines at positions 472 and 473 did not hinder the targeting of PSS1 to MAM. Moreover, themyc-tagged PSS1 was predominantly located in the MAM. Since the preceding data demonstrated that PSS1 was undetectable in the ER but was highly enriched in the MAM, we hypothesized that the serine and ethanolamine exchange activities in the ER would be imparted by PSS2. Support for the idea that the ER contains PSS2 comes from the observations that (i) the serine exchange activity in the ER is robustly stimulated by PtdEtn (Fig. 3), (ii) the ER contains ethanolamine exchange activity (Fig. 2), and (iii) serine exchange activity of the ER is inhibited by ethanolamine (Fig. 1). Microsomes, MAM, and mitochondria were isolated from CHO-K1 cells, and the proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of PSS2 from CHO cells. Fig.7 shows the unexpected result that although PSS2 was abundant in MAM, little immunoreactive PSS2 (M r ∼52 kDa) was detectable in microsomes from CHO cells. Unfortunately, the anti-PSS2 antibody, which is directed against a peptide sequence of PSS2 from CHO cells, does not cross-react with murine liver PSS2, and all of our attempts to generate an anti-murine PSS2 antibody have been unsuccessful. Therefore, as an alternative approach to confirm that PSS2 is present primarily in MAM, we generated McArdle cells stably expressing murine PSS2 containing a C-terminalmyc tag. In these cells, the serine exchange activity (specific activity 5.1 nmol/h/mg of protein) was ∼7-fold higher than in control cells transfected with empty vector (specific activity 0.69 nmol/h/mg of protein). Immunoblotting of cellular lysates with anti-myc antibody confirmed that C-myc-PSS2 protein was expressed in the McArdle cells (Fig.8 A), as indicated by the presence of an ∼52-kDa immunoreactive protein that was absent from cells transfected with empty vector alone. Subcellular fractions (microsomes, MAM, and mitochondria) were prepared from C-myc-PSS2-expressing cells and control cells, and proteins were immunoblotted with anti-myc antibody. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 7 for CHO cells, C-myc-PSS2 was abundant in MAM but was undetectable in microsomes and mitochondria (Fig. 8 B). We considered the possibility that the apparent absence of PSS2 from the ER according to immunoblotting (Fig. 8) was the result of proteolytic cleavage of the myc epitope from the C terminus of the protein in the ER. This possibility was investigated by expression of a cDNA encoding PSS2 with a myc tag appended to the N terminus in McArdle cells. N-myc-PSS2 protein was also detected in the MAM but not in microsomes by immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody (data not shown). Since N-myc-PSS2 and C-myc-PSS2 were similarly localized to the MAM, the presence of the myc tag clearly did not affect their subcellular targeting. The lack of immunoreactive PSS2 in the ER was probably not due to proteolytic cleavage of either the N or C terminus to generate a truncated PSS2. The data do not, however, eliminate the possibility that a truncated isoform of PSS2, from which both the N and C termini have been proteolytically cleaved, is present in the ER, but to our knowledge there are no known examples of such proteins in the ER. We therefore conclude that both PSS1 and PSS2 are highly enriched in the MAM but are largely excluded from the ER. The studies presented herein show that full-length PSS1 and PSS2 are localized almost exclusively to MAM and are largely excluded from the bulk of the ER. However, the possibility that truncated isoforms of these proteins are present in the ER cannot be completely eliminated. The reason why both PSS1 and PSS2 are so highly enriched in MAM is not clear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that nearly all mitochondrial PtdEtn is derived from imported PtdSer (7Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible explanation for the localization of the two PtdSer synthases in MAM is that a robust synthesis of PtdSer at this site, in close proximity to mitochondrial outer membranes, would provide an efficient mechanism for the import of newly synthesized PtdSer into mitochondria for decarboxylation to PtdEtn. The findings of the present study, however, leave open the question of which protein is responsible for the serine and ethanolamine exchange activities in the ER. Saito et al. (12Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have used a CHO-K1 cell line, PSA-3, which is defective in PSS1, to generate a mutant cell line, PSB-2. The PSB-2 cells are defective in both PSS1 and PSS2 and contain essentially no choline exchange activity. The ethanolamine and serine exchange activities of PSB-2 cells are reduced to 4.8 and 11.5%, respectively, of those in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. It is possible that the residual base exchange activity detected in PSB-2 cells is contributed by a putative “ER isoform” of PSS, which, as indicated by our trypsin proteolysis experiments, might have a different structure and/or a different topological arrangement in the ER membranes compared with PSS1 and PSS2 in the MAM."

Although arsenic can be rapidly cleared from the body, the factors that control its transport into bile and feces are largely unknown. Previous studies of the clearance of inorganic arsenic have demonstrated the presence of arsenite, arsenate, monomethyl arsonic acid (MMA),1 and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA) in feces and urine (10Yoshida K. Inoue Y. Hua Chen K. Shoji Fukushima H.W. Endo G. J. Toxicol. Env. Health. 1998; 54: 179-192Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Morel G. Cluet J.L. Telolahy P. Yang H.M. Thieffry N. deCeauriz J. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 78: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but these studies have not illuminated the molecular basis for transport or the nature of the transported products. GSH has been suggested to be important as an intracellular reductant for arsenic methylation and in arsenic transport (12Zakharyan R.A. Aposhian H.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Aposhian H.V. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14Gyurasics A.

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2/cMOAT) is highly expressed in the bile canaliculus of hepatocytes and mediates hepatobiliary transport of many organic compounds including GSH (16Paulusma C.C.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the transport of arsenic and its methylated derivatives might depend on the formation of arsenic-GSH complexes and their transport by MRP2/cMOAT. This idea is supported by recent work in cultured cells and lower eukaryotes (Caenorhabditis elegans) that demonstrates arsenic transport by multidrug resistance-associated proteins (20Broeks A. Gerrard B. Allikmets R. Dean M. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6132-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Rats (Rattus norvegicus) (Wistar; Harlan, Houston, TX) or TR− rats (on a Wistar background originally obtained from Dr. Oude Elferink of the Academic Medical Center, Department of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (6–8 weeks of age) were anesthetized (Ketamine/Acepromazine/xylazine 25:1:1, 1 ml/kg), and the common bile duct was cannulated with a 22-gauge needle attached to polyethylene tubing (PE-10), the distal end of which flowed into an Eppendorf tube resting on a small pad of dry ice. Sodium arsenite (Fisher), MMA (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), and DMA (Aldrich) solutions in deionized distilled water were administered intravenously via the tail vein or orally at the doses indicated in the text. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (10 mmol/kg) (Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally 4 h prior to bile duct cannulation, and rats were maintained on water containing 20 mm BSO until anesthetized. All procedures followed guidelines established by the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. The synthesis of ATG, MADG, and DMAG was carried out according to previously published procedures (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,22Cullen W.R. Mcbride B.C. Reglinski J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 21: 179-194Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric amounts of GSH and the respective arsenic species were mixed, and the reaction was carried out for 12 h under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The experimental conditions for each of the arsenic-GSH complexes are as follows: ATG was prepared by dissolving sodium arsenite (0.129 g; 1 mmol) and GSH (0.921 g; 3 mmol) in 10 ml of degassed ultrapure water. At the end of the reaction, the ATG complex was precipitated with 40 ml of methanol, and the precipitate was filtered on a cellulose acetate membrane. Residual water was removed under reduced pressure without heating. Similarly, MADG was prepared by dissolving MMA (0.056 g, 0.4 mmol) and GSH (0.491 g, 1.6 mmol) in 2 ml of degassed ultrapure water and precipitating the product with ethanol. For DMAG preparation, DMA (0.138 g; 1 mmol) and GSH (0.921 g; 3 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of degassed ultrapure water, and at the end of the reaction the mixture was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure without heating. The resulting powder was extracted with cold methanol (20 ml × 4), and the extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness. The resulting powder was recrystallized from methanol/water (1:1), filtered, and dried. Bile samples from arsenic-treated rats were diluted with 1% nitric acid and were analyzed for arsenic content by ICP-MS (HP 4500). Arsenic content in the bile was quantified using a standard calibration curve of inorganic arsenic (SPEX, Metchen, NJ) with terbium as an internal standard. The detection limits of ICP-MS for arsenic ranged between 100 and 200 parts per trillion. Arsenic levels in bile samples were expressed as μg/ml bile. Mixtures of synthetic ATG, MADG, and DMAG were separated on reversed phase HPLC column (Aqua C18 75 × 2-mm column with a particle size of 3 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using 0.1% formic acid (pH 2.65) and an acetonitrile gradient (0–40%). The column effluent was analyzed by monitoring negative ions by ESI-MS (HP1100). Mass spectra of ATG run under SCAN mode revealed several major fragmented ions including molecular ion (m/z 992), whereas MADG and DMAG showed specific mass fragmentation with their corresponding molecular ions,m/z 701 and m/z 410, respectively (please see the legend for Fig. 2 for details on the fragmentation). Selected ion monitoring was used to quantify the arsenic-GSH complexes in bile samples. The concentrations of these complexes were calculated on the basis of external standard calibration curves generated using synthetic ATG, MADG, and DMAG. In addition, the relative concentrations of arsenic in these complexes were analyzed by fractionating (20 s fractions) the bile sample on an LC column and analyzing the arsenic content by ICP-MS to compare the arsenic levels in these complexes with total arsenic in the bile. The data are presented as either total arsenic or arsenic present in these arsenic-glutathione complexes (ATG and MADG) per ml of bile. We also spiked bile samples with synthetic complexes to investigate their stability in bile. During these studies we found that MADG and DMAG were stable in bile (pH 8.0) with half-lives of ∼40 min, whereas ATG was found to have a half-life of 20 min. For this reason, we have collected bile samples at 2-min intervals (i.e. 18- 20 min after intravenous administration of arsenic), and the bile samples were immediately used for the analysis of arsenic-GSH complexes by LC-MS. To determine the arsenic content in these complexes, a portion of this bile sample was fractionated using LC (20-s intervals), and the fractions were analyzed for total arsenic by ICP-MS. The structures of arsenic-GSH complexes were further characterized by using a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer according to previously published methods (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 22Cullen W.R. Mcbride B.C. Reglinski J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 21: 179-194Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). 1H NMR data on GSH and its complexes with arsenic were collected at 25 °C with a sweep width of 6068 Hz and a preacquisition delay of 5 s. 1 Hz broadening was applied before Fourier transformation. Arsenic-GSH complexes were prepared as described above except that GSH and mixtures of GSH and arsenic compounds (sodium arsenite, MMA, and DMA) were prepared in D2O for NMR experiments. The proton shifts in GSH and its complexes with arsenic are reported with the internal reference standard 3-(trimethylsilyl) 2,2,3,3, tetra deutero propionic acid sodium salt set to 0.0 ppm. To develop a better understanding of arsenic excretion in bile, we administered sodium arsenite intravenously (0.5 mg/kg) to Wistar rats and collected bile by cannulating the common bile duct. Using ICP-MS, we found that ∼40% of administered arsenic was excreted into the bile and that the majority of this excretion took place during the first hour (Fig. 1). Circumstantial evidence has suggested that GSH might be involved in arsenic transport (14Gyurasics A. Varga F. Gregus Z. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Buchet J.P. Lauwerys R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1987; 91: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the MRP2/cMOAT transporter is known to transport organic anions including GSH (18Oude Elferink R.P.J. Ottenhoff R. Liefting W. de Haan J. Jansen P.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Paulusma C.C. Van Geer M.A. Evers R. Heijin M. Ottenhoff R. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we reasoned that if GSH transport is an obligatory for arsenic excretion, TR−rats, known to be deficient in this transporter (16Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J.R. Bakker C.T. M Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Science. 1996; 271: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 17Kitamura T.

A. 1990; 87: 3557-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), should have reduced biliary excretion of arsenic. When we examined the biliary excretion of arsenic in these mutant rats, we found that they excreted <1% as much arsenic as wild-type Wistar rats (Fig. 1). The biliary concentration of GSH was also reduced drastically in TR−rats to <1% of wild-type levels (18Oude Elferink R.P.J. Ottenhoff R. Liefting W. de Haan J. Jansen P.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the transport of GSH and the transport of arsenic are two separate processes that both depend on MRP2/cMOAT pump, we used BSO, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis (23Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to examine the excretion of arsenic in Wistar rats in which the MRP2/cMOAT pump is intact. Pretreatment of Wistar rats with BSO (10 mmol/kg) reduced the biliary excretion of arsenic to <1% of control values (Fig. 1), and the level of GSH excreted to 10% of control values (not shown). These data provide additional evidence for the essential role of GSH transport in the biliary excretion of arsenic.Figure 1Time course of arsenic excretion in bile. Sodium arsenite (0.5 mg/kg, intravenously) was administered to Wistar, BSO-treated Wistar, and TR− rats, and the bile was collected at 15-min intervals for the analysis of total arsenic by ICP-MS. Values represent the means ± S.E. of four rats. Note the Wistar rats treated with BSO or mutant TR− rats exhibit ∼1% of arsenic excretion compared with wild-type Wistar rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the transport of MMA and DMA into bile by administering these compounds (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously to Wistar and TR− rats. Neither Wistar nor TR− rats excreted significant amounts of either MMA or DMA into bile (<1% as much arsenic as Wistar rats treated with sodium arsenite). These data suggest that for MMA or DMA to be excreted into bile, they must be formed in vivo within the liver, presumably by a mechanism involving GSH. The implication of GSH in arsenic excretion prompted us to look for arsenic-GSH complexes as intermediates in arsenic transport. Although such complexes have not been identified in vivo to date, their existence has been postulated (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 22Cullen W.R. Mcbride B.C. Reglinski J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 21: 179-194Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Dey S.

Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We reasoned that failure to detect these complexes in the past might have resulted from their inherent instability and/or the choice of methods to extract and analyze body fluids. We synthesized three possible arsenic-GSH complexes, ATG, MADG, and DMAG (Fig.2 A), and developed methods for their separation and identification by LC/ESI-MS. Using these synthetic ATG, MADG, and DMAG standards, we found that the retention times for ATG, MADG, and DMAG were 3.8, 4.1, and 4.5 min, respectively (Fig.2 B). These complexes were found to have specific mass fragmentation including their molecular ions (ATG,m/z 992; MADG, m/z 701; DMAG, m/z 410) (Fig. 2 C). We used NMR to provide additional confirmation for the complex formation between GSH and arsenic compounds (sodium arsenite, MMA, and DMA). The chemical shifts of the cysteine residue β protons of glutathione have been shown to be markers of complex formation with arsenic by NMR (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These β protons shift downfield by 0.3–0.4 ppm upon forming the ATG complex (Fig. 3 and Table I). In the complex formed between MMA and glutathione (MADG), the β protons shift downfield 0.2–0.3 ppm, whereas DMAG (a complex of DMA and GSH) displayed a downfield shift in these protons of about 0.2 ppm (Table I). In addition to the β proton shifts, the methyl protons of MMA shifted downfield 0.17 ppm upon formation of MADG, whereas the methyl protons of the DMA shift upfield about 0.6 ppm upon complex formation with GSH (Table I). Minor changes in α−CH protons were also observed in these arsenic-GSH complexes (Table I). These findings are in close agreement with those of Scott and collaborators (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and Cullen and co-workers (22Cullen W.R. Mcbride B.C. Reglinski J. J. Inorg.

To determine whether ATG, MADG, and DMAG (Fig. 2 A) existin vivo and are responsible for arsenic excretion, we intravenously injected Wistar rats with sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg) and analyzed the bile for the presence of these complexes by LC/ESI-MS. ATG and MADG were identified in bile samples of rats treated with arsenic (Fig. 4 A). We were unable to detect significant amounts of DMAG in bile samples. The total arsenic content in the bile was measured using ICP-MS (TableII). To quantify the arsenic content in these complexes, we collected the LC column effluent of bile at 20-s intervals under the same chromatographic conditions and determined the arsenic content in these fractions using ICP-MS (Fig. 4 B). Most of the arsenic (80–90%) eluted between 3.7 and 4.2 min (Fig.4 B), indicating that arsenic-GSH complexes account for the majority of arsenic in the bile. Inorganic arsenic, MMA, and DMA elute in <1 min under these chromatographic conditions, and we found less than 10% of total arsenic in these fractions. At this dose, ATG and MADG were about equally abundant (Table II). These data establish the role of arsenic-GSH complexes in arsenic excretion.Table IIAnalysis of total arsenic, ATG, and MADG in the bile of sodium arsenite-treated Wistar ratsDose (mg/kg)Total arsenicArsenic in ATGArsenic in MADGGSH2-aFree GSH (unconjugated) concentration in bile.

We extended our studies to examine the presence of these complexes in bile using lower doses of arsenic that are relevant to human exposure (1World Health Organization (1999) Arsenic in Drinking Water, Fact Sheet No. 210, pp. 1–6, WHO Press, Geneva.Google Scholar, 2National Research Council Arsenic in Drinking Water. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.1999Google Scholar, 3Klaassen C.D. Amdur M.O. Doull J. Casarett and Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Sciences of Poisons.

Epidemiol. 1998; 27: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For these experiments, Wistar rats were injected with either 0.5 or 0.1 mg/kg arsenic intravenously, and the bile was analyzed for ATG and MADG. We detected MADG and found that it accounted for 50–60% of arsenic in bile at these doses (Table II). ATG was undetectable at these doses. A likely explanation for this finding is that ATG is found only at high doses (5 mg/kg) because the ability of cells to methylate arsenic is saturated, whereas at lower doses all arsenic can be methylated. The data on TR− rats (Fig. 1) suggest that virtually all arsenic in bile should be found associated with GSH. The reason we do not find 100% of arsenic associated with GSH is probably that dissociation of arsenic-GSH complexes occurs, especially at low doses of arsenic. The formation of ATG and MADG and their dissociation may be represented as follows (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).3H++AsO33−+3GSH⇄ATG+3H2OREACTION 1MMA+4GSH⇄MADG+GSSG+3H2OREACTION 2Because the forward reaction of each of the above equations depends on the exponential concentration of GSH (i.e.[GSH]3 for ATG formation and [GSH]4 for MADG formation), the effect of changes in GSH concentration as a function of arsenic dose (Table II) is vastly magnified and drives the reaction toward the GSH arsenic complexes. The inability to detect ATG with low concentrations of arsenic exposure (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, intravenously) could also be partly because of the instability of this complex in bile (pH 8.0) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Because human exposure is largely oral, we administered sodium arsenite to Wistar rats by gastric tube (5.0 mg/kg). We found that under these conditions the excretion of arsenic was slower; however, most of the arsenic was present as ATG and MADG (Table II). At 0.5 mg/kg we were able to detect MADG but not ATG (data not shown) similar to our studies using intravenous administration of sodium arsenite (Table II). Our findings reveal several novel features of the biliary excretion of arsenic. We find that the hepatobiliary transport of arsenic depends on the bile canalicular MRP2/cMOAT transporter (Fig.1). It is well known that MRP2/cMOAT transports GSH and GSH conjugates (18Oude Elferink R.P.J. Ottenhoff R. Liefting W. de Haan J. Jansen P.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Paulusma C.C. Van Geer M.A. Evers R. Heijin M. Ottenhoff R. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); our data demonstrate that arsenic is transported by this mechanism as well. Failure of TR− rats to excrete any (<1%) arsenic after loading with sodium arsenite suggests that both arsenic and one of its methylated products (MMA) are transported by this mechanism. This interpretation is supported by the findings of Gregus et al. (26Gregus Z. Gyurasics A. Csanaky I. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 56: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which show that MMA is excreted into the bile of rats exposed to arsenite or arsenate. As expected from the results of others (18Oude Elferink R.P.J. Ottenhoff R. Liefting W. de Haan J. Jansen P.L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Paulusma C.C. Van Geer M.A. Evers R. Heijin M. Ottenhoff R. Borst P. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), transport of GSH in to bile was also diminished in TR− rats (<2% of controls rats). In addition, when wild-type Wistar rats were treated with BSO (an inhibitor of GSH synthesis) prior to arsenic administration, they also exhibit reduced arsenic levels in bile (<2% of control rats). These data indicate that both the MRP2/cMOAT transport system and GSH are essential for the biliary excretion of arsenic. These observations prompted us to look for arsenic-GSH complexes in the bile. Although such complexes have not been identified in vivo to date, their existence has been postulated (21Scott N. Hatelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Cater D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 22Cullen W.R. Mcbride B.C. Reglinski J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 21: 179-194Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Dey S.

Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found two arsenic-GSH complexes not previously identifiedin vivo, arsenic triglutathione and methylarsenic diglutathione. These account for most of the arsenic in the bile (Fig.4 and Table II). The inability of other investigators to identify these complexes probably results from the relative instability of these complexes. Our success may result from our avoidance of extraction prior to analysis and the use of LC-MS electrospray ionization. The increasing biliary GSH concentration with arsenic exposure is in close agreement with an earlier report (14Gyurasics A. Varga F. Gregus Z. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our findings also raise the possibility that arsenic-GSH complex formation and transport by MRPs or multidrug-resistant proteins represent a general process by which cells clear arsenic. In this view, transport across the bile canalicular surface of the hepatocyte might represent a particularly efficient or well developed general mechanism. It is known, for example, that MRP2 is also expressed in kidney and lung, although at lower levels (16Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J.R. Bakker C.T. M Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P.

Hepatology. 2000; 32: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further, MRP2 is one of a family of multidrug-resistant proteins, some or all of which may be involved with arsenic transport (20Broeks A. Gerrard B. Allikmets R. Dean M. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6132-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Van Eijk M.J.T. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). Also, our data provide a paradigm for the involvement of MRP1 and perhaps MRP2 in the renal excretion of arsenic (10Yoshida K. Inoue Y. Hua Chen K. Shoji Fukushima H.W. Endo G. J. Toxicol. Env. Health. 1998; 54: 179-192Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Van Eijk M.J.T. Juijn J.A.

Lett. 1987; 37: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We do not know precisely how much lowering of GSH is necessary to begin to reduce levels of excreted arsenic (Fig. 1), but the observed increased toxicity of arsenic in humans on protein-deficient diets may result from less formation of arsenic GSH-complexes and less excretion (2National Research Council Arsenic in Drinking Water.

With respect to leukemia patients receiving arsenic, studies of arsenic toxicity in cultured acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) and other malignant cell lines indicate that these cells have much lower intracellular GSH levels than nonmalignant cells and exhibit increased sensitivity to arsenic (29Dai J. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment withN-acetyl cysteine, which preserves intracellular GSH levels, prevents arsenic-induced apoptosis in these cells. Our findings suggest that one reason why arsenic may be effective against promyelocytic leukemia is that increased toxicity results from reduced formation of arsenic-GSH complexes and subsequently less transport of arsenic out of these cells. In summary, biliary transport of arsenic is dependent on formation of arsenic-GSH complexes and their transport out of hepatocytes by MRP2/cMOAT and into bile. Our findings provide a model for detoxification and clearance of arsenic at the cellular level.

Here, we show that monkeys' ability to recognize degraded objects was improved by several days of practice with these objects. This improvement was reflected in the activity of neurons in the prefrontal (PF) cortex, a brain region critical for a wide range of visual behaviors. Familiar objects activated fewer neurons than did novel objects, but these neurons were more narrowly tuned, and the object representation was more resistant to the effects of degradation, after experience. These results demonstrate a neural correlate of visual learning in the PF cortex of adult monkeys."

Imitation of this prolonged PKA activation in the ALs in combination with single-trial conditioning is sufficient to induce LTM. These findings not only demonstrate the close connection between conditioning procedure and temporal dynamics in PKA activation but also reveal that already during conditioning a distinct temporal pattern of PKA activation is critical for LTM induction in intact animals."
https://openalex.org/W2089275735,"Cone pedicles, the synaptic terminals of cone photoreceptors, are connected in the macaque monkey retina to several hundred postsynaptic dendrites. Using light and electron microscopy, we found underneath each cone pedicle a laminated distribution of dendritic processes of bipolar and horizontal cells. Superimposed were three strata of glutamate receptor (GluR) aggregates, including a novel layer of glutamate receptors clustered at desmosome-like junctions. They are, most likely, postsynaptic densities on horizontal cell dendrites. GABAA and GABAC receptors are aggregated on bipolar cell dendrites in a narrow band underneath the cone pedicle. Glutamate released from cone pedicles and GABA released from horizontal cell dendrites act not only through direct synaptic contacts but also (more so) through diffusion to the appropriate receptors."

In an attempt to expand the therapeutic potential of this class, four new ω-conotoxins (CVIA–D) have been discovered in the venom of the piscivorous cone snail, Conus catus, using assay-guided fractionation and gene cloning. Compared with other ω-conotoxins, CVID has a novel loop 4 sequence and the highest selectivity for N-type over P/Q-type calcium channels in radioligand binding assays. CVIA−D also inhibited contractions of electrically stimulated rat vas deferens. In electrophysiological studies, ω-conotoxins CVID and MVIIA had similar potencies to inhibit current through central (α1B-d) and peripheral (α1B-b) splice variants of the rat N-type calcium channels when coexpressed with rat β3 in Xenopus oocytes. However, the potency of CVID and MVIIA increased when α1B-d and α1B-b were expressed in the absence of rat β3, an effect most pronounced for CVID at α1B-d (up to 540-fold) and least pronounced for MVIIA at α1B-d (3-fold). The novel selectivity of CVID may have therapeutic implications. 1H NMR studies reveal that CVID possesses a combination of unique structural features, including two hydrogen bonds that stabilize loop 2 and place loop 2 proximal to loop 4, creating a globular surface that is rigid and well defined. ω-Conotoxins selective for N-type calcium channels are useful in the management of severe pain.

The venom of each species contains a unique array of more than 100 peptides, whose pharmaceutical potential remain largely unexploited (1Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Drinkwater R. Lewis R.J. Drug Dev. Res. 1999; 46: 219-234Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Different classes of conotoxins have evolved to target ion channels and receptors for the successful capture of fish, molluscs, or worms (2Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Zeikus R. McIntosh J.M. Varga J. Science. 1990; 230: 1338-1343Crossref Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 3McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In addition to their use as research tools, animal studies have shown that ω-conotoxins that target N-type VSCCs have clinical potential in ischemic brain injury (9Yamada K. Teraoka T. Morita S. Hasegawa T. Nabeshima T. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and pain (10Malmberg A.B. Yaksh T.L. Pain. 1995; 60: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, ω-conotoxins presently available are not ideal therapeutics, despite their selectivity and potency and the dominant role of N-type VSCCs at synapses in carrying nociceptive information in the spinal cord (11Wetenbroek R.E. Hoskins L. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6319-6330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, intrathecal MVIIA causes a variety of neurological side effects of unknown origin (12Penn R.D. Paice J. Pain. 2000; 85: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another N-type VSSC selective ω-conotoxin, GVIA, dissociates slowly from N-type VSCCs (13Kristipati R. Nádasdi L. Tarczy-Hornoch K. Lau K. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Bell J.R. Mol. Cell.

Open table in a new tab A number of central and peripheral splice variants of the N-type VSCC have been reported (14Lin Z. Haus S. Edgerton J. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, calcium channel probes with greater selectivity are required to help understand the role(s) played by the various forms of the N-type VSCC in normal and disease states. Here we report the isolation and characterization of four new ω-conotoxins (CVIA—D, see Table I) discovered in the venom of the piscivorous cone snail, Conus catus. One of these, CVID, has a number of novel structural features that underlie an enhanced ability to discriminate between N-type (α1B) and P/Q-type (α1A) VSCCs, as well as between splice variants of the α1B expressed in oocytes in the presence or absence of rat β3. 37 specimens of C. catus(average length 4 cm) were collected from the southern Great Barrier Reef. Crude venom duct contents were extracted with 30% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged. Soluble material was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C prior to use. The crude venom extract (12 mg) was fractionated using semi-preparative RP-HPLC (10 μm C18, 1.0 × 25 cm, Vydac) eluted at 2.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B over 60 min, then to 80% solvent B over 20 min, using a Waters 600 solvent delivery system (solvent A, 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid). Inhibition of 125I-GVIA binding to rat brain membrane (see below) identified six 1-min fractions eluting at 17, 18, 22, 23, 26, and 27 min that contained ω-conotoxins. The ω-conotoxins in each fraction were further purified by size exclusion HPLC (Superdex HR10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were finally rechromatographed by analytical RP-HPLC (5 μm C18, 0.46 × 25 cm, Vydac) eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–50% solvent B over 45 or 90 min. Peaks detected at 214 nm were collected and sequenced. Screening of the venom of other Australian cone snails, including the piscivorousConus striatus, Conus tulipa, Conus geographus, andConus magus, only identified sequences corresponding to known ω-conotoxins. The purified peptides (∼100 pmol) were reduced in the presence of TCEP, 50 mm ammonium acetate at pH 4.5 (37 °C for 1 h), and then alkylated in the presence of maleimide (37 °C, 1 h). The alkylated peptides were purified by RP-HPLC, applied to a Biobrene-treated glass fiber filter, and analyzed by Edman chemistry using an Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 470A protein sequencer. Alkylation of peptides with maleimide allowed their cysteine residues to be observed as phenylthiohydantoin-Cys-maleimide doublets (diastereomers), and Ser was confirmed by the presence of dehydroserine. The high number of serine, threonine, and cysteine residues present in each conotoxin resulted in a relatively rapid decrease in the amino acid yields in successive cycles; however, complete sequences were obtained in each case. The low serine signals were accompanied by the presence of large dehydroserine peak. Ducts from two specimens of C. catus were emulsified, and poly(A)+-tailed mRNA was extracted using the QuickPrep mRNA purification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Strand-1 cDNA was 3′ end-synthesized from the C. catuspoly(A)+ mRNA templates using aNotI-d(T)18 bifunctional primer (5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAAT18) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) extended with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resultant cDNA templates were used to manufacture double-stranded cDNA using a RNase H/DNA polymerase procedure (cDNA Timesaver system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Marathon adaptors (CLONTECH) were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ds-cDNA molecules to complete the cDNA construction. An oligonucleotide PCR primer (R-301A 5′-atcatcaaaATGAAACTGACGTG) was designed from a consensus of aligned coding sequences from conotoxins with a 6-cysteine/4-loop framework comprising published (15Woodward S.R.

The primer included a translation start site (underlined) and 9 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence (lowercase). This forward PCR primer was designed to work in conjunction with the reverse ANCHOR primer (5′- AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAAT) that was homologous to the adaptor at the 3′ termini of the ds-cDNA templates. PCR was carried out on samples containing ds-cDNA from C. catus, the R-301A primer, the ANCHOR primer, AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the manufacturer's AmpliTaq buffer, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmdeoxynucleotides. The samples were incubated in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Bresatec, Australia) at 95 °C for 2 min (1 cycle), 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 90 s (35 cycles), and 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). The PCR products were assessed on agarose gels and, when necessary, isolated and purified using BRESAspin gel extraction systems (Bresatec, Australia). The purified PCR products were blunt end-cloned into dephosphorylated Sma-1 cut pUC-18 plasmid vector DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced using the pUC-18 forward and reverse primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dideoxy terminator sequencing chemistries (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on Applied Biosystems, Inc., 377 sequencers. CVIA–D were each manually synthesized, deprotected, and cleaved from resin as described previously (17Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept.

The pure, reduced peptides (0.02–0.05 mm) were oxidized in aqueous 0.33 mNH4Oac, 0.5 m guanidine·HCl (pH 7.5–8.0, adjusted with 0.1 m NH4OH). The peptide solutions were then stirred for 2–4 days at 4 °C in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione (molar ratio 1:100:10) to achieve oxidation. Oxidized peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC (18Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Peptides were quantified initially by triplicate amino acid analysis (19Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar) and then by RP-HPLC (HP 1100) using an external reference standard for each peptide. Stability studies in physiological saline solutions showed that nonspecific binding of these peptides to glass or polypropylene was minimal. Mass spectra were acquired on a PE-Sciex API III triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer (MS) in positive ion mode (m/z 500–2000, at 0.1–0.2-Da steps, declustering potentials of 10–90 V, and dwell times of 0.4–1.0 s). Data were deconvoluted (MacSpec 3.2, Sciex, Canada) to obtain the molecular weight from the multiply charged species. MS was used to confirm purity and to monitor peptide oxidation. Native and synthetic CVIA−D were compared on a 5-μm C18 column (0.21 × 25 cm, Vydac) eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 2 min and then with a linear gradient to 80% solvent B (solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) over 80 min at a flow rate of 130 μl/min, using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 pump and MS detection. Radioligand binding were performed on rat brain membrane incubated in the following (mm): 20 HEPES (pH 7.2), 75 NaCl, 0.1 EDTA, 0.1 EGTA, 2 leupeptin, 0.5 units of aprotinin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, as described previously (18Nielsen K.J.

Cold iodinated CVID (127I-CVID) was also prepared and quantified by HPLC.127I-CVID coeluted with 125I-CVID, and MS confirmed it as the monoiodinated species. For displacement studies, [125I-Tyr22]GVIA, 125I-MVIIA, or125I-MVIIC (7 pm diluted with assay buffer) were incubated with increasing concentrations of cold peptide. Saturation binding studies were performed with freshly prepared125I-CVID and 125I-MVIIA (n = 4 experiments). On-rate and off-rate experiments were performed at 23 °C in single 50-ml polypropylene tubes containing125I-CVID or 125I-MVIIA (30 pmdiluted with assay buffer). On-rate experiments commenced with the addition of rat brain membrane, and off-rate experiments commenced with the addition of excess CVID or MVIIA (10−7m) following a 30-min incubation of rat brain membrane with125I-CVID or 125I-MVIIA (30 pm), respectively. At defined intervals, aliquots (300 μl) were filtered (25-mm Whatman GF/B treated with 0.6% polyethyleneimine), and the filtrates were rapidly washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer. Nonlinear regressions were fitted to each experiment (n= 3 data points per experiment) with Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Male Wistar rats (250–350 ×g) were killed by cervical dislocation and exsanguinated. Prostatic halves of each vas deferens were mounted under 0.5 ×g tension in 5-ml organ baths containing physiological solution containing the following (mm): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.17, MgSO4, 1.18 KH2PO4, 25.0 NaHCO3, 5.5 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.026 EDTA, at 37 °C and bubbled with 5% CO2 in O2 (pH 7.4). After 45 min of equilibration, electrical field stimulation every 3 min (single 55 V, 0.1-ms duration pulses generated by a Grass S44 stimulator) were applied via two platinum-stimulating electrodes straddling the tissue. Isometric contractions were measured using a force transducer (F-60, Narco Bio-System) and recorded digitally on a Power Macintosh computer using Chart version 3.5.6/s software and a MacLab/8 s data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Australia) at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. Evoked contractions were abolished by tetradotoxin (0.1 μm), indicating that they were of neurogenic origin. Conotoxins were added cumulatively at 18-min intervals, with allowance made for a small (0.16% /min) deterioration of the evoked response. CVID effect on ATP (3 × 10−3m, Sigma) and norepinephrine (10−4m, Sigma) responses in the bisected epididymal portion of the rat vas deferens was also determined. Dose-response data (means ± S.E.; n = 5) were analyzed using Prism software. Oocytes were surgically removed from mature Xenopus laevis frogs anesthetized by submersion in 0.1% ethyl m-aminobenzoate (MS 222). Stage V–VI oocytes were prepared for injection by dissociation in Ca2+-free solution containing the following (mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4), plus 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type I) for 1 h at room temperature. Oocytes, maintained in storage solution containing (mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5 pyruvate, plus 50 μg/ml gentamicin (pH 7.4), were injected with 25–50 ng of total cRNA using a precision injector (Drummond “Nanojet”) and incubated at 18 °C for 3−5 days. Injected cRNA obtained using an Ambion mMessage mMachine kit comprised rat brain peripheral (α1B-b) or central (α1B-d) subunits of the N-type VSCC expressed in the absence or presence (1:1 ratio) of the rat β3 subunit provided by D. Lipscombe (12Penn R.D. Paice J. Pain. 2000; 85: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recordings were made in a nominally Ca2+-free solution containing (mm) 85 tetraethylammonium, 5 BaCl2, 5 KCl, 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid perfused at a rate of ∼10 ml/min. Depolarization-activated Ba2+ currents were recorded using a GeneClamp 500B two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (21−23 °C). Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had final resistances of 0.2–1.0 MΩ. VSCC currents in oocytes were evoked by a step depolarization to 0 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV using pClamp programs (Axon Instruments Inc). The linear membrane capacitative and leak currents were subtracted using a −P/4 pulse protocol. Membrane currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Oocytes showing <15% change in peak current amplitude over a 10-min incubation period were used in these studies to avoid effects associated with current run down. Oocytes that exhibited a slowly developing Cl− current were discarded, and in control experiments on the remaining oocytes, BAPTA injection did not affect the Ba2+ current, indicating that this current was not contaminated by Ca2+-activated Cl− current. Perfusion was stopped, and cumulative additions of ω-conotoxins were added to a Teflon chamber (0.8 ml volume) to achieve rapid mixing. Inhibition of peak Ba2+current amplitude was measured when the inhibitory effects of each concentration of MVIIA and CVID approached steady state values, typically requiring a 5–7-min incubation to achieve <2% change in peak current amplitude per min. Data (means ± S.E.;n = 3–5) were fitted with nonlinear regressions using Origin software. All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit, or a Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer equipped with an x,y,z-gradient unit. The Hα chemical shifts were obtained from spectra of CVIA–D in 95% H2O, 5% D2O (pH 2.5–3.5) at 293 K, and restraints for three-dimensional structure calculations of CVID were obtained from spectra recorded at 280 and 293 K at pH 3 and 5.5 (18Nielsen K.J.

The amino acid sequences of CVIA and CVIB were cosequenced at a 3:2 ratio, whereas CVIC and CVID were obtained from separate fractions. Synthetic C-terminally amidated CVIA, CVIC, and CVID gave retention times and masses that were indistinguishable from the corresponding native peptides (Fig.1), thus CVIA, CVIC, and CVID were determined to be C-terminally amidated. For each peptide, the oxidized form eluted earlier than the reduced form. PCR of the C. catus venom duct cDNA templates produced a DNA product of approximately 380−500 base pairs (data not shown). A relatively broad DNA band indicated the presence of a composite PCR product. Subsequent sequence analysis of more than 100 clones derived from the PCR product libraries confirmed this observation. The PCR products contained peptides of the ω- and δ-conotoxin types, as well as sequences from at least two other conotoxin families yet to be assigned. Within the ω-conotoxin sequences isolated were two that translated to putative mature peptides identical to the CVIA and CVID sequences. Despite an extensive screening of the two C. catus PCR product libraries, clones for the conotoxins CVIB and CVIC were not located, and the CVID clone was located in only one specimen. The complete nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences derived for CVIA and CVID are shown in Fig. 2 and are aligned with the sequences for MVIIA and GVIA. Homology screening of public nucleotide and amino acid data bases with the CVIA and CVID sequences indicated that both sequences were unique. Synthetic CVIA−D, GVIA, MVIIA, and MVIIC each fully displaced 125I-GVIA (defining N-type VSCCs) and 125I-MVIIC (defining P/Q-type VSCCs) binding to crude rat brain membrane (Fig. 3; Table II). GVIA, MVIIA, and CVID had similarly high affinity for the N-type VSCC (pIC50± S.E. values of 10.4 ± 0.05, 10.3 ± 0.03, and 10.2 ± 0.03 m, respectively). In comparison, CVIA was a moderate inhibitor, and CVIB and CVIC were relatively poor inhibitors at the N-type VSCC. GVIA, MVIIA, and CVID also fully displaced125I-MVIIA, with potencies (IC50 values of 49, 29, and 50 pm, respectively) similar to those obtained for displacement of 125I-GVIA. At the P/Q-type VSCC MVIIC had highest affinity (pIC50 9.2 ± 0.04m); CVIB and CVIC were moderate inhibitors; MVIIA, CVIA, and MVIIA were poor inhibitors; and CVID was an exceptionally weak inhibitor (IC50 55 μm) (Fig.3 B and Table II).Table IIPotency (nm) of ω-conotoxins to inhibit 125 I-GVIA (N-type) or 125 I-MVIIC (P/Q-type) binding to rat brain VSCCs, and contractions of electrically stimulated rat vas deferensω-ConotoxinDisplacement of 125I-GVIA, IC50(95% CI)Inhibition of vas deferens, IC50 (95% CI)Displacement of 125I-MVIIC, IC50 (95% CI)CVIA0.56 (0.44–0.70)205 (170–250)850 (700–1020)CVIB7.7 (7.1–8.5)630 (480–830)11 (9.0–13)CVIC7.6 (7.0–8.3)410 (290–590)31 (26–37)CVID0.070 (0.058–0.077)18.4 (16–21)55,000 (49,000–62,000)MVIIA0.055 (0.047–0.066)18.2 (15–22)440 (380–520)GVIA0.038 (0.030–0.047)4.9 (4.0–6.0)1050 (830–1320)MVIIC7.0 (5.3–9.8)0.60 (0.49–0.72) Open table in a new tab Saturation binding studies indicated that 125I-CVID and125I-MVIIA (67 ± 11 and 37 ± 12 pm, respectively) had potencies slightly lower than CVID and MVIIA in rat brain membrane, and both appeared to occupy a single class of receptor (Fig. 4). In paired experiments (n = 4), 125I-CVID (0.07 ± 0.03 pmol/mg protein) bound to 31% fewer receptors in rat brain membrane than 125I-MVIIA (0.10 ± 0.04 pmol/mg protein) (p = 0.049, paired two-tailed t test), and125I-CVID had half the nonspecific binding of125I-MVIIA (Fig. 4). Despite this difference in the density of receptor sites recognized, displacement assays did not reveal a component of 125I-GVIA or 125I-MVIIA binding that was not displaced by CVID. 127I-CVID (IC500.44 nm) also fully displaced 125I-MVIIA binding to rat brain with a Hill slope of unity. However, saturation binding studies have limited power to resolve binding sites of similar affinity, and a lower affinity binding site comprising 30% of receptors would be under-represented with the concentration of125I-MVIIA used in the displacement assays (20% of itsK d concentration). Displacement of higher concentrations of 125I-MVIIA by MVIIA, GVIA, CVID, or127I-CVID also did not identify a significant resistant component, possibly due to the reduction in the signal to noise of the assay with increased labeled ligand concentrations (data not shown). The difference in B max did not arise from differences in binding kinetics; 125I-CVID and125I-MVIIA had similar k on values (0.024 and 0.08 min−1pm−1, after adjusting fork off) and k off values (0.56 and 0.53 min−1, respectively). TheK d values for 125I-CVID and125I-MVIIA calculated from kinetic data (23 and 7 pm, respectively) were similar to the estimates obtained from saturation binding studies (67 and 37 pm, respectively). CVIA–D inhibited electrically stimulated rat vas deferens contractions (Fig.5 A). The rank order of potency was GVIA > CVID ≈ MVIIA > CVIA > CVIC > CVIB (Fig. 5 B and Table II). Inhibition of the nerve-evoked responses in rat vas deferens was positively correlated with displacement of 125I-GVIA binding across the ω-conotoxins tested (log(rat vas deferens IC50) = 0.78(log(125I-GVIA IC50) + 0.1) (r 2 = 0.92)). CVID and MVIIA gave Hill slopes significantly greater than unity (2.9 and 3.3, respectively), whereas CVIA-C and GVIA gave Hill slopes that were not significantly different from unity. The origin of these differences is unclear; however, differences in N-type versus P/Q-type VSCC selectivity do not appear to be a contributing factor.

https://openalex.org/W2017506170,"At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, there are two synaptic vesicle pools, namely the exo/endo cycling pool (ECP) and the reserve pool (RP). We studied the recruitment process from RP using a fluorescent dye, FMI-43. During high-frequency nerve stimulation, vesicles in RP were recruited for release, and endocytosed vesicles were incorporated into both pools, whereas with low-frequency stimulation, vesicles were incorporated into and released from ECP. Release of vesicles from RP was detected electrophysiologically after emptying vesicles in the ECP of transmitter by a H+ pump inhibitor. Recruitment from RP was depressed by inhibitors of steps in the cAMP/PKA cascade and enhanced by their activators. In rutabaga (rut) with low cAMP levels, mobilization of vesicles from RP during tetanic stimulation was depressed, while it was enhanced in dunce (dnc) with high cAMP levels."

In mice, mutations in the microphthalmia gene cause pigmentation disorders because of the absence of melanocytes, supporting the involvement of MITF in melanocyte survival (1Hodgkinson C.A.

MITF has been also demonstrated to up-regulate the expression of the genes involved in melanin synthesis, such as tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 (3Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Further MITF is thought to be a master gene in melanocyte differentiation, because its forced expression in fibroblasts leads to the expression of melanocyte-specific enzymes required for melanin synthesis (4Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In humans, mutations ofMITF are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type 2a, characterized by pigmentation abnormalities and sensorineural deafness due to the absence of melanocytes from the stria vascularis of the inner ear (5Hughes A.

Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In humans, at least four MITF isoforms with different amino termini have been described. The existence of four alternative promoters allows a specific expression pattern of these isoforms (7Udono T. Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Amae S. Watanabe K. Saito H. Fuse N. Tachibana M. Takahashi K. Tamai M. Shibahara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 149: 205-219Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A melanocyte-specific promoter controls melanocyte-restricted expression of the MITF-M isoform. Analysis of this promoter has identified several potential cis-acting regulatory elements. Among these regulatory sequences, a canonical cAMP-responsive element is involved in the regulation of MITF expression by cAMP-elevating agents such as alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH) and forskolin (8Bertolotto C.

Nature. 1998; 26: 370-373Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins mediate their biological effects through the binding to frizzled, a seven-transmembrane receptor, leading to the subsequent nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin in turn cooperates with lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF1)/T cell factor (10Travis A.

Very recently, Wnt 3a has been shown to stimulate MITF expression, and a LEF1 site has been identified in the MITF promoter (12Takeda K. Yasumoto K. Takada R. Takada S. Watanabe K. Udono T. Saito H.

This site appears to play a pivotal role in pigment cell development in vertebrates, because a LEF1 site is present and functional in the promoter of nacre, a zebra fish MITF homologue (13Dorsky R. Raible D. Moon R. Genes Dev. 2000; 15: 158-162Google Scholar). Mutations in PAX3, which encodes a paired homeodomain transcription factor, are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome 1 and 3 (14Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Harris R. Balling R. Gruss P. Strachan T. Nature. 1992; 355: 635-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 15Tassabehji M. Newton V. Liu X. Brady A. Donnai D. Krajewska-Walasek M. Murday V. Norman A. Obersztyn E. Reardon W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2131-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PAX3 was shown to bind and transactivate the MITF promoter, thereby demonstrating the role of PAX3 in the regulation of MITF expression. This observation supports an epistatic relationship betweenMITF and PAX3 and can explain the pigmentary disorders observed in WS1 and 3 (16Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations show that MITF is subjected to a complex array of transcriptional regulation that allows an accurate developmental expression of MITF. WS4 is caused by mutations in either the endothelin B receptor, endothelin 3, or SOX10, a sex-determining gene (SRY)-related transcription factor (17Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W.J. Nat.

How mutations in these genes lead to deafness and pigmentary abnormalities, shared by all the WS subtypes, was not elucidated. It was tempting to propose that the WS4 genes, mentioned above, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of MITF expression that is crucial for melanocyte development. In the present report, we have investigated the possible involvement of Sox10 in the regulation of the MITF gene expression. We show that Sox10 binds and transactivates theMITF promoter, whereas Sox10 mutants found in WS4 patients failed to stimulate the MITF promoter. Thus, we demonstrate an epistatic relationship between SOX10 and MITF, thereby giving a molecular basis for the audio-pigmentary defect in patients with WS4.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet-P40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, 100 IU/ml aprotinin. Proteins (30 μg) were separated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Sox10 protein was detected with a rat polyclonal antibody (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar) at a 1/1000 dilution in saturation buffer and with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at a 1/3000 dilution. Proteins were visualized using the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. B16 melanoma cells and NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were seeded in 24-well dishes. 24 h later cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.02 and 0.04 μg of the expression vector, and 0.05 μg of pCMVβgal to control the variability of the transfection efficiency. Transfection of B16 cells and 3T3 cells were performed using 2 μl of LipofectAMINE in 200 μl of Optimem™ for 6 and 3 h, respectively. Then the transfection medium was changed to fresh medium, and 40 h later cells were washed with a saline phosphate buffer and lysed with 25 mm Tris phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Soluble extracts were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All transfections were repeated at least five times using different plasmid preparations and gave similar results. Gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from A293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding Sox10. Double-stranded synthetic nucleotide, −250 5′-GCTGAAAGAGAAATACCA TTG TCTATTAATACTACTGG-3′ 270 was γ-32P end-labeled with the T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were preincubated for 30 min in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 25 ng poly(dI-dC) as unspecific competitor, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2. Then, 50,000–100,000 cpm of 32P probe were added to the reaction mixture for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in TAE 0.25× buffer (10 mm Tris, 9 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, 275 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 45 min at 100 V. When indicated, a 50-fold excess of cold competitor oligonucleotides was added during preincubation. To investigate the possible involvement of Sox10 in the regulation of MITF expression, we first evaluated the expression of Sox10 in melanocyte cells. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against rat Sox10 showed that Sox10 was expressed in B16 melanoma cells and in human melanocytes but not in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.1 A). Then we analyzed the effect of Sox10 on the MITF promoter activity. A 2.2-kilobase pair fragment of the melanocyte-specificMITF promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (8Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T. Bille K. Fisher D. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 827-835Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This construct (pMITF) was transfected alone or together with expression vectors encoding either Sox10, Sox4, or the catalytic subunit of PKA as a positive control. In B16 melanoma cells, Sox10 and PKA induced more than a 20-fold increase in the activity of pMITF, whereas co-transfection with Sox4 failed to increase the luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, Sox10 increased significantly pMITF expression (8-fold), whereas PKA and Sox4 did not affect the MITF promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). In these experiments, Sox4 stimulated the activity of a Sox reporter construct (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrating that Sox4 was indeed expressed (not shown). Hence, Sox10, which is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells, transactivates the MITF promoter as efficiently as PKA or LEF1 (12Takeda K. Yasumoto K. Takada R. Takada S. Watanabe K. Udono T. Saito H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 12: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which are, to date, the most potent activators of MITF expression. Sox4, another SRY-related transcription factor that has been reported to have strong transcriptional activity (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar), is unable to activate the MITF promoter. Interestingly, Sox10 transactivates pMITF in both fibroblasts and melanoma cells, whereas the effect of the cAMP pathway activation is restricted to melanoma cells as previously reported (8Bertolotto C. Abbe P. Hemesath T. Bille K. Fisher D. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 827-835Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In an attempt to localize the cis-acting elements accountable for the Sox10 response of the MITF promoter, we constructed a series of deletions in the 5′-region of pMITF (schematized in Fig.2 A) and evaluated their responsiveness to Sox10. In cells transfected with pMITF, pMITF-1812, or pMITF-1580, Sox10 induced a 20-fold increase in the luciferase activity. pMITF-880 and pMITF-387 constructs showed a slight but significant decrease in their responsiveness to Sox10 (14-fold). Then, using pMITF-177, we observed a more dramatic decrease in Sox10 stimulation (3-fold) (Fig. 2 B). This first series of experiments pointed out to the existence of at least two regulatory regions that seem to confer to the MITFpromoter its responsiveness to Sox10. One of these elements would be located between −387 and −177, and the other one should lay between −1580 and −880. Then, a new series of deletions between −387 and −177 were performed to identify the key Sox10-responsive element. The following four additional deletions were constructed: pMITF-277, pMITF-251, pMITF-239, and pMITF-217. pMITF-277 showed the same Sox10 responsiveness (14-fold) as pMITF-387, whereas the responsiveness of pMITF-251, pMITF-239, and pMITF-217 was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2 C). These experiments identify a Sox10-responsive element between −277 and −251. Within this region, we found a consensus binding sequence for Sox10 (−266/−260). A mutation of this site in pMITF-SXm moderately impaired the Sox10 responsiveness (13-fold). However, when this mutation was combined with the deletion of the region upstream −880 pMITF-SXm/880, we observed a complete loss of the Sox10 response (Fig. 2 C). Using a probe encompassing the Sox10 consensus binding sequence, we performed a gel shift assay (Fig. 2 D). When using nuclear extracts from mock-transfected A293, we observed no complex. On the other hand, nuclear extracts from A293 cells expressing Sox10 protein formed a complex that was displaced by an excess of unlabeled probe, whereas a probe carrying the same mutation as pMITF-SXm failed to do so. Further, this complex was specifically supershifted by an anti-Sox10 antibody. This result demonstrates that the Sox10 binds to the sequence −264/−266 of the MITF promoter. This Sox10 binding site cooperates with another cis-acting element between −1580 and −880. Mutation of Sox10 consensus binding sequences in this region, in the context of either the intact promoter or in pMITF-SX, did not affect the stimulation evoked by Sox10 (not shown). Thus, either the Sox10-responsive element between −1580 and −880 is a non-canonical Sox binding motif, or Sox10 acts indirectly on theMITF promoter through the up-regulation of another transcription factor, which needs to be identified in future studies. Noteworthy, the Sox10-responsive element of theMITF promoter, identified in this report, is located near a Pax3 binding site involved in the regulation of MITF expression (16Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because Sox10 has been reported to synergize the effect of Pax3 on a reporter gene containing adjacent Sox10 and PAX3 binding sites (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar), it was tempting to propose that Sox10 would cooperate with the downstream PAX3 site to stimulate MITF transcription. To verify this hypothesis, we have studied, in both B16 melanoma and NIH3T3 cells, the combined effects of Sox10 and PAX3 on pMITF. Surprisingly, in B16 melanoma cells, Pax3 did not stimulate the activity of pMITF, and the effect of Sox10 plus Pax3 was similar to the effect of Sox10 alone. Further, the mutation of the Pax3 site in pMITF (pMITF-Px3) did not impair the Sox10 responsiveness of the promoter (Fig.3 A). In total agreement with the previous report of Watanabe et al. (16Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we observed in NIH3T3 that Pax3 induces a 5-fold increase in MITF promoter activity. Combined action of Pax3 and Sox10 gave a 13-fold increase of the luciferase activity (Fig. 3 B). In these experiments, Pax3 expression was verified by using a Pax3 reporter gene (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar) (not shown). Thus, we did not observe any synergy between Pax3 and Sox10 but observed solely an additive effect. Finally, we wished to evaluate the functional consequences of Sox10 mutations found in WS4 patients (18Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D. Préhu M.O. Puliti A. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Smith G. Read A. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Three mutations schematized in Fig.4 A were studied. The WS095 mutant has an insertion of 6 nucleotides between 482 and 483 resulting in the addition of a leucine and an arginine in the high mobility group domain. In the mutant WS059, a deletion of two nucleotides in 1076 leads to frameshift and a premature stop codon. The resulting protein is deleted of its 106 amino-terminal amino acids. Finally, the MIC mutant results from a nonsense mutation at codon 189. First, we co-transfected B16 cells with both pMITF and an expression vector encoding wild type or mutant Sox10 constructs (Fig.4 B). The mutants used in our experiments showed a complete lack of effect on the MITF promoter, indicating that the mutations had invalidated the transcriptional activity of Sox10. Noteworthy, Sox-MIC induced a very reproducible inhibition (55%) of the basal MITF promoter activity, suggesting that this mutant inhibits the endogenous Sox10 activity and could function as a dominant negative mutant. The expressions of wild type and mutant Sox10 were verified by Western blot analysis of B16 cell extracts after transfection with the different constructs. Fig. 4 C shows an autoradiogram of a representative experiment. Sox-WT and the three mutants were consistently expressed at a very similar level. The endogenous Sox10 can be observed on a film exposed for a longer time. Recently, it has been reported that these three mutants have a nuclear localization and that Sox059 and Sox-MIC, but not Sox095, bind to DNA (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar). These mutations were reported to abolish the transcriptional activity of Sox10, because these mutants did not stimulate the expression of a reporter plasmid consisting of a minimal promoter and multiple Sox binding sites. Interestingly, two of these mutants, Sox-MIC and Sox059, have kept their ability to synergize with other transcription factors (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 237-250Crossref Google Scholar). However, according our results, Sox-MIC and Sox059 failed to stimulate pMITF, suggesting that the effect of Sox10 on the MITF promoter is mediated by its own transcriptional activity and not through cooperation with other endogenous transcription factors expressed in melanocytes. This is in total agreement with the lack of synergy observed between Sox10 and Pax3 in Fig. 3. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that Sox10 binds to theMITF promoter and stimulates its activity, whereas Sox10 mutants, found in WS4, are unable to do so. Because MITF controls melanocyte development, these observations give a clue to the auditory-pigmentary symptoms in Waardenburg type 4 syndrome that result from the absence of melanocytes in the affected organs. Sox10 joins Pax3, CREB, and LEF1 in the list of transcription factors that control MITF expression. The individual spacial-temporal involvement of these transcription factors in MITF expression now remains to be determined. Further, it will be necessary to investigate the possible relationship or cooperation existing between Sox10, Pax3, CREB, and LEF1. These future studies will allow us to fully understand the mechanisms that regulate MITF expression and thereby melanocyte development.

https://openalex.org/W2037794607,"The nature of the structural changes induced by histone acetylation at the different levels of chromatin organization has been very elusive. At the histone level, it has been proposed on several occasions that acetylation may induce an α-helical conformation of their acetylated N-terminal domains (tails). In an attempt to provide experimental support for this hypothesis, we have purified and characterized the tail of histone H4 in its native and mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra- acetylated form. The circular dichroism analysis of these peptides shows conclusively that acetylation does increase their α-helical content. Furthermore, the same spectroscopic analysis shows that this is also true for both the acetylated nucleosome core particle and the whole histone octamer in solution. In contrast to the native tails in which the α-helical organization appears to be dependent upon interaction of these histone regions with DNA, the acetylated tails show an increase in α-helical content that does not depend on such an interaction.

Allis C.D. Cell. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) has renewed interest in histone acetylation; however, the precise structural role of this important post-translational modification remains elusive. Initial hypotheses proposed that this modification was responsible for weakening histone-DNA interactions, thereby producing a more “open” chromatin conformation, but the situation does not appear to be that simple. At the chromatin fiber level, in the absence of linker histones, histone acetylation induces an extended chromatin conformation (2Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which is more amenable to transcription. However, when the full complement of histones is present, the extent of folding of the fiber does not appear to be greatly affected by this post-translational modification (3McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Rau D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 12: 4065-4075Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Dimitrov S. Makarov V. Apostolova T. Pashev I. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At the nucleosome level, the acetylated particle adopts a more asymmetric structure (5Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This is mainly the result of the DNA ends flanking this chromatin particle binding less tightly to the histones and adopting a stretched conformation (2Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As ionic strength is increased, acetylated histone tails are more readily released from DNA interaction(s) (7Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov J. Ausió J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) than their nonacetylated counterparts. This is as expected and is a consequence of the charge neutralization resulting from acetylation. However, under physiological ionic conditions, the histone tails are persistently bound (7Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov J. Ausió J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to the nucleosome regardless of the extent of acetylation. Thus, not surprisingly, the evidence in support of histone acetylation facilitating the binding of transcription factors to nucleosomally organized DNA has been very controversial (8Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 9Howe L. Ausió J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, it has recently been shown that binding of the developmental transcription factor HNF3, which preferentially binds to nucleosomal DNA, is not affected by histone acetylation (11Cirillo L.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A more recent hypothesis proposes that histone acetylation provides a histone code (12Strahl B.D. Allis D.C Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6533) Google Scholar). However, the structural changes associated with this code remain undefined. The tails of the core histones have been shown to adopt a helical conformation in nucleosomal DNA (13Baneres J.L. Martin A. Parelló J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it was not made clear whether the helical conformation preexisted in the histone tails or was a result of their interaction with DNA. Early studies (14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 20: 2944-2955Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have also indicated that histone acetylation increases the overall α-helical content of these proteins in a way that was not defined. Given the relevance of both acetylation and the histone tails in the processes of chromatin folding (2Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausió J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the regulation of gene expression (18Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we decided to determine the structural effect of acetylation on these histone domains. Finally, it has been recently postulated that the spacing of the acetylatable lysine residues of the H3-H4 histone tails is “reminiscent of that of an α -helix” (12Strahl B.D. Allis D.C Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6533) Google Scholar). This is an idea first proposed 30 years ago by Sung and Dixon (19Sung M.T. Dixon G.H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This paper represents the first experimental evidence that such a postulate is indeed correct. MSB cells (chicken erythroleukemic cells transformed by Marek's virus) were kindly provided to us by Dr. Vaughn Jackson. The cells were grown in 5% fetal calf, 5% newborn serum in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 mmHEPES, 30 mm bicarbonate, and 2 mm glutamine as described previously (20Peng H.F. Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12371-12382Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells where grown to a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml and then were harvested or incubated in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate for 20–22 h before harvesting. After harvesting (3800 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C), the cell pellets were suspended in 0.5 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 40% glycerol at a density of approximately 2 × 107 cells/ml, and the suspension was stored at −80 °C until further use. Chicken erythrocytes were used as a source of native and trypsinized nucleosomes. The cell suspension was thawed and centrifuged at 3800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mmMES1 (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, with or without 10 mm sodium butyrate) at a ratio of 5 ml/g of pellet using a disposable plastic transfer pipette. The suspension was then centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated once more, and the pellets were next resuspended in 20 ml of buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, with or without 10 mm sodium butyrate) and centrifuged under the same conditions described above. The nuclear pellets were resuspended again in buffer B (10 ml) using a transfer pipette, and the DNA concentration of the suspension was adjusted to A 260 = 40, using the same buffer. The DNA concentration was determined by lysing a small aliquot of the nuclear suspension in a 200-fold excess of distilled water followed by the addition of 10% SDS to a final concentration of 0.5%. The nuclear suspension was then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and digested at this temperature for an extra 5–6 min with micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) at 50 units/ml. The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 mmEDTA to a final EDTA concentration of 10 mm (on ice) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of this “fraction a” consists mainly of highly hyperacetylated mononucleosomes (usually containing 15–20 mg of DNA). This fraction was stored on ice in the presence of 1:100 (v/v) (protease inhibitor mixture; see below). The pellets were suspended in 15 ml each of buffer C (100 mm NaCl, 10 mmPipes (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2), with or without 10 mm sodium butyrate plus protease inhibitor mixture “Complete” from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; one pill was dissolved in 1 ml of water and used at 1:100 (v/v). The chromatin extraction was carried out by pipetting up and down with a 10-ml glass pipette until completely homogeneous. This was incubated for 30 min on ice with occasional vortexing and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to produce a supernatant (fraction b). This fraction usually yields 8–10 mg of DNA and consists of oligonucleosomes in which the histones are still highly hyperacetylated. The chromatin extraction was repeated once more but using buffer D (350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, with or without 10 mm sodium butyrate plus protease inhibitor) in the same way as for buffer C. This gives a poorly acetylated fraction that typically contains 20 mg of DNA. The compositions of the buffers are the same as those described by Perry and Chalkley (5Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3313-3318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken erythrocyte nucleosome core particles were prepared as described previously (22Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Trypsinized nucleosome core particles were also prepared as described previously (22Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) except thatl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin immobilized on beaded agarose was used (Pierce). Nucleosomes at an A 260 = 10 that had been dialyzed against buffer E (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) were mixed with a pre-equilibrated trypsin suspension (200p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester units per ml of suspension at a ratio of 1 ml of trypsin suspension/300A 260). For the equilibration of the trypsin suspension, the volume of suspension needed was washed by centrifugation five times with 3 volumes of buffer E. After the last wash, the nucleosome sample was added to the trypsin pellet and allowed to tumble for 50–60 min at room temperature. The immobilized trypsin was then removed by centrifugation, and the “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture was added to the supernatant in a 1:100 (v/v) ratio. The sample was then concentrated to an A 260 = 50–60 using a Centriprep-50 (Amicon-Millipore, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and loaded on a 5–20% sucrose gradient in buffer E and run at 100,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. After collection of the fractions, the nucleosome peak was dialyzed against buffer E containing 0.1 mm EDTA and was stored on ice until further use. Native PAGE for the analysis of nucleosomes and DNA was carried out as described in Ref. 23Yager T.D. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Acid-urea (AU) PAGE was carried out as described elsewhere (5Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fractions a, b, and c were brought to a final NaCl concentration of 350 mm by the addition of 5 m NaCl and were loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Gel HTP, DNA grade; Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) buffer (25Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Li W., S. Nagaraja G.P. Decluve M.J. Hendzel Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After loading the sample, the column was run overnight at room temperature in 0.35 m NaCl, 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), and the H2A-H2B and H3-H4 histones were eluted with a 0.35–2m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Columns of different sizes were used and eluted with a 6-column volume gradient at room temperature. The peak containing H3-H4 was exhaustively dialyzed at 4 °C against distilled water using Spectra/Por 3 membrane (Spectrum laboratories Inc., Houston, TX) and lyophilized. Histones H3 and H4 were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (27Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) on a Vydac C4(5 μm) 1.0 × 25-cm column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a 0–60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The peak containing the highly acetylated H4 fractions was lyophilized. Histone octamers (native, trypsinized, and acetylated) were prepared from their respective nucleosome counterparts. To this purpose, the nucleosome core particles (∼2–3 mg) in buffer E, prepared as described above were loaded onto small hydroxylapatite columns (1.0 × 6 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer. The column was washed with 2 volumes of 0.35m NaCl in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and the histone octamers were eluted with 2 m NaCl in the same buffer. Elution and loading were carried out at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Acetylated and control (nonacetylated) H4 were digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (EC 3.4.24.33) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in either 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.0) at room temperature with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:1500 (w/w). Endoproteinase Asp-N cleaves the protein at the N-terminal site of aspartic acid with differing specificity depending on pH. Immediately after digestion, the sample was directly loaded onto a reversed-phase HPLC Vydac C18(5-μm) 0.46 × 25-cm column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and was eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated H4 tail were collected and lyophilized. Amino acid analyses were carried out on an ABI model 420A derivatizer analyzer system as described elsewhere (28Carlos S. Jutglar L. Borrell J.I. Hunt D.F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption coefficient of the native core histones wasA 280 = 0.45 cm2mg−1 (14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 20: 2944-2955Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the native histone octamer (10.8 × 104 g/mol) and that of the trypsinized octamer (8.8 × 104 g/mol) were calculated from the amino acid sequences of the individual histones and from the data reported by Böhm and Crane-Robinson (29Böhm L. Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) on trypsinized histones as described in Ref. 22Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar. All of the analyses were carried out in triplicate. A value of 3200 cm−1mol−1 was used for the molar extinction coefficient of the histone tails (30Verdaguer N. Perelló M. Palau J. Subirana J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) at 205 nm. Using a comparative amino acid analysis with an internal norleucine standard, no significant variation of the extinction coefficient resulting from the addition of the acetyl groups could be detected at this wavelength. DNA concentrations were determined using A 260 = 20.0 cm2 mg−1. The molecular weight of the 145-base pair nucleosome core particle DNA was taken to be 9.6 × 104 g/mol. The absorption coefficient of the native nucleosome core particles was A 260 = 9.5 cm2 mg−1 (31Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and that of the trypsinized nucleosome core particles was A 260 = 10.5 cm2 mg−1. For this latter calculation, the absorption coefficient of the trypsinized histone octamer at 260 nm was considered to be the same as that of the native histone octamer (A 260 = 0.23 cm2 mg−1) (32Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (5Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The nucleosomes and the histone octamers were dialyzed against the different buffers described here. The histone tails were dissolved directly in the corresponding buffers or in 90% TFE. Nucleosome and DNA samples were analyzed in 1-cm path length cells, and histone and H4 tail spectra were taken in 0.1-cm cells. For the calculation of the mean residue molecular ellipticity [θ], an average M r value of 110.6 was used for the calculation of the main molecular residue ellipticity of the native histone octamer and 110.4 for the trypsinized histone octamer as determined from amino acid analysis of these two proteins. In the case of the histone H4 tail, M r values of 103.2, 105, 106.6, 108.4 and 110.2 were used for the non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated forms, respectively, as calculated from the amino acid sequence. The average M r (for a nucleotide) used for the DNA was 331. Secondary structure prediction was carried out with the help of the DNASTAR Program (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) using the Protean analysis system tool. Because core histones exhibit a very low β sheet structure (33Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Lowe W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 34Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar), the percentile of α-helix was calculated from either the values of the ellipticity [θ] at either 220 nm according to Ref. 30Verdaguer N. Perelló M. Palau J. Subirana J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar using the relation,α=8.9−2.4·[θ] 220·10−3Equation 1 or at 222 nm according to the following relation.α=−3.1(1+[θ] 222·10−3)Equation 2 In the latter case, the relation was also established on the assumption that only random coil and helical regions were present. An average random coil ellipticity value of [θ]222 = 1000° (35Bradbury E.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Rattle H.W.E. Boublik M. Sautière P.

For the α-helix, we used the average of the ellipticity values of helices of an average length of about 12 residues ([θ]222 = −30,000°) (36Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) and of α-helices of an average length of about 20 residues ([θ]222 = −35,500°) (37Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3310) Google Scholar) as it pertains to the histone fold structure (33Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Lowe W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc.

It was designed in a way that would allow analysis of the secondary structure of the histone octamer and selectively look at the conformation of its N-terminal domains (tails) in the presence or absence of interaction with the nucleosomal DNA.

A, native (4%) polyacrylamide gel of acetylated (n1), native (n2), and trypsinized (n3) nucleosome core particles and their corresponding constitutive DNA (d1,d2, and d3). dM is a DNA marker obtained by cutting pBR 322 with HhaI. B, SDS-PAGE of the acetylated (h1), native (h2), and trypsinized (h3) histones. hM are chicken erythrocyte histones used as a marker. Notice that the H3/H4 exhibit a slightly faster and more fuzzy appearance in this type of gel electrophoresis as a result of their acetylation levels (60Georgieva E.I. Sendra R. Anal.

The histone octamer has a strong contribution to the far UV region of the spectrum, whereas the DNA component exerts its main contribution in the near UV region (see Fig. 3 A,inset). The spectra of the trypsinized nucleosome and that of the native counterpart in the near UV region are identical to those reported earlier (22Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) with an ellipticity increase (∼17%) at the maximum (282.5 nm) within this region of the spectrum for the trypsinized nucleosomes. As is shown in Fig. 3 B, it is possible to subtract the DNA contribution to the far UV region of the spectrum from that of the nucleosome and obtain a protein spectrum that is very similar to the spectrum of the histone octamer in a high salt concentration solution (2 m NaCl) in which the histone octamer exists as a stable entity (33Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.-C. Lowe W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 38Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The similarity of the two spectra shown in this figure is remarkable. The ellipticity of the octamer in the nucleosome form was calculated from the concentration of nucleosomes using the absorption coefficient of DNA (A 260 = 20.0 cm2 mg−1) assuming 1 mol of histone/mol of DNA and using M r = 110.6. The ellipticity of the octamer in solution was calculated directly from the concentration of the protein using its absorption coefficient (14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 20: 2944-2955Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the histone octamer spectra are almost identical to those previously reported for the histone octamer in 2 m NaCl (14Prevelige Jr., P.E. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 20: 2944-2955Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From the ellipticity values at 222 nm and using Equations 1 and2, it is possible to estimate the amount of α-helix as 46.6 and 52.5%, respectively, for the histone octamer in the nucleosome and 43.7 and 48.7% for the histone octamer in 2 m NaCl. The values determined with Equation 2 compare very well with the value of 49.4% as determined from the crystallographic structure (34Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar), assuming that the regions not visualized in that analysis (see Fig.3 C) did not have any α-helical structure. Once it was established that the far UV region of the CD spectrum of the nucleosome core particle could be reliably used to determine the secondary structure of its constitutive histone octamer, we decided to analyze the changes in the histone octamer resulting from the removal of the histone tails by immobilized trypsin. It is interesting to note (see Fig. 3 A) that the far UV region of the spectrum of the nucleosome for both the native and the trypsinized core particles look very similar, despite the differences observed in the near UV region (see Fig. 3 A,inset). However, when this region of the spectrum for the trypsinized particles is normalized for the mass lost from the histone octamer as a result of trypsinization (see thin dashed line in Fig. 3 A), then there is an increase in the ellipticity at 222 nm that corresponds to an 11.6% increase in the α-helical content of the trypsinized histone octamer (see also Fig. 3 B). The α-helical content determined in this way is in good agreement with the corresponding value (62%) estimated from the crystallographic data (34Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar). When the value of the α-helical content (64.4%) for the trypsinized core is combined with that estimated for the whole molecule (52.8%) and taking into consideration their relative molecular masses, it is possible to estimate the α-helical content of the tail domains to be approximately 17%. This value is considerably lower than the value of 30–35% previously estimated (13Baneres J.L. Martin A. Parelló J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine if the α-helical conformation of the tails is a result of their interaction with the nucleosomal DNA as it has been routinely hypothesized (13Baneres J.L. Martin A. Parelló J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we looked at the ionic strength variation of the spectrum of native nucleosome core particles in the range of 25–600 mm NaCl. Nucleosome core particles retain their integrity within this range of salt concentration (31Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), while the histone tails are presumably released from their interaction with nucleosomal DNA as the ionic strength increases (39Walker I.O. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5622-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the near UV region of the spectra showed an increase at 282.5 nm, which is characteristic of the effect of the ionic strength increase within this range (22Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the far UV spectrum remained virtually unchanged, and we could not determine any significant changes in the [θ]222 at any of the salt concentrations analyzed (results not shown). It has been shown that the protein environment significantly affects the amino acid preference for secondary structure (40Zhong L. Johnson Jr., W.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, the ionic environment and the electrostatic interactions of the histone tails with the nucleosomal DNA may have an important impact on the structure adopted"

Overexpression of BRCA1 was shown to induce an apoptotic signaling pathway involving the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but the signaling steps upstream and downstream of JNK were not delineated. To better understand the role of BRCA1 in apoptosis, we examined the effect of wild-type and C-terminal-truncated dominant negative BRCA1 on breast and ovarian cancer cell lines subjected to a number of different pro-apoptotic stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal, substratum detachment, ionizing radiation, and treatment with anticancer agents. All of these treatments were found to induce substantial levels of apoptosis in the presence of wild-type BRCA1, whereas dominant negative BRCA1 truncation mutants diminished the apoptotic response. Subsequent mapping of the apoptotic pathway induced by growth factor withdrawal demonstrated that BRCA1 enhanced signaling through a pathway that sequentially involved H-Ras, MEKK4, JNK, Fas ligand/Fas interactions, and caspase-9 activation. In addition, the pathway functioned independently of the p53 tumor suppressor. These data suggest that BRCA1 is an important modulator of the response to cellular stress and that loss of this apoptotic potential due to BRCA1 mutations may contribute to tumor development.

Several observations also support a role for BRCA1 in regulation of transcription. BRCA1 activates the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter in cells that contain wild-type or mutant p53 (19Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras H. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the mechanisms by which BRCA1 regulates cell cycle and suppresses growth is through the induction of p21. Additionally, BRCA1 binds the CtIP transcriptional repressor that inhibits BRCA1-mediated activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (20Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), interacts with CBP/p300 (21Pao G.M. Janknecht R. Ruffner H. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These data imply that BRCA1 might be directly involved in transcriptional activation of specific genes. A growing body of evidence has also implicated BRCA1 in the preservation of genome integrity. Initial studies demonstrated that BRCA1 binds to the RAD50 and RAD51 DNA repair proteins (10Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 23Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). More recent studies have implicated BRCA1 in transcription-coupled repair (24Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and double strand DNA break repair (25Scully R. Ganesan S. Vlasakova K. Chen J. Socolovsky M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1093-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In accord with a possible role for BRCA1 in repair (or the control of repair), breast tumors from patients with BRCA1 germ-line mutations contain 2- to 3-fold more chromosomal rearrangements than sporadic cancers. Consistent with the proposed role of BRCA1 as a tumor suppressor, it has been observed that BRCA1 inhibits breast and ovarian cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in an experimental tumor model (7Holt J.T. Thompson M.E. Szabo C. Robinson-Benion C. Arteaga C.L. King M.C. Jensen R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Conversely, selective reduction of BRCA1 mRNA levels using antisense RNA also induces more rapid cell growth and promotes cell transformation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (7Holt J.T. Thompson M.E. Szabo C. Robinson-Benion C. Arteaga C.L. King M.C. Jensen R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Whether the effects of BRCA1 on transcription and genome maintenance are sufficient to explain these results have been unclear. However, several recent reports have suggested that BRCA1 might also play a role in induction of apoptosis. Shao and colleagues (8Shao N. Chai Y.L. Shyam E. Reddy P. Rao V.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) reported that expression of BRCA1 in mouse fibroblast and human breast cancer cell lines resulted in apoptosis in response to serum deprivation or calcium ionophore treatment. BRCA1-expressing prostate cancer DU-145 cells were subsequently shown to be susceptible to drug-induced apoptosis (27Fan S. Wang J.A. Yuan R. Ma Y.X. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Brody L.C. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3069-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently, Harkin and colleagues (28Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) demonstrated that BRCA1 expression can induce apoptosis through activation of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK). In the present study, we have further delineated the relationship between BRCA1 and JNK-dependent apoptotic signaling in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. We provide evidence that BRCA1 modulates stress-induced apoptotic signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves the H-Ras proto-oncogene, MEKK4, JNK, Fas (CD95)/FasL interactions, and activation of procaspase-8. In addition, we present evidence for dominant negative activity of BRCA1 mutants in the context of this apoptotic response.

The MCF7, T47D, and OV177 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, RPMI 1640, and α-minimal essential medium, respectively. Each of these was supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) p53−/− and MCF7 HPV16 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and the additives listed above. Cells were plated (1 × 106 cells) into 100-mm dishes, allowed to adhere overnight, and then transiently transfected with 10 μg of either the full-length BRCA1 or mutant BRCA1 expression constructs along with 2.5 μg of the GFP expression plasmid, pEGFP-N1 using the Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection system. After 24 h, GFP-expressing cells were isolated by FACS and replated. Cells sorted for GFP expression were replated in 6-well plates and incubated in the presence or absence of serum for 24 h. Alternatively, the transfected cells were grown in 100-mm plates and subjected to 10 or 20 grays of γ-irradiation using a 137Cs source (J. L. Shepard) delivering 103 centigrays/min. Cells were harvested after 8, 16, or 24 h. In some experiments, transfected cells were treated for 24 h with 100 nm paclitaxel, a concentration previously demonstrated to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells (30Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L.

Cell death was determined by two-color flow cytometry after staining of cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin V and PI using a Becton Dickinson FacsCaliber. Cells that were Annexin V-positive and PI-negative were considered apoptotic. Apoptosis was also measured by quantitation of nuclei containing subdiploid amounts of DNA. In this latter method, cells were lysed in HFS (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml PI); subdiploid nuclei were counted by flow cytometry. For both of these flow cytometry methods, at least 10,000 gated events were recorded for each sample. Data were analyzed by Winlist and WinMDI software (Variety Software House, Topsham, ME). After transfection with empty vector, full-length BRCA1, or mutant BRCA1, cells were collected and lysed using EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate with protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (20 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml)). For immunoblotting, equal concentrations (100 μg) of whole cell extract were loaded per lane, resolved in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% BSA in TBS-T (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (66046E BRCA1 C-terminal and 66036E BRCA1 N-terminal) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in TBS-T containing 1% BSA and 0.1% azide. After several washes with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution in 1% BSA/TBS-T. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. To assess the effect of BRCA1 overexpression on Fas, FasL, and caspases, aliquots containing 1 × 106 cells transfected with vector, full-length BRCA1, or BRCA1Δ5382-insC mutant, were incubated for 24 h in the presence and absence of serum. Cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (80 ng/ml), leupeptin (40 ng/ml), pepstatin (40 ng/ml), chymostatin (40 ng/ml), and antipain (40 ng/ml). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell supernatants were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. To study the functional properties of BRCA1, we transiently overexpressed full-length BRCA1 cDNA or pCR3.1 empty vector in two breast (MCF7 and T47D) and one ovarian (OV177) cancer cell line. Western blot analysis using the C-terminal anti-BRCA1 (66046E) antibody showed a 7- to 8-fold increase in BRCA1 protein on BRCA1 transfection when compared with the endogenous BRCA1 level in all three cell lines used in this study (Fig.1 A). To evaluate the effect of BRCA1 overexpression on cellular apoptosis, we cotransfected cells with BRCA1 or pCR3.1 and GFP, enriched for transfected cells by sorting for GFP-positive cells, incubated the transfected cells under various conditions for an additional 24 h, and then measured apoptosis using Annexin V and PI. Cells exposed to normal growth conditions (Fig.1 B, +Serum) demonstrated a 6- to 7-fold increase in Annexin V positivity when transfected with BRCA1 as compared with empty vector. For example, 17 ± 2% of BRCA1-transfected MCF7 cells were apoptotic, whereas only 2.5 ± 1% of vector-transfected MCF7 cells were apoptotic under the same conditions. These results suggest that increased levels of wild-type BRCA1 increase the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in the three cell lines. To further examine the effect of BRCA1 expression on cellular apoptosis, cells were exposed to various apoptotic stimuli, including serum withdrawal, γ-irradiation, and treatment with paclitaxel. Staining with Annexin V and PI revealed that 13 ± 1%, 17 ± 2%, and 11 ± 1% of the vector-transfected MCF7, T47D, and OV177 cells, respectively, were apoptotic 24 h after removal of serum. In contrast, 42 ± 4%, 53 ± 4%, and 39 ± 3% of the BRCA1-transfected MCF7, T47D, and OV177 cells were apoptotic after serum withdrawal (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, forced overexpression of BRCA1 enhanced the amount of apoptosis observed after treatment with γ-irradiation (Fig. 1 C) and paclitaxel (Fig.1 D). These results suggest that expression of BRCA1 facilitates the response of breast and ovarian cancer cells to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. To further evaluate the role of BRCA1 in apoptosis, we transiently transfected the wild-type BRCA1 and the pCR3.1 vector into HCC1937 cells, which express only the 5382insC-truncated form of BRCA1. When these cells were incubated in the presence and absence of serum for 24 h, the pCR3.1-transfected cells displayed only minor levels of apoptosis (<3%) (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, ectopic expression of BRCA1 at levels that exceeded the expression level of the endogenous BRCA1Δ5382-insC-truncated protein (inset, Fig.1 E) increased the rate of apoptosis in the presence of serum to 10%, and to 38% upon serum withdrawal (Fig. 1 E). The low levels of spontaneous and serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in the absence of full-length BRCA1 suggest that BRCA1 plays an important role in this apoptotic process. To further explore the role of BRCA1 in cellular apoptosis, we transiently transfected the BRCA1Δ5382-insC mutant construct, containing a common BRCA1 mutation found in BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer families, into both breast and ovarian cancer cells. Immunoblotting with anti-BRCA1 66036E antibody, directed to the N-terminal portion of BRCA1, revealed that the truncated BRCA1Δ5382-insC protein was expressed at levels that equaled or exceeded the levels of ectopically expressed or endogenous wild-type BRCA1 protein (Fig. 2 A). Under these conditions, the BRCA1Δ5382-insC protein diminished serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis associated with endogenous levels of BRCA1 (Fig. 2 B). In addition, when expressed in stoichiometric amounts, the BRCA1Δ5382-insC mutant blocked spontaneous and growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis associated with ectopic expression of wild-type BRCA1 (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were also observed in T47D and OV177 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of another BRCA1 mutant (BRCA1Δ5677-insA) also abolished BRCA1-induced apoptosis in both breast and ovarian cancer cells (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that BRCA1 expression induces apoptosis in breast and ovarian cancer cells and that mutations in BRCA1 that commonly remove the C terminus, block this induction. Harkin et al. (28Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that BRCA1-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of JNK/SAPK. However, signaling pathways upstream of JNK/SAPK, or the downstream targets of JNK/SAPK, were not identified. To assess the role of JNK signaling in BRCA1-dependent serum starvation-induced apoptosis, we investigated the involvement of other components of MAPK signaling pathways. MCF7 and OV177 cells were transfected with pCR3.1 vector, full-length BRCA1 or BRCA1Δ5382-insC, sorted, and cultured in the presence and absence of serum for 24 h. Cell lysates prepared from these cells were subjected to immunoblotting with antisera that recognize phosphorylated species of MEKK1, MEKK4, and JNK. BRCA1 overexpression did not alter MEKK1 phosphorylation (data not shown) but did result in increased levels of phospho-MEKK4 and phospho-JNK, which were increased even further after growth factor withdrawal (Fig.3, A and B). Conversely, the BRCA1Δ5382-insC mutant, which failed to induce apoptosis (Fig. 2 B), failed to induce phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). Further evidence that activation of these kinases plays a critical role in BRCA1-dependent serum withdrawal-triggered apoptosis came from the observation that expression of dn-MKK4 or dn-JNK completely blocked BRCA1-dependent apoptosis in both MCF7 and OV177 cells in the presence and absence of serum (Figs. 3, C–E). In contrast, dominant negative forms of MEKK1 and MKK7 did not affect BRCA1-dependent apoptosis either in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that JNK and its upstream activators MKK4 and MEKK4 are required for BRCA1-dependent apoptosis after serum withdrawal. A number of activators of MEKK proteins have been identified previously, including Ha-Ras (31Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although Ras appears to play a major role in cell survival and proliferation, a role in induction of apoptosis has also been reported (32Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 33Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Ras in BRCA1-dependent growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis, MCF7 and OV177 cells were transiently co-transfected with BRCA1 and a dominant negative form of H-Ras (Ras N17). Expression of Ras N17 resulted in complete abrogation of BRCA1-dependent apoptosis in the presence and absence of serum starvation (data not shown). Collectively, these observations suggest that BRCA1 facilitates apoptotic signaling through a Ras/MEKK4/MKK4/JNK pathway. Recent reports have suggested a role for Fas and FasL in neuronal apoptosis following nerve growth factor withdrawal (34Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition, JNK has been shown to up-regulate the FasL promoter by activation of the c-Jun and ATF2 transcription factors (35Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When combined with the results from the experiments described above, these observations suggest that Fas and FasL play a role in BRCA1-dependent apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal. To evaluate this hypothesis, MCF7 and OV177 cells were transiently transfected with pCR3.1, full-length BRCA1, or BRCA1Δ5382-insC, sorted, incubated in the presence and absence of serum for 24 h, and immunoblotted for Fas and FasL. BRCA1 expression up-regulated both Fas and FasL in MCF7 and OV177 cells (Fig.4, A and B), and the levels of these proteins were further enhanced by serum withdrawal (Fig. 4, A and B). Conversely, BRCA1Δ5382-insC completely blocked induction of Fas and FasL by endogenous and ectopically expressed BRCA1 in both cell lines (Fig. 4, Aand B). To further evaluate the role of Fas, Fas-L, and the adaptor protein FADD in this apoptotic signaling pathway, MCF7 and OV177 cells transfected with BRCA1 and the vector control were incubated with ZB4 or Nok2 in the presence and absence of serum. The Nok2 and ZB4 monoclonal antibodies bind to the Fas receptor and prevent cross-linking by Fas-L. Both of these antibodies abolished BRCA1-induced apoptosis in the presence and absence of serum (Fig.4 C). Likewise, co-expression of a dominant negative version of the adaptor protein FADD, or MC159, a Molluscum contagiosum viral inhibitor of FADD signaling (36Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y. Banks S. Wang G.H. Senkevich T.G. Alnemri E.S. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. Tomaselli K.J. Cohen J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), with BRCA1 abolished BRCA1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that the BRCA1-dependent apoptosis in response to serum deprivation is Fas-dependent and that mutant BRCA1 blocks this apoptotic signaling pathway in both breast and ovarian cancer cells. Two pathways of Fas-dependent caspase activation have been described (37Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

One involves recruitment of caspase-8 followed by direct activation of effector caspases, whereas the second involves activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of the Bcl-2 family member Bid to yield a fragment that induces release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent activation of effector caspases through the Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway (39Budihardjo I.

The N terminus of CCR5, which contains several sulfated tyrosines, plays a critical role in the CD4-dependent association of gp120 with CCR5 and in viral entry. Here we demonstrate that a tyrosine-sulfated peptide based on the N terminus of CCR5, but not its unsulfated analogue, inhibits infection of macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by CCR5-dependent, but not CXCR4-dependent, HIV-1 isolates.

Moreover, this peptide inhibited the precipitation of gp120 by 48d and 23e antibodies, which recognize CD4-inducible gp120 epitopes, but not by several other antibodies that recognize proximal epitopes. The ability of the sulfated peptide to block 48d association with gp120 was dependent in part on seven tropism-determining residues in the third variable (V3) and fourth conserved (C4) domains of gp120.

We have shown that some or all of the tyrosines in this region are post-translationally modified by the addition of a sulfate moiety and that these sulfate moieties contribute substantially to the association of gp120-soluble CD4 (sCD4) complexes with CCR5 and to the ability of CCR5 to support HIV-1 infection (20Farzan M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).Here we report that a peptide derived from the N terminus of CCR5 in which two of its four tyrosines have been modified by sulfate, but not an equivalent peptide lacking these sulfates, interacts in a specific manner with CCR5 ligands, including HIV-1 gp120. Moreover, by using gp120-directed antibodies and a chimeric gp120 glycoprotein, we have localized the site on gp120 with which the sulfated CCR5 peptide interacts.RESULTSOur previous work demonstrated that the N terminus of CCR5 contains 2–4 sulfate moieties that modify tyrosine 3 and 1–3 tyrosines at residues 10, 14, and 15 (20). The study of CCR5 variants in which all but one tyrosine were altered to aspartic acid revealed that constructs containing tyrosine 3, 10, or 14 were most efficiently sulfated. In contrast, when the same constructs were assayed for their coreceptor activity, constructs containing tyrosines at positions 10, 14, or 15 were shown to be most efficient at supporting HIV-1 entry. Thus, because pure preparations of sulfated peptides could be obtained best with peptides containing two or fewer non-adjacent sulfates (data not shown), we assayed a peptide that included the first 22 residues of the N terminus of CCR5, in which tyrosines 10 and 14 were sulfated and cysteine 20 had been altered to a serine. We refer hereafter to this peptide as the S-peptide, indicating that it is tyrosine sulfated. We also synthesized an unsulfated analogue of this peptide, which we refer to as the C-peptide, for the fact that it is a CCR5-derived control for the S-peptide.We first assayed the ability of these peptides to inhibit the entry of recombinant HIV-1 viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the R5 isolate ADA, the dual tropic (R5X4) isolate 89.6, and the X4 isolate HXBc2. As controls, we used recombinant HIV-1 viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of either the amphotropic murine leukemia virus or the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. As shown in Fig. 1 A, entry of the various pseudotyped viruses into human PBMC was not significantly altered by incubation with the C-peptide as compared with peptide-free buffer alone. However, the S-peptide substantially inhibited the entry of viruses pseudotyped with the ADA envelope glycoproteins. No consistent effect of the S-peptide was observed for viruses pseudotyped with the HXBc2 envelope glycoproteins or with the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope glycoproteins. The inability of the S-peptide to inhibit entry of viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the HXBc2 isolate is consistent with the inability of this isolate to utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor.The infection of primary human macrophages by viruses pseudotyped with the R5 ADA or the R5X4 89.6 envelope glycoproteins was inhibited by the S-peptide but unaffected by the C-peptide (Fig. 1 B). The control virus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was not affected by either peptide. We conclude that the entry of R5 HIV-1 isolates could be inhibited by the S-peptide but not the C-peptide; thus, the sulfate moieties on the S-peptide are critical for the ability of this peptide to block CCR5-dependent HIV-1 entry.Complexes of sCD4 and the gp120 molecules of R5 or R5X4 isolates specifically bind CCR5-expressing cells (6Wu L.

We incubated metabolically labeled gp120 from the R5 HIV-1 isolates ADA and YU2 with sCD4 in the presence of either the S-peptide or the C-peptide (Fig.2, A and B). The S-peptide inhibited the ability of ADA gp120/sCD4 complexes to associate with CCR5-expressing Cf2Th cells, whereas no significant inhibition was observed with the C-peptide (Fig.2 A). Approximately 50% inhibition was observed by phosphorimaging at an S-peptide concentration of 50 μm, suggesting that the affinity of this peptide for gp120/sCD4 complexes is in this range. Similar data was obtained using gp120 molecules of the R5 HIV-1 isolate YU2 (Fig. 2 B). No binding of the YU2 gp120 molecule to Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells, which do not express CCR5, was observed, even in the presence of sCD4. We conclude that the S-peptide inhibits the association of gp120/sCD4 complexes with CCR5.Figure 2The sulfated N-terminal CCR5 peptide blocks association of the gp120 glycoprotein of R5 HIV-1 isolates with CCR5. A and B, 50 ng of radiolabeled gp120 from the R5 isolates ADA (A) or YU2 (B) and 500 ng of sCD4 were incubated with the indicated concentrations of the S-peptide (S) or the C-peptide (C) or with peptide-free buffer (−). The peptide/gp120/sCD4 mixtures were then incubated with Cf2Th-CCR5 or Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells (indicated by +CCR5 or CXCR4, respectively). Cells were washed and lysed, and radiolabeled gp120 was precipitated with a mixture of sera from HIV-1 infected individuals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. C, Cf2Th-CCR5 cells were incubated with 0.2 nm125I-MIP-1α and peptide buffer alone (no peptide), 200 μm C-peptide, 200 μm S-peptide, or 200 nm unlabeled MIP-1α. As a control, 0.2 nm125I-MIP-1α was also incubated with Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells lacking CCR5 (indicated asno CCR5). Cells were washed, and bound 125I was quantified by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also assessed the ability of the S-peptide to block the association of MIP-1α, a natural chemokine ligand of CCR5, with CCR5-expressing cells (Fig. 2 C). Radiolabeled MIP-1α (0.2 nm) was incubated with Cf2Th-CCR5 cells in the presence of peptide-free buffer, 200 μm C- or S-peptide, or 200 nm unlabeled MIP-1α. Cf2Th-CXCR4 cells were also included as a control and bound minimal amounts of radiolabeled MIP-1α. The C-peptide had no effect on the ability of radiolabeled MIP-1α to bind CCR5-expressing cells, whereas the S-peptide partially inhibited this association. Inhibition of MIP-1α binding to Cf2Th cells by the S-peptide was much less efficient than that by unlabeled MIP-1α.To study regions on the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein that interact with the CCR5 N terminus, we measured the ability of the S- and C-peptides to block the precipitation of gp120 by anti-gp120 antibodies. It has been shown that antibodies such as 17b and 48d bind to discontinuous, CD4-induced gp120 epitopes near the CCR5-binding domain of gp120 (6Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Paralin C.

As shown in Fig. 3,A–C, the S-peptide, but not the C-peptide, interfered with the ability of the 48d antibody to precipitate the gp120 envelope glycoproteins of the R5 HIV-1 isolates ADA and YU2, but not those of the X4 isolate HXBc2. This inhibition was observed in the presence and, to a lesser degree, in the absence of sCD4 (Fig. 3, Aand B).Figure 3Binding of the CD4-induced antibody 48d is blocked by the tyrosine-sulfated peptide. Radiolabeled gp120 from the R5 isolates ADA and YU2 and the X4 isolate HXBc2 was incubated with or without soluble CD4 as indicated and 200 μm S-peptide (S) or C-peptide (C) or with peptide-free buffer (−).

As shown in Fig. 4 A, neither the S-peptide nor the C-peptide interfered with the ability of the IgG1b12 and F105 antibodies, which are directed against the CD4-binding site (28Posner M.R. Cavacini L.A. Emes C.L. Power J. Byrn R. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1993; 6: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roben P. Moore J.P. Thali M. Sodroski J. Barbas C.F. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to precipitate gp120. Similarly, neither peptide interfered with the precipitation of gp120 by the loop2 and 39f antibodies directed against the tip of the gp120 V3 loop (27Barbas III, C.F. Collet T.A. Amberg W. Roben P. Binley J.M. Hoekstra D. Cababa D. Jones T.M. Williamson R.A. Pilkington G.R. Haigwood N.L. Cabezas E. Satterthwait A.C. Sanz I. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 812-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Among the set of antibodies (17b, A32, 48d, 23e) whose epitope is enhanced by sCD4 association with gp120, only precipitation of gp120 by the 48d and 23e antibodies could be inhibited by the S-peptide. In both cases the association of gp120 with sCD4 enhanced this inhibition. Other CD4-induced antibodies, including A32 and, surprisingly, 17b, precipitated gp120 efficiently in the presence of the S- and C-peptides. Because all of the monoclonal antibodies tested exhibit similar affinities for soluble gp120 monomers (26Moore J.P. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1863-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that the binding site of the S-peptide overlaps the 48d and 23e epitopes, but not those of the other antibodies tested.Figure 4The sulfated CCR5 peptide interacts with a CD4-induced epitope of gp120 that includes tropism determinants in the V3 and C4 regions of gp120. A, the gp120 glycoprotein of the R5 isolate ADA was incubated with the indicated antibodies in the presence of peptide-free buffer, the C-peptide (gray bars), or the S-peptide (black bars). The mixtures were then precipitated with the indicated antibodies, and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Precipitation by the 17b, A32, 48d, and 23e antibodies, which recognize CD4-induced gp120 epitopes, was performed in the presence or absence of excess soluble CD4 as indicated. Antibodies IgG1b12 and F105 recognize the CD4-binding site of gp120. Antibodies loop2 and 39f recognize the tip of the V3 loop of gp120. The values shown represent the percentage of gp120 precipitated relative to that observed in the presence of peptide-free buffer. B, the gp120 glycoproteins of the R5 isolate ADA, the X4 isolate MN, and the R5 MN(ADA) chimera were incubated with soluble CD4 in the presence of buffer alone, the C-peptide (gray bars), or the S-peptide (black bars). The mixtures were precipitated with the anti-gp120 antibody 48d, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The values shown represent the percentage of gp120 precipitated relative to that observed in the presence of peptide-free buffer, as quantified by phosphorimaging.

Residues that vary between the ADA and MN isolates are shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize the binding site of the S-peptide further, we assayed its ability to block precipitation of the gp120 glycoprotein from an X4 isolate, MN, and from an MN variant, MN(ADA), by the 48d antibody. MN(ADA) is a variant of MN that had been converted to an R5 phenotype by the substitution of seven gp120 residues in the V3 and C4 regions with those of the ADA isolate 3H. Choe, unpublished data. (Fig. 4 C). The 48d antibody efficiently precipitated the gp120/sCD4 complexes derived from the ADA and MN isolates and the MN(ADA) chimera (Fig. 4 B). The S-peptide did not interfere with the precipitation of the MN envelope glycoprotein complexed with sCD4. By contrast, the S-peptide inhibited the precipitation by the 48d antibody of the MN(ADA) gp120/sCD4 complexes, although less efficiently than it interfered with precipitation of ADA gp120/sCD4 complexes. These data indicate that the binding of the S-peptide to gp120/sCD4 complexes depends on a small number of gp120 residues in the N- and C-terminal bases of the third variable loop and/or a single residue in the C4 region. Notably, of these changes, the only alteration to a positive charge, which could complement the net four negative charges on the S-peptide, occurs in the C4 residue (glutamic acid 440 to arginine) (Fig.4 C).DISCUSSIONThe N terminus of CCR5, in particular a tyrosine-rich region in this N terminus, plays a critical role in the ability of HIV-1 to enter CCR5-expressing cells (20Farzan M.

Some or all of the tyrosines in this region are modified by the addition of a sulfate group, and we have previously demonstrated that the presence of these sulfate moieties substantially contributes to the ability of CCR5 to support viral entry (20Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).The ability of a sulfated peptide derived from the N terminus of CCR5, but not its unsulfated analogue, to inhibit the association of HIV-1 gp120 with CCR5 and to block HIV-1 entry supports the assertion that sulfated tyrosines and the sulfate moieties themselves contribute to a specific interaction of the CCR5 N terminus with gp120. Similar conclusions were reached by Cormier et al. (36Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), who reported that CCR5-derived peptides containing at least two sulfated tyrosines could inhibit the entry of an R5 HIV-1 isolate. Of interest, a CCR5 peptide in which a single tyrosine was modified by sulfate either at position 10 or 14 did not inhibit the association of gp120/CD4 complexes with CCR5 (36Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), indicating that both sulfate moieties of the S-peptide contribute to the inhibitory activities described here.The relatively high concentrations necessary for observable inhibition of gp120-CCR5 interactions suggest a low affinity (∼50 μm) of the peptide for gp120/sCD4 complexes. This affinity is approximately 103-104-fold lower than that measured for the gp120-sCD4 interaction with native CCR5 on the cell surface (6Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Paralin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardosa A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 184: 179-183Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 7Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). This affinity difference is consistent with additional roles for other CCR5 domains in the interaction with gp120 (24Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Broder C.C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Cell. 1996; 87: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and with the high entropic barrier that a relatively disordered peptide must overcome in binding gp120. Compared with inhibition of gp120-CCR5 binding, even higher concentrations of S-peptide were required to inhibit the entry of R5 viruses. This probably reflects the fact that virus entry, unlike the gp120-CCR5 binding assay, involves oligomeric gp120 contacts with multiple CCR5 proteins and is assisted by virus association with the cell surface via CD4 and possibly other adhesion molecules.Similar concentrations of the S-peptide less efficiently inhibited the association of the chemokine MIP-1α with CCR5, as compared with gp120-CCR5 inhibition. This may be a consequence of the lower intrinsic affinity (apparently >200 μm) of the S-peptide for MIP-1α or may reflect the possibility that S-peptide/MIP-1α complexes retain the ability to bind CCR5. The observed inhibition is consistent with a role for sulfated tyrosines in the MIP-1α/CCR5 association (20Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The less effective inhibition is consistent with a greater dependence of MIP-1α binding, relative to that of gp120, on the second extracellular loop of CCR5 (35Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F.

Notably, this competition was observed, albeit to a lesser degree, in the absence of soluble CD4, suggesting that the N terminus of CCR5 can interact to some extent with gp120 in the absence of CD4.

A prominent form of spontaneous damage arises through hydrolytic deamination of bases carrying exo-cyclic amino groups such as cytosine and 5-methylcytosine. Deamination of cytosine in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)1 generates a uracil·guanine mispair and, similarly, deamination of 5-methycytosine generates a thymine·guanine mispair. In vitro, both events occur at appreciable rates, with 5-methylcytosine deamination being slightly faster than that of cytosine (1Ehrlich M. Zhang X.Y. Inamdar N.M. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and, in vivo, both deamination products are mutagenic and will produce C→T transitions upon DNA replication, if left unrepaired. Whereas accurate repair of G·U mispairs is mediated by enzymes that specifically recognize and process uracil in DNA, e.g. uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) (2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar), correction of G·T mispairs to G·C base pairs requires a repair function that is able to discriminate between a mutagenic thymine in a G·T mismatch and a normal thymine base-paired with adenine. A G·T mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase activity was discovered in HeLa cell extracts (3Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was purified to apparent homogeneity (4Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the encoding cDNA was cloned (5Neddermann P.

The biochemical properties of this thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) are compatible with a function of the enzyme in cellular defense against mutagenesis by cytosine and 5-methylcytosine deamination. It is capable of recognizing G·T and G·U mismatches in DNA and initiating their restoration to G·C base pairs through a base excision repair process involving DNA polymerase β (6Wiebauer K.

Two bacterial open reading frames with significant homology to the central part of human TDG were discovered, and expression of theEscherichia coli homologue produced an enzyme with G·U mismatch-dependent uracil DNA glycosylase activity but no G·T mismatch processing activity (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This protein was, therefore, named Mug for mismatch-specific uracil DNA-glycosylase. Deletion analysis of the human enzyme revealed that its conserved central domain is sufficient for G·U but not for G·T processing activity and that additional non-conserved amino acid residues of the N terminus are required for G·T processing (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). More recent evidence suggested a wider range of possible substrates and functions for TDG homologues. Both the E. coli and the human enzymes were found to efficiently process a mutagenic cyclic adduct of cytosine, 3,N 4-ethenocytosine (εC), which arises in DNA as a consequence of lipid peroxidation or the exposure to chemical carcinogens such as vinyl chloride (10Hang B. Medina M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A vertebrate homologue of TDG was reported to copurify with a 5-methylcyotsine DNA glycosylase activity from extracts of chicken embryos and to have weak 5-methylcytosine glycosylase activity when purified as a recombinant protein from overexpressing bacteria (12Zhu B.

Furthermore, a different line of investigation revealed physical and functional interactions of mammalian TDG with retinoid receptors and, therefore, implicated a role in nuclear receptor-mediated control of transcription (13Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of E. coli Mug was analyzed by x-ray crystallography and resolved at a resolution of 1.8 Å (14Barrett T.B. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This revealed striking structural similarities between Mug and the functionally related uracil DNA glycosylases, despite very limited conservation at the amino acid sequence level. Similar to uracil DNA glycosylase, Mug forms an active site pocket, which penetrates into the core of the enzyme. The inferred catalytic mechanism for Mug suggests that the mispaired base to be released is flipped out of the DNA double helix and accommodated within the active site pocket in a manner that allows the N-glycosidic bond to be hydrolytically attacked by an activated water molecule. Positioning of the water molecule is coordinated by the Asn-40 of the highly conserved putative active site motif GINPGL. Base flipping by Mug is accompanied by intercalation of a 3-amino acid wedge into the DNA double helix. The less-conserved intercalating residues around Gly-143 occupy the abandoned space opposite the guanine and maintain the base-stacking interactions to avoid the bases flanking the flipped-out residue collapsing on each other. A notable difference to the mechanism employed by uracil DNA glycosylase (15Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) is that the Mug residues involved in helix intercalation engage in specific complementary DNA strand interactions in a way that mimics hydrogen bonding to the widowed guanine (14Barrett T.B.

Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test the functional predictions from the Mug crystal structure on the human TDG and to better understand the structural relationship between different TDG homologues, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues and examined the biochemical activities of the mutant proteins. We were able to separate the DNA glycosylase and the substrate interaction functions in human TDG by mutating the implicated residues Asn-140 and Met-269. By studying the differential effects of the amino acid substitutions on binding and excision of thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil opposite guanine, we found the relative inefficiency of TDG in G·T versus G·U processing to be a consequence of both a lower G·T binding affinity and a lower catalytic efficiency in thymine release. We further established experimental evidence for the importance of stable complementary strand interactions by human TDG as compensation for its comparably poor hydrolytic potential. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Switzerland). The substrate oligonucleotides were polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified after synthesis. Restriction enzymes and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor were supplied by New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and the UDG was supplied by Roche Diagnostics (Switzerland). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma (Switzerland). pPRS202b: pQE30 (Qiagen, Germany), containing a BamHI and SalI polymerase chain reaction fragment of full-length cDNA encoding human TDG, was cloned into the respective restriction sites (polymerase chain reaction primers were: BamATG, 5′-GCACGTGGATCCATGGAAGCGGAGAACGCG-3′; TAASal, 5′-CCGTGTCGACTTAAGCATGGCTTTCTTCTTCCTG-3′). This cloning strategy generates a 6-histidine-TDG fusion open reading frame downstream of a promoter-operator element consisting of phage T5 promoter and two lac operator sequences. The plasmids encoding mutant proteins were as follows. pPRS203b: N140A mutant; pPRS204b: N140D mutant; pPRS205: M269H mutant; pPRS209: A145S mutant. In vitro mutagenesis of human TDG was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pPRS202b served as template for mutagenesis, and the oligonucleotide primers used to generate the individual mutations were as follows (sense strand sequences shown only): hsTDG-N140D: 5′-GTCATTATTGGCATAGACCCGGGACTAATGGC-3′; hsTDG-A145S: 5′-CCCGGGACTAATGTCTGCTTACAAAGGGC-3′; hsTDG-N140A: 5′-GTCATTATTGGCATAGCCCCGGGACTAATGGC-3′; hsTDG-M269H-u: 5′-GAAACTCTCTGCTATGTTCATCCATCATCCAGTGC-3′. Expression constructs for the individual TDG variants were cotransformed with thelacI-repressor encoded on plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen) intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 2% glucose after incubation at 30 °C. TDG expression cultures of 1 liter of LB medium containing the same ingredients were inoculated with 25 ml of an overnight culture and incubated at 30 °C until an A 600 of 0.8 was reached. After lowering the temperature of the culture to 20 °C over a period of 30 min, TDG expression was induced by the addition of 200 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was allowed to proceed at 20 °C for a further 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall SLA-3000, 5000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min), and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. The thawed cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml/g sonication buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication on ice (25 × 10-s bursts with intermittent chilling for 10 s). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation (Sorvall SS34, 15,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min), 1 ml of sonication-buffer-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added to the crude lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The suspension was then packed into a disposable column from which unbound protein was washed out with sonication buffer containing stepwise increasing concentrations of imidazole: 1 × 15 column-volumes (cv) 1 mm imidazole; 5 × 5 cv 20 mmimidazole; 1 × 5 cv 60 mm imidazole. Finally, bound histidine-tagged TDG protein was eluted with 5 × 1 cv sonication buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The 300 mmimidazole fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8,0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After loading the dialyzed fraction onto a 1-ml Resource Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washing with 10 ml of binding buffer, bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 30 ml. The nearly homogeneous TDG protein (>98% pure) eluted as a major protein peak in fractions containing approximately 150 mm NaCl. After a last dialysis step against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), the pure TDG protein was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The enzymatic activity of the recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins was monitored by means of a standardized nicking assay. 60-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates containing different mismatches were prepared by annealing of an unlabeled upper strand oligonucleotide 5′-TAGACATTGCCCTCGAGGTACCATGGATCCGATGTC X ACCTCAAACCTAGACGAATTCCG-3′ to a 5′-fluorescein-labeled lower oligonucleotide strand 5′-F-CGGAATTCGTCTAGGTTTGAGGT Y GACATCGGATCCATGGTACCTCGAGGGCAATGTCTA-3′, where X = G or A and Y = C, T, U, or 5-fluorouracil (FU). Strand annealing was carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl with 0.5 μm labeled and 1 μm unlabeled oligonucleotide by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and gradual cooling to 25 °C over 30 min. Standardized nicking reactions were carried out in a 20-μl total volume in 1× nicking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmEDTA) containing 1 pmol of substrate DNA, 1 pmol of TDG protein, and 0.5 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Deviating assay conditions are indicated where appropriate. The reactions were then stopped, and the generated AP-sites were cleaved by the addition of 1 n NaOH to a final concentration of 90 mm and heating to 99 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated at −20 °C for 1 h, following the addition of tRNA to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and of sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to 0.3m. It was collected by centrifugation (Eppendorf, 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 20 min) and washed in 80% ethanol (−20 °C). The dried pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of formamide gel loading buffer (90% formamide, 1× TBE), heated for 5 min at 99 °C, and chilled on ice immediately. The samples were then loaded onto a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 19:1, 1× TBE, 8 m urea) (Bio-Rad, Mini Protean II cell), pre-run for 15 min at 450 V. The gels were run for 5 min at 450 V and subsequently at 250 V until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. Fluorescein-labeled DNA was visualized using the blue fluorescence mode of the Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed by ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). For kinetic assays, the reactions were performed in larger volumes with an enzyme concentration of 50 nm and substrate concentrations ranging from 50 nm to 25 μm. After different time points, samples were withdrawn, stopped by the addition of NaOH, and further treated as described above. EMSAs were performed to measure the DNA-binding ability of wild-type and mutant TDG proteins, using the double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates described above. Substrate containing an AP-site was generated as follows: 10 pmol of duplex DNA containing a uracil opposite G or A at position Y in the labeled oligonucleotide (see above) was incubated with 1 unit of uracil-DNA-glycosylase (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) in 1× UDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmDTT) in a total volume of 20 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. Accuracy and completion of AP-site formation was tested by NaOH treatment and denaturing gel-electrophoresis as described above for the nicking assay. Fully processed substrate DNA was then stored at −20 °C and used for EMSA. In standard EMSA, 4 pmol of TDG protein were incubated in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 1 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide substrate, 10 pmol of unlabeled homoduplex competitor DNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. After 15 min at 37 °C the reactions were loaded immediately onto 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (Bio-Rad, Mini Protean II cell), and electrophoresis was carried out in 0.5 × TBE for 50 min at 100 V at room temperature. The fluorescent probes were visualized using a Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics) in the blue fluorescence mode, and the ImageQuaNT software (version 1.2) was used for the subsequent quantitative analysis of the fluorescent signals. In substrate dissociation assays, 2 pmol of TDG protein was preincubated with 1 pmol of labeled substrate in 1× binding buffer and a total volume of 10 μl. After 10 min at 37 °C, different molar excesses (0, 10-fold, and 20-fold) of unlabeled unspecific competitor (homoduplex) or specific, mismatch-containing competitor substrate was added and the reaction was left to proceed for another 10 min at 37 °C. Substrate binding was then analyzed on 6% native polyacrylamide gels as described above. The existence of TDG homologues in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans documents that the enzyme is of ancient origin and has a highly conserved structure and function. The degree of evolutionary relationship between the catalytic core domains of TDG homologues across the species E. coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens is illustrated in Fig.1. Highlighted are two conserved sequence motifs that build critical parts of the enzyme's active site, as deduced from the crystal structure of E. coli Mug. These are the N-terminal GINPGL and the C-terminal NPSGLSR sequences. The amino acid Asn-18 in the N-terminal motif is the predicted catalytic residue in Mug (14Barrett T.B. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and is present in all TDG homologues identified thus far. The structural model suggests a role for this asparagine in activation of a water molecule for the hydrolytic attack of theN-glycosidic bond of the flipped-out base to be released. Residues of the less conserved C-terminal motif NPSGLSR form a structural interface for the protein-DNA interactions involved in the base-flipping/helix-intercalation mechanism proposed for Mug (14Barrett T.B. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These functions are comparable to those assigned to equivalent motifs in the well-characterized uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme (15Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 17Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Yet, the helix-intercalating residues of Mug, unlike those of uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme, establish and maintain specific contacts to the Watson-Crick face of the widowed G in the complementary DNA strand (14Barrett T.B. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ser-23 of Mug is part of a small, flexible helix contributing to the fold of the active site and appears to interfere with the accommodation of the hydrophobic thymine within the catalytic pocket. The equivalent residue in the human enzyme is the smaller and less polar Ala-145, a substitution that was proposed to account for the human enzyme's ability to process thymine-containing substrates (16Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether the functional predictions from the Mug crystal structure are applicable to the human TDG enzyme, we mutagenized the putative active site residue Asn-140 to Ala (N140A) or Asp (N140D), the presumed DNA binding site residue Met-269 to His (M269H), as well as Ala-145 to Ser (A145S) according to standard site-directed mutagenesis procedures. To facilitate purification, we expressed the wild-type and mutant variants of human TDG in E. coli as N-terminal fusions with a 6-histidine-tag. Using a simple two-step purification scheme involving metal affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) and fast protein liquid chromatography (Resource Q), we were able to produce 5–10 mg of pure protein from 1 liter of culture. Consistent with previous observations (5Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we noticed that moderate expression at low temperature (20 °C) was required to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies with insoluble protein. Regarding solubility, the proteins carrying mutations at position Asn-140 and Ala-145 behaved as wild-type TDG, whereas the M269H mutant gave rise to a lower amount of soluble protein. All TDG variants showed fractionation properties identical to the wild-type TDG. Human TDG releases thymine and uracil from G·T and G·U mismatches to generate AP-sites opposite G (7Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of the mutant TDG proteins to catalyze this reaction. As substrate we used fluorescein-labeled, double-stranded and single-stranded oligonucleotides of 60-base pair length carrying a target lesion 24 base pairs away from the labeled 5′-end. Upon incubation with TDG, we monitored the generation of alkaline-sensitive AP-sites by treatment of the reactions with NaOH and separation of the cleaved products from the alkaline-resistant substrate fragments in denaturing gels. To analyze the DNA-binding capacity of the mutant proteins, we performed gel retardation assays with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide substrates in the presence or absence of specific and unspecific competitor DNA. Because TDG is very strongly product-inhibited under in vitro assay conditions, we based our comparisons on single turnover kinetics of AP-site formation under standard reaction conditions. The specific conditions applied were equimolar enzyme substrate ratios and incubation at 37 °C, the parameters for comparison were total amount of substrate processed (P max) and the time requirement for processing 50% of the plateau levels for each substrate (T 50). These values are summarized for each TDG variant in Table I. Enzyme-substrate interactions were assessed as equilibrium binding capacity under standardized EMSA conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.”Table IQuantitative assessment of DNA glycosylase activities of wild-type and mutant variants of human thymine DNA glycosylaseSubstrateTDGN140DN140AM269HP maxT 50P maxT 50P maxT 50P maxT 50%min%min%min%minG · U64 ± 10.5565 ± 113 ± 1<5ND43 ± 11.0G · T40 ± 21.90<5ND 1-aND, not determined.<2ND29 ± 13.25A · U11 ± 1>13<2ND<2ND<5NDG · FU90 ± 20.5580 ± 11.140 ± 29.35490.9A · FU54 ± 22.15<2ND<2ND>7522.5The generation of alkaline-sensitive sites was assayed for wild-type TDG and the mutant variants N140D, N140A, and M269H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we found that purified recombinant wild-type TGD efficiently processed G·U and G·T substrates and very weakly also uracil in A·U base pairs, whereas uracil in ssDNA was resistant to cleavage by the enzyme (Fig.2 A). In the absence of competitor DNA, the wild-type enzyme bound homoduplex DNA nearly as well as the G·T and G·U heteroduplex substrates or an AP-site opposite G (G·AP) (Fig. 4 A). Only when substrate binding was assayed in the presence of an excess of homoduplex competitor DNA did differences in affinities become more evident (Fig.3 A). Under these conditions, substrate binding efficiencies followed the order G·AP = G·U > G·T ≫ G·C.Figure 4Substrate dissociation of wild-type TDG and the N140A mutant. In this substrate dissociation assay, 2 pmol of wild-type or mutant TDG enzyme was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 1 pmol of labeled substrate DNA under EMSA conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1974833672,"Hormones and growth factors induce in many cell types the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), which has been proposed to play a role as a second messenger. We have previously shown in an acellular system that PA selectively stimulates certain isoforms of type 4 cAMP-phosphodiesterases (PDE4). Here we studied the effect of endogenous PA on PDE activity of transiently transfected MA10 cells overexpressing the PA-sensitive isoform PDE4D3. Cell treatment with inhibitors of PA degradation, including propranolol, induced an accumulation of endogenous PA accompanied by a stimulation of PDE activity and a significant decrease in both cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity. Furthermore, in FRTL5 cells, which natively express PDE4D3, pretreatment with compounds inducing PA accumulation prevented both cAMP increase and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation triggered by thyroid-stimulating hormone. To determine the mechanism of PDE stimulation by PA, endogenous phospholipids were labeled by preincubating MA10 cells overexpressing PDE4D3 with [32P]orthophosphate. Immuno- precipitation experiments showed that PA was specifically bound to PDE4D3, supporting the hypothesis that PDE4D3 activation occurs through direct binding of PA to the protein. PA binding site on PDE4D3 was characterized by engineering deletions of selected regions in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme. Deletion of amino acid residues 31–59 suppressed both PA-activating effect and PA binding, suggesting that this region rich in basic and hydrophobic residues contains the PA binding site. These observations strongly suggest that endogenous PA can modulate cAMP levels in intact cells, through a direct activation of PDE4D3.

Although it has long been considered a mere intermediate in the biosynthetic pathways of the major phospholipids or a precursor of lipid mediators such as diacylglycerol and lyso-PA, it is now suspected to play a role as a second messenger involved in several signal transduction pathways (1Exton J.H.

However, by comparison, rather little information is available on the functional significance of the regulations observed with broken cell preparations. Raf-1 kinase function constitutes one of the few cases in which the essential role of PA has been demonstrated. Indeed, a specific PA association to the Raf-1 protein has been characterized (21Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and pharmacological or genetic blockade of PA synthesis has been shown to prevent the Raf-1 kinase translocation triggered by phorbol esters in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (21Ghosh S.

It thus appears that PA takes part in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway by controlling recruitment to the membrane and activation of Raf-1. We have previously observed that PA selectively activates some isoforms of the type 4 PDE family in vitro (19Némoz G. Sette C. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The type 4 PDEs are expressed from four genes, which give rise to numerous isoforms deriving from alternative splicing and usage of different promoters (23Conti M. Némoz G. Sette C. Vicini E.

The activity of type 4 PDEs is closely involved in the control of cAMP levels in a number of cell models, including lymphocytes (25Marcoz P. Prigent A.F. Lagarde M. Némoz G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1027-1035PubMed Google Scholar, 26Essayan D.M. Huang S.K. Undem B.J. Kagey-Sobotka A. Lichtenstein L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar). The “long isoforms” expressed from the four genes coding for PDE4s are characterized by the presence of a conserved sequence termed UCR1 in their N-terminal regulatory domain (24Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Only long PDE4 isoforms were found to be sensitive to PA activation (19Némoz G. Sette C. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PA rapidly accumulates in rat thymic lymphocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes, following a mitogenic stimulation. This response precedes an increase in the activity of cAMP-phosphodiesterase and a lowering of cAMP levels. Furthermore, we observed that a pharmacological blockade of PA synthesis induced both an increase in cAMP levels and suppression of the lymphoproliferative response. We thus hypothesized that the regulation of PDE4 by PA has a functional relevance in the lymphoid cells, through its influence on levels of cAMP, a major negative effector of cell response (27Marcoz P. Némoz G. Prigent A.F. Lagarde M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28El Bawab S. Macovschi O. Sette C. Conti M. Lagarde M. Némoz G. Prigent A.F.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present study aims to investigate the hypothesis of the physiological relevance of PDE4 regulation by PA and to shed some light on the biochemical mechanism of this regulation. We investigated the effects of pharmacological treatments able to induce an accumulation of endogenous PA in intact cells and observed that they can alter the activity of type 4 PDEs and have marked consequences on the cAMP signaling pathway. This effect was observed with transfected MA10 cells overexpressing the PA-sensitive PDE4D3 isoform as well as with FRTL5 cells, which natively express PDE4D3, suggesting that modulation of the cAMP pathway by the action of PA on phosphodiesterase may have functional implications in various cell types. We have detected direct binding of PA to PDE4D3 and investigated the mechanism of PA-induced PDE4D3 activation by creating deletion mutations in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme. We have thus identified a region rich in basic and hydrophobic residues, overlapping into the UCR1 domain, that is required for PA association and PA-induced activation of the enzyme.

Anti-phospho-CREB rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The oligonucleotides used as primers for the PCR amplifications were as follows. A (5′-GCGAATTCGATATGGACAATGGCACATCA-3′) corresponded to the rat PDE4D3 sequence from base 49 to base 72. The G55 was replaced by an A in order to create an ATG start codon (underlined). At the 5′-end, the additional 5 bases created an EcoRI site (in boldface type). B (5′-GTTTCTGGTAGGCCTCCTCTGTG-3′) corresponded to the antisense sequence of rat PDE4D3 from base 396 to base 418 and included a StuI site (in boldface type). C (5′-CTCCCTTGGACAGCGATTATGACCTCTCTC-3′) corresponded to the sequence of rat PDE4D3 from base 178 to base 197. The additional 8 bases at the 5′-end created a StyI site (in boldface type). D (5′-CTAGTTCCTTGGCCAGGACATC-3′) corresponded to the antisense sequence of rat PDE4D3 from base 766 to base 787 and included a StyI site (in boldface type). E (5′-CGACTTCGAACCATCACAGAGGAGGCCTACCAG-3′) corresponded to the sequence of rat PDE4D3 from base 391 to base 414. At the 5′-end the additional 9 bases created a SfuI site (in boldface type). F (5′-GGTTAGTTCGAACTGGAATTTTTCAGT-3′) corresponded to the antisense sequence of rat PDE4D3 from base 1783 to base 1809 and included a SfuI site (in boldface type). PCRs were performed with 2.5 units of Pwo DNA polymerase and rat PDE4D3 cDNA as template in a buffer containing a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, a 0.2 mmconcentration of each dNTP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was subjected to 20 cycles of denaturation (1 min, 94 °C), annealing (30 s, 55 °C), and elongation (45 s, 72 °C). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. DNA bands of the correct size were excised and purified from the gel with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Band Prep Kit following the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified PCR products were digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes and were inserted with the T4 DNA ligase into the pCMV5-PDE4D3 vector (30Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously restricted with the corresponding restriction enzymes and dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase (with the exception of mutant construct Δ(31–59), which was first inserted in pBS-skt plasmid). All of the mutated rat PDE4D3 cDNAs were finally inserted into theEcoRI site of the pCMV5 polylinker. Escherichia coli strain DH5α or NM522 was transformed with the rat PDE4D3-pCMV5 mutant constructs using the conventional procedure described in Ref. 31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.85Google Scholar. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from the ampicillin-resistant transformed clones using the Plasmid Mini kit from Qiagen, and were examined by restriction enzyme analysis for the presence of the insert and for its correct orientation. For mutant Δ(2–19), primers A and B were used to amplify a fragment of 374 bases, starting at the 3′-end of the sequence to delete, and ending at the StuI site of PDE4D3 cDNA. The PCR fragment was digested by EcoRI and StuI. Rat PDE4D3 cDNA was also digested by EcoRI and StuI. The resulting largest fragment, of 1671 base pairs (starting with theStuI site and ending at the 3′-extremity of the PDE4D3 cDNA by an EcoRI site) was reinserted together with the digested PCR product in the EcoRI site of the pCMV5 polylinker. The resulting mutant construct is deleted of the DNA sequence coding for amino acids 2–19 of the PDE4D3 protein, MHVNNFPFRRHSWICFDV. For mutant Δ(31–59), the sequence of 87 bases to delete is at the 3′-position of the first of two StyI sites on rat PDE4D3 cDNA. Since there are several StyI sites in pCMV5, PDE4D3 cDNA was subcloned in another vector, pBS-skt in the EcoRI site of the polylinker. pBS-PDE4D3 was restricted by StyI. A fragment of 690 base pairs between the twoStyI sites of PDE4D3 cDNA was eliminated. Primers C and D were used to amplify by PCR a fragment of 617 base pairs, starting at the 3′-end of the sequence to delete and ending at the secondStyI site on PDE4D3 cDNA. This PCR product was restricted by StyI and ligated into theStyI-digested and dephosphorylated pBS-PDE4D3. The deleted PDE4D3 cDNA was cloned back into pCMV5 at the EcoRI site of the polylinker. This mutant construct is deleted of the DNA sequence coding for amino acids 31–59 of the PDE4D3 protein, DPMTSPGSGLILQANFVHSQRRESFLYRS. For mutant Δ99–130, the 96-base sequence to delete is at the 3′-position of the first of twoSfuI sites on the PDE4D3 cDNA. The vector pCMV5-PDE4D3 was restricted by SfuI, and the sequence of 1508 base pairs between the two SfuI sites was eliminated. Primers E and F were used to amplify by PCR a fragment of 1428 base pairs, starting at the 3′-end of the sequence to delete and ending at the secondSfuI site on the PDE4D3 cDNA. This PCR product was restricted by StyI and ligated into theSfuI-digested and dephosphorylated pCMV5-PDE4D3. This mutant construct is deleted of the DNA sequence coding for the amino acids 99–130 of the PDE4D3 protein, TVRNNFAALTNLQDRAPSKRSPMCNQPSINKATIT. Rat thyroid follicular FRTL-5 cells were cultured in Coon's F-12 medium supplemented as described previously (32Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Leydig tumor cells (MA10) were grown in Waymouth MB752/1 medium modified as previously reported (33Swinnen J.V. D'Souza B. Conti M. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Untransfected or mock-transfected MA10 cells express no immunodetectable amounts of type 4 PDE, and PDE activity of cell homogenates is insensitive to activation by PA (19Némoz G. Sette C. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, the selective overexpression of individual PDE4D isoforms, which increased cell PDE activity by 20–100-fold above basal level, allowed us to study the effects of endogenous PA accumulation on a well defined PDE4 isoform. MA10 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (34Jin S.L.C. Swinnen J.V. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18929-18939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with 10–15 μg of vector pCMV5 containing the corresponding cDNA. Mock-transfected cells were treated in the same way but did not receive plasmidic DNA. 24 h after the transfection, MA10 cells were incubated in Waymouth medium in which the serum was replaced by 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 0.25–0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for additional 2 h. During the last 30 min of the labeling incubation, 250 μmpropranolol was added to the cells. At the end of the treatment, cells were washed three times with cold PBS, harvested, and homogenized, and PDE was immunoprecipitated as described below. Cells were harvested by scraping into the homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.04% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. They were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, by 2 × 30 strokes and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under continuous shaking with the monoclonal anti-PDE4D antibody M3S1 (32Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preadsorbed onto protein G-Sepharose beads (a 1:3 suspension of beads in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% gelatin (PBS-gelatin) and the antibody (1:50) was shaken for 90 min at 4 °C; the complex was then washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl and twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). At the end of the incubation, complexes immunoadsorbed to the beads were washed four times with PBS-gelatin and separated into two fractions. One part was subjected to a lipid extraction followed by phospholipid analysis and PA quantification. The second part of the immunoprecipitate was resuspended in PBS containing 1% SDS, shaken for 15 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was diluted in sample buffer to be analyzed for PDE4 expression by Western blotting as described below. Immunoprecipitated proteins or cell extracts were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting using either the rabbit polyclonal K116 antiserum (1:500) for PDE4 detection (32Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB antibody (1:1000) for the detection of CREB phosphorylated on serine 133. Second antibody incubation was carried out with anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated to peroxidase, and immunoreactive bands were detected by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the immunoprecipitated samples, the final immunoprecipitation pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of HCl-PBS, pH 3. For MA10 cell extracts, cells were first labeled for 2 h with 1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid and then treated with 0.25 mm propranolol. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the cell culture dishes with 0.5 ml of HCl-PBS, pH 3. Then, in both cases, lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) method in the presence of 50 μm butylhydroxylated toluene as an antioxidant. PA was separated from the other phospholipids by a bidimensional TLC as described by Meskini et al. (36Meskini N. Zakaroff A. Joulain C. Némoz G. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TLC plates were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue according to Nakamura and Handa (37Nakamura K. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PA was quantified by videodensitometry (Bioprofil Vilber Lourmat/Fröbel) in comparison with standards of egg yolk PA chromatographed on the same plate. Phospholipid spots were scraped and mixed with Picofluor (Packard) in order to determine their radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The PA-associated 3H radioactivity was expressed as a percentage of the total phospholipid-incorporated radioactivity. For the analysis of lipid extracts obtained from the immunoprecipitation pellets, unlabeled egg yolk PA was added to the samples before the bidimensional TLC separation. The TLC plates were then stained and subjected to an autoradiography. PA-associated32P radioactivity was quantified by videodensitometry analysis of the autoradiography films. Before harvesting, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 0.5 ml of ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added. 15 min × 10,000 × g supernatants were extracted five times with water-saturated diethylether to eliminate trichloroacetic acid, and cAMP was assayed by radioimmune assay according to the manufacturers' recommendations, using the acetylation procedure. MA10 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 30 mm NaF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin) and homogenized in a Dounce glass/glass homogenizer by 30 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was quantified by measuring the incorporation of labeled phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP into the synthetic peptide substrate Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), as described in Ref.38Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Molinaro M. Adamo S. Némoz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4355-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. PKA activity was evaluated as the fraction of activity specifically inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor Sigma catolog number P 0300. FRTL5 cell membranes were prepared from quiescent cells (cultivated for 24 h without serum and hormones), according to the procedure described in Ref. 39Iacovelli L. Falasca M. Valitutti S.

Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar, with some modifications (1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm EDTA, 5 units/ml adenosine deaminase were added to the assay medium) in the presence or absence of 0.5 units/ml TSH. To evaluate the sensitivity of PDE4D preparations to activation by PA, PA stock solution in chloroform was evaporated under nitrogen flux, and PA was resuspended at a concentration of 400 μg/ml in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Suspension was obtained by sonicating the lipid film with a probe sonicator (three cycles of 15 s). PA suspension was then appropriately diluted in the PDE assay buffer. PDE activity was assayed by a two-step radioisotopic procedure, using [3H]cAMP as substrate, as described in Ref. 38Naro F. Sette C. Vicini E. De Arcangelis V. Grange M. Conti M. Lagarde M.

In an attempt to demonstrate the functional relevance of PDE4 regulation by PA in intact cells, transiently transfected MA10 Leydig tumor cells overexpressing different isoforms of PDE4 were studied. To increase PA levels in these cells, we used the conventional inhibitor of PA-phosphohydrolase, propranolol (41Lavie Y. Piterman O. Liscovitch M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Treatment of MA10 cells with 250 μm propranolol induced a marked accumulation of PA, reaching a maximum at 15 min (Fig.1, A and B). At that time, PA mass was increased by 12-fold compared with the control levels. Such a PA accumulation probably reflects an efficient de novo phosphoglyceride synthesis in these cells. The smaller increase measured for radiolabeled PA (3-fold) may be attributed to a high rate of exchange of the labeled fatty acid moiety. However PA mass and labeled PA variations followed similar time courses, and both were still elevated after 1 h of propranolol treatment (5-fold for PA mass and 2-fold for [3H]PA). Very similar changes in PA levels were induced by propranolol treatment in transfected MA10 cells overexpressing the PDE4D3 phosphodiesterase (not shown). We established that 250 μm propranolol was the most efficient concentration (not shown), as also observed by Lauritzen et al. (42Lauritzen L. Nielsen L.A. Vinggaard M.A. Hansen H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with rat Leydig cells. This concentration was shown to be nontoxic for Leydig cells for the duration of treatment (42Lauritzen L. Nielsen L.A. Vinggaard M.A. Hansen H.S. Mol. Cell.

To assess the relative roles of the β-AR subtypes in mediating leptin's effects on adipocyte gene expression, mice with a targeted disruption of the β3-adrenoreceptor gene (β3-AR KO) were treated with vehicle or the β1/β2-AR selective antagonist, propranolol (20 μg/g body weight/day) prior to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of leptin (0.1 μg/g body weight/day). Leptin produced a 3-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue of wild type (FVB/NJ) and β3-AR KO mice. The response was unaltered by propranolol in wild type mice, but was completely blocked by this antagonist in β3-AR KO mice. In contrast, ICV leptin had no effect on leptin mRNA in either epididymal or retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (WAT) from β3-AR KOs. Moreover, propranolol did not block the ability of exogenous leptin to reduce leptin mRNA in either WAT depot site of wild type mice. These results demonstrate that the β3-AR is required for leptin-mediated regulation ofob mRNA expression in WAT, but is interchangeable with the β1/β2-ARs in mediating leptin's effect on UCP1 mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue.

York D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 51: 598-646Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Deposition of excess body fat occurs even when food intake is controlled, suggesting that an important function of leptin is to regulate energy balance through modulation of metabolic efficiency. This view is supported by studies in ob/ob mice showing that leptin-injected animals lose more weight than pair-fed vehicle-injected littermates (2Levin N. Nelson C. Gurney A. Vandlen R. De Sauvage F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1726-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the observation that leptin-induced weight loss occurs specifically in adipose tissue with little effect in other tissues (3Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L.

Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3067) Google Scholar). The loss of adipose tissue is associated with an increase in fat oxidation, and the associated shift in fuel selection can be measured as a decrease in the respiratory quotient during leptin repletion (5Hwa J.J. Ghibaudi L. Compton D. Fawzi A.B. Strader C.D. Horm. Metab. Res. 1996; 28: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Hwa J.J. Fawzi A.B. Graziano M.P. Ghibaudi L. Williams P. Van Heek M.

Thus, adipose tissue is an important target of leptin action and the primary effect is a shift from fat storage to fat mobilization and oxidation. This leptin-mediated shift in adipocyte function involves a coordinated change in gene expression. Two mechanisms have been postulated and include both centrally mediated effects and direct effects through functional leptin receptors (Ob-Rb) on the adipocyte (7Kutoh E. Boss O. Levasseur F.

It should be noted, however, that although supraphysiologic levels of leptin are capable of producing significant direct effects on adipose tissue (10Wang Z.W. Zhou Y.T. Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M.

Thus, several lines of evidence support an emerging consensus that norepinephrine represents the peripheral signal linking hypothalamic leptin receptors to leptin-dependent changes in adipocyte gene expression. Occupancy of each of the three known β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR)1 subtypes leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase in adipose tissue (23Lafontan M. Berlan M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the combination of unequal expression and differing affinities for endogenous agonists has made it challenging to assess the relative contributions of each receptor subtype in various physiological states. Recent studies also demonstrate that β-adrenoreceptor subtypes may be differentially coupled to various functions within the adipocyte (24Zhao J. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R2002-R2011PubMed Google Scholar, 25Atgié C. D'Allaire F. Bukowiecki L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1136-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chaudhry A. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R147-R153PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have attempted to identify the β-adrenoreceptor subtype(s) that mediate the effects of leptin on gene expression in various adipose tissue depot sites. Using intracerebroventricular injections of leptin in mice lacking β3-adrenoreceptors, we show that different complements of β-adrenoreceptor subtypes are required to transduce leptin's effects on gene expression in white versus brown adipose tissue. Mice in each of the four experiments described below were housed in pairs in solid-bottom cages with continuous access to chow (Purina Mouse Chow, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO) and water. Room temperature was maintained at 22–23 °C, and the lights were on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals were acclimated for 1–2 weeks prior to each study, and injected thereafter with various agents according to protocols specified under each experiment. All injections were given 2 h following the start of the light cycle, and all mice were sacrificed 2 or 4 h after the last injection in the series. Thereafter, interscapular BAT, as well as epididymal, retroperitoneal, and inguinal WAT depots were carefully removed, weighed, and used for preparation of total RNA or isolation of adipocytes. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and a guarded, blank 27-gauge 0.5-inch needle was used to create a guide injection site 0.7 mm posterior to bregma and 1.0 mm lateral to midline at a depth of 4.0 mm (27Pelleymounter M.A. Joppa M.

In the experiments proper, a 10.0-μl Hamilton 1700 series gastight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was used to inject artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), murine leptin, or rat neuropeptide Y in a volume of 2–5 μl. Correct positioning of the guide injection site was confirmed prior to the start of each experiment by monitoring feeding behavior following injection of neuropeptide Y (0.075 μg/g body weight). Mice failing to respond to neuropeptide Y were removed from the experiment. aCSF, consisting of 70 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.85 mmMgCl2, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 0.10 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.1% untreated bovine serum albumin, was injected in a volume of 5 μl. Thereafter, mice were monitored to ensure full recovery. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and acclimated for 2 weeks prior to the study. Thereafter, mice were injected ICV with leptin (0.1 μg/g body weight/day) for 1, 2, or 3 days, and representative mice were sacrificed 2 and 4 h following the respective injections on each day. Separate groups of mice received intraperitoneal injections of CL-316,243 (1 μg/g body weight/day) for 1 or 2 days, and were sacrificed 2 h after injection. Control mice were injected ICV with aCSF. Interscapular BAT, as well as epididymal, retroperitoneal, and inguinal WAT depots were removed, weighed, and used to prepare total RNA as described previously (19Commins S.P. Watson P.M.

Seven-month-old male FVB/NJ (WT) mice and age-matched FVB/NJ male mice with a targeted disruption of the β3-adrenoreceptor (β3-AR KO) gene (28Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B.

The mice in group 1 received ICV injections of aCSF for 3 days, and food was providedad libitum. Mice in group 2 received ICV injections of mouse leptin (0.1 μg/g body weight/day), while group 3 received ICV leptin (0.1 μg/g body weight/day) in combination with intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (20 μg/g body weight/day). Food was provided ad libitum, and intake was measured. Mice in group 4 received intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (20 μg/g body weight/day) for 3 days and were pair-fed to the mean intake of mice in groups 2 and 3. Two h after the final injection, the mice were sacrificed and tissues processed as described above. Seven-month-old male FVB/NJ mice and age-matched β3-AR KO male mice were acclimated as described above. Thereafter, the WT and β3-AR KO mice were sacrificed, and the adipose tissue depot sites were carefully removed and used for cell isolation and membrane preparation as described below. Male C57BL/6J (ob/ob) mice and their lean littermates (+/?) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories at 6 weeks of age and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The mice were housed individually at 23 °C and equilibrated for 4 days before beginning the experiment. On the morning of the 5th day and for 2 mornings thereafter, half the mice in each phenotype received intraperitoneal injections of recombinant mouse leptin (20 μg/g body weight/day), while the remaining mice in each phenotype received vehicle injections. Within each phenotype, the mice receiving vehicle were pair-fed with the mice receiving leptin. Three h following the final injections on day 7, the mice were weighed, sacrificed, and adipose tissue processed as described previously. Seven-month-old male FVB/NJ mice and age-matched β3-AR KO male mice were acclimated as described above. Thereafter, half of the WT and β3-AR KO mice were moved to 4 °C environmental chambers while the remaining mice in each group were maintained at 23 °C. After 4 h, all mice were sacrificed, and the adipose tissue depot sites were carefully removed and used for isolation of total RNA. RNA probes complementary to UCP1 mRNA and leptin mRNA were prepared, labeled, and used as described previously to assay the respective mRNA species (18Commins S.P. Marsh D.J. Thomas S.A. Watson P.M.

Using the same method, a β3-AR probe was produced by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (5′ to 3′; forward, accccagtgcagccaacacca; reverse, cgcaaccagtttcgcccaagg), purified, and cloned into the pGEM-3Z riboprobe vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The identity of the cloned fragment was confirmed by sequencing, and it corresponded to nucleotides 630–890, producing a protected fragment of 261 base pairs. β1- and β2-AR probes corresponding to nucleotides 534–971 and 789–971 of the rat β1- and β2-AR cDNAs, respectively, were obtained from Dr. James Granneman (29Granneman J.G. Lahners K.N. Chaudhry A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 895-899PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of UCP1, leptin, and β1-, β2-, and β3-AR mRNA in each sample was determined by comparison to known amounts of sense strand fragments for each gene that were hybridized simultaneously in the ribonuclease protection assay. After autoradiography and densitometry, standard curves were constructed for each gene and used to estimate mRNA concentrations in unknown samples as described previously (18Commins S.P. Marsh D.J.

White adipocytes were prepared from pooled epididymal, retroperitoneal, and inguinal fat pads of 8-month-old WT FVB/NJ and β3-AR KO mice by collagenase treatment according to Rodbell (30Rodbell M. J.

The cells were washed and resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit-HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), then broken in a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm TES (pH 7.0) containing 0.25m sucrose. Crude membranes were collected following centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min and stored at −80 °C. Interscapular brown adipose tissue was carefully dissected free of surrounding tissue, finely minced with scissors, and washed in Krebs-Henseleit-HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Following centrifugation at 1000 × g, the infranatant was aspirated and the fat cells resuspended in 10 mm TES (pH 7.0) containing 0.25m sucrose. The brown fat cells were then broken using an overhead stirrer and filtered through nylon mesh, and crude membranes were collected following an initial low speed spin to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The crude membranes were resuspended and stored at −80 °C. Radioligand binding assays were conducted with adipocyte membranes using our modification (32Gettys T.W. Watson P.M. Seger L. Padgett M.

Briefly, 20 μg of white and 40 μg of brown adipocyte membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 30 pm125I-cyanopindolol (ICYP) in 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 12.5 mmMgCl2, and increasing concentrations of the β1-AR-specific antagonist, CGP-20712A (RBI, Natick, MA). Bound ICYP was collected on filters in a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the components of β1-AR and β2-AR binding of ICYP were resolved by fitting a two-site competition curve to the data by least squares (Prizm; Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) and analyzed as described previously (32Gettys T.W. Watson P.M. Seger L. Padgett M. Taylor I.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was determined in adipocyte membranes using combinations of receptor subtype selective agonists and antagonists to assess the functional activity of each receptor subtype (31Gettys T.W.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Luciano Manara (Sanofi Midy, Milan, Italy) and solubilized in ethylene glycol at 200 μg/ml. The antagonist was used at a final concentration of 10 μmas reported previously (36Nisoli E. Tonello C. Landi M. Carruba M.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar). Other agonists and antagonists were from commercial sources. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare group means for UCP1 mRNA, leptin mRNA, β1-AR mRNA, β2-AR mRNA, β3-AR mRNA, adenylyl cyclase activity, and ICYP binding in the respective experiments for each variable. The level of protection against type I errors was set at 5%, and Pvalues for specific treatment comparisons are presented under “Results.” All reagents, except where noted, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest reagent grade. T1-RNase and Trizol LS reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotide primers and DNA sequencing were generated at the DNA Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. [α-32P]CTP and [125I]iodocyanopindolol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1-Chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether (isoflurane) was from Ohmeda PPD (Liberty Corner, NJ). CL-316,243 was a gift from Wyeth Ayerst Research (Princeton, NJ). Recombinant methionyl mouse leptin was kindly provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). The β3-adrenoreceptor antagonist SR59230A was kindly provided by Dr. Luciana Manara (Sanofi, Italy). Breeding pairs of the β3-AR KO mice (28)were kindly provided by Dr. Brad Lowell (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA). To determine the time course for leptin's effects on UCP1 expression in BAT and distinguish between central versusperipheral effects of the peptide, mice were given ICV injections of leptin or artificial CSF and sacrificed 2 and 4 h later on successive days. This protocol complemented our normal treatment regimen of 3 days and revealed that leptin increased UCP1 mRNA 2 and 4 h after the initial injection on day 1 (Fig.1). The ∼2-fold increase was maximal 4 h after leptin injection and comparable to the increase produced by the β3-adrenoreceptor selective agonist, CL316,243 (data not shown). Similar results were observed on day 2, but, because a somewhat larger increase in UCP1 mRNA was seen on day 3, the 3-day injection protocol was adopted for subsequent studies (see Fig.2). These results confirm that the effect of leptin was both rapid and centrally mediated, and they are consistent with our previous work showing that leptin regulates gene expression in adipose tissue through a central site of action (18Commins S.P.

A secondary objective was to determine whether the β1/β2-ARs could substitute for the missing β3-AR or whether α-adrenoreceptors might also be involved in mediating the response. WT age-matched FVB/NJ mice served as positive controls and responded to ICV-injected leptin with a 4–5-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA in BAT (p < 0.01, Fig. 2 A). Intraperitoneal injection of propranolol to block β1/β2-ARs reduced basal expression of UCP1 mRNA in WT mice, but did not block leptin's ability to induce UCP1 mRNA expression by 4-fold (p < 0.01, Fig.2 A). These results suggest that the β1/β2-ARs and β3-ARs are interchangeable with respect to their ability to mediate central effects of leptin on UCP1 expression. This conclusion is supported by results from the β3-AR KO mice, which show that central leptin produced a 3–4-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA (p < 0.01, Fig. 2 B), and the finding that propranolol completely blocked the ability of leptin to increase UCP1 mRNA in BAT from these animals (p < 0.01, Fig.2 B). These findings also make the case that α-adrenoreceptors are not involved in the response and that β-adrenoreceptors are the primary adrenergic receptors mediating the effects of leptin on UCP1 mRNA. To test the hypothesis that centrally administered leptin regulates its own expression in WAT, we measured leptin mRNA in epididymal and retroperitoneal depot sites from WT and β3-AR KO mice treated with leptin. The two sites were chosen as being representative of WAT depots that respond differently to adrenergic stimulation (19Commins S.P. Watson P.M. Padgett M.A. Dudley A. Argyropoulos G. Gettys T.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In WT mice, ICV leptin produced a highly significant reduction (p < 0.01) of leptin mRNA in epididymal WAT from 0.021 ± 0.003 fmol of leptin mRNA/μg of RNA to 0.005 ± 0.002 fmol/μg of RNA (Fig.3 A). A similar reduction in leptin mRNA (p < 0.001) was noted in the retroperitoneal WAT depot of these mice (Fig.4 A). Figs. 3 A and4 A show that propranolol produced a modest increase in basal leptin mRNA in both depot sites of WT mice (p < 0.05), but did not impair leptin's ability to decrease expression of its own message in either site (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). In contrast, ICV leptin failed to decrease leptin mRNA in epididymal or retroperitoneal WAT from β3-KO mice (Figs.3 B and 4 B). Propranolol alone produced a slight increase in leptin mRNA in both depot sites of β3-AR KO mice (p < 0.05), and treating these mice with propranolol and leptin produced no additional change in leptin mRNA (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). The failure of ICV leptin to down-regulate leptin mRNA in WAT from β3-KO mice coupled with the inability of propranolol to block leptin's ability to down-regulate leptin mRNA in WT mice indicates that the β3-adrenoreceptor is both necessary and sufficient for mediation of this response.Figure 4Ribonuclease protection assay of leptin mRNA from retroperitoneal WAT of FVB/NJ (A) and β3-AR KO mice (B). Total RNA from retroperitoneal WAT of wild type (5.0 μg) and β3-AR KO (2.0 μg) mice was hybridized with an antisense probe for leptin mRNA (nucleotides 1–355) and 18 S rRNA (nucleotides 715–794).

https://openalex.org/W2127518646,"We have systematically screened EMS-mutagenized Drosophila for embryonic lethal strains with defects in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, this screen led to the identification of several alleles with missense mutations in highly conserved regions of Dgad1. Analysis of these gad mutants reveals that they are paralyzed owing to defects in glutamatergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Further electrophysiological and immunohistochemical examination reveals that these mutants have greatly reduced numbers of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in an otherwise morphologically normal synapse. By overexpressing wild-type Dgad1 in selected neurons, we show that GAD is specifically required in the presynaptic neuron to induce a postsynaptic glutamate receptor field, and that the level of postsynaptic receptors is closely dependent on presynaptic GAD function. These data demonstrate that GAD plays an unexpected role in glutamatergic synaptogenesis."

However, the molecular mechanisms governing regulated exocytosis are not yet fully understood. Here, we have established an assay system using permeabilized platelets to analyze the Ca2+-induced exocytosis of both types of granules, focusing on RabGTPases. Incubation with Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, an inhibitory regulator of RabGTPases, reduced membrane-bound RabGTPases extensively, and caused strong inhibition of the Ca2+-induced secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF) stored in α-granules, but not that of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in dense-core granules. Specifically, Rab4 co-fractionated with vWF and P-selectin (an α-granule marker) upon separation of platelet organelles by density gradient centrifugation. Incubation of the permeabilized platelets with cell extracts expressing the dominant negative mutant of His-tagged Rab4S22N, but not with those of similar mutant His-Rab3BT36N, inhibited the vWF secretion, whereas neither of the cell extracts affected the [3H]5-HT secretion. Importantly, the inhibition of vWF secretion was rescued by depleting the cell extracts of the His-Rab4S22N with nickel beads. Thus, in platelets, the regulatory mechanisms governing α- and dense-core granule secretions are distinct, and Rab4 is an essential regulator of the Ca2+-induced exocytosis of α-granules.

Incubation of the permeabilized platelets with cell extracts expressing the dominant negative mutant of His-tagged Rab4S22N, but not with those of similar mutant His-Rab3BT36N, inhibited the vWF secretion, whereas neither of the cell extracts affected the [3H]5-HT secretion. Importantly, the inhibition of vWF secretion was rescued by depleting the cell extracts of the His-Rab4S22N with nickel beads. Thus, in platelets, the regulatory mechanisms governing α- and dense-core granule secretions are distinct, and Rab4 is an essential regulator of the Ca2+-induced exocytosis of α-granules. 5-hydroxytryptamine von Willebrand factor α-solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein SNAPreceptor target vesicular synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa GDP dissociation inhibitor heat shock protein 60 streptolysin O polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin wild type Certain types of cells contain specialized granules, which are released in response to extracellular stimuli. The process is known as regulated exocytosis, which is often triggered by the increased concentration of intracellular calcium ions, followed by docking and fusion of granule membrane with plasma membrane (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Platelets contain three types of such granules, dense-core granules, α-granules, and lysosomes, which are secreted upon activation of platelets (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J., R.

Febbraio M. Blood. 1992; 80: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dense-core granules contain small molecules such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1 and α-granules contain newly synthesized proteins such as von Willebrand factors (vWF). Despite the biological significance of these secretions in platelet function (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J., R. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Recent advances have shed light on the mechanism of intracellular membrane docking/fusion. An ATPase, N -ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor (NSF), and its binding protein, solubleNSF attachment protein (α-SNAP), are required for priming SNAP -receptors (SNARE) (4Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) on vesicular (v-) and target (t-) membranes. Then, the cognate v- and t-SNARE (trans) complex on both sides of the membranes are formed, resulting in their docking/fusion (5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 6Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Many v- and t-SNARE homologues have been identified from mammals to yeast, and the SNARE complex-mediated mechanism has been demonstrated to play essential roles in many pathways of intracellular vesicle transport (7Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the case of platelets, NSF (8Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α-SNAP (8Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently been shown to be required for the granule secretion. Furthermore, syntaxin2 and synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa (SNAP23), which are t-SNARE proteins, have been shown to be essential for the dense-core granule secretion (9Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and syntaxin4 and SNAP23 function in the α-granule secretion (10Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the SNAREs are not the only molecules governing the regulation of intracellular membrane docking/fusion. The RabGTPases are also essential regulatory molecules, which are required at a step upstream of the formation of the SNARE complexes (11Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). RabGTPase family is composed of more than 30 members and belongs to the Ras-related small GTPase superfamily (13Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22161-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, Rab proteins have both GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms regulated by the GDP/GTP cycles. The active GTP-bound forms exert their functions on the specific organelle membranes through their effector molecules, with which only the active GTP-bound form can be associated (13Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22161-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). RabGTPases are also regulated by a unique negative regulator named Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (16Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). RabGDI is a cytosolic protein, which forms a complex with GDP-bound Rab proteins to inhibit the GDP/GTP exchange (16Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol.

Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, RabGDI has recently been demonstrated to play also positive roles to accompany Rab proteins from cytosol to the proper membranes (17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Horiuchi H. Giner A. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11257-11262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The functional requirement of RabGTPases in vesicle docking/fusion has been demonstrated using genetics, morphology, and biochemistry (19Olkkonen V.M. Stenmark H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 176: 1-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, mutations in Sec4, one of the yeast Rab proteins, cause accumulation of trans-Golgi network-derived vesicles, thereby demonstrating the requirement for this GTPase in docking vesicles to the plasma membrane (20Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In mammals, Rab5 regulates early endosome vesicle docking through its effector protein EEA1 (21Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The Rab5 effector proteins participate in oligomeric complexes regulating the priming and pairing of SNARE complexes, which ultimately drive bilayer fusion (22McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus, RabGTPases are upstream regulators of SNARE complex formation. So far, several RabGTPases including Rab3B, -4, -6, -8, and -27 have been demonstrated to be present in platelets (23Karniguian A. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Nagata K. Suzuki T. Okano Y. Hamaguchi M. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 189: 330-335Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear whether or not Rab proteins regulate the regulated exocytosis of α- and dense-core granules. If it is the case, which Rab protein regulates the process? In order to address these questions, we have developed an in vitro assay system using permeabilized platelets for analyzing α- and dense-core granule secretions induced by Ca2+. Here, we show that Rab4 is an essential regulator of the α-granule secretion. His-tagged RabGDI (25Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) were purified from overexpressingEscherichia coli, kindly provided by Dr. M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), with nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction followed by extensive dialysis against Buffer A (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl22 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In some experiments, the RabGDI was further purified using a MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column, followed by dialysis against Buffer A. Rab3B-containing plasmid (27Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka Univerity, Osaka, Japan). Rab4b plasmid (28Chavrier P. Vingron M. Sander C. Simons K. Zerial M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6578-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was from Dr. M. Zerial. From these plasmids, mutant Rab3BT36N and Rab4S22N were produced by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed that these DNA sequences were correct. Then, these mutants and wild type (wt)-Rab4 were cloned into mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1/His C (Invitrogen) at the BamHI-EcoRI site and transfected transiently using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) into subconfluent HeLa cells in a 10-cm dish. The transfected cells were harvested after 24 h and extracted proteins by incubation of the cell pellets in Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation of the mixture at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as cell extracts expressing the His-tagged Rab proteins. Anti-Na-K ATPase rabbit polyclonal antibody (29Akayama M. Nakada H. Omori K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct.

Ohmori (Kansai Medical University, Kadoma, Japan), and anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibody and anti-RabGDI antiserum (30Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was from Dr. M. Zerial. Anti-vWF rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma; anti-His monoclonal antibody from Qiagen; anti-cathepsin-D, anti-Rab8, and anti-Rab27 monoclonal antibodies from Transduction Laboratories; anti-Rab4, anti-Rab6, and anti-P-selectin rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and anti-heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) goat polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse, rabbit, and goat IgG monoclonal antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, which were used as secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unless otherwise specified, all the chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except for streptolysin O (SLO), which was from Dr. Bhakdi (Mainz University, Mainz, Germany). The assay method will be described elsewhere. 2A. Yoshioka, R. Shirakawa, H. Horiuchi, H. Nishioka, A. Tabuchi, and T. Kita, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, freshly obtained washed platelets (5 × 107 platelets/assay, counted with Coulter counter) were incubated with [3H]5-HT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to allow uptake into dense-core granules. The platelet plasma membrane was permeabilized in Buffer A containing 0.6 μg/ml SLO essentially as described (31Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Alexandrov K. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Approximately, 80% of the cytosol was lost by the procedure, as determined by quantifying the leakage of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase measured with a kit (Waken Co., Osaka, Japan). Usually, the permeabilized platelets per assay contained approximately 20,000 cpm of [3H]5-HT. Then, the platelets were stimulated by addition of CaCl2. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant containing any secreted [3H]5-HT and vWF were measured for the presence of [3H]5-HT by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman) and vWF by Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitation with anti-vWF antibody (Sigma) followed by quantification using densitometric detection and NIH Image software. Unless otherwise specified, the assay was performed in 1 min at 30 °C with the calculated calcium ion concentration at 20 μm (32Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of ATP (31Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Alexandrov K. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and 3 mg of protein/ml of rat brain cytosol, which contained approximately 0.5 μm RabGDI and 3 nm Rab4. In experiments using RabGDI and cell extracts expressing Rab proteins, the platelets after permeabilization were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with the rat brain cytosol in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), RabGDI, boiled RabGDI, or the indicated cell extracts, followed by stimulation with CaCl2. Boiled RabGDI was prepared by incubation of the purified RabGDI at 95 °C for 10 min. Secretion levels of vWF and [3H]5-HT were expressed as percentages of the total vWF and [3H]5-HT, respectively, above those (2–4% of total vWF and 5–10% of total [3H]5-HT) released before the final incubation. Unless otherwise specified, they were expressed as means ± S.E. of more than five independent experiments with similar results. For vWF secretion, representative Western blots were also shown in some figures. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) or densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard. Platelets from 50 ml of blood were washed and resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer B (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl), and broken by sonication. The sample was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to remove unbroken platelets. The aliquot of the low speed supernatant was further separated for the membrane fraction (pellet) and cytosolic fraction (supernatant) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The rest of the low speed supernatant was layered on the top of metrizamide stepwise gradient (3.5 ml each of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40% from the top) in Buffer B and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm with a Beckman SW28 rotor for 3 h at 4 °C. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by Western blot with indicated antibodies. To investigate mechanism of regulated exocytosis in platelets, we established an in vitro assay system using SLO-permeabilized platelets by monitoring secreted vWF stored in α-granules and [3H]5-HT in dense-core granules (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J., R. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar). It is well known that agonists drive the granule secretions by increasing the intracellular calcium ion concentration in platelets (35Knight D.E. Hallam T.J. Scrutton M.C. Nature. 1982; 296: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since calcium ion concentration inside the platelets would be the same as that of the outside following the permeabilization, we used calcium chloride as a stimulus. Therefore, we here analyzed the secretion mechanism triggered by increased Ca2+. In the assay, the Ca2+-induced secretions of both granules were quick and they were efficiently secreted within 1 min (Fig.1, A and B), similar to that observed in intact platelets stimulated with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin (data not shown). Although Ca2+ at 20 nm, the basal condition in this assay, only slightly induced both granule secretions, Ca2+ at 2–200 μm efficiently induced these secretions (Fig.2, A and B). Since it has been shown that the [Ca2+] in resting platelet cytosol is around 10 nm and it becomes increased to 1–10 μm upon platelet activation (35Knight D.E. Hallam T.J. Scrutton M.C. Nature. 1982; 296: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the sensitivity of secretion in the permeabilized platelets to [Ca2+] was also similar to that in intact platelets. Thus, the secretions of α- and dense-core granules in our in vitro assay system were similar to those in intact platelets, in terms of the time course and the Ca2+ sensitivity.Figure 3Purified RabGDI (A) extracted membrane-bound RabGTPases (B) and inhibited the Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion (C), but not the dense-core granule secretion (D).

B, permeabilized platelets (lane 1) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with BSA (lane 2), RabGDI (lane 3), and boiled RabGDI (lane 4) at 10 μm.

We first analyzed the effects of RabGDI (16Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), a general inhibitor of RabGTPases. We purified His-RabGDI from the overexpressing E. coli with nickel-agarose beads to more than 90% purity (Fig.3 A), followed by dialysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When permeabilized platelets were incubated with the RabGDI, more than 80% of Rab4, -5, -6, and -8 were extracted from the membrane of the permeabilized platelets (Fig. 3 B). Although RabGDI has been shown to extract all the tested RabGTPases from the membrane (25Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rab27 remained on the membrane (Fig. 3 B). The data suggested that there was some difference in sensitivity of RabGTPases to extraction by RabGDI from the membrane in platelets, similarly as observed in a fibroblast cell line (36Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both vWF stored in α-granules and P-selectin which is a cell adhesion molecule stored on α-granule membrane (37Stenberg P.E. McEver R.P. Shuman M.A. Jacques Y.V. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) were not extracted by the RabGDI treatment, suggesting that α-granule membrane remained intact by the RabGDI treatment. Under these conditions, incubation with RabGDI inhibited the Ca2+-induced secretion of vWF strongly (Fig.3 C), whereas the secretion of [3H]5-HT measured in the same samples was not affected (Fig. 3 D). The effects of the RabGDI treatment were obtained specifically due to the RabGDI function. First, the purified RabGDI was extremely pure (Fig.3 A) and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer used in the reaction. Second, the inhibition was abolished when the RabGDI sample was boiled (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting the effect was not due to the buffer. Third, the RabGDI further purified with a MonoQ anion exchange column also inhibited the Ca2+-induced secretion of vWF (data not shown), suggesting that the effect was not due to any contaminating proteins. These data suggested that the regulatory mechanisms of α- and dense-core granule secretions were distinct and that certain Rab protein(s) were required for α-granule secretion, whereas RabGTPases sensitive to the RabGDI treatment might not be involved in dense-core granule secretion. It has been demonstrated that there are certain vesicle populations, such as those transported to apical domain of an epithelial cell line (38Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and vesicles containing influenza virus hemagglutinin in a fibroblast cell line (39Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whose transports are resistant to RabGDI treatments. Since the RabGDI treatment did not affect the dense-core granule secretion (Fig. 3 D), the dense-core granules could be classified into such a RabGDI-resistant group of vesicles. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that RabGDI-insensitive Rab proteins such as Rab27 (Fig. 3 B) might regulate the dense-core granule secretion. Next, in order to determine which Rab proteins were associated with α-granules, platelet organelles were separated by 5–40% stepwise metrizamide-density gradient (Fig.4 A). In the separation, both vWF (2Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J., R. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. McGlave P. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar) and P-selectin (37Stenberg P.E. McEver R.P. Shuman M.A. Jacques Y.V. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) co-fractionated mainly in the 20–25% layer and less in the 25–30%, indicating the position of α-granules. Rab4 was recovered in two peaks, the 0–5% layer and in the high density fractions, which were overlapped with the fractions of vWF and P-selectin, suggesting that some Rab4 could be associated with α-granules. Although Rab6 and Rab8 have been suggested to be associated with α-granules (23Karniguian A. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), they were recovered widely in the gradient and some parts of them were recovered in the fractions of vWF and P-selectin (Fig. 4 A). Rab27 has also been suggested to be associated with α-granules (40Nagata K. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 195: 1081-1088Google Scholar). However, Rab27 was recovered in the slightly lighter fractions than those of vWF and P-selectin (Fig.4 A). Rab3B was recovered in the lighter fractions of the 0% and the 0–5% layer. Rab5 was recovered largely in different fractions from those of Rab4 (Fig. 4 A), although both of them have been shown to be localized to early endosomes in fibroblast cell lines (41van der Sluijs P.

In the gradient separation, plasma membrane marker Na-K ATPase (29Akayama M. Nakada H. Omori K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and lysosomal cathepsin-D (43Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21738-21745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were recovered in the lighter fractions, and mitochondrial HSP60 (44Kreisel W. Hildebrandt H. Schiltz E. Kohler G. Spamer C. Dietz C. Mossner W. Heilmann C. Acta Histochem. 1994; 96: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was in the heavier fractions (Fig.4 A), compared with those of α-granules. According to the results using a similar separation shown previously (23Karniguian A. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), dense-core granule could be recovered in the 35–40% layer or the bottom of the tube in the condition. Since cytosolic protein RabGDI (17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was recovered in both the 0% and the 0–5% fractions, the 0–5% fraction might possibly contain both cytosol and low density organelles. Therefore, to clarify the cytosolic amounts of organelle markers and Rab proteins, the low speed supernatant of the sonicated platelets was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate the cytosol from the membrane fraction. Then, comparable amounts of both fractions were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 4 B). As expected, vWF, P-selectin, cathepsin-D, and HSP60 were recovered in the membrane fraction. Although Na-K ATPase was recovered in the 0–5% fraction in the density-gradient separation (Fig. 4 A), it was detected exclusively in the membrane fraction. As shown previously, Rab3B (23Karniguian A. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and RabGDI (17Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were recovered mainly in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4 B). Rab4, -5, -6, -8, and -27 were recovered mainly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B). The detection of Rab4 in the 0–5% fraction in the density-gradient separation (Fig. 4 A) could reflect the presence of Rab4 on lighter density organelles. Since the inhibition of Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion by RabGDI (Fig. 3 C) suggested involvement of Rab protein(s) in the regulation, we were prompted to determine which Rab(s) were responsible for it. Because of the possible association of Rab4 with α-granules (Fig. 4 A), we focused upon Rab4, using Rab3B as a control. First, we produced cell extracts expressing His-tagged Rab3BT36N and Rab4S22N (45Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4497-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using Triton X-100 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 6 A). These mutants correspond to H-RasS17N (46Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and Rab5S34N (26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), which have been shown to bind GDP preferentially, but not GTP, and demonstrated to act as dominant negative proteins. The concentrations of the His-tagged mutant Rab proteins were determined by quantitative Western blot with the anti-His antibody using His-tagged Rab5 purified from overexpressingE. coli as a standard (Fig. 6 A). Then we analyzed the effects of Triton X-100 on the assay, which were used for producing the cell extracts and brought into the assay. As shown in Fig.5, in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100, most of vWF and [3H]5-HT were detected in the media even without the Ca2+ stimulation, which was presumably due to solubilization of the membrane structure of platelets. However, in the presence of no more than 0.005% Triton X-100, the amounts of both secretions were low without the Ca2+ stimulation and efficiently induced by the stimulation (Fig. 5). Therefore, we analyzed the effects of Rab proteins on the secretions in the presence of 0.005% Triton X-100. When the permeabilized platelets were first incubated with the cell extracts expressing His-tagged Rab4S22N at 50 nm, the Ca2+-induced secretion of vWF was inhibited extensively (Fig. 6 B). However, incubation with cell extracts expressing His-tagged Rab3BT36N at 50 nmor with the mock-transfected cell extracts did not inhibit the vWF secretion (Fig. 6 B). Cell extracts expressing Rab4S22N at 20 nm inhibited the vWF secretion by approximately 50% (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of Rab4S22N was concentration-dependent. Consistent with the results of experiments using RabGDI (Fig. 3 B), incubation with neither of the cell extracts expressing the mutant Rab3BT36N nor Rab4S22N inhibited the Ca2+-induced secretion of [3H]5-HT (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of dominant negative Rab4 was specific for the α-granule secretion, but not for the dense-core granule secretion. When the His-tagged Rab4S22N was depleted from the cell extracts with nickel-agarose beads completely (Fig. 6 A), the cell extracts did not inhibit the α-granule secretion (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect was due to the mutant Rab4, specifically the inhibition of Rab4 function. In the last set of experiments, we analyzed the effects of wt-Rab4 (Fig. 6 A). Incubation of the permeabilized platelets with the cell extracts expressing His-tagged wt-Rab4 at 50 nmdid not affect the Ca2+-induced secretion of vWF in α-granules under conditions where incubation with the cell extracts expressing His-Rab4S22N at 50 nm strongly inhibited the vWF secretion (Fig. 7 A). These results indicated that the inhibitory activity of Rab4 for the α-granule secretion was specific to the mutant. As expected, incubation with the cell extracts expressing wt-Rab4 did not affect the Ca2+-induced secretion of [3H]5-HT in dense-core granules (Fig. 7 B). Thus, Rab4 is involved in the regulation of the α-granule secretion in platelets, although we cannot exclude the possibility of the involvement of Rab6, Rab8, Rab27, or yet unidentified RabGTPases. Rab4 has been first demonstrated to be localized to early endosomes and regulate the recycling vesicle transport in a fibroblast cell line (41van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown to positively regulate the transport of vesicles containing glucose transporter 4 in adipocytes in response to insulin since a C-terminal peptide of Rab4 and an anti-Rab4 antibody inhibited it (47Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, Ohnishi et al. (48Ohnishi H. Mine T. Shibata H. Ueda N. Tsuchida T. Fujita T. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have shown that the same Rab4 C-terminal peptide and the anti-Rab4 antibody enhanced the amylase secretion in response to cholecystokinin in pancreatic acinar cells. The authors concluded that Rab4 has functions as an inhibitor in regulated secretion of amylase (48Ohnishi H. Mine T. Shibata H. Ueda N. Tsuchida T. Fujita T. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, although Rab4 might be involved in regulation of certain regulated exocytosis, the function of Rab4 has not yet been concluded to be a positive or negative regulator. Since our results have shown that the dominant negative mutant Rab4 inhibited the α-granule secretion in platelets, Rab4 could positively regulate the α-granule secretion in platelets. The Rab3 isoforms have been noted as regulators of Ca2+-induced exocytosis (13Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22161-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). For example, in Rab3A-deficient mice, long term potentiation of mossy fibers is abolished, demonstrating the involvement of Rab3A in the regulation of the neurotransmitter release (49Castillo P.E. Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Tzounopoulos T. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of Rab3B expression has been shown to attenuate Ca2+-induced exocytosis in rat anterior pituitary cells (50Lledo P.M. Vernier P. Vincent J.D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, in our results, Rab3B did not seem to be involved in the Ca2+-induced α- or dense-core granule secretion in platelets. In summary, a permeabilized platelet system established here revealed that small GTPase Rab4 could positively regulate the Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion and that Rab proteins which are sensitive to the RabGDI-treatment might not play important roles in the dense-core granule secretion. Further investigation is required for elucidation how Rab4 regulates the α-granule secretion. We are grateful to Dr. Y. Takai and Dr. M. Zerial for valuable discussion, continuous encouragement, providing materials, and critical reading of the manuscript; to Dr. H. McBride of EMBL for the critical reading; to Dr. K. Ohmori for providing the antibody; and to T. Matsubara for technical assistance."

Previously we showed quinidine arrested MCF-7 cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle and led to a G1 to G0 transition followed by apoptotic cell death. The present experiments demonstrated that MCF-7, MCF-7ras, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells transiently differentiate before undergoing apoptosis in response to quinidine. The cells accumulated lipid droplets, and the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeleton was reorganized. Hyperacetylated histone H4 appeared within 2 h of the addition of quinidine to the medium, and levels were maximal by 24 h. Quinidine-treated MCF-7 cells showed elevated p21 WAF1 , hypophosphorylation and suppression of retinoblastoma protein, and down-regulation of cyclin D1, similar to the cell cycle response observed with cells induced to differentiate by histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A, and trapoxin. Quinidine did not show evidence for direct inhibition of histone deacetylase enzymatic activity in vitro. HDAC1 was undetectable in MCF-7 cells 30 min after addition of quinidine to the growth medium. The proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin completely protected HDAC1 from the action of quinidine. We conclude that quinidine is a breast tumor cell differentiating agent that causes the loss of HDAC1 via a proteasomal sensitive mechanism.

Histones H3 and H4 are the principal histone targets of HDAC enzymatic activity, and these histones undergo acetylation at lysine residues at multiple sites within the histone tails extending from the histone octamer of the nucleosome core. The association of HDAC proteins with mSin3, N-CoR, or SMRT and other transcriptional repressors has led to the hypothesis that HDAC proteins function as transcriptional co-repressors (reviewed in Ref. 1Davie J.R. Chadee D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30 (suppl.): 203-213Crossref Google Scholar). The spectrum of genes that show alterations in gene transcription rates in response to decreased HDAC activity is quite restricted (2Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC) such as trichostatin A (TSA), superoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), trapoxin, and phenyl butyrate cause major alterations in cellular activity including the induction of cellular differentiation and apoptosis (3Medina V.

Trichostatin A, SAHA, and trapoxin stimulate histone acetylation by acting as direct inhibitors of HDAC enzyme activity (6Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A, SAHA, and trapoxin possess lysine-like side chains and act as chemical analogs of lysine substrates. Molecular models based upon the x-ray crystal structure of an HDAC-like protein indicate that trichostatin A and SAHA can bind within the active site of the HDAC enzyme and interact with a zinc metal ion within the catalytic pocket that is critical for enzymatic activity (7Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Trapoxin is an irreversible HDAC enzyme inhibitor (8Kijima M. Yoshida M. Sugita K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22429-22435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Much remains to be learned about the biochemical events subsequent to HDAC inhibition that lead to cell cycle arrest, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. However, a spectrum of biological responses characteristic of HDAC inhibitors has emerged, including cell cycle arrest in G1, elevated p21 WAF1 expression, hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), hyperacetylation of histones, particularly H3 and H4, and apoptosis. Histone hyperacetylation is directly linked to the activation of p21 transcription and is p53-independent (5Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34940-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This observation provides an important link between HDAC inhibition and cell cycle arrest because p21 WAF1 plays a critical role in causing G1 cell cycle arrest via inhibition of the G1cyclin-dependent kinase family (9Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1572-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p21 WAF1 has also been associated with apoptosis, but the mechanism of p21 WAF1 induction of apoptosis requires further investigation (10Sheikh M.S. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1899-1905PubMed Google Scholar).Cancer therapy that targets the activity of genes or gene products controlling cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis is a promising new strategy. Because HDAC inhibitors regulate the cell cycle and cause both cellular differentiation and apoptosis, they comprise an interesting group of compounds with potential for development into a new category of clinically significant anti-tumor agents. Single, key protein targets for “gene-regulatory chemotherapy” are difficult to identify due to the existence of parallel, functionally overlapping signaling cascades. For this reason, use of cancer therapies that target multiple intracellular signaling pathways, such as observed with the HDAC inhibitors, is an intriguing approach that addresses the problem of redundancy in growth signaling pathways. In this regard, the HDAC inhibitor phenyl butyrate was recently shown to have clinical anti-tumor activity (11Warrell Jr., R.P. He L.-Z. Richon V. Calleja E. Pandolfi P.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).Quinidine is a natural product therapeutic agent originally used as an anti-malarial and as an anti-arrhythmic agent. Previous studies with human breast tumor cell lines demonstrated that quinidine (90 μm) is an anti-proliferative agent as well. Quinidine arrested cells in early G1 phase and induced apoptosis by 72–96 h in MCF-7 cells (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the biochemical basis for the anti-proliferative effect of quinidine was not well understood. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of the anti-proliferative activity of quinidine, we investigated the effects of quinidine on histone acetylation and cell cycle regulatory proteins. In this report, we show that quinidine causes hyperacetylation of histone H4, down-regulation of HDAC1 protein levels, and cellular differentiation in a panel of human breast tumor cell lines. We conclude that quinidine is a novel differentiating agent that stimulates histone hyperacetylation as a result of HDAC1 protein degradation.DISCUSSIONQuinidine-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells can be attributed to the rapid elimination of HDAC1 protein, a response that was blocked by MG-132 and lactacystin, two inhibitors of proteasome-mediated proteolysis. HDAC1 protein was undetectable within 30 min after the addition of quinidine to the medium of MCF-7 cells, and hyperacetylated histone H4 appeared between 1 and 2 h. Levels of HDAC1 protein were completely suppressed between 0.5 and 6 h, and during this time H4 acetylation levels increased. H4 acetylation was maintained at 12 and 24 h, despite the partial restoration of HDAC1 protein at these same time points. These data indicate that quinidine-induced reductions in HDAC1 protein levels are unlikely to explain fully the regulation of H4 acetylation state in MCF-7 cells by quinidine. Additional HDAC enzymes or effects upon histone acetylation rates could possibly play a role as well.An earlier study showed that over this initial 48-h period, 80% of the MCF-7 cell population had shifted into G0, a quiescent state marked by the absence of Ki67 antigen immunoreactivity (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cellular differentiation manifested as the accumulation of lipid droplets, and a reorganization of the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeleton was evident after this initial 48-h period. Quinidine exhibited all the responses typical of known HDAC inhibitory drugs, with the exception that quinidine had no direct inhibitory effect upon HDAC1 enzymatic activity. We conclude from the current studies that quinidine is a novel differentiating agent that causes histone hyperacetylation, in part, by physical elimination of HDAC1 protein rather than the inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity.Histone H4 hyperacetylation and induction of cellular differentiation by quinidine were seen in a panel of human breast tumor cell lines that were selected for study on the basis of their diversity of genetic backgrounds. The differentiation response to quinidine was independent of the estrogen receptor (ER) status. Cell lines representative of ER-positive and ER-negative human breast carcinoma cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of quinidine. The ER status of the estrogen receptor positive cell lines is MCF-7 (ER-α and ER-β), T47D (ER-α and ER-β), and MDA-MB-231 (ER-β). MDA-MB-435 cells expressed very low levels of ER-β and no ER-α (37Fuqua S.A. Schiff R. Parra I. Friedrichs W.E. Su J.L. McKee D.D. Slentz-Kesler K. Moore L.B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T.

MCF-7 and T47D cells display an epithelial morphology and show similarities with mammary ductal and luminal epithelial cells, respectively (30Jing Y. Zhang J. Waxman S. Mira-y-Lopez R. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit an elongated cellular morphology that is also typical of MDA-MB-435 cells. Our results demonstrate that quinidine is a differentiation agent in both types of mammary tumor cells.HDAC inhibitors reverse the transformed phenotype of NIH3T3ras cells, and this property has been used successfully as a screening assay for the identification of new HDAC inhibitors (40Futamura M. Monden Y. Okabe T. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1119-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 41Itazaki H. Nagashima K. Sugita K. Yoshida H. Kawamura Y. Yasuda Y. Matsumoto K.

Quinidine elicited a more differentiated phenotype in MCF-7ras cells, an MCF-7 cell derivative produced by stable transformation with v-Ha-ras, thus demonstrating that quinidine, like other HDAC inhibitors, can reverse an Ha-ras-induced phenotype.Quinidine induced differentiation independently of wild-type p53. The ability of quinidine to cause differentiation of p53 mutant cell lines is consistent for a role of histone hyperacetylation in the response. HDAC inhibitors typically induce a p53-independent activation of p21 WAF1 gene expression (5Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol.

Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and quinidine raised p21 WAF1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells approximately 11-fold within 12 h. Although p21 WAF1 was reported to be low to undetectable in MDA-MB-231, p21 WAF1 was detected in Western analyses of both MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells in a p53-independent fashion in response to serum deprivation, adriamycin, etoposide (42Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Sheikh M.S. Li X.-S. Chen J.-C. Shao Z.-M. Ordonez J.V. Fontana J.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3407-3415PubMed Google Scholar), and quinidine (data not shown). These data support the idea that the p21 WAF1 gene is present but inactive in growing MDA-MB-231 cells. Since histone hyperacetylation of the p21 WAF1 gene occurs in response to HDAC inhibitors, it might be involved in the pathway of p53-independent activation of p21 WAF1 gene expression (5Sambucetti L.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34940-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).The processes of cellular differentiation and cell cycle progression are interdependent. G1 arrest is a necessary but insufficient condition for differentiation in numerous cell types including leukemic cells, keratinocytes, colonic epithelium, and muscle cells. In all of these cells, induction of p21 WAF1 protein and G1 cell cycle arrest occurred prior to differentiation (44Chang B.D. Wuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B.

We hypothesize that the differentiated state can be viewed as a cellular response to G1 arrest, requiring a change in gene expression profile and suppression of cell death pathways. The response of MCF-7 breast tumor cells to quinidine is consistent with this model.To begin to understand how quinidine might elicit G1 arrest of MCF-7 cells, we have focused on the action of quinidine as a potassium channel blocking agent. Quinidine enters cells and inhibits cardiac potassium channels by binding to the intracellular face of the ion pore (51Yeola S.W. Rich T, C. Uebele V.N. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the location of the quinidine-binding site on the ATP-sensitive potassium channel is unknown, quinidine is freely permeable across membranes and inhibits the ATP-sensitive potassium channels whether it is applied to the external or internal surface of a lipid membrane bilayer (52Iliev I.G. Marino A.A. Cell. & Mol Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar).In the presence of quinidine, MCF-7 cells accumulate at a position 12 h into G1 phase (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This position, defined by cell cycle arrest and release experiments, precedes the lovastatin arrest point by 5–6 h and is clearly distinct from the restriction point described by Pardee (53Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) near the G1/S transition. The present work showed that quinidine treatment caused elevated levels of p53 and p21 WAF1 protein by 12 h (Fig. 3), the point within G1 where MCF-7 cells arrest in response to quinidine (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When p53 and p21 WAF1 proteins were assayed before 12 h, p53 was undetectable, and p21WAF was first detected after 8 h of quinidine treatment (data not shown), suggesting a p53-independent induction of p21 WAF1 occurred prior to arrest in G1. CDK4 and cyclin D1 protein levels were also reduced, as was CDK4 activity as demonstrated by the abundance of hypophosphorylated pRb protein. Based upon our observations in MCF-7 cells, we conclude that p21 WAF1 protein levels become elevated prior to the G1 arrest in response to quinidine and could initiate the G1 arrest. Hypophosphorylated pRb protein is prominent in quinidine-treated MCF-7 cells, and this could act to sustain the G1 state by preventing the transition into S phase. The G1 arrest induced by quinidine in MCF-7 cells was correlated with the blockade of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in MCF-7 cells (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G.

Direct evidence for the involvement of potassium ions in the G1 arrest was provided using valinomycin, a potassium-selective ionophore to stimulate a G1-S phase transition in the presence of quinidine (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).In summary, quinidine, a drug that is used therapeutically in the treatment of malarial infections and cardiac arrhythmia, was shown to be useful as an inducer of cellular differentiation in human breast tumor epithelial cells. Quinidine caused histone H4 hyperacetylation and cellular differentiation in human breast tumor cells following the rapid loss of HDAC1 involving a proteasome-dependent pathway. Additional experiments are needed to determine how the action of quinidine upon ATP-sensitive potassium channels initiates the molecular events underlying the differentiation response. Histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 proteins comprise a family of related proteins that act in conjunction with histone acetyltransferase proteins to modulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity via changes in the acetylation status of histones. Histones H3 and H4 are the principal histone targets of HDAC enzymatic activity, and these histones undergo acetylation at lysine residues at multiple sites within the histone tails extending from the histone octamer of the nucleosome core. The association of HDAC proteins with mSin3, N-CoR, or SMRT and other transcriptional repressors has led to the hypothesis that HDAC proteins function as transcriptional co-repressors (reviewed in Ref. 1Davie J.R. Chadee D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30 (suppl.): 203-213Crossref Google Scholar). The spectrum of genes that show alterations in gene transcription rates in response to decreased HDAC activity is quite restricted (2Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC) such as trichostatin A (TSA), superoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), trapoxin, and phenyl butyrate cause major alterations in cellular activity including the induction of cellular differentiation and apoptosis (3Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707PubMed Google Scholar, 4Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34940-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A, SAHA, and trapoxin stimulate histone acetylation by acting as direct inhibitors of HDAC enzyme activity (6Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A, SAHA, and trapoxin possess lysine-like side chains and act as chemical analogs of lysine substrates. Molecular models based upon the x-ray crystal structure of an HDAC-like protein indicate that trichostatin A and SAHA can bind within the active site of the HDAC enzyme and interact with a zinc metal ion within the catalytic pocket that is critical for enzymatic activity (7Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Trapoxin is an irreversible HDAC enzyme inhibitor (8Kijima M. Yoshida M. Sugita K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22429-22435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much remains to be learned about the biochemical events subsequent to HDAC inhibition that lead to cell cycle arrest, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. However, a spectrum of biological responses characteristic of HDAC inhibitors has emerged, including cell cycle arrest in G1, elevated p21 WAF1 expression, hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), hyperacetylation of histones, particularly H3 and H4, and apoptosis. Histone hyperacetylation is directly linked to the activation of p21 transcription and is p53-independent (5Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34940-34947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This observation provides an important link between HDAC inhibition and cell cycle arrest because p21 WAF1 plays a critical role in causing G1 cell cycle arrest via inhibition of the G1cyclin-dependent kinase family (9Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1572-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p21 WAF1 has also been associated with apoptosis, but the mechanism of p21 WAF1 induction of apoptosis requires further investigation (10Sheikh M.S. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1899-1905PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer therapy that targets the activity of genes or gene products controlling cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis is a promising new strategy. Because HDAC inhibitors regulate the cell cycle and cause both cellular differentiation and apoptosis, they comprise an interesting group of compounds with potential for development into a new category of clinically significant anti-tumor agents. Single, key protein targets for “gene-regulatory chemotherapy” are difficult to identify due to the existence of parallel, functionally overlapping signaling cascades. For this reason, use of cancer therapies that target multiple intracellular signaling pathways, such as observed with the HDAC inhibitors, is an intriguing approach that addresses the problem of redundancy in growth signaling pathways. In this regard, the HDAC inhibitor phenyl butyrate was recently shown to have clinical anti-tumor activity (11Warrell Jr., R.P. He L.-Z. Richon V. Calleja E. Pandolfi P.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Quinidine is a natural product therapeutic agent originally used as an anti-malarial and as an anti-arrhythmic agent. Previous studies with human breast tumor cell lines demonstrated that quinidine (90 μm) is an anti-proliferative agent as well. Quinidine arrested cells in early G1 phase and induced apoptosis by 72–96 h in MCF-7 cells (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the biochemical basis for the anti-proliferative effect of quinidine was not well understood. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of the anti-proliferative activity of quinidine, we investigated the effects of quinidine on histone acetylation and cell cycle regulatory proteins. In this report, we show that quinidine causes hyperacetylation of histone H4, down-regulation of HDAC1 protein levels, and cellular differentiation in a panel of human breast tumor cell lines. We conclude that quinidine is a novel differentiating agent that stimulates histone hyperacetylation as a result of HDAC1 protein degradation. DISCUSSIONQuinidine-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells can be attributed to the rapid elimination of HDAC1 protein, a response that was blocked by MG-132 and lactacystin, two inhibitors of proteasome-mediated proteolysis. HDAC1 protein was undetectable within 30 min after the addition of quinidine to the medium of MCF-7 cells, and hyperacetylated histone H4 appeared between 1 and 2 h. Levels of HDAC1 protein were completely suppressed between 0.5 and 6 h, and during this time H4 acetylation levels increased. H4 acetylation was maintained at 12 and 24 h, despite the partial restoration of HDAC1 protein at these same time points. These data indicate that quinidine-induced reductions in HDAC1 protein levels are unlikely to explain fully the regulation of H4 acetylation state in MCF-7 cells by quinidine. Additional HDAC enzymes or effects upon histone acetylation rates could possibly play a role as well.An earlier study showed that over this initial 48-h period, 80% of the MCF-7 cell population had shifted into G0, a quiescent state marked by the absence of Ki67 antigen immunoreactivity (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cellular differentiation manifested as the accumulation of lipid droplets, and a reorganization of the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeleton was evident after this initial 48-h period. Quinidine exhibited all the responses typical of known HDAC inhibitory drugs, with the exception that quinidine had no direct inhibitory effect upon HDAC1 enzymatic activity. We conclude from the current studies that quinidine is a novel differentiating agent that causes histone hyperacetylation, in part, by physical elimination of HDAC1 protein rather than the inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity.Histone H4 hyperacetylation and induction of cellular differentiation by quinidine were seen in a panel of human breast tumor cell lines that were selected for study on the basis of their diversity of genetic backgrounds. The differentiation response to quinidine was independent of the estrogen receptor (ER) status. Cell lines representative of ER-positive and ER-negative human breast carcinoma cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of quinidine. The ER status of the estrogen receptor positive cell lines is MCF-7 (ER-α and ER-β), T47D (ER-α and ER-β), and MDA-MB-231 (ER-β). MDA-MB-435 cells expressed very low levels of ER-β and no ER-α (37Fuqua S.A. Schiff R. Parra I. Friedrichs W.E. Su J.L. McKee D.D. Slentz-Kesler K. Moore L.B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T.

MCF-7 and T47D cells display an epithelial morphology and show similarities with mammary ductal and luminal epithelial cells, respectively (30Jing Y. Zhang J. Waxman S. Mira-y-Lopez R. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit an elongated cellular morphology that is also typical of MDA-MB-435 cells. Our results demonstrate that quinidine is a differentiation agent in both types of mammary tumor cells.HDAC inhibitors reverse the transformed phenotype of NIH3T3ras cells, and this property has been used successfully as a screening assay for the identification of new HDAC inhibitors (40Futamura M. Monden Y. Okabe T. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1119-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 41Itazaki H. Nagashima K. Sugita K. Yoshida H. Kawamura Y. Yasuda Y. Matsumoto K.

Quinidine elicited a more differentiated phenotype in MCF-7ras cells, an MCF-7 cell derivative produced by stable transformation with v-Ha-ras, thus demonstrating that quinidine, like other HDAC inhibitors, can reverse an Ha-ras-induced phenotype.Quinidine induced differentiation independently of wild-type p53. The ability of quinidine to cause differentiation of p53 mutant cell lines is consistent for a role of histone hyperacetylation in the response. HDAC inhibitors typically induce a p53-independent activation of p21 WAF1 gene expression (5Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol.

Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and quinidine raised p21 WAF1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells approximately 11-fold within 12 h. Although p21 WAF1 was reported to be low to undetectable in MDA-MB-231, p21 WAF1 was detected in Western analyses of both MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells in a p53-independent fashion in response to serum deprivation, adriamycin, etoposide (42Sweeney K.J. Swarbrick A. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Sheikh M.S. Li X.-S. Chen J.-C. Shao Z.-M. Ordonez J.V. Fontana J.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3407-3415PubMed Google Scholar), and quinidine (data not shown). These data support the idea that the p21 WAF1 gene is present but inactive in growing MDA-MB-231 cells. Since histone hyperacetylation of the p21 WAF1 gene occurs in response to HDAC inhibitors, it might be involved in the pathway of p53-independent activation of p21 WAF1 gene expression (5Sambucetti L.C.

G1 arrest is a necessary but insufficient condition for differentiation in numerous cell types including leukemic cells, keratinocytes, colonic epithelium, and muscle cells. In all of these cells, induction of p21 WAF1 protein and G1 cell cycle arrest occurred prior to differentiation (44Chang B.D. Wuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B.

Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2865-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and quinidine raised p21 WAF1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells approximately 11-fold within 12 h. Although p21 WAF1 was reported to be low to undetectable in MDA-MB-231, p21 WAF1 was detected in Western analyses of both MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells in a p53-independent fashion in response to serum deprivation, adriamycin, etoposide (42Sweeney K.J.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3407-3415PubMed Google Scholar), and quinidine (data not shown). These data support the idea that the p21 WAF1 gene is present but inactive in growing MDA-MB-231 cells. Since histone hyperacetylation of the p21 WAF1 gene occurs in response to HDAC inhibitors, it might be involved in the pathway of p53-independent activation of p21 WAF1 gene expression (5Sambucetti L.C.

The processes of cellular differentiation and cell cycle progression are interdependent. G1 arrest is a necessary but insufficient condition for differentiation in numerous cell types including leukemic cells, keratinocytes, colonic epithelium, and muscle cells. In all of these cells, induction of p21 WAF1 protein and G1 cell cycle arrest occurred prior to differentiation (44Chang B.D. Wuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B.

We hypothesize that the differentiated state can be viewed as a cellular response to G1 arrest, requiring a change in gene expression profile and suppression of cell death pathways. The response of MCF-7 breast tumor cells to quinidine is consistent with this model. To begin to understand how quinidine might elicit G1 arrest of MCF-7 cells, we have focused on the action of quinidine as a potassium channel blocking agent. Quinidine enters cells and inhibits cardiac potassium channels by binding to the intracellular face of the ion pore (51Yeola S.W. Rich T, C. Uebele V.N. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the location of the quinidine-binding site on the ATP-sensitive potassium channel is unknown, quinidine is freely permeable across membranes and inhibits the ATP-sensitive potassium channels whether it is applied to the external or internal surface of a lipid membrane bilayer (52Iliev I.G. Marino A.A. Cell. & Mol Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of quinidine, MCF-7 cells accumulate at a position 12 h into G1 phase (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This position, defined by cell cycle arrest and release experiments, precedes the lovastatin arrest point by 5–6 h and is clearly distinct from the restriction point described by Pardee (53Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) near the G1/S transition. The present work showed that quinidine treatment caused elevated levels of p53 and p21 WAF1 protein by 12 h (Fig. 3), the point within G1 where MCF-7 cells arrest in response to quinidine (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When p53 and p21 WAF1 proteins were assayed before 12 h, p53 was undetectable, and p21WAF was first detected after 8 h of quinidine treatment (data not shown), suggesting a p53-independent induction of p21 WAF1 occurred prior to arrest in G1. CDK4 and cyclin D1 protein levels were also reduced, as was CDK4 activity as demonstrated by the abundance of hypophosphorylated pRb protein. Based upon our observations in MCF-7 cells, we conclude that p21 WAF1 protein levels become elevated prior to the G1 arrest in response to quinidine and could initiate the G1 arrest. Hypophosphorylated pRb protein is prominent in quinidine-treated MCF-7 cells, and this could act to sustain the G1 state by preventing the transition into S phase. The G1 arrest induced by quinidine in MCF-7 cells was correlated with the blockade of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in MCF-7 cells (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 54Woodfork K.A. Wonderlin W.F. Peterson V.A. Strobl J.S. J. Cell.

Direct evidence for the involvement of potassium ions in the G1 arrest was provided using valinomycin, a potassium-selective ionophore to stimulate a G1-S phase transition in the presence of quinidine (12Wang S. Melkoumian Z.K. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In summary, quinidine, a drug that is used therapeutically in the treatment of malarial infections and cardiac arrhythmia, was shown to be useful as an inducer of cellular differentiation in human breast tumor epithelial cells. Quinidine caused histone H4 hyperacetylation and cellular differentiation in human breast tumor cells following the rapid loss of HDAC1 involving a proteasome-dependent pathway. Additional experiments are needed to determine how the action of quinidine upon ATP-sensitive potassium channels initiates the molecular events underlying the differentiation response."

Its oncogenic potential appears to depend on the state of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the mechanisms by which ErbB-2 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in human breast cancer are poorly understood. We now show that human breast carcinoma samples with ErbB-2 overexpression have higher proliferative and metastatic activity in the presence of autocrine secretion of prolactin (PRL). By using a neutralizing antibody or dominant negative (DN) strategies or specific inhibitors, we also show that activation of Janus kinase Jak2 by autocrine secretion of PRL is one of the significant components of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2, its association with Grb2 and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in human breast cancer cell lines that overexpress ErbB-2. Furthermore, the neutralizing anti-PRL antibody or erbB-2 antisense oligonucleotide or DN Jak2 or Jak2 inhibitor or DNRas or MAP kinase kinase inhibitor inhibits the proliferation of both untreated and PRL-treated cells. Our results indicate that autocrine secretion of PRL stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 by Jak2, provides docking sites for Grb2 and stimulates Ras-MAP kinase cascade, thereby causing unrestricted cellular proliferation. The identification of this novel cross-talk between ErbB-2 and the autocrine growth stimulatory loop for PRL may provide new targets for therapeutic and preventive intervention of human breast cancer.

EMBO J. 1990; 7: 1647-1651Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), are poorly understood. Catalytic activation of ErbB-2 may be inducible by membrane overexpression itself. This mechanism alone, however, is unable to explain the variability in net receptor tyrosine phosphorylation among cell lines with similar amount of ErbB-2 expression (30Epstein R.J. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that other mechanisms are likely to influence tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2. In the present study, to identify the factors that affect proliferative activity and clinical features of breast cancer in relation to overexpression of ErbB-2, we screened several factors by using immunohistochemical analyses in human breast carcinoma tissues and found that breast cancers with ErbB-2 overexpression have higher proliferative and metastatic activity in the presence of prolactin (PRL) co-expression. PRL, whose receptor belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily (32Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 33O'Shea J.J.

To determine whether Jak2 kinase is constitutively activated in SK-BR3 cells, we performed immunoprecipitation with limited quantities of anti-Jak2 antibody, thus ensuring that an equal amount of protein could be examined in both breast cancer cell line SK-BR3 and normal HBL-100 cells. The growth rates of breast cancer cells were determined as described (50Wiechen K. Dietel M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with modification. They were assessed by measuring relative increases in cell number using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Dojindo).

Then we determined incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described (51Yamauchi N. Sakamoto A. Uozaki H. Iihara K. Machinami R. Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol. 1996; 15: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For immunostaining of PRL, PRLR, and ErbB-2, respective antibodies were diluted and incubated as follows: PRL (1:50, A569), PRLR (30 μg/ml, U5) for 16 h at 4 °C; ErbB-2 (1:200, A485) for 30 min at room temperature in a moisture chamber. Positive controls for PRL included pituitary gland, and for ErbB-2 included breast carcinoma known to exhibit high levels of protein. The percentage of PCNA-positive cells (labeling index) was counted. All pathological features were evaluated separately by two investigators who were unaware of the clinical outcome of the patients. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t test and chi-square test for independence. The investigations were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. To identify the factors that affect proliferative activity and clinical features of breast cancer in relation to overexpression of ErbB-2, immunohistochemical analyses were performed in 76 human breast carcinoma tissues obtained at the time of surgery in Mitsui Memorial Hospital in 1994. We observed positive immunoreactivity for ErbB-2 in 29% of the specimens examined. PRL has been shown to stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cells (37Fuh G. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13133-13137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 38Wennbo H. Gebre-Medhin M. Gritli-Linde A. Ohlsson C. Isaksson O.G. Tornell J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined immunohistologically expression of PRL and PRLR. Immunoreactive PRL and PRLR were detected in 95% and 100% of the specimens, respectively, and 28% of the total displayed both ErbB-2 and PRL immunoreactivity, whereas 67% were positive for PRL immunostaining but negative for ErbB-2. Although growth hormone (GH) has also been reported to induce primate mammary epithelial proliferation (52Ng S.T. Zhou J. Adesanya O.O. Wang J. LeRoith D. Bondy C.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), none of the specimens were positive for GH immunoreactivity. The expression of ErbB-2 or PRL was then correlated to that of PCNA, a marker of proliferation activity. As shown in TableI, the mean positivity percentage (labeling index) of PCNA (±S.E.) was 52.4 (± 4.2) in the group of patients with both ErbB-2- and PRL-positive staining, whereas the value (38.3 ± 3.2) was significantly lower (p = 0.013) in the patients with PRL-positive but ErbB-2-negative staining. In contrast, there was no significant difference in PCNA expression between the cancer tissues with and without expression of another growth factor receptor EGFR (EGFR-positive versusEGFR-negative; 45.3 (± 5.8) versus 41.9 (± 3.0);p = 0.618). Moreover, lymph node metastases were found more frequently in ErbB-2- and PRL- positive carcinomas compared with those with PRL-positive but ErbB-2-negative carcinomas (68%versus 44%; p = 0.058) (Table I). In addition, even in the presence of ErbB-2 overexpression, tumor negative for PRL was node-negative, and had a PCNA labeling index of only 5.9 (Table I left). These data suggest that breast cancers with ErbB-2 overexpression have higher proliferative and metastatic activity in the presence of autocrine or paracrine secretion of PRL.Table IImmunohistochemical analysis of ErbB2, prolactin in relation to PCNA (labeling index), and lymph node metastasis*, p = 0.013; ErbB2- and prolactin-positive stainingversus prolactin-positive and ErbB2-negative staining. **,p = 0.058; ErbB2- and prolactin-positive stainingversus prolactin-positive and ErbB2-negative staining.

PRL signals via its cell-surface receptor through Jak2 activation (32Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 33O'Shea J.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To explore the effects of the co-expression of PRL and ErbB-2, PRLR and Jak2 were cotransfected into COS cells which express endogenous ErbB-2. Since the level of expression of Jak2 in COS cells appears to be low, some level of co-expression of wild-type (WT)-Jak2 and PRLR has been reported to be required in order to detect activation of Jak2 by PRL (47Yamauchi T. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Tsuji Y,. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Tsushima T. Akanuma Y. Komuro I. Tobe K. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15719-15726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We confirmed that neither expression of WT-Jak2 alone nor coexpression of kinase-inactive Jak2 and PRLR, but coexpression of WT-Jak2 and PRLR resulted in PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in COS cells (Fig. 1 I). Expression of WT-Jak2, but not kinase-inactive ΔJak2, which lacks the C terminus kinase domain (41Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), induced activation of Jak2 and interestingly, at the same time caused tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2, and its association with Grb2 in a PRL-dose-dependent manner in COS cells (Fig. 1,A–D). These results suggest that PRL is able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and its association with Grb2 via activation of Jak2 kinase. To clarify how PRL induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2, we tested whether PRL could induce the association of ErbB-2 with Jak2 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS cells transiently transfected with PRLR and WT Jak2; we found that complex formation between Jak2 and ErbB-2 was induced in a PRL-dependent manner (Fig. 1 E). To explore the mechanism by which Jak2 is recruited to ErbB-2, especially to clarify whether Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation necessarily precedes binding of Jak2 to ErbB-2, we have performed the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and showed that coexpression of WT-Jak2 and PRLR or coexpression of kinase-inactive Jak2 and PRLR, but not expression of WT-Jak2 alone resulted in PRL-induced complex formation between ErbB-2 and WT-Jak2 (Fig. 1, F (lane 4) andH (lane 4)) or between ErbB-2 and ΔJak2 (Fig. 1, F (lane 6) andH (lane 6)), despite that ΔJak2 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PRL (Fig. 1 I,lane 6). However, WT-Jak2 was able to induce PRL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 (Fig. 1 G,lane 4), whereas ΔJak2 failed to do so (Fig.1 G, lane 6), suggesting that Jak2"

Here, we present evidence that retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a substrate for both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK4/SEK1) and its downstream mediator c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MKK4/SEK1 and JNK recognized distinct features on RXR in the DE and AB regions, respectively. Phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 had profound effects on the biochemical properties of RXR, inhibiting the expression of genes activated by RXR-retinoic acid receptor complexes. Tyr-249 in the RXR DE region was required for the inhibitory effect of MKK4/SEK1. These effects were significantly reduced in MKK4/SEK1-null cells, indicating that MKK4/SEK1 is required for the suppression of retinoid signaling by stress. Findings presented here demonstrate that MKK4/SEK1 can directly modulate transcription by phosphorylating RXR, a novel MKK4/SEK1 substrate.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Of the naturally occurring retinoids, 9-cis retinoic acid is a ligand for RARs and RXRs, and all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) is a ligand for RARs. These receptors form RXR homodimers and RXR·RAR heterodimers, which activate gene transcription directly by binding to specific retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in gene promoter regions. RXR homodimers and RXR·RAR heterodimers bind to distinct RAREs, thus activating different signal transduction pathways. Disruption of genetic loci associated with specific RARs and RXRs has revealed the importance of retinoid receptors in mediating the biologic effects of retinoids (2Kastner P. Grondona J.M. Mark M.

Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptor transcriptional activity is regulated by factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the receptor complex. In the unliganded state, retinoid receptors are bound to co-repressors, including silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors and nuclear receptor co-repressor (4Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). These co-repressors form complexes with histone deacetylases to induce chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Ligand binding causes retinoid receptors to dissociate from co-repressors and bind to co-activators, including cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein, p300/CBP-interacting protein, and members of the p160/SRC family of co-activators, such as steroid receptor co-activator-1 (5McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Co-activators form multiprotein complexes that possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, which is required for retinoid receptor transcriptional activation. Although ligand binding is thought to be the primary means of activation, retinoid signaling is also modulated by cellular stresses. For example, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation decreases intracellular RARγ and RXRα protein levels and inhibits ligand-induced transcription of RXR·RAR target genes (6Wang Z. Boudjelal M. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Nature Med. 1999; 5: 418-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide growth factors also decrease retinoid-induced expression of RXR·RAR target genes and block the biological effects of retinoids on cells (7Miller L.A. Cheng L.Z. Wu R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2527-2533PubMed Google Scholar, 8Andreatta-Van Leyen S. Hembree J.R. Eckert R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these cellular stresses inhibit retinoid signaling pathways has not been defined. Stress-activated signaling pathways include the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1–3), also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) (9Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). These MAP kinases can be activated directly by MAP kinase kinases such as MKK4/SEK1 and MKK7 (10Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H.

Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), no substrates other than MAP kinases have been identified for MKKs. Because stress inhibits retinoid signaling, we tested the hypothesis that stress-activated protein kinases mediate these effects by acting on nuclear retinoid receptors. Here we present evidence that RXR is a substrate of the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and MKK4/SEK1. MKK4/SEK1 directly phosphorylates RXR, inhibiting ligand-induced transactivation of RAREs, effects that are greatly diminished in MKK4/SEK1-null cells. The functional effects of MKK4/SEK1-mediated phosphorylation support the conclusion that this kinase, thought to be dedicated to the phosphorylation of stress-sensitive MAP kinases (18Lewis T.S.

Total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 1 μg/plate with vector DNA. The transfection solution was removed after 8 h of transfection, and the cells were cultured for 16 h in medium containing 0.1% serum. Cells were then treated with 1 μm t-RA overnight. When indicated, cells were co-treated with anisomycin at the indicated dose and time. Cells were subjected to luciferase assays as described previously (25Kim Y.H. Dohi D.F. Han G.R. Zou C.P. Oridate N. Walsh G.L. Nesbitt J.C. Xu X.C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5603-5610PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were expressed as the means and standard deviations from three identical wells. Cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and transfected with plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE. For co-transfections, total transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant (10 μg) using empty vector. After 8 h of transfection, cells were serum-starved by changing medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with t-RA (1 μm) for 16 h and labeled with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate or [35S]methionine. Radioactive labeling was performed in the presence of t-RA (1 μm) to investigate ligand-dependent effects unless otherwise indicated. 32P-Labeled RXRα was immunoprecipitated with either RXRα-specific polyclonal antibody or Flag-specific monoclonal antibody M2. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis, the phosphopeptides localized by autoradiography were recovered and treated as described below. Western blotting autoradiographs were quantitated by scanning densitometry (MultiImage light cabinet, Alpha-Innotech Corp.). Following transfection of COS-7 cells with GST-tagged MKK4 E-D, MKK4/SEK1 was affinity-purified from whole cell extracts with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. Activated JNK1 was immunoprecipated from COS-7 cells transiently co-transfected with MKK4 E-D and JNK1 expression vectors using anti-JNK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The JNK1 immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm α-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) for use in immune complex kinase reactions. Kinase reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of substrate and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer. Samples were boiled and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out on RXR phosphorylated by JNK1 and MKK4/SEK1 in vitro and in intact cells. The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and phosphopeptides localized by autoradiography were excised, digested with 6 n HCl and further dried. Pellets were dissolved in buffer (pH 1.9) containing 5 μg of unlabeled standard phosphoamino acids, and then separated on 20 × 20-cm thin layer cellulose plate. The plates were then dried, sprayed with ninhydrin to visualize phosphoamino acid standards, and exposed to x-ray film. We first investigated the effects of stress on retinoid signaling in cells that are biologically responsive to retinoid treatment. t-RA induces differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells, a process marked by an increase in the transcription of several genes mediated directly by RXR·RAR heterodimeric complexes. Through this mechanism, the expression of RARβ and laminin B1 increases within the first 6 and 48 h, respectively (29Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of stress pathway activation on RARβ and laminin B1 expression. Drugs such as anisomycin are potent activators of the stress response. Northern analysis revealed that treatment with anisomycin or transfection with a constitutively active form of MKK4/SEK1 (MKK4 E-D), an upstream activator of JNK/SAPKs (31Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), clearly suppressed t-RA-induced RARβ and laminin B1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1). Importantly, these effects of stress were not observed in F9 cells that lack RXRα through genetic knockout (Fig. 1). Stably reintroducing RXRα into RXRα-null F9 cells (Rc7 cells) restored stress-induced suppression of t-RA-induced laminin B1 and RARβ mRNA (Fig. 1). These findings demonstrate an absolute requirement of RXRα in mediating stress-induced suppression of retinoid signaling in vivo. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that stress inhibits ligand-induced transcriptional activation of promoters containing RAREs. We investigated retinoid receptor transcriptional activity in COS-7 cells using reporters containing RAREs that bind RXR·RAR heterodimeric complexes in the context of a TK heterologous promoter (DR5) or the RAR-β gene promoter (β-RARE). Treatment of COS-7 cells with anisomycin or co-transfection with MKK4 E-D markedly inhibited ligand-induced RARE transcriptional activity, with effects ranging from 50% to 70% inhibition (Fig. 2). Co-transfection with constitutively active MKK1 (R4F mutant), an activator of ERK MAP kinases, activated an AP-1 response element but did not detectably alter ligand-induced RARE activity (data not shown), suggesting that transcriptional activity of the RXR·RAR complex is regulated selectively by a stress-sensitive kinase pathway. We investigated whether the transcriptional effects we observed might be caused by phosphorylation of retinoid receptors. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-RARα or Flag-RXRα, treated for 16 h with t-RA (10−6m), and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence or absence of anisomycin (Fig.3 A). Anisomycin increased the phosphorylation of RXR but not RAR. RXR phosphorylation was also enhanced by co-transfection with MKK4 E-D (Fig. 3 B). In these assays, we observed a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of RXR, which is consistent with the conclusion that a significant fraction of RXR was phosphorylated on at least one residue. Co-transfection of Flag-RXRα with other MKKs (MKK7 or MKK1) did not detectably induce phosphorylation of RXR (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating the specificity of RXR for MKK4/SEK1. Phosphoamino acid analysis of RXR immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate following transient co-transfection with MKK4 E-D and Flag-RXRα revealed phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (data not shown). MKK4/SEK1 is an intermediate in a cascade involving an upstream MKK kinase and MAP kinases (including JNK/SAPK). No MKK4/SEK1 substrates other than MAP kinase family members have been identified. Therefore, we hypothesized that RXR phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 is mediated through JNK/SAPK, which is known to phosphorylate other steroid receptors (12Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R Leff T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We tested the capacity of activated JNK1 and MKK4/SEK1 to phosphorylate RXR in vitro. JNK1 phosphorylated RXRα in vitro (Fig.4 A) as well as it did c-Jun (data not shown). The region of RXR phosphorylated by JNK was defined using RXRα deletion mutants. JNK phosphorylated RXR fragments lacking the DE region but not those lacking the ABC region (Fig.4 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the RXRα band revealed phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (Fig. 4 B). In the AB region, there are more than 10 potential JNK phosphorylation sites as defined by the minimal consensus site (S/TP). Surprisingly, RXRα was also phosphorylated by MKK4 E-D in an in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 5 A). MKK4 E-D minimally phosphorylated GST-RARα or GST-thyroid receptor (TR) (Fig.5 A), demonstrating the specificity of MKK4/SEK1 for RXR. We tested the possibility that MKK4/SEK1 bound stably to RXR. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GST-MKK4 E-D and Flag-RXRα. MKK4 E-D was affinity purified from cell lysates and immunoblotted to RXRα antibodies. Stable binding between MKK4 E-D and RXR was observed (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5MKK4/SEK1 physically associates with RXR α and phosphorylates serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in the RXR α DE region. A, GST-MKK4 E-D was affinity-purified from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GST-MKK4 E-D using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and kinase assays (KA) were performed to examine the effect of constitutively active MKK4/SEK1 on the phosphorylation of GST-RXRα, -RARα, -TRβ, and -JNK1 (as a positive control). The relative size of the bacterial GST fusion proteins is illustrated on a Coomassie-stained gel. B, COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with Flag-RXRα and GST-MKK4 E-D expression vectors, and GST-MKK4 E-D was affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Association of MKK4/SEK1 with RXR was examined by subjecting the GST complex to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting (W) with anti-RXRα antibodies. Cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis with anti-Flag antibodies to indicate the levels of RXR expressed in the cells. C, GST-MKK4 E-D was affinity-purified from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GST-MKK4 E-D using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and kinase assays (KA) were performed to examine the effect of MKK4 E-D on the phosphorylation of His-tagged full-length (RXR) and deletion mutant RXR, which are illustrated diagrammatically. Samples of full-length and deletion mutant RXRs were subjected to Western analysis (W) with anti-histidine antibodies to illustrate their expression and relative size (designated with arrow). D, kinase reactions were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis to examine the effect of constitutively active MKK4/SEK1 on the phosphorylation of serine (pS), threonine (pT), and tyrosine (pY) in the RXR D-E region (D-E) or full-length RXR (RXR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the region of RXR phosphorylated by MKK4/SEK1, in vitro kinase assays were performed on RXRα deletion mutants. MKK4 E-D phosphorylated a mutant lacking the ABC region of RXR, but not two RXR mutants lacking the DE region (Fig. 5 C). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the RXR DE region revealed phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5 D), which is consistent with the dual-specificity kinase activity of MKK4/SEK1 (10Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar,31Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation was more prominent relative to serine in the context of full-length RXR protein than in the D-E region (Fig.5 D), suggesting that conformational effects influenced relative rates of phosphorylation of different sites on RXR. This type of conformational effect has been observed previously for steroid receptors (32Hilliard G.M. Cook R.G. Weigel N.L. Pike J.W. Biochem. 1994; 33: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on the known specificity of MKK4/SEK1 for phosphorylating tyrosine residues nearby to serine or threonine, we mutated tyrosine residues with that feature in the D-E region (Tyr-249 and -397) and in the C (DNA-binding) region (Tyr-169) to identify potential MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylation sites in RXR. Phosphorylation of these RXR mutants by MKK4 E-D was examined in COS-7 cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and in vitro (Fig.6 A). RXR phosphorylation by MKK4 E-D was reduced by mutation of either tyrosine 397 (Y397F) or 249 (Y249F). Mutation of tyrosine 169 (Y169F) had no effect on RXR phosphorylation by MKK4 E-D, which is consistent with the result that the RXR C region was not phosphorylated by MKK4/SEK1. We investigated the necessity of RXR phosphorylation in the suppression of RARE transactivation by MKK4/SEK1. Transient co-transfection assays in COS-7 cells revealed that the suppression of RARE activity by MKK4 E-D was abrogated by mutation of RXR at Tyr-249 (Y249F) but not Tyr-397 (Y397F) or Tyr-169 (Y169F) (Fig. 6 B), indicating that RXR phosphorylation on Tyr-249 is critical for the effects of MKK4/SEK1 on RARE transactivation. Our findings demonstrate that MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylated RXR domains distinct from those phosphorylated by JNK1. To confirm that MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylated RXR through a JNK-independent mechanism, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with MKK4 E-D, a dominant negative JNK construct (JNK-1 or -2) to block JNK activation, and Flag-RXRα. The transfectants were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of t-RA (10−6m) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies or Western analysis with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies to examine dominant negative activity of JNK constructs. Dominant negative JNK-1 and -2 suppressed MKK4 E-D-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun but had no detectable effect on RXR phosphorylation (Fig.7). Taken together, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that JNK activation is not required for RXR phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1; instead, RXR is a direct substrate of MKK4/SEK1. To determine the physiologic role of MKK4/SEK1 in the suppression of retinoid signaling by stress, we tested the effect of anisomycin on wild type and MKK4/SEK1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts. RXRα phosphorylation was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis following [32P]orthophosphate labeling (Fig.8 A). Anisomycin treatment greatly enhanced RXR phosphorylation in wild type but not MKK4/SEK1-null cells. Transient transfection assays were performed to explore the contribution of MKK4/SEK1 to the modulation of ligand-induced RARE transcriptional activity by anisomycin (Fig.8 B). Anisomycin suppressed t-RA-induced RARE transcriptional activity in wild type cells, and this effect of anisomycin was partially lost in MKK4/SEK1-null cells. Transient transfection with MKK4 E-D was sufficient to restore RXRα phosphorylation and to suppress RARE transcriptional activity in MKK4/SEK1-null cells (Fig. 8,A and B). Together, these findings support a physiologic role for MKK4/SEK1 in the suppression of retinoid signaling by stress. Stress signaling is activated in response to a variety of environmental stimuli, including starvation, changes in osmolarity, heat shock, proinflammatory cytokines, UV light, and DNA damaging agents (33Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 127-138PubMed Google Scholar). Potential biologic responses to these stimuli include growth, apoptosis, inflammation, and differentiation. The mechanisms by which diverse biologic outcomes can result from stress pathway activation have not been elucidated. Toward this end, substrates of stress-activated protein kinases have been identified, including a number of nuclear receptors (12Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R Leff T.

Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence that MKK4/SEK1 can directly modulate transcription by phosphorylating RXR, a novel MKK4/SEK1 substrate. The consequence of RXR phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 is a marked inhibition of retinoid-mediated transcriptional signaling. Based on the lack of any other known substrates for MKK4/SEK1, it has been presumed that MKK4/SEK1 acted only upon stress-activated kinases JNK/SAPKs. However, several lines of evidence presented here indicate that MKK4/SEK1 can directly phosphorylate RXR in vivo, independent of its downstream mediator JNK. First, anisomycin enhanced RXR phosphorylation in wild type but not MKK4/SEK1-null cells, supporting MKK4/SEK1 as an essential mediator of stress-induced RXR phosphorylation. Second, MKK4/SEK1 was shown to directly phosphorylate RXR in vitro on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, all of which were phosphorylated in intact cells. Third, MKK4/SEK1 and JNK phosphorylated distinct RXR domains, indicating that these kinases recognize different features of RXR. Fourth, neither dominant-negative JNK1 nor JNK2 blocked RXR phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 in intact cells, suggesting that JNK activation was not required. Phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 appears to be specific, since neither MKK7 nor MKK1 phosphorylated RXR, nor did MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylate other nuclear receptors, RAR or TR. These findings demonstrate a new paradigm in MAP kinase signaling by revealing a novel substrate of MKK4/SEK1, previously believed to act only as an intermediate in a kinase cascade. Our findings in MKK4/SEK1-null fibroblasts indicate that MKK4/SEK1 is required for RXR phosphorylation by anisomycin. Further, mutation of Tyr-249 decreased RXR phosphorylation and abrogated the suppression of RARE transcriptional activity by MKK4/SEK1. Together, these findings support a role for RXR phosphorylation by MKK4/SEK1 in stress-induced inhibition of retinoid signaling. However, suppression of RARE transcriptional activity by anisomycin was only partially abrogated in MKK4/SEK1-null cells, suggesting that other anisomycin-sensitive kinases regulate the activity of RXR·RAR heterodimers. In this study, MKK7 overexpression had no effect on RXR phosphorylation. As reported previously (34Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we found that JNK1 phosphorylated RXR, but this has been reported to have no effect on the transactivation properties of RXR·RAR heterodimers (34Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be required to fully understand the pathways through which stress regulates the activity of RXR·RAR heterodimers. What may be the physiologic consequence of stress-mediated inhibition of RXR function? Chronic exposure of human skin to UV light, a potent activator of stress pathways, induces tumor formation in vivo and inhibits the expression of RARγ, RXRα, and RXR·RAR target genes (6Wang Z.

Data presented here offer a potential mechanism by which environmental stress could suppress retinoid signaling in epithelial tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2094625115,"The activation of protein phosphastase-1 (PP1) by insulin plays a critical role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. PTG is a PP1 glycogen-targeting protein, which also binds the PP1 substrates glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (Printen, J. A., Brady, M. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997) Science 275, 1475–1478). Through a combination of deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, the regions on PTG responsible for binding PP1 and its substrates have been delineated. Mutagenesis of Val-62 and Phe-64 in the highly conserved (K/R)VXF PP1-binding motif to alanine was sufficient to ablate PP1 binding to PTG. Phosphorylase kinase, glycogen synthase, and phosphorylase binding all mapped to the same C-terminal region of PTG. Mutagenesis of Asp-225 and Glu-228 to alanine completely blocked the interaction between PTG and these three enzymes, without affecting PP1 binding. Disruption of either PP1 or substrate binding to PTG blocked the stimulation of PP1 activity in vitroagainst phosphorylase, indicating that both binding sites may be important in PTG action. Transient overexpression of wild-type PTG in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the insulin receptor caused a 50-fold increase in glycogen levels. Expression of PTG mutants that do not bind PP1 had no effect on glycogen accumulation, indicating that PP1 targeting is essential for PTG function. Likewise, expression of the PTG mutants that do not bind PP1 substrates did not increase glycogen levels, indicating that PP1 targeting glycogen is not sufficient for the metabolic effects of PTG. These results cumulatively demonstrate that PTG serves as a molecular scaffold, allowing PP1 to recognize its substrates at the glycogen particle.

(2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275.Google Scholar) studies have suggested that insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis, at least in part, through the activation of PP1. PP1 is ubiquitously expressed and resides in most cellular compartments. However, the hormonal activation of the enzyme is restricted to discrete sites, such as the glycogen particle, suggesting that mechanisms must exist to ensure the localized regulation of the enzyme. For example, although PP1 is found in a number of cellular locations in fat, liver, and muscle cells, insulin produces the dephosphorylation of only a small fraction of phosphoproteins. The compartmentalization of PP1 is mediated by a family of binding or targeting subunits (14Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Brady M. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (2000) Recent Prog. Horm. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) is one of four targeting proteins that bind to PP1 and glycogen, targeting the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. Unlike the restricted expression of other PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits, PTG is expressed in all insulin-sensitive tissues (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTG results in dramatic increases in glycogen accumulation in cell lines and tissues (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating an important role for this protein in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. In addition to PP1 and glycogen, PTG also directly binds to three PP1- and insulin-regulated enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism as follows: glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of these interactions was unclear, since each of these enzymes can also bind directly to glycogen (18Cohen P. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1978; 14: 117-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To determine whether PTG solely functions to target PP1 to glycogen, or to additionally direct the binding of substrates with the phosphatase, we have delineated the binding domains of PTG by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, disruption of either PP1 or substrate binding to PTG completely abrogated the ability of PTG to increase glycogen synthesis. Thus, PTG acts as a molecular scaffold, assembling PP1 with its substrates at the glycogen particle and priming them for activation by insulin. pGEX-KG plasmid was a generous gift of Dr Kun-Liang Guan (University of Michigan). Cell expression vectors and anti-V-5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coralville, IA). Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., with the exception of sera for culture of 3T3-L1 cells, which was supplied by Summit Biotechnology (Ft. Collins, CO). Insulin, differentiation reagents, amylase, and phosphorylaseb were from Sigma. ECL reagents and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Affinity purified chicken anti-PP1 and anti-glycogen synthase antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. J. Lawrence, Jr. (University of Virginia). Polyclonal anti-phosphorylase kinase antibody was prepared by Research Genetics, against the recombinant phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (kindly provided by F. Bourbonais, Parke-Davis). The antibody was affinity purified as described (13Gasa, R., Jensen, P. B., Berman, H. K., Brady, M. J., Depaoli-Roach, A. A., and Newgard, C. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275.Google Scholar), using a phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit-affinity column. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibody was from Accurate Chemical Corp (Westbury, NY), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was supplied by Bio-Rad. Full-length, point mutant, and truncated PTG-GST constructs were generated by PCR using the full-length 1.1-kilobase pair BamHI-SalI FLAG-PTG fragment in Bluescript KS as template. Constructs were cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-KG (19Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) for GST fusion protein expression or pCDNA3.1/V5/His (Invitrogen) for mammalian cell expression. The resultant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The V62A/F64A double point mutation was made using the Quik-change Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The V62A mutation was made with primers 5′-GCCAAGAAGCGGGCCGTGTTTGCGGACTCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTGAGTCCGCAAACACGGCCCGCTTCTTGGC-3′, followed by additional mutation of F64A using primers 5′-GAAGCGGGCCGTGGCAGCGGACTCAAAGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCCTTTGAGTCCGCTGCCACGGCCCGCTTC-3′. The D225A/E228A double point mutation was made in a similar fashion, using primers 5′-GGATCTTCTGGGCCAACAATGCGGGTCAGAATTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAATTCTGACCCGCATTGTTGGCCCAGAAGATCC-3′. Expression of fusion proteins was induced in bacteria and affinity-purified as described previously (20Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the fusion proteins were eluted by incubation of the glutathione-Sepharose beads with 3 volumes of 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 20 mm reduced glutathione on ice for 5 min. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. After two more batch elutions, the eluates were combined and concentrated with an Amicon-30. Protein concentrations of the GST-PTG constructs were estimated by Bradford and Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels. CHO-IR cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (21Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and electroporated with 120 μg of plasmid DNA at 0.340 V and 975 microfarads. Cells were replated on Biocoat tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson). Media were changed after 12–24 h, and cells were harvested after 40–48 h. The expression of various PTG constructs was verified by anti-V5 immunoblotting. Measurement of cellular glycogen levels was performed essentially as described (22Gomez-Lechon M.J. Ponsoda X. Castell J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and aspirated completely. Plates were then frozen and stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing alternately in a dry ice ethanol bath and a 37 °C water bath. 400 μl of 0.2m sodium acetate (pH 4.8) was added to wells. Glycogen was then hydrolyzed to glucose in the wells by addition of 500 μl of 250 milliunits/ml amyloglucosidase (Sigma) and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h with constant rocking. Samples were then neutralized by addition of 125 μl of 0.5 m sodium hydroxide, transferred to 1.5-ml tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Glucose concentrations were assayed using a Roche Molecular Biochemicalsd-glucose determination kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 50 μl of the cell lysate was added to a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, and the resulting NADPH was measured using a spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Glucose concentration was determined as follows: (change in absorbance at 340 nm) × (volume × molecular weight of glucose)/6.3 × sample volume × light path × 1000) = mg/liter glucose. 40–48 h after transient transfection with V5-tagged PTG constructs, CHO-IR cells were collected in homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and lysed by sonication (20% output, 10 s). Lysates were centrifuged at 2500 ×g to pellet nuclei, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Due to the low amount of endogenous glycogen, CHO-IR lysates were then directly centrifuged at 100,000 × gto separate cytosolic and particulate, glycogen-containing fractions. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (23Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For binding assays, cells were collected in homogenization buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100. Cellular glycogen was digested by addition of 40 μg/ml amylase and incubation of the lysates at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet any residual glycogen. The supernatants were removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Binding assays using GST fusion proteins and glycogen-free lysates or 32P-labeled phosphorylase were performed in homogenization buffer lacking glycogen as described (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For PP1 assays, extracts from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared as described (24Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C until use. PP1 activity was measured in vitro, and 32P-labeled phosphorylase was prepared as previously reported (24Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except that recombinant phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit was used. Immunoprecipitations (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (25Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Protein determination was by Bradford. PTG binds to PP1, glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To identify the domains on PTG mediating interaction with these proteins, a series of 18 constructs comprising N- and C-terminal deletions was synthesized by PCR and subcloned into a pGEX expression vector (Fig. 1). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, and affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST-PTG fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose beads were then incubated with glycogen-free 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates. Following several washes, PP1 and glycogen synthase binding was measured simultaneously by immunoblotting. A representative result is shown in Fig. 2. Both PP1 and glycogen synthase bound to full-length GST-PTG (lane 3) but not to empty beads (lane 2). Since glycogen-free lysates were used, this result demonstrates that glycogen synthase binds directly to PTG, rather than co-sedimenting with glycogen (26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Progressive C-terminal truncations of PTG diminished glycogen synthase binding, without affecting binding to PP1 (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Conversely, N-terminal deletions disrupted interaction with PP1 without affecting glycogen synthase binding (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and7). These results demonstrate that PP1 and glycogen synthase bind independently to separate domains on PTG.Figure 3Glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase bind to the same region on PTG. The indicated GST-PTG fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with glycogen-free 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysate (A andB) or 32P-labeled phosphorylase (C). After washing, samples were separated on polyacrylamide gels, and glycogen synthase (A) binding and phosphorylase kinase (B) binding were detected by immunoblotting, whereas phosphorylase (C) binding was detected by autoradiography. Bands corresponding to glycogen synthase (GS), phosphorylase kinase (PK), and phosphorylase (Phos) are indicated by arrows.

After extensive washing, proteins bound to the PTG constructs were analyzed by immunoblotting. Binding of glycogen synthase to full-length PTG (residues 1–295) was readily detected (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Deletions of 45–55 amino acids from the C terminus of PTG increased glycogen synthase binding 2-fold as compared with wild-type PTG (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–4). However, deletion of a further 17–23 residues completely abrogated glycogen synthase binding (Fig. 3 A, lane 7 and 8). These progressive C-terminal deletions of PTG had no effect on PP1 binding (Fig. 7, data not shown). Phosphorylase kinase exhibited a similar pattern of binding to the GST-PTG constructs (Fig. 3 B). Short C-terminal truncations of PTG increased phosphorylase kinase binding, but continued deletions completely disrupted this interaction. Identical results were obtained in phosphorylase binding assays (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that all three PP1- and insulin-regulated enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism bind to the same domain of PTG. A summary of the binding results is shown in Fig. 1. The PP1 binding domain is located in the N-terminal region of PTG, which contains the consensus (K/R)VXF PP1-binding motif that is conserved in other PP1-targeting proteins (27Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The PP1 substrate binding domain, which mediates interaction with glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase, is located in the C-terminal region. The glycogen binding domain has been previously reported to span a rather large, ill-defined region between the other two domains (28Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, deletion analysis can potentially cause secondary effects elsewhere in the molecule, due to alterations in protein folding. Therefore, to confirm these initial results, two full-length PTG constructs were made, with point mutations in either the putative PP1 or PP1 substrate binding domain (Fig. 1). The highly conserved Val-62 and Phe-64 residues in the consensus PP1-binding motif were substituted with alanine. Mutagenesis of the analogous hydrophobic residues in the PP1 nuclear targeting subunit NIPP1 completely ablated PP1 binding (5Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed PP1 substrate binding domain on PTG contains a stretch of amino acids, WDNNE, that is predicted by RasMol molecular modeling to protrude from the surface of the molecule. This motif is homologous to the granular starch binding of theAspergillus niger (1Kul) (29Bork P. Dandekar T. Eisenhaber F. Huynen M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is conserved in the other PP1 glycogen-targeting proteins. The two acidic residues in this region, Asp-225 and Glu-228, were therefore also mutated to alanine. Wild-type PTG and the two full-length, double point mutant PTG constructs were expressed and immobilized as GST fusion proteins and incubated in duplicate with glycogen-free 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates. Twice as much protein was used in the pulldown assays with the point mutant constructs as compared with wild-type PTG. Glycogen synthase and PP1 binding was then examined by immunoblotting. Wild-type PTG readily bound to both PP1 and glycogen synthase from the lysate (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3). Mutagenesis of two residues in the consensus PP1-binding motif (V62A/F64A) completely blocked PP1 binding without affecting glycogen synthase binding (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and5). Conversely, mutagenesis of the two acidic C-terminal residues to alanine (D225A/E228A) blocked glycogen synthase binding without affecting interaction with PP1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7). These results confirm the finding that PP1 and glycogen synthase bind independently to PTG, via separate N- and C-terminal domains. Identical results were obtained in phosphorylase binding assays (Fig. 4 B). Disruption of the PP1 binding domain on PTG (V62A/F64A) had no effect on interaction with phosphorylase (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and 4). However, phosphorylase did not bind to the D225A/E228A PTG construct (Fig.4 B, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that both glycogen synthase and phosphorylase binding are blocked by the mutagenesis of these two residues. The effects of interfering with either PP1 or PP1 substrate binding to PTG were investigated. The indicated GST-PTG constructs (Fig. 5) were affinity-purified from bacterial lysates, and then eluted off the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of protein were added to 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates, and PP1 activity was measured in vitro using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate. As previously reported, addition of wild-type GST-PTG caused a 2–3-fold increase in PP1 activity (Fig. 5), due to a 5-fold reduction in the K m of the phosphatase for its substrate (20Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ablation of PP1 binding to PTG by mutation of Val-62 and Phe-64 to alanine reduced PP1 activity to control levels (Fig. 5). Additionally, disruption of the PP1 substrate-binding site, either through mutation (D225A/E228A) or deletion (residues 1–217), also blocked the stimulatory effect of PTG on PP1 activity (Fig. 5). Addition of 33 residues to the PTG (residues 1–217), C-terminal deletion construct restored both phosphorylase binding to PTG (Fig.3 C) and the PTG-mediated increase in PP1 activity (Fig. 5). These initial in vitro results indicated that binding of both the phosphatase and its substrate to PTG are important for the regulation of PP1 activity. The effects of disrupting either PP1 or glycogen synthase binding on PTG function were examined in CHO-IR cells. These cells contain low levels of glycogen and no endogenous PTG. Following transient transfection of the various PTG constructs, the cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared. All PTG constructs were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 6), and the transfection efficiency was approximately 50% (data not shown). Following transfection, cells were fractionated into a cytosolic and glycogen-containing particulate fraction and analyzed by anti-V5 immunoblotting to detect localization of the PTG constructs. As previously reported (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), wild-type PTG was found exclusively in the glycogen-containing fraction (Fig. 6, lane 6). Mutagenesis of either the PP1- (V62A/F64A) or substrate (D225A/E228A)-binding site had no effect on the binding of PTG to glycogen (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8). The latter result confirms previous results indicating that the glycogen binding region of PTG is located in the center of the molecule (28Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In parallel, glycogen levels in the transfected CHO-IR cells were measured (Fig. 7). The top part of Fig. 7 shows results from glycogen synthase and PP1 binding assays using the same constructs expressed as GST fusion proteins. Overexpression of wild-type PTG (residues 1–295) caused a 50-fold increase in glycogen levels as compared with LacZ-transfected CHO-IR cells, adjusting for transfection efficiency (Fig. 7,lanes 1 and 2). PTG overexpression had no effect on PP1 or glycogen synthase protein levels in CHO-IR cells but rather caused a redistribution of PP1 from the cytosol to glycogen (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The full-length V62A/F64A PTG mutant that bound to glycogen synthase but not PP1 did not increase glycogen levels (Fig. 7, lane 3), indicating that PP1 targeting to glycogen is essential for PTG function. However, expression of the full-length D225A/E228A PTG mutant that bound to PP1 but not glycogen synthase also had little effect on glycogen levels (Fig. 7, lane 4). This result indicates that targeting of PP1 to glycogen alone is not sufficient to increase glycogen accumulation. Similarly, a PTG C-terminal truncation construct (residues 1–217) that bound to PP1 but not glycogen synthase also did not increase glycogen accumulation (Fig. 7, lane 5). Addition of 16 amino acids (residues 1–233) restored glycogen synthase binding to PTG (Fig. 7, lane 6) and resulted in an increase in glycogen levels comparable to wild-type PTG (Fig. 7,lane 6 versus 2). Furthermore, the PTG deletion construct 1–250, which bound glycogen synthase more avidly than wild-type PTG (Fig. 7, lane 7 versus 2), caused a 125-fold increase in glycogen levels, 2.5-fold higher than wild-type (Fig. 7, lane 7 versus 2). This result indicates that interaction with glycogen synthase may be limiting for the PTG-mediated increase in glycogen accumulation. Additionally, these results cumulatively demonstrate that both PP1 and glycogen synthase binding to PTG are essential for PTG function. Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis by increasing glucose transport and by coordinately increasing the activity of glycogen synthase and inhibiting phosphorylase via changes in the phosphorylation states of the enzymes. The hormone stimulates the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase through increased glucose uptake and metabolism, inactivation of glycogen synthase kinases, and activation of glycogen-targeted PP1 (30Brady M.J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these three signaling events to the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin remains controversial and may vary between cell and tissue types. However, insulin also inhibits glycogenolysis through the PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation and inactivation of phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase. Furthermore, overexpression of PP1 glycogen targeting subunits dramatically increases glycogen synthesis (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Gasa, R., Jensen, P. B., Berman, H. K., Brady, M. J., Depaoli-Roach, A. A., and Newgard, C. B. (2000) J. Biol.

PP1 is localized to glycogen through binding to a family of four glycogen-targeting subunits. GM/RGL/PPP1R3 and GL/PPP1R4 are primarily expressed in striated muscle and liver, respectively, and PTG/PPP1R5 and PPP1R6 are distributed in muscle, liver, and fat (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J.

GM is a 124-kDa protein that is significantly larger than the other three approximately 35-kDa family members. Despite a proposed common function, there exists no more that 50% sequence homology between any two targeting subunits. Additionally, Northern blot analysis revealed that three of the subunits are expressed in both liver and skeletal muscle (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R.

These observations suggest that each targeting subunit may possess unique regulatory properties regarding PP1 activity and hormonal responsiveness (13Gasa, R., Jensen, P. B., Berman, H. K., Brady, M. J., Depaoli-Roach, A. A., and Newgard, C. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275.Google Scholar). In addition to PP1 and glycogen, PTG also binds with the following three insulin- and PP1-regulated enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism: glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (1Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We sought to define the domains on PTG that mediate phosphatase and substrate binding and to assess their relative contributions to PTG function. The PP1 binding domain was located in the N-terminal region, which contains the consensus (K/R)VXF motif present in other PP1-binding proteins (27Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the PTG residues Val-62 and Phe-64 to alanine completely blocked PP1 binding. Similar results were reported when the corresponding residues were mutated in the PP1-binding protein NIPP1 (5Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The (K/R)VXF motif is conserved in the majority of eukaryotic PP1-binding proteins, including all four PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits, and very likely comprises a common site of interaction with the phosphatase (Fig.8 A). The PP1-binding site on GL was mapped by deletion analysis to a 36-amino acid stretch that contains this conserved motif (26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a peptide from the corresponding region on GM was successfully co-crystallized with PP1 and bound to a hydrophobic cleft on the phosphatase (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation of Ser-67 on GM, which is in the center of the PP1 interaction motif, disrupts PP1 binding to GM (35Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and promotes dissociation of the phosphatase from glycogen (37Hiraga A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, substitution of Ser-67 with the corresponding Val-63 from PTG also completely abrogated PP1 binding (36Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that the immediate consensus motif is not necessarily interchangeable between targeting proteins. Furthermore, a series of point mutations in PP1 differentially affected interaction with the glycogen-targeting subunits in a two-hybrid array. 2N. M. Fong, M. J. Brady, and A. R. Saltiel, unpublished observations. These results suggest that multiple contact points outside the common (K/R)VXF motif also mediate the interaction of PP1 with each glycogen-targeting subunit. The extreme C terminus of GL contains a high affinity binding site for phosphorylase that is not conserved in the other three glycogen-targeting subunits (26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis indicated that phosphorylase, as well as glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase, bound to a C-terminal region on PTG, which bore little homology to the phosphorylase-binding site on GL. This supposition was confirmed, as mutagenesis of the two acidic residues Asp-225 and Glu-228 to alanine blocked the binding of all three enzymes to PTG. These residues lie within a WDNNXGXNY motif that is relatively well conserved among the various glycogen-targeting subunits (Fig. 8 B) and has been proposed to comprise a common glycogen-binding region (26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the D225A/E228A PTG mutant still bound to glycogen (Fig. 6), indicating that other residues must also be involved in the binding of PTG to glycogen (28Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Initial results indicate that GL does not directly bind glycogen synthase, 3B. C. Callaghan and M. J. Brady, unpublished observations. indicating the WDNNXGXNY motif is not sufficient for glycogen synthase binding. Furthermore, several C-terminal PTG constructs, which contained the WDNNXGXNY motif, did not bind to glycogen synthase (Fig. 1). These results suggest that either other sites in PTG are also required for interaction with glycogen synthase or that the lack of glycogen synthase binding may be due to misfolding of these truncated proteins. The regions on the three glycogen-regulatory enzymes that bind to PTG are not obvious. Phosphorylase kinase, glycogen synthase, and phosphorylase possess distinct enzymatic properties and thus are not highly homologous. However, all three enzymes bind to glycogen (18Cohen P. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1978; 14: 117-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and may use these functionally similar domains to bind to PTG. The mutually exclusive binding of the PP1 substrates on PTG suggests the potential for competitive binding of these enzymes to PTG, which in turn may be hormonally regulated. Mapping of the region of glycogen synthase that binds to PTG and competitive binding assays with the various PP1 substrates are currently under investigation. Since glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase directly bind to glycogen, the significance of their interaction with PTG was previously unclear. In the present study, binding assays were performed in the absence of glycogen, demonstrating that PTG forms direct protein-protein complexes with these enzymes, as opposed to glycogen-mediated co-sedimentation (26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Disruption of PP1 binding to PTG completely inhibited the PTG-mediated increase in glycogen levels in CHO-IR cells, confirming the importance PP1 targeting in PTG function. However, disruption of PP1 substrate binding to PTG, either through C-terminal deletions or point mutagenesis, also completely ablated the ability of PTG to support glycogen synthesis. Conversely, a PTG construct that bound glycogen synthase more avidly than wild-type PTG caused a 2.5-fold larger increase in glycogen levels (Fig. 7). These results clearly demonstrate that targeting of PP1 to glycogen and binding of PP1 substrates are both required for the PTG-mediated increase in glycogen accumulation. However, the binding of substrates to PTG is presumably regulated, allowing for the dephosphorylation of multiple proteins by one PP1·PTG complex. One possibility being investigated is that the phosphorylated substrates possess a higher affinity for PTG, resulting in their disassociation following PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. Additionally, PP1 substrate binding may be influenced by hormonal signaling and/or elevation of intracellular levels of glucose and its metabolites. A family of four targeting subunits localizes PP1 to the glycogen particle. The lack of sequence homology and overlapping tissue distribution suggested that each targeting subunit might confer unique properties onto PP1 activity. Initial work has demonstrated that the GM-PP1 binding is uniquely regulated by the phosphorylation of GM, whereas the GL·PP1 complex is subject to allosteric inhibition by phosphorylase. Additionally, the various glycogen-targeting subunits exert differential effects on PP1 activity against glycogen-bound substrates in vitro (11Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 20Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Recently, Newgard and colleagues (13Gasa, R., Jensen, P. B., Berman, H. K., Brady, M. J., Depaoli-Roach, A. A., and Newgard, C. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275.Google Scholar) have reported that transfection of primary hepatocytes with GL or PTG results in similarly large increases in glycogen levels, whereas GMoverexpression has more modest effects. Cells containing GLwere no longer responsive to insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, whereas PTG-overexpressing cells were refractory to glycogenolytic stimuli. Thus, multiple glycogen-targeting subunits may be required for the differential modulation of PP1 substrate specificity, through intracellular localization, distinct mechanisms of binding to PP1, and direct interaction with phosphatase substrates. Chimeric analysis of the various glycogen targeting subunits may shed further light on the mechanisms of hormonal regulation and the physiological need for multiple proteins that superficially appear to serve the same function. Recent complimentary results have been reported for GM/RGL, the striated muscle-specific PP1-glycogen targeting subunit (39Liu J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26074-26081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)."

Here, we show that the L channel alpha1C subunit is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IGF-1. Moreover, expression of kinase-dead c-Src in neurons or acute block of Src family kinases with a cell-permeable inhibitor specifically blocks L channel potentiation. Purified Src kinase phosphorylates tyrosine residue Y2122 of the C terminus of neuronal alpha1C in vitro, and c- and v-Src directly bind the C terminus. When expressed in neuroblastoma cells, point mutation of Y2122 prevents both tyrosine phosphorylation of alpha1C and IGF-1 potentiation. Our data provide a biochemical mechanism whereby phosphorylation of a single specific tyrosine residue rapidly modifies ion channel physiology."

RNA polymerase II lacking the Rpb9 subunit RNA polymerase II comprises 12 subunits in yeast (1Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Four of the subunits, Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11, form a catalytic core that is homologous in structure and function to the prokaryotic core RNA polymerase (2Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 3Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The other eight eukaryotic subunits are less well characterized. Five of these subunits, Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10, and Rpb12, are found in all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (4Carles C. Treich I. Bouet F. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24092-24096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Woychik N.A. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17816-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Woychik N.A. Liao S.-M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The other three, Rpb4, Rpb7, and Rpb9, are unique to RNA polymerase II, although both Rpb7 and Rpb9 have sequence homologues in RNA polymerases I and III (7Nogi Y. Yano R. Dodd J. Carles C. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The gene for Rpb9 is not essential for yeast cell viability, but is essential in Drosophila(8Harrison D.A. Mortin M.A. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rpb9 has roles both in transcription initiation and in transcription elongation. In the initiation reaction, Rpb9 modulates the selection of the transcription start site. In cells lacking Rpb9 and in reconstituted transcription reactions lacking Rpb9, the population of start sites is shifted upstream at a variety of promoters (9Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the elongation reaction, Rpb9 is required, along with TFIIS, to effect transcription through blocks to elongation encoded by the DNA template (12Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A role in the modulation of initiation and elongation is consistent with the localization of Rpb9 in the three-dimensional structure of yeast RNA polymerase II. Rpb9 is located at the tip of the so-called “jaws” of the enzyme, which is thought to function by clamping the DNA downstream of the active site (3Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L.

The Rpb9 homologue in RNA polymerase III, C11, also has been implicated in regulating RNA chain elongation (15Chedin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Rpb9 comprises two zinc ribbon domains joined by a 30-amino acid linker. The C-terminal zinc ribbon is a sequence homologue of the zinc ribbon in the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (16Wang B. Jones D.N. Kaine B.P. Weiss M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 555-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Qian X. Jeon C. Yoon H. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The roles of each domain of Rpb9 in transcription elongation were determined by assaying a series of alanine-scanning mutants of Rpb9 in in vitro reactions (18Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions in the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain of Rpb9, like amino acid substitutions in the homologous part of TFIIS, completely eliminated elongation activity. Mutating the first zinc ribbon had no effect on elongation activity, although deleting this domain entirely abrogated activity. The linker region mediated the interaction of Rpb9 with the rest of the RNA polymerase. In this study, we used this series of mutations to probe the cellular role of Rpb9 in both initiation and elongation. YF2221 (MAT a ura3-52 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ade2-1 can1-100 ssd1-d2 trp1::hisG-URA3-hisG) is the parent strain. YF2230 (MAT a ura3-52 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ade2-1 can1-100 ssd1-d2 trp1::hisG-URA3-hisG rpb9::HIS3) is a derivative of YF2221 deleted for RPB9. YF2222 (MAT a ura3-52 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ade2-1 can1-100 ssd1-d2 trp1-1 ppr2::hisG-URA3-hisG) is deleted for the TFIIS gene, and YF2234 (MAT a ura3-52 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ade2-1 can1-100 ssd1-d2 trp1-1 ppr2::hisG-URA3-hisG rpb9::HIS3) lacks bothRPB9 and the TFIIS gene. The yeast expression plasmid pRS314RPB9 containing theRPB9 open reading frame plus ∼500 base pairs upstream and 2200 base pairs downstream was obtained from Dr. Rolf Furter (9Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This plasmid was adapted by inserting a BamHI restriction site immediately upstream of the start codon and an EcoRI restriction site immediately downstream of the stop codon, creating the plasmid pRS314RPB9BE. These sites were inserted using the QuikChange protocol and PfuI DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Incorporation of these restriction sites allowed for the insertion of each of the previously constructed rpb9 mutants into pRS314RPB9BE. The resulting plasmids, containing each of therpb9 mutant alleles under control of the endogenousRPB9 promoter, were transformed into yeast to determine their effects on growth and the use of initiation start sites. The Δrpb9 yeast strain grows slowly at 30 °C, is extremely sensitive to high- and low-temperature extremes, and is sensitive to the drug 6-azauracil. Expression of wild-typeRPB9 corrects these defects. Haploid Δrpb9cells were transformed with the RPB9 yeast expression plasmids to test each mutant for the ability to complement theΔrpb9 growth phenotypes. To test for complementation of cold and temperature sensitivity, the cells were grown on solid synthetic complete yeast medium lacking tryptophan. Suspensions containing ∼10,000, 2000, 400, and 80 cells were spotted onto solid medium and grown at 12, 30, or 37 °C for 2–6 days. Cells were grown on solid synthetic complete yeast medium lacking tryptophan and uracil and containing 50 μg/ml 6-azauracil to measure ability to correct sensitivity to 6-azauracil. Suspensions containing ∼10,000, 2000, 400, and 80 cells were spotted onto solid medium and grown at 30 °C for 3–8 days. Each mutant construct was compared with wild-typeRPB9 with respect to ability to restore growth characteristics. Primer extension assays were performed to identify the transcription start sites in the mutant yeast strains. Yeast strains YF2221, YF2222, YF2230, and YF2234 were grown in yeast extract peptone liquid medium with 2% glucose. YF2230 cells transformed with each of the pRS314RPB9BE constructs was grown in liquid complete synthetic medium lacking tryptophan. All cultures were grown at 30 °C to A 600 nm = 0.2 to 1.0. Cells (5 × 107) were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy protocol (QIAGEN Inc.). The primer used for these experiments, 5′-AGAAGATAACACCTTTTTGAG-3′ (Dalton Chemicals), is complementary to nucleotides +37 to +17 in the ADH1 gene. The primer was radiolabeled at the 5′-end by phosphorylating with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP. For each primer extension reaction, 15 μg of total RNA from the appropriate yeast strain was annealed with 0.4 pmol of the 5′-radiolabeled primer for 45 min at 52 °C. Reverse transcription from the annealed primer was done with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcripts were collected by ethanol precipitation and resolved on a Tris borate/EDTA, 8.3 m urea, and 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract peptone 2% glucose medium at 30 °C with constant agitation and aeration to A 600 nm = 0.4–0.6. Cells were washed once with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.5% SDS. Total RNA was isolated using a hot phenol method (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) and further purified using a QIAGEN RNeasy midi kit essentially as described by the supplier. RNA concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Two independent RNA preparations were made for each mutant strain. For each DNA microarray, 50 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 400 units of Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse transcription was primed with an AncT primer (T20VN, Sigma) and performed in the presence of dATP, dGTP, dTTP (final concentration of 168 μm each; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dCTP (final concentration of 50 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Cy3-labeled dCTP or Cy5-labeled dCTP (final concentration of 50 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 20 units of RNasin (Promega) was also added to the reaction. The mixture (minus the enzyme) was heated at 65 °C for 5 min and then at 42 °C for 5 min; the reverse transcription enzyme was added; and the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. The reverse transcription was stopped with EDTA (final concentration of 6.25 mm), and the RNA template was degraded by the addition of 10 n NaOH (final concentration of 0.5 n) and incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. The mixture was neutralized by the addition of 5 m acetic acid (final concentration of 0.5m), and the labeled cDNA was precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol and incubation on ice for 30 min. After rinsing with 70% EtOH, the labeled cDNA was resuspended in 5 μg of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. For each DNA microarray, 5 μl of purified Cy3-labeled cDNA and 5 μl of purified Cy5-labeled cDNA were added to 75 μl of DIG Easy hybridization buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 2 μl of yeast tRNA (10 mg/ml; Sigma) and 2 μl of single-stranded salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml; Sigma) were also added to the hybridization buffer, and the solution was heated at 65 °C for 2 min. The solution was then applied under a coverslip to a custom-made yeast whole genome microarray (Microarray Center, Ontario Cancer Institute). The microarrays were incubated at 37 °C in a humid hybridization chamber for 8–12 h. Before scanning, the slides were washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS (3 × 15 min at 50 °C), rinsed with 0.1× SSC (3 × 5 min at room temperature), and dried by centrifugation. A total of eight slides were hybridized for each mutant strain. The arrays were read on a laser confocal scanner (ScanArray 4000, GSI Lumonics), and the images obtained were quantified using QuantArray 2.0 software (GSI Lumonics). Our previous studies implicated Rpb9 in transcription elongation in vitro (12Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

In cells lacking Rpb9, a proportion of the Rpb9-deficient RNA polymerase II molecules (pol IIΔ9)1 initiated transcription at many promoters at upstream DNA sequences. This defect could be rescued by the addition of wild-type RPB9, but not a mutant altered in the N-terminal zinc ribbon domain. Subsequently, biochemical studies revealed a role for Rpb9 in transcription elongation in vitro (12Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

The addition of Rpb9 to pol IIΔ9 restored its in vitroelongation properties. Occasionally, the pol IIΔ9 enzyme did form arrested elongation complexes at the histone H3.3 arrest site. Unlike wild-type arrested complexes, these arrested pol IIΔ9 complexes were unable to be rescued by the addition of the elongation factor TFIIS. In general, these studies revealed a role for Rpb9 in transcription elongation. The parts of Rpb9 that contributed to the elongation activity were determined using a set of Rpb9 deletion and alanine-scanning mutants (18Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies showed that the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain was important for elongation, as was the linker region connecting the two zinc ribbons composing Rpb9. The linker region was shown specifically to be important for the binding of Rpb9 to pol IIΔ9. We were unable to show that the N-terminal zinc ribbon, which is important for start site selection (10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), played a role in elongation. TFIIS and Rpb9 are linked biochemically and are related in structure. We were interested whether there is also a genetic interaction betweenRPB9 and TFIIS gene (the TFIIS gene is also known asPPR2). Yeast cells lacking the gene for Rpb9 are sensitive to both low- and high-temperature extremes and grow more slowly than do wild-type strains even at the optimal growth temperature (10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,21Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phenotypes were also observed in ourΔrpb9 strain, and normal growth was restored by expressingRPB9 from a low-copy plasmid under the control of its own promoter. Yeast strains lacking the TFIIS gene are sensitive to the drug 6-azauracil. This phenotype is thought to reflect a defect in transcription elongation (20Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Since Rpb9 is required for the functional interaction between RNA polymerase II and TFIIS, we tested the Δrpb9 strain for sensitivity to 6-azauracil. TheΔrpb9 strain grew more slowly on medium containing 6-azauracil than did the parent strain (Fig.1). Transforming the Δrpb9strain with the RPB9 gene on a low-copy plasmid fully complemented the 6-azauracil sensitivity (Fig. 1). The double deletion strain (Δrpb9/Δtfiis) was constructed, and its phenotype was tested to explore the genetic interaction between the TFIIS gene and RPB9. In agreement with the biochemical studies, the double mutant possessed a much more severe phenotype than did either of the individual gene disruptions (Fig. 1). These observations are consistent with a functional interaction between TFIIS and Rpb9 in vivo. The Δtfiis and Δrpb9 strains were each transformed with high-copy plasmids bearing the wild-type TFIIS gene and RPB9, respectively (Fig.2). These and various control strains were tested for growth on plates containing 0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml 6-azauracil. The TFIIS gene on a high-copy plasmid partially suppressed the 6-azauracil sensitivity of Δrpb9 cells. In contrast,RPB9 on a high-copy plasmid did not suppress the 6-azauracil sensitivity of Δtfiis cells. These data suggest that the elongation defect caused by the absence of Rpb9 can be restored partially by increasing the cellular concentration of TFIIS. We conclude that the effects on cell growth caused by disruptingRPB9 arise in part from defects in transcription elongation. Rpb9 was shown originally to have a role in regulating the choice of the transcription start sites (9Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); subsequently, Rpb9 was implicated in transcription elongation (12Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G.

Here, we analyzed the properties of the set of rpb9 mutants in vivo to gain insight into the physiological role of Rpb9. The 20 mutants were assayed for their ability to restore normal growth to haploidΔrpb9 and Δrpb9/Δtfiis yeast cells. To accomplish this, each strain was transformed with the low-copy plasmid pRS314 carrying each of the rpb9 mutant alleles, and the phenotypes were monitored. All of the 20 alanine-scanning Rpb9 mutants restored normal growth to Δrpb9 cells. These mutants could, however, be divided into two classes: those that had no effect on any of the other Rpb9 properties (start site selection and elongation; data not shown) and those that affected one or the other (TableI, first and second columns). Other mutants had no effect on growth rate, initiation in vivo, or elongation in vitro and are not included in Table I: Rpb9(R5A,F6A), Rpb9(R8A,D9A), Rpb9(R17A), Rpb9(E18A), Rpb9(D19A), Rpb9(K20A), Rpb9(E21A), Rpb9(R30A), Rpb9(E54A), Rpb9(D72A), and Rpb9(K77A). These mutations are located in the N-terminal zinc ribbon and the linker domains.Table ISummary of in vivo analyses of rpb9 mutant allelesRpb9 mutantPhenotypeStart siteElongation in vitro1-bReported previously (18).Rpb9++ 1-a++, allele completely restores normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan; +, allele partially restores normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan; −, allele does not restore normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan.++++Rpb9-(1–47)−++−Rpb9-(Δ12–27)−−−Rpb9-(Δ16–23)−++−Rpb9-(Δ36–70)+−−Rpb9-(Δ65–70)++++−Rpb9(D61A)+++++Rpb9(D65A)+++++Rpb9(R70A)+++++Rpb9-(Δ80–101)++++−Rpb9-(Δ89–95)++++−Rpb9(R91A)++++−Rpb9(R92A)++++−Rpb9(K93A)++++−Rpb9(D94A)++++−1-a ++, allele completely restores normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan; +, allele partially restores normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan; −, allele does not restore normal growth at 30 °C on synthetic complete solid medium lacking tryptophan.1-b Reported previously (18Hemming S.A.

Open table in a new tab Several rpb9 alleles with internal or C- or N-terminal deletions in either of the two zinc domains had cell growth phenotypes (Table I, first and second columns). A C-terminal truncation mutant, Rpb9-(1–47), which contains the N-terminal zinc-binding domain and part of the linker region but lacks the second zinc domain, was unable to restore normal cell growth to Δrpb9 cells. Two deletion mutants in the first zinc (Zn1) region (Rpb9-(Δ12–27) and Rpb9-(Δ16–23)) also were unable to complement Δrpb9cell growth. We conclude that Rpb9 requires both zinc-binding regions for normal growth. For all rpb9 mutants tested, the three phenotypes, temperature, cold, and 6-azauracil sensitivity, were strongly correlated. This correlation suggests that the lack of Rpb9 is the primary defect that underlies all three phenotypes and that they are not secondary effects of the gene disruption. rpb9 cells exhibit altered preference for transcription start sites on a variety of promoters (9Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In most cases, an upstream shift of the 5′-end of the transcript is observed. In this study, the ADH1 gene, which shows a distinctive difference in the transcription start site between the wild-type parent and the Δrpb9 strains (10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was used to analyze the effect of the various rpb9 alleles on the use of initiation sites. A tfiis knockout strain and a rpb9/tfiis double knockout strain were also analyzed to determine the effect of TFIIS on initiation start site selection. Primer extension analysis was performed on RNA isolated from the different yeast strains using a primer directed against the 5′-end of the ADH1 gene. The pattern of initiation sites in the wild-type strain was compared with those in the Δrpb9, Δtfiis, andΔrpb9/Δtfiis strains. The RNA for this primer extension analysis was prepared from these strains after they were grown in a rich medium. The patterns of initiation sites in the wild-type and Δrpb9 strains are easily distinguished; the reverse transcripts prepared from the Δrpb9 strain are longer and reflect an increase in the number of ADH1transcripts that start upstream of position −37 (Fig.3). The deletion of the TFIIS gene appeared to have no influence on start site selection, even in conjunction with the deletion of RPB9. TheΔtfiis strain had a transcription initiation profile identical to that of the wild-type strain, and the profile for therpb9/tfiis double knockout strain was identical to that of the Δrpb9 strain. The synthetic phenotype that occurs in the rpb9/tfiis double knockout strain does not appear to stem from a more severe defect in transcription initiation. The majority of rpb9 alleles restored the normal pattern of initiation sites in rpb9-deleted yeast cells (see above and Table I). One exception was an rpb9 mutant containing only the Zn1 domain. This mutant, which expressed at wild-type levels, 2S. M. Orlicky, personal communication. was able to complement the start site defect (Fig.4), but not the other activities. The properties of this mutant serve to uncouple the role of Rpb9 in transcription initiation from the roles in transcription elongation and cell growth. The phenotypes of the rpb9 mutants are inconsistent with an important role for Rpb9 in transcription initiation. Our previous studies linking Rpb9 structure to function identified several parts of the protein important for transcription elongation activity (18Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Specifically, the C-terminal zinc ribbon was required for RNA cleavage in arrested transcription complexes and for reactivating arrested complexes in conjunction with TFIIS, and the linker region mediated the interaction of Rpb9 with RNA polymerase II. When tested for activity in yeast cells, every rpb9 mutant that displayed a growth phenotype was inactive for transcription elongation. However, all of the alanine-scanning mutants that displayed reduced elongation activity had perfectly normal growth rates and were able to restore the normal pattern of initiation start sites (Table I). We suggest that the in vivo complementation assays are less sensitive indicators of Rpb9 function than the in vitroassays. The similar phenotypes of the tfiis- andrpb9-deleted strains and their genetic interaction suggest that the proteins have a similar effect on elongation. To determine whether a common set of genes is regulated by the two transcription factors, we compared the patterns of gene expression in theΔrpb9, Δtfiis, andΔrpb9/Δtfiis strains using yeast DNA microarrays. Disruption of either the TFIIS gene or RPB9 in log-phase cells grown in rich medium had little effect on global gene expression (data not shown). 3C. Seidel and C. M. Kane, unpublished data. InΔrpb9 cells, where the effect was more dramatic, transcription of only 1–2% of yeast genes was altered more than 2-fold compared with the isogenic parent. Many of these genes belonged to metabolic clusters (Table II). For example, the expression of a set of glycolytic enzymes was decreased in the Δrpb9 cells. Although this observation suggests some form of metabolic response, the profile of gene expression did not resemble the global responses to glucose starvation (22DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Further analysis will be required to determine whether the response is a direct effect on gene regulation or a more general indirect response.Table IIFunctional clusters of transcription differences in Δrpb9 cells grown in rich medium compared with the isogenic parentORFGene nameExp. 1Exp. 2FunctionDescriptionGlycolysis YKL152CGPM10.440.37GlycolysisPhosphoglycerate mutase YGL253WHXK20.390.37GlycolysisHexokinase II (PII) (also called hexokinase B) YFR053CHXK10.370.31GlycolysisHexokinase I (PI) (also called hexokinase A) YOR344CTYE70.370.36GlycolysisBasic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein YCR012WPGK10.320.35Glycolysis3-Phosphoglycerate kinase YAL038WCDC190.250.2GlycolysisPyruvate kinase YDR050CTPI10.150.2GlycolysisTriose-phosphate isomeraseAmino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis/ metabolism YEL009CGCN40.570.36Amino acid, purine biosynthesisTranscriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes YOL058WARG10.520.47Arginine biosynthesisArginosuccinate synthetase YEL046CGLY10.440.58Gly, Ser, Thr biosynthesisThreonine aldolase YDR046CBAP30.380.52TransportValine transporter YBR249CARO40.360.57Aromatic amino acid biosynthesisDAHP synthase isoenzyme YOR202WHIS39.784.78Histidine biosynthesisImidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase YER081WSER37.53.91Serine biosynthesis3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase YDR007WTRP12.252.5Tryptophan biosynthesisn-(5′-Phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate isomerase YHR137WARO93.463.04Aromatic amino acid metabolismAromatic amino acid aminotransferase II YLR438WCAR22.633.38Arginine metabolismOrnithine aminotransferase YDR399WHPT10.550.44Purine biosynthesisHypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase YAR075WYAR075W0.410.41Unknown YAR073WYAR073W0.330.44Unknown YHR216WYHR216W0.320.42Purine biosynthesisIMP dehydrogenase YLR432WYLR432W0.250.43Unknown YEL058WTHI53.421.95Pyrimidine biosynthesisThiamine-regulated pyrimidine precursor biosynthesis YNL332WTHI123.012.47Pyrimidine biosynthesisInvolved in pyrimidine biosynthesis YEL021WURA32.772.63Pyrimidine biosynthesisOrotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase YLR156CTHI112.541.86Pyrimidine biosynthesisThiamine biosynthetic enzyme YHR128WFUR10.20.27Pyrimidine salvage pathwayUPRTaseProtein synthesis YPL240CHSP820.560.44Protein folding82-kDa heat shock protein; homologue of Hsp90 YMR186WHSC820.290.27Protein foldingConstitutively expressed heat shock protein YNL007CSIS10.510.48Translationsit4suppressor, dnaJ homologue YER001WMNN10.470.55Protein glycosylationα-1,3-Mannosyltransferase YFL022CFRS20.450.53Protein synthesisPhenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase YFL031WHAC10.150.27Unfolded protein responseBasic leucine zipper proteinRNA processing YHR163WSOL32.451.75tRNA splicing, putativeHomologous to Sol2p and Sol1p YDR021WFAL12.11.76rRNA processingDEAD box protein, putative RNA helicase YKL149CDBR10.550.31mRNA splicingDebranching enzyme YCR035CRRP430.550.48rRNA processingComponent of the exosome 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease complex YNL112WDBP20.472.02mRNA decayATP-dependent RNA helicase of DEAD box family YDL048CSTP40.360.44tRNA splicingInvolved in tRNA splicingShown are major functional gene clusters.

ORF, open reading frame. In cells lacking both TFIIS and Rpb9, the transcriptional changes were more pronounced, but the response resembled an amplified version of the RPB9 disruption. In general, the transcription profile correlated with the growth of the cells. There were more differences in the rpb9/tfiis double disruption than in the singly deleted rpb9 andtfiis cells. We were unable to relate any differences to specific elongation defects. Rpb9 plays a role in selecting the sites of transcription initiation. Cells lacking Rpb9 initiate transcription at upstream sites on many promoters. We discovered that a derivative of Rpb9 containing only the Zn1 and linker domains of Rpb9 was sufficient to correct this defect. In addition, inactivating the Zn1 domain by deleting the majority of the region between the two pairs of cysteines or mutating the first cysteine (10Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) destroyed its ability to select the wild-type initiation sites. Together, these two results suggest that the Zn1 domain regulates the selection of transcription initiation sites. In the crystal structure of yeast RNA polymerase II (3Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), Rpb9 is positioned near the largest subunit and is predicted to contact the DNA downstream of the active site. The Zn1 and Zn2 domains are positioned on opposite sides of a protein wall that separates the DNA cleft from the back of the enzyme with respect to the DNA. The Zn1 domain would be predicted to be closer to the DNA template than would the Zn2 domain. The activity of the Zn1 domain in selecting transcription start sites is therefore consistent with its position in the RNA polymerase. In addition to altered patterns of transcription initiation sites,rpb9 strains also exhibit slow growth at optimal temperature, an increased sensitivity to high and low temperatures (20Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and a lower tolerance for the drug 6-azauracil. One of the most significant observations of this work is that the temperature and drug phenotypes can be distinguished from the defect in start site selection. Two mutations in the Zn1 domain were unable to correct the defect in start site selection, yet corrected the growth defects. Therefore, in Δrpb9 cells, we conclude that the defect in start site selection does not appear to be the underlying basis for the defect in growth. The Zn1 domain has a charged loop whose homologue in the Zn2 domain is essential for elongation activity. Point mutants or deletion mutants in the charged loop in the Zn1 domain do not appear to play an important role in selecting the transcription start sites. Each of the single amino acid substitution mutants within the loop as well as the Δ16–23 mutant, which has the entire predicted flexible loop removed, restored the wild-type pattern of initiation sites. The mechanism of action of the Zn1 domain likely differs than of the Zn2 domain. Rpb9 must assemble with RNA polymerase to restore elongation activity to RNA polymerase II. In vitro, we showed that the mutant comprising the Zn1 domain and part of the linker interacted poorly with pol IIΔ9 (18Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this mutant was able to restore correct start site selection in vivo. The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo observations is common; many of the mutants that bound poorly to pol IIΔ9 in vitro restored both start site preferences and growth characteristics in vivo. Recently, we learned that the polymerase-binding surface of Rpb9 consists of more than just the conserved D-DPTLPR sequence; in the RNA polymerase crystal structure (3Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), there appear to be a range of contacts between Rpb9 and Rpb1. Many of these contacts involve the Zn1 domain, suggesting that the strength of these interactions is sufficient for the assembly of the Zn1 domain into RNA polymerase II in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W1965939096,"The most abundant mismatch binding factor in human cells, hMutSα, is a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH6, two homologues of the bacterial MutS protein. The C-terminal portions of all MutS homologues contain an ATP binding motif and are highly conserved throughout evolution. Although the N termini are generally divergent, they too contain short conserved sequence elements. A phenylalanine → alanine substitution within one such motif, G<i>X</i>FY(<i>X</i>)<sub>5</sub>DA, has been shown to abolish the mismatch binding activity of the MutS protein of<i>Thermus aquaticus</i> (Malkov, V. A., Biswas, I., Camerini-Otero, R. D., and Hsieh, P. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 272, 23811–23817). We introduced an identical mutation into one or both subunits of hMutSα. The Phe → Ala substitution in hMSH2 had no effect on the biological activity of the heterodimer. In contrast, the <i>in vitro</i> mismatch binding and mismatch repair functions of hMutSα were severely attenuated when the hMSH6 subunit was mutated. Moreover, this variant heterodimer also displayed a general DNA binding defect. Correspondingly, its ATPase activity could not be stimulated by either heteroduplex or homoduplex DNA. Thus the N-terminal portion of hMSH6 appears to impart on hMutSα not only the specificity for recognition and binding of mismatched substrates but also the ability to bind to homoduplex DNA."

However, in the mammalian brain, it has not been possible to monitor Ca(res) in fibers that project from one brain region to another. Here, we label neuronal projections by injecting dextran-conjugated calcium indicators into brain nuclei in vivo. Currently available dextran conjugates distort Ca(res) due to their high affinity for calcium. Therefore, we synthesized a low-affinity indicator, fluo-4 dextran, that can more accurately measure the amplitude and time course of Ca(res). We then demonstrate the utility of fluo-4 dextran by measuring Ca(res) at climbing fiber presynaptic terminals. This method promises to facilitate the study of many synapses in the mammalian CNS, both in brain slices and in vivo."

Analysis of the sequences of the different members of the annexin family revealed the presence of a pentapeptide biochemically related to KFERQ in some annexins but not in others. Such sequences have been proposed to be a targeting sequence for chaperone-mediated autophagy, a lysosomal pathway of protein degradation that is activated in confluent cells in response to removal of serum growth factors. We demonstrate that annexins II and VI, which contain KFERQ-like sequences, are degraded more rapidly in response to serum withdrawal, while annexins V and XI, without such sequences, are degraded at the same rate in the presence and absence of serum. Using isolated lysosomes, only the annexins containing KFERQ-like sequences are degraded by chaperone mediated-autophagy. Annexins V and XI could associate with lysosomes but did not enter the lysosomes and were not proteolytic substrates. Furthermore, four annexins containing KFERQ-like sequences, annexins I, II, IV, and VI, are enriched in lysosomes with high chaperone-mediated autophagy activity as expected for substrate proteins.

Russo-Marie F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Moss S. Moss S. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 1-9Google Scholar). A conserved 70-amino acid sequence is repeated either four or eight times in the sequences of annexin family members forming the core domain of the protein responsible for calcium and phospholipid binding (2Moss S. Moss S. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 1-9Google Scholar, 3Benz J. Hofmann A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the annexins has a unique amino-terminal region susceptible to secondary posttranslational modifications believed to be responsible for the specific annexin functions (4Gerke V. Moss S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, differences in their tissue and intracellular distribution also determine the different functions for the 40–50% identical and 70–80% similar proteins (5Dreier R. Werner Schmid K. Gerke V. Richemann K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of annexins is still unclear, different intracellular and extracellular functions have been proposed (1Donato R. Russo-Marie F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, regulation of inflammatory processes, binding of extracellular matrix molecules, and activation of plasminogen are some of the proposed functions (1Donato R. Russo-Marie F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Moss S. Moss S. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 1-9Google Scholar). In addition to those specific functions, many authors have proposed the regulation of intracellular vesicular transport such as endocytosis and exocytosis as the primary function of annexins (6Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Pikula S. Acta Biochim. Polon. 1998; 45: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Donnelly S. Moss S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Annexins have been implicated as membrane fusogens, calcium sensors, mediators of actin binding to membranes, and signal transducers (7Donnelly S. Moss S. Cell Mol.

The role of the different annexins in vesicular transport may also differ depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of cells. Annexins are mainly located in the cytosol, but they can shift to different subcellular locations in a calcium-dependent manner. Annexins have been localized to the plasma membrane (9Culard J. Basset-Seguin N. Calas B. Guilhou J. Martin F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), early endosomes (10Diakonova M. Gerke V. Ernst J.

In addition to the vesicular system, annexins have also been detected in mitochondria and the nucleus (5Dreier R. Werner Schmid K. Gerke V. Richemann K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rates of synthesis of annexins are not acutely regulated (13Hajjar K. Krishnan S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mechanisms other than changes in annexin mRNA levels might contribute to altered protein expression levels or activities under different conditions. Different secondary modifications such as phosphorylation and alkylation have been described for some of the annexins (1Donato R. Russo-Marie F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Moss S. Moss S. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 1-9Google Scholar). Little is known about changes in annexin degradation rates or even the pathways by which annexins are normally degraded. Analysis of the sequences of the 12 human annexins revealed the presence in nine of them of a motif biochemically related with the pentapeptide KFERQ (14Gomes A. Barnes J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 853-860PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I diagrams the annexins analyzed in this work). That motif has been implicated in targeting of mammalian proteins for degradation in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (15Dice J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The substrates for this pathway constitute a heterogeneous group of proteins that includes some glycolytic enzymes, transcription factors and their inhibitors, subunits of some cytosolic proteases, and the cytosolic form of a secretory protein (16Dice J. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit., Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar, 17Cuervo A. Dice J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only common feature in all of the substrates for this pathway is that they contain the KFERQ-related motif. This motif, present in about 30% of cytosolic proteins (15Dice J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 18Wing S. Chiang H. Goldberg A. Dice J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), is specifically recognized by a chaperone, the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa (hsc73)1 when chaperone-mediated autophagy is activated (19Chiang H. Terlecky S. Plant C. Dice J. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The complex of substrate protein/chaperone then binds to the lysosomal membrane through a receptor protein (20Cuervo A. Dice J. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), and the substrate is then transported into the lysosomal matrix for degradation. The transport of substrate requires the presence of a second chaperone, the lysosomal hsc73, in the lysosomal lumen (21Agarraberes F. Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Cuervo A. Dice J. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Chaperone-mediated autophagy is mainly activated under conditions of nutrient deprivation in a tissue-dependent manner (18Wing S. Chiang H. Goldberg A. Dice J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Cuervo A. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and after exposure to specific toxin compounds (24Cuervo A. Hildebrand H. Bomhard E. Dice J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Table IKFERQ-like motifs in human and rat annexinsTable IKFERQ-like motifs in human and rat annexinsThe location and sequence of KFERQ-like motifs in the human (h) and rat (r) annexins analyzed in this work is shown. The location and sequence of KFERQ-like motifs in the human (h) and rat (r) annexins analyzed in this work is shown. The KFERQ-related motif seems to be phylogenetically conserved. Recently a pathway similar in many respects to chaperone-mediated autophagy has been described in yeast (25Horst M. Knecht E. Schu P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolated yeast vacuoles could selectively import and degrade glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase type 1 in an ATP/hsc73-dependent manner. The yeast protein also contains a KFERQ motif near its amino terminus (QRKDI, residues 21–25). In this work we have directly analyzed the effect that changes in the activity of this lysosomal pathway under conditions such as nutrient deprivation have on the half-life of four annexins, two of which contain a KFERQ motif and two of which do not. We also analyze whether or not the annexins can be taken up and degraded in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy in vitro. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were starved for 20 h to deplete liver glycogen. Rats had free access to water. In some experiments fasting was prolonged to 64 or 88 h as indicated. Primary human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) from the Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) in the presence of 10% newborn calf serum. To deprive cells of serum, plates were extensively washed with Hanks' balanced salts solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and medium without serum was added. Sources of chemicals and antibodies were as described previously (20Cuervo A. Dice J. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 23Cuervo A. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, the monoclonal antibodies against annexins I, II, IV, and VI were obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and against annexin V from Dr. Y. Imai (National Institute of Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). For immunoprecipitation purposes the polyclonal antibodies against annexins II and VI were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), against annexin V from Dr. A. Hofman (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany), and against annexin XI from Dr. W. J. van Venrooij (University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The cDNAs for annexins II, V and VI were from Dr. V. Gerke (University of Münster, Münster, Germany), Dr. A. Hofman (Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie), and Dr. S. Moss (University College, London, United Kingdom), respectively. The half-lives of different annexins were measured in human fibroblasts in culture as described (28Cuervo A. Hu W. Lim B. Dice J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1995-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts at 60–70% confluence were radiolabeled with the [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (0.2 mCi/ml) for 48 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% serum. After extensive washing, cells were maintained in the presence or absence of 10% serum, and supplemented with a 2 mm mixture of nonradioactive methionine and cysteine. At increasing times, cells were recovered and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with the specific antibodies against the different annexins previously conjugated to protein A/protein G-Sepharose beads (Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The half-lives of the different annexins for cells maintained in the presence or absence of serum were calculated after quantification in the PhosphorImager system from the formulat 12 = ln2/degradation rate. Lysosomes were isolated from a light mitochondrial fraction in a discontinuous metrizamide density gradient (29Wattiaux R. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Ronveaux-Dupal M. Dubois F. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) by the shorter method reported previously (27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some studies two groups of lysosomes with different activities for chaperone-mediated autophagy were isolated as described (22Cuervo A. Dice J. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5606-5615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The integrity of the lysosomal membrane after isolation was measured by β-hexosaminidase latency as described previously (26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only preparations with more than 95% intact lysosomes were used. Lysosomal membranes and matrices were separated after hypotonic shock of isolated lysosomes as reported (30Ohsumi Y. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1983; 93: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomal membranes recovered by centrifugation were then washed with 20 volumes of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, without additions or with 1 mmCaCl2, 3 mm EDTA, or 3 mm EGTA. The cDNA of annexins II, V and VI cloned in the pRC-CMV vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were transcribed/translated in a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (T7TNT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega, Madison, WI) using a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Easy Tag-Express [35S]; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h, and the total radioactivity incorporated was determined by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. All synthesis reactions were adjusted to 0.3 m sucrose before adding into the lysosomal transport assay to maintain the osmolarity of the medium. Isolated lysosomes (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 100 μm chymostatin for 10 min at 0 °C and then diluted three times with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.3 msucrose (MOPS buffer) (23Cuervo A. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized annexins (approximately 150,000 dpm) were added and samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at 0 °C with proteinase K at a final concentration previously determined to be sufficient to completely degrade the amount of annexins synthesized. Lysosomes recovered by centrifugation were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amount of annexins associated with lysosomes (samples not treated with proteinase K) and transported into the lysosomal lumen (samples treated with proteinase K) was detected and quantified by exposure of dried gels to a PhosphorImager screen in a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Any additions were dissolved in the incubation buffer before adding to lysosomes. Degradation of annexins by lysosomes was assayed as described previously (23Cuervo A. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, intact rat liver lysosomes or lysosomes broken by 10 cycles of freezing and thawing in a hypotonic buffer (25 μg of protein) were incubated with the in vitro synthesized annexins (approximately 75,000 dpm) in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5.4 μm cysteine (MOPS/dithiothreitol buffer) for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. Acid-soluble material (amino acids and small peptides) was collected by filtration through a Millipore Multiscreen assay system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a 0.45-μm pore filter, and the acid-precipitable material (protein) was collected in the filter. Radioactivity in the samples was converted to disintegrations per minute in a P2100TR Packard liquid scintillation analyzer by correcting for quenching using an external standard (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). Proteolysis was expressed as the percentage of the initial acid-insoluble radioactivity converted to acid-soluble radioactivity at the end of the incubation. In some experiments aliquots taken at different times of the incubation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteolysis was followed after exposure of the dried gel to a PhosphorImager screen as the decrease in the amount of initial protein. SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) were performed by standard procedures. Protein was determined by the Lowry method (33Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Standard procedures were used for the determination of enzymatic activities as reported previously (26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots, was performed with a Digital Imaging System IS-1000 (Innotech S-100, Sunnyvale, CA). Removal of serum from confluent cultures of fibroblasts activates chaperone-mediated autophagy (16Dice J. Lysosomal Pathways of Protein Degradation. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit., Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar). We measured the half-lives of two KFERQ-containing annexins (II and VI; TableI) and two annexins lacking the motif (V and XI) in confluent human fibroblasts cultured in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1). In the presence of serum, the half-lives of the four annexins in those cells were similar (40–52 h). After serum removal we found reduced half-lives of annexin II (30%) and annexin VI (65%), but no changes in the half-lives of annexins V and XI. These results suggest that the annexins containing the KFERQ-like motifs may be degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy. We then analyzed isolated rat liver lysosomes for their content of different annexins. Annexins have been detected in the cytosol of most cell types but also in association with various intracellular membranes (9Culard J. Basset-Seguin N. Calas B. Guilhou J. Martin F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Diakonova M. Gerke V. Ernst J. Liautard J.-P. van der Vusse G. Griffiths G. J.

Biol. 1999; 66: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge only annexin VI has been previously reported to be associated with lysosomes (11Jackle S. Beisiegel U. Rinninger F. Buck F. Grigoleit A. Block A. Groger I. Greten H. Windler E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1026-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the four annexins analyzed in this work (annexins II, V, VI, and XI) (Fig.2 A), but also annexins I and IV (data not shown) can be detected to some extent in the isolated lysosomes (0.2%, 0.6%, 0.1%, and 0.04% of the total annexins II, V, VI, and XI in the homogenate, respectively). The lysosomal fraction used in this study has been extensively characterized (26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it consists mainly of mature lysosomes as indicated by their acidic pH (pH 5.2–5.5), the complete processing and maturation of cathepsins in their lumen, and the absence of markers for other vesicular organelles such as for late endosomes (i.e. the mannose 6-phosphate receptor). The annexins detected in the lysosomal fraction had the same molecular weight as those in the cytosolic fraction. In addition, in some preparations we detected two immunoreactive lower molecular mass bands of 35 and 30 kDa for annexins II and VI, but never for annexins V or XI (data not shown). Those lower molecular weight forms might correspond to proteolytic fragments of annexins as described below. Although we found all annexins analyzed associated with lysosomes, when we separated lysosomal membranes and matrices we found a preferential location of annexins II and VI in the lysosomal matrix (83% in the matrix versus 17% in the membrane) and of annexin XI in the lysosomal membrane (24% in the matrix versus 76% in the membrane) (Fig. 2 A). Annexin V lacks the KFERQ motif but was still more abundant in the lysosomal matrix, although not as strikingly so as the KFERQ-containing annexins (Fig. 2 A). We then incubated the isolated rat liver lysosomes in an isotonic medium in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitor, leupeptin, and followed changes in levels of different annexins by immunoblot (Fig. 2 B). The lysosomal levels of annexin II and VI, but not of annexin V and XI, decreased with the incubation time, and that decrease was almost completely blocked by the protease inhibitor. These results suggest that the two annexins containing the KFERQ motif, but not the two lacking the motif, were degraded in lysosomes. To analyze the mechanism that the annexins containing the KFERQ motif follow for their transport and further degradation into the lysosomal matrix, we used a previously developed in vitro system (23Cuervo A. Knecht E. Terlecky S. Dice J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Terlecky S. Dice J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That system allowed us to analyze the ability of isolated rat liver lysosomes to take up and degrade different annexins. A portion of the annexin II, and to a lesser extent annexin VI, synthesized in anin vitro transcription/translation system was degraded after incubation with intact lysosomes (Fig.3 A). We found much less degradation of annexin V incubated under the same conditions. The different degradation rates for those annexins were not due to differences in their susceptibility to lysosomal proteases since all of them were degraded at similar rate by broken lysosomes (Fig.3 B, bottom). When we analyzed the annexin pattern of lysosomal degradation in autoradiograms, we found an intermediate proteolytic fragment for annexins II and VI of 35 and 38 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 A,top). In agreement with our previous observations, annexin V incubated with intact lysosomes remained intact (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we found similar intermediate fragments for annexins II and VI after their incubation with broken lysosomes (Fig.3 B, top), suggesting that the fragments were probably the result of preferential cleavage by lysosomal protease(s). After incubation with broken lysosomes, we did not detect any intermediate fragment for annexin V during its complete degradation (Fig. 3 B). We separately analyzed binding and uptake of proteins by isolated lysosomes in vitro after inhibiting their proteolytic activity with specific protease inhibitors (27Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we added thein vitro synthesized annexins II, V, and VI to that system, we found that a portion of all of them bound to lysosomes (Fig.4 A, lanes 4–6). Interestingly, despite the pretreatment of lysosomes with the protease inhibitor, chymostatin, we still detected the two lower proteolytic fragments for annexin II and VI described above (Fig.4 A, lane 6). To determine the amount of each annexin transported into the lysosomal lumen, we then removed the proteins bound to the external surface of the lysosomes by treatment with proteinase K. We found that a portion of annexin II and VI, but also of annexin V, was presumably located in the lysosomal lumen since it was not degraded by proteinase K (Fig. 4 A,lanes 7–9). The amount of proteinase K added was sufficient to remove all the extralysosomal annexins since we did not detect any remaining annexin in the supernatant after lysosomal sedimentation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10–12). To better determine the location of the different annexins associated with lysosomes, we then performed similar uptake assays but separated lysosomal membranes from matrices at the end of the incubation (Fig.4 B). We found that a portion of the total annexin II and VI associated with lysosomes (lanes 4 and6) was bound to the lysosomal membrane (lanes 7 and 9), but both annexins and their corresponding proteolytic fragments were also present in the lysosomal matrix (lanes 10 and 12). In contrast, we only detected annexin V in the lysosomal membrane fraction (lane 8) but never in the lysosomal matrix (lane 11). These results suggest a portion of annexin V associates with the lysosomal membrane in a fashion that makes it resistant to the attack of proteinase K but that annexin V is not transported into the lysosomal lumen. Binding of annexins to phospholipids is often modulated by calcium. We found that the binding of in vitro synthesized annexin II and VI to the membrane of intact lysosomes was not significantly modified in the presence of calcium (Fig. 5 A). However, we detected a slight increase in the amount of annexin V associated to the lysosomal membrane after calcium supplementation (Fig. 5 A). One possibility is that the normal stimulatory effect of calcium on annexin binding properties might be masked by the presence of calcium already in the transcription/translation reactions or in the isolated lysosomes. Some of the annexins, such as annexin II, have low calcium requirements for phospholipid binding. Thus, we then analyzed the effect that calcium c"

This study was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte translation lysates in which the HCV IRES-driven reporter RNA was introduced along with the PTB-specific SELEX RNA molecules. The SELEX RNAs specifically inhibited the HCV IRES function in the context of mono- and dicistronic mRNAs. The cap-dependent translation of a reporter (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) RNA or naturally capped brome mosaic virus RNA, however, was not affected by the presence of SELEX during in vitro translation assays. The SELEX-mediated inhibition of the HCV IRES is shown to be relieved by the addition of recombinant human PTB in an add-back experiment. Thein vivo requirement of PTB was further confirmed by cotransfection of Huh7 cells with reporter RNA and PTB-specific SELEX RNA. The HCV IRES activity was inhibited by the SELEX RNA in these cells, but not by an unrelated control RNA.

Inoue A. Yamazaki H. Kawashima T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). HCV contains a single-stranded RNA genome (9600 nucleotides) with plus polarity that encodes a single polyprotein of 3010 amino acids (1Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1058Google Scholar). The polyprotein is processed into three structural (C (p21), E1 (p31), and E2 (p72)) and several nonstructural (NS2 (p23), p7, NS3 (p70), NS4A (p6), NS4B (p27), NS5A (p58), and NS5B (p65)) polypeptides. Analysis of the conserved and divergent regions of the HCV genomes thus far cloned from various geographical locations indicates that the 5′-noncoding region (5′-NCR) that precedes the open reading frame and the 3′ terminus of the genome are highly conserved among all subtypes (1Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1058Google Scholar, 4Kolykhalov A. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These elements function as promoters of HCV gene expression. The translation initiation of the HCV RNA genome occurs by internal ribosome entry located in the 5′-NCR (5Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Iizuka N. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that HCV RNA translation is regulated by at least three distinct elements: 1) the global structure of the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which includes almost the entire sequence (except nucleotides 1–40) within the 5′-NCR and a few nucleotides downstream of the AUG initiator codon (see Fig. 1 A) (5Tsukiyama-Kohara K.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8789-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (but the exact role of the entire 3′-NCR during translation regulation is still unclear); and 3) trans-acting cellular factors that interact with the viral IRES element and assist in internal initiation of translation (15Ali N.

Several subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor-3 have been shown to bind the apical half of domain III of the 5′-NCR (18Sizova D.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Buratti E. Tisminetzky S. Zotti M. Baralle F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3179-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Notable among the non-canonical translation initiation factors that regulate the viral IRES elements are the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and La antigen (for review, see Ref. 19Krecic A., M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). PTB (p57 or hnRNP-1) has been shown to exist as a homodimer in solution and presents an oligomeric array of eight RNA recognition motifs (four in each monomer) (20Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Structural analysis suggests that PTB possesses unusual features of RNP-1 and RNP-2 motifs within its RNA recognition motifs (35Conte M.R. Grune T. Ghuman J. Kelly G. Ladas A. Mathews S. Curry S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3132-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The protein binds polypyrimidine tract near the 3′-splice site of many introns and can act as a repressor of splicing (21Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, PTB has been shown to physically interact with viral and cellular 5′-NCRs (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kaminski A. Hunt S.H. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J.

Furthermore, it has been shown to facilitate translation directed by picornaviral IRES elements in the rabbit reticulocyte translation system (22Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hellen C.U.T. Witherell G.W. Schmid M. Shin S.H. Pestova T.V. Gil A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The overexpression of PTB was recently shown to have a considerable stimulatory effect on translation directed by IRES elements derived from hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, and HCV in different types of cells (24Gosert R. Chang K.H. Rijnbrand R. Yi M. Sangar D.V. Lemon S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have previously shown interaction of PTB with the HCV 5′-NCR at multiple sites using a UV cross-linking assay (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ito and Lai (33Ito T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1999; 254: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an additional PTB-binding site at the end of the core coding region that appears to have a regulatory effect on the HCV IRES activity. Our immunodepletion experiment suggested that PTB or PTB-associated factors may be required for the HCV IRES function (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to address the biological requirement of PTB for the HCV IRES function using high affinity SELEX (sytematic evolution of ligands byexponential enrichment) RNA ligands. Here, we demonstrate that the SELEX RNA ligands raised against human PTB specifically interfered with HCV IRES-directed translation under conditions in which cap-dependent translation of the in vitrotranscribed RNA or naturally capped BMV RNA was unaffected. The PTB requirement for HCV IRES function was established by schemes of RNA cotransfections and add-back experiments. RNA transcripts were synthesizedin vitro from linearized plasmid DNA that was purified by elution of the desired fragments from agarose gels after digestion with an appropriate restriction endonuclease. The plasmids pT7C1-341 and pT7DC1-341 (6Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were linearized by HpaI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase to produce HCV 5′-NCR-containing monocistronic luciferase reporter and dicistronic mRNAs, respectively. The plasmids encoding SELEX 53.3, 63.1, and 63.6 or the pGEM-4 vector were linearized with HindIII or EcoRI, respectively, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Capped T7DC1-341 was synthesized in the presence of the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue using an Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies Corp.). The transcripts were visualized on formaldehyde-agarose gel, and the concentrations were determined. The plasmid GST-2TK/PTB, which encodes GST-human PTB fusion protein (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. M. A. Garcia-Blanco. The expression of GST-PTB was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in Escherichia coli (JM101) and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final preparation was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. GST was also purified by a similar procedure and used as a control. 4-Thio-UDP (Sigma) was phosphorylated with nucleoside-5′-diphosphate kinase to prepare 4-thio-UTP. The SELEX RNA probes synthesized in the presence of 4-thio-UTP and [32P]CTP were incubated with the purified PTB or translation lysates at 30 °C for 30 min in RNA binding buffer as described previously (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UV cross-linking was carried out in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) for 30 min at 4 °C. The ribonucleoprotein complexes were treated with RNase A (10–20 units; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and analyzed by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The immunoprecipitation assay was carried out with the UV-cross-linked product(s) between SELEX RNA probe and translation lysates using polyclonal anti-PTB antibodies or normal human IgG (control) (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of template RNA (T7C1-341) was translated in the presence of varying amounts (1–5 μg) of SELEX RNAs, and the proteins were radiolabeled with Tran35S-label (ICN). The reaction was carried out for 1.5 h at 30 °C, and luciferase activity was assayed from a 2-μl aliquot as described by de Wet (23de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Two-microliter translation reactions were subjected to SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were treated with Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International Corp.), dried, and used for phosphoimage analysis (Bio-Rad) and autoradiography. During the PTB add-back experiments, varying amounts of purified recombinant GST-PTB (1–5 μg) or GST (control) were added to the translation reactions containing 5 μg of SELEX RNA. Translation of capped T7DC1-341 was carried out using 10 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRLs), 2 μl of HeLa initiation factors (37Barton D.J. Morasco B.J. Flanegan J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), 1 μl of [35S]methionine, 1 μl of amino acid mixture without methionine, and 20 units of RNasin in a total volume of 25 μl for 1 h at 30 °C. Translation was carried out in the absence (control) or presence of varying amounts of SELEX 53.3. A liver-derived cell line (Huh7) was used for the cotransfection assay. The cells were transfected within vitro transcribed T7C1-341 RNA (1 μg) using the Lipofectin transfection protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). To demonstrate the inhibitory activity of SELEX RNA on HCV IRES-controlled translation, the cells were directly cotransfected with T7C1-341 RNA along with SELEX 53.3. An RNA derived from the pGEM-4 multiple cloning site served as a control during similar cotransfection experiments. Each experiment was repeated three to four times to confirm the results. Luciferase activity was assayed as described above. Sequence analysis of the HCV 5′-NCR identified three putative polypyrimidine tracts: Py-I (UCACCUCCCCUGU, nucleotides 37–48), Py-II (CCCCCCCUCCCGG, nucleotides 120–132), and Py-III (AUCCUUUCUUGG, nucleotides 191–202) (Fig.1 B) (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three polypyrimidine tracts appear to contain the core of the PTB consensus binding site (CYYYYCYYYY(G/Y)G, where Y is pyrimidine) that was identified by the SELEX procedure (Fig. 1 B) (21Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We previously reported the interaction between PTB and the HCV IRES at three distinct domains, each of which harbors one of the three polypyrimidine tracts (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the biological significance of such unusual binding, we demonstrated dramatic reduction in the HCV IRES activity in HeLa and rabbit reticulocyte translation lysates that were immunodepleted of PTB (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study, Lemon and co-workers (24Gosert R. Chang K.H. Rijnbrand R. Yi M. Sangar D.V. Lemon S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that PTB contributes to the HCV IRES activity. This was demonstrated by the dicistronic expression vector containing human PTB and the HCV IRES-driven reporter gene in BS-C-1 and Huh7 cells. The presence of multiple PTB consensus binding sites within the HCV IRES and their interaction with PTB, including the functional assays described above, argue for a role of PTB in HCV RNA translation. However, Kaminski et al. (25Kaminski A. Hunt S.H. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar) observed that PTB depletion from HeLa lysates passed through an encephalomyocarditis virus RNA (nucleotides 277–450 of the genome) affinity column permitted the translation of HCV or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus 5′-NCR-linked reporter RNAs. This observation argued against the role of PTB during translation of either HCV RNA or a member of the picornavirus family (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus), both of which are known to bind PTB efficiently (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kaminski A. Hunt S.H. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar). Since PTB has been shown to exist in many different isoforms, such a PTB depletion approach does not preclude the possible role(s) of PTB isoforms and their associated protein(s) or unknown substitute(s) in the lysates that may not recognize one or other types of viral RNA segments used during similar PTB depletion experiments. Furthermore, these studies were carried out in RRLs and require more physiologically relevant systems such as cultured cells in which PTB is inactivated. Here, we employed an alternative approach to establish the requirement of PTB. We used SELEX strategy to sequester PTB during the active translation process. A similar approach has been successfully used to clarify conflicting issues on the role of PTB during regulation of RNA splicing (21Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Three SELEX RNAs (63.1, 63.6, and 53.3), all of which harbor similar PTB consensus binding motif(s) but differ in their overall base composition (Fig. 1 B), were used during the translation assays. These SELEX RNAs were shown to bind human PTB with high affinity (K d ∼ 1–10 nm) (21Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The SELEX binding to PTB in the translation lysates used during these studies was confirmed by UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). HCV IRES-luciferase RNA (T7C1-341), in which the HCV IRES directs translation of the luciferase reporter gene, was translated in RRLs either in the absence or presence of varying amounts of SELEX RNAs. The resulting luciferase activity was assayed, and the protein bands were visualized by autoradiography (Fig.2 A). All of the SELEX RNAs were found to be inhibitory for the HCV IRES activity. However, the extent of inhibition for each SELEX RNA was variable. For example, SELEX 53.3 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of the HCV IRES activity (compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3–5). This differential inhibitory ability of the SELEX RNAs could be due to the differences in sequence composition and their affinity for PTB. An unrelated RNA of similar length and stability that was derived from a pGEM-4 vector failed to inhibit IRES activity at a higher concentration (lane 9). To further confirm the specificity of inhibition by SELEX 53.3, naturally 5′-capped BMV RNAs were translated as described above. The BMV RNA preparation consists of at least three capped RNAs that are translated into four viral proteins, 1a (110 kDa), 2a (97 kDa), 3a (35 kDa), and the coat protein (20 kDa). As shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 5–7), the translation of these RNAs was not significantly affected in the presence of SELEX molecules. However, the HCV IRES activity was dramatically inhibited under these conditions (lanes 2and3). In a control experiment, the SELEX RNA was also found to be an effective inhibitor of the polioviral IRES (data not shown). The ability of SELEX RNA to inhibit the HCV IRES activity was also tested in the context of a capped dicistronic mRNA (T7DC1-341). The upstream cistron (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) of this mRNA is translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas the translation of the downstream luciferase coding region is dictated by the HCV IRES (6Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capped dicistronic RNA was translated in a reticulocyte translation system supplemented with HeLa S100 lysates enriched in cellular factors including La antigen and other canonical translation initiation factors. In this system, cap-dependent translation and HCV IRES-driven translation occur efficiently (38Ali N. Pruijn G.J.M. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Siddiqui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27531-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Translation was carried out in the presence (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3–5) or absence (lane 2) of increasing amounts of SELEX RNA. SELEX inhibited HCV IRES-driven translation of the luciferase (65–70%; lane 5), but had little or no effect on cap-dependent translation (lanes 3–5) under these conditions. These observations further reiterate specific inhibition of the HCV IRES function by SELEX RNA without affecting cap-dependent translation. A likely explanation for the SELEX RNA-based inhibition of the HCV IRES demonstrated above is that the SELEX molecules could sequester PTB in the translation lysates with high affinity (Fig. 2), rendering PTB unable to support the HCV IRES activity. In this case, the PTB requirement may be due to its direct interaction with the 5′-NCR and/or its indirect inhibition of the interaction of other proteins needed for the IRES function. One such example is the known PTB-binding protein hnRNP L, which has been shown to bind the 3′-boundary of the HCV IRES (26Hahm B. Cho O.H. Kim J.-E. Kim Y.K. Kim J.H. Oh Y.L. Jang S.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Hahm B. Kim Y.K Kim J.H. Kim T.Y. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8782-8788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding was shown to correlate with HCV IRES efficiency (27Hahm B. Kim Y.K Kim J.H. Kim T.Y. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8782-8788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In either case, the addition of an excess amount of recombinant PTB should rescue the efficiency of the HCV IRES that was inhibited by SELEX RNA molecules during translation. To test this hypothesis, an add-back experiment was carried out in which purified GST-human PTB was added to translation lysates containing HCV IRES-luciferase RNA and an excess amount of the SELEX RNA inhibitory for translation (Fig.3, lane 3). Interestingly, the inhibition was considerably relieved by the supplemented GST-PTB in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6). However, the addition of similar amounts of GST protein failed to rescue the HCV IRES activity (lanes 7 and 8). These results clearly demonstrate a direct involvement of PTB during HCV IRES-controlled translation initiation. Next, we investigated the PTB requirement for the HCV IRES activity in vivo using SELEX 53.3, which displayed the highest inhibitory ability during thein vitro translation assay (Fig. 2 A). A liver-derived cell line (Huh7) that expresses PTB at levels similar to those expressed by the widely used HeLa cell line (24Gosert R. Chang K.H. Rijnbrand R. Yi M. Sangar D.V. Lemon S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with HCV IRES-luciferase RNA along with varying amounts of SELEX 53.3. The pattern of HCV IRES-mediated translation is shown in Fig. 4. The HCV IRES activity was inhibited by the SELEX RNA in a dose-dependent manner. However, an unrelated RNA failed to inhibit IRES activity even at higher concentrations during the cotransfection experiment. Consistent results were obtained during several transfection assays. These data together provide further evidence that the HCV IRES requires PTB for efficient translation initiation in vivo. There is a growing body of evidence that supports the biological significance of non-canonical translation factors in the regulation of viral IRES-mediated translation initiation (15Ali N.

The SELEX RNA-based strategy has been shown to be highly effective in demonstrating diverse functions of target proteins involved in complex biological pathways, including that of La antigen (21Singh R.

An additional advantage of using SELEX RNA is that it may not interfere with the nuclear functions of its target protein during transient transfection assays similar to that used in this study. We employed SELEX RNA technology to establish the functional requirement of PTB during HCV IRES-controlled translation initiation. The results presented here strongly suggest that SELEX RNA raised against PTB attenuates the HCV IRES activity most probably by sequestering cellular PTB in Huh7 cells or translation lysates. Thus, a direct interaction of PTB with the 5′-NCR that might be an essential ritual during recruitment of the 43 S initiation complex to the HCV IRES in vivo is prevented. In addition to this requirement, PTB interaction may also facilitate recruitment of its cellular partners such as hnRNP L or other proteins that may be needed for the assembly of an initiation complex. In either case, PTB binding to the 5′-NCR appears to have important biological consequences on translation of the HCV RNA. The molecular mechanism(s) of the PTB requirement during internal initiation of translation of the HCV RNA is not known. Available evidence suggests a physical interaction of PTB with the following: (i) multiple structural domains of the HCV 5′-NCR (15Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) an internal polypyrimidine-rich motif at the 3′-end of the core coding sequence (33Ito T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1999; 254: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and (iii) a region near the end of the HCV genome (within the 3′-NCR) (28Ito T. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8698-8706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tsuchihara K. Tanaka T. Hijikata M. Kuge S. Toyoda H. Nomoto A. Yamamoto N. Shimotohno K. J.

Vecchio A.M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these viralcis-elements appear to bind PTB with different affinities. These differential kinetics may play critical role(s) in regulating the HCV IRES activity (33Ito T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1999; 254: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Another important feature of PTB is its intrinsic ability to homodimerize and/or multimerize in solution (20Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because of these unusual features, it is tempting to speculate a plausible role of PTB in establishing a dialogue between the 5′- and 3′-NCRs by bringing the ends in close proximity. Such RNA topology is now believed to be a prerequisite for an efficient translation initiation process (31Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). PTB may also function as a molecular chaperon because of its ability to bind multiple domains within the 5′-NCR. These interactions were found to be independent of La antigen, 2N. Ali and A. Siddiqui, unpublished data. which binds the initiator AUG codon of the HCV RNA in the context of an ordered structure (16Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recently, Kieft et al. (45Kieft J.S. Zhou K. Jubin R. Murray M.G. Lau J.Y.N. Doudna J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) demonstrated functionally relevant ion-dependent tertiary folds of the HCV IRES. In light of these observations, it appears that these non-canonical translation initiation factors including PTB might be required for the stabilization of IRES conformation(s) in vivo. Amid all these possibilities, the requirement of PTB for efficient HCV IRES activity is unambiguously supported by the data presented here. Because PTB binds to the 3′-NCR, which functions as the assembly site for the preinitiation replication complex, the SELEX strategy has the potential to reveal its role during (−)-strand synthesis. How PTB affects the HCV IRES activity and RNA replication via its interaction with the 5′- and 3′-NCRs is the subject of future investigation. We thank Drs. David Barton (of this institution) for HeLa lysates and Ravinder Singh (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) for plasmids encoding SELEX RNA against PTB."

Following extended training sessions, Adf1 mutants show normal early memory but defective longterm memory. Adf1 shows widespread spatiotemporal expression, yet mutant alleles reveal no discernible disruptions in gross morphology of the nervous system. Studies at the larval neuromuscular junction, however, reveal a role for Adf1 in the modulation of synaptic growth-in contrast to the role established for dCREB2 in the control of synaptic function (Davis et al., 1996). These findings suggest that Adf1 and dCREB2 regulate distinct transcriptional cascades involved in terminal stages of synapse maturation. More generally, Adf1 provides a novel link between molecular mechanisms of developmental and behavioral plasticity."

Like SMC, MUC4 may also exist as two subunits: a mucin type unit known as MUC4α and a growth factor-like transmembrane subunit, MUC4β. The expression of MUC4 in normal human pancreas is not detectable, but it is highly expressed in pancreatic tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of MUC4 expression in human pancreatic tumor cells CD18/HPAF, exhibiting a high level of MUC4 transcripts and protein. When these cells were adapted to grow in the serum-free medium (CD18/HPAF-SF), the MUC4 expression was undetectable. Among several serum constituents, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) induced the expression of MUC4 transcripts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The RA-mediated increase in the level of the MUC4 transcript coincided with an increased expression of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) transcript. The antagonist of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-α (Ro41–5253) abrogated the expression of MUC4 and TGF-β2 induced by RA. The exogenous addition of TGF-β2 also increased the MUC4expression. The TGF-β-neutralizing antibody blocked the RA-induced as well as TGF-β2-mediated MUC4expression. In conclusion, induction of MUC4expression in pancreatic carcinoma by RA is mediated through the RAR-α signaling pathway, and TGF-β2 may serve as an interim mediator of this regulated expression.

The NH2 terminus of MUC4 is composed of a 27-residue signal peptide and a large domain, varying in length from 3285 to 7285 amino acid residues due to variable number of tandem repeats. The COOH terminus of MUC4 encodes 1156-residue peptide and includes two cysteine-rich domains, three epidermal growth factor-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and two regions rich in potential N-glycosylation sites. The MUC4 mucin is considered the homologue of rat sialomucin complex (SMC, rat Muc4) due to its structural organization; however, rat Muc4 lacks the tandem repeat domain containing 16-residue repetitive units, the identifying feature of MUC4 (25Rossi E.A.

So far, no data on MUC4 protein expression are available because of the unavailability of MUC4-specific monoclonal antibodies.

In the present study, we investigated RA-mediated increase of MUC4 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line CD18/HPAF. We demonstrated that the RA not only increases the MUC4transcript and protein levels, but also theTGF-β2 transcript. These events were inhibited by a retinoid that functions as RAR-α antagonist. Treatment with TGF-β2 increased MUC4 expression, demonstrating a linkage of MUC4 with the TGF-β2-signaling pathway. Moreover, the addition of an antibody against the TGF-β, which immunoneutralized the secreted TGF-β2, completely abrogated the effect of RA and TGF-β2 onMUC4 expression. These findings provide evidence that RA induces MUC4 through an RAR-α-dependent pathway, and the increase in MUC4 expression by RA requires activation of the TGF-β2 pathway by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. The following materials were purchased: fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, trypsin solution, and penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.); Genescreen nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); restriction enzymes and TGF-β2 EmaxTMenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Promega, Madison, WI); random primed labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); TGF-β2 and TGF-β1 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN); Vectastain universal ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA); RA, mouse IgG1, κ (MOPC 21) (Sigma); mouse hybridoma (1D11.16.8) producing TGF-β antibodies (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The CD18/HPAF pancreatic tumor cells used in the study were derived from the parental heterogenous HPAF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (46Kim Y.W. Kern H.F. Mullins T.D. Koriwchak M.J. Metzgar R.S. Pancreas. 1989; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CD18/HPAF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. These tumor cells were slowly selected for growth in a serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus F-12 nutrient mixture; 1:1 ratio) by gradually decreasing the serum content in the medium at each passage. The tumor cells that are adapted to grow in a serum free medium were named CD18/HPAF-SF. These selected cells were frozen until needed. Once the cell line was thawed, the cells were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus F-12 nutrient mixture containing penicillin and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) for 15 days. CD18/HPAF-SF cells were incubated in a serum-free medium alone or with RA (1 nm to 20 μm), Ro41–5253, TGF-β2, anti-TGF-β antibody (IgG1), MOPC 21 antibody (IgG1) alone or in combination. The working dilution of RA was made from 100 mm stock in Me2SO, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2; stocks were reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA from the tumor cells was isolated by guanidine isothiocyanate cesium chloride cushion ultracentrifugation. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with a solution containing 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate, 0.05 m sodium acetate, and 250 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Total RNA was recovered via sedimentation through a 5.7 m CsCl in 0.025m sodium acetate cushion in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 18 h. RNA pellets were resuspended in 0.3 m sodium acetate and precipitated with ethanol. Total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.66 mformaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose via capillary blotting. The cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit and were separated from the free label by sephadex G-50 column chromatography. Prehybridization and hybridization of blots were carried out in a solution of 5× SSPE, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 200 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and a minimum of 106 cpm/ml of probe at 42 °C for 18 h. Blots were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, followed by four washes with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The cDNA probes used in this analysis were a 500-bp humanMUC4 and 780-bp human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH ). The MUC4 cDNA clone was isolated from the HPAF cDNA library that contains 10 complete tandem repeat units (AF177925). It shares a 98% similarity with the published MUC4 tandem repeat sequence (5Porchet N. Nguyen V.C. Dufosse J. Audie J.P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Gross M.S. Denis C. Degand P. Bernheim A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). TheGAPDH probe has 31 bp of 5′-untranslated region and the region coding the first 250 amino acid residues of the protein. Expression of the MUC4 mRNA was quantified by densitometry of autoradiograms using the ImageQuant software program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The MUC4 signal on the Northern blot appears as a smear. Each sample measurement was calculated as the ratio of the average areas betweenMUC4-specific smear and 1.3 kilobase pairsGAPDH band in the linear range of the autoradiogram as reported earlier (29Hollingsworth M.A. Strawhecker J.M. Caffrey T.C. Mack D.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The subconfluent monolayer of cells cultured in eight-chambered slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) was used for the immunohistochemical analysis. After the monolayer was washed, cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone and methanol mixture (1:1) for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed on the fixed cells with the Vectastain universal ABC kit. The cell monolayer was blocked with normal blocking serum for 1 h. Following blocking, the samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with either anti-MUC4 rabbit antiserum raised against 16-amino acid tandem repeat (Ser-Thr-Gly-Asp-Thr-Thr-Pro-Leu-Pro-Val-Thr-Asp-Thr-Ser-Ser-Val) peptide or preimmune rabbit serum serving as a negative control. To block the positive staining, the primary test antisera (1:100 dilution) were incubated with different concentrations of tandem repeat peptide ranging from 100 through 0.001 mg/ml and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies). The cells were incubated with ABC reagent for 30 min followed by treatment with peroxidase substrate solution until the desired stain intensity was developed. Total RNA (0.5 μg) from the CD18/HPAF cells and the control normal tissues was reverse transcribed using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each target gene was co-amplified with the sameGAPDH primers. Amplifications were performed in a programmable thermal controller (PTC-100, MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). PCR amplification reactions were conducted in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 5 μl of 10× PerkinElmer buffer, 5 μl of 10 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2 μl of first strand pancreatic cell line cDNA, 5 μl of 25 mmMgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, and 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Ampli Taq Gold; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mixture was denatured at 96 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The final elongation step was extended for an additional 15 min. The sequence of the PCR product was confirmed by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method. The positive controls for the various mucin genes were as follows: forMUC1 and MUC4, HPAF/CD18; for MUC6, the normal pancreas; for MUC2 and MUC3, the small intestine; for MUC5AC and -B, the trachea; and for MUC7, salivary gland (3Gum Jr., J.R.

PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and scanned on a Nucleo VisionTM 760 Imaging Workstation. Amplified products were quantified for each sample using the gel expertTM 3.5 software suite (Nucleotech Corporation, San Mateo, CA). The densitometric values were calculated for gene-specific product and GAPDH for each reaction. The value for the mucin gene-specific product is expressed per unit of GAPDH to account for any differences in starting amounts of RNA. The lowest densitometric value (weakest band) for GAPDH is taken as a unit. For convenience, the corrected densitometric scores for different products were categorized in three different ranges: high (+++), moderate (++), and weak (+). Each value was determined as the mean of four densitometry readings.Table IPrimers used for PCR amplificationGene productGenBank™ No.Sequence 1-aF, forward; R, reverse amplification primer.Amplicon sizeReferencesbpMUC1J05582F: GAACTACGGGCAGCTGGACATC4472Lan M.S.

In the developing fetus, however, Nkx6.1 is initially expressed in almost all the epithelial cells of the pancreatic buds. Starting around embryonic day 13 (E13), Nkx6.1 expression becomes restricted to β-cells and β-cell precursors (13Oster A. Jensen J. Serup P. Galante P. Madsen O.D. Larsson L.I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the nkx6.1 gene causes a severe defect in β-cell differentiation in mice. The nkx6.1 null mutants have normal numbers of insulin-expressing cells through E12.5, but new β-cell formation is blocked after E12.5. Hence, Nkx6.1 is a necessary component of the signals triggering the major wave of β-cell differentiation and proliferation after E12.5. 1M. Sander, L. Sussel, J. Conners, J. Kalamaras, F. DelaCruz, V. Schwitzgebel, A. Hays-Jordan, and M. S. German, submitted for publication.1M. Sander, L. Sussel, J. Conners, J. Kalamaras, F. DelaCruz, V. Schwitzgebel, A. Hays-Jordan, and M. S. German, submitted for publication. Nkx6.1 functions at one step in the hierarchy of transcription factors controlling pancreatic development and differentiation. Although Nkx6.1 represses the transcription of target genes (14Mirmira R.G. Watada H. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14743-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), its downstream genetic targets have not been identified. Upstream of Nkx6.1, two homeodomain transcription factors are known to control its pancreatic expression, Nkx2.2 in the fetal pancreas after E12.5 and PDX1 in adult β-cells (9Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these factors control Nkx6.1 expression and the potential roles of other factors are unknown.Control of cell type-specific gene expression frequently operates at the level of gene transcription, but post-transcriptional mechanisms including controls at the level of translation initiation may play essential roles as well. Generally, cap-dependent ribosomal scanning identifies translation start sites and initiates translation on the majority of cellular mRNAs. This process is severely hampered on long 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR)2 containing multiple upstream reading frames and secondary structure (16Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). Translation of such mRNAs may initiate through a cap-independent mechanism utilizing an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5′-UTR. Cellular mRNAs containing IRESs can be very specifically regulated, providing a post-transcriptional mechanism to control their expression (17Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 18van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By using this mechanism, the translation of a number of mammalian growth factor RNAs is specifically regulated during differentiation or cell growth (19Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Teerink H. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Furthermore, duringDrosophila embryonic development, the 5′-UTRs of mRNAs encoding homeodomain transcription factors Antp and Ubx are known to regulate protein expression in a spatio-temporal manner, although there are no reports of the existence of IRESs in any mammalian homeodomain transcription factor genes (23Oh S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Ye X. Fong P. Iizuka N. Choate D. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).To understand the mechanisms that regulate β-cell-specific expression of Nkx6.1, we outlined the structure of the mouse nkx6.1gene and identified a promoter that directs cell type-specific expression in β-cells. A promoter element found approximately 800 bp upstream of the transcription initiation sites contains binding sites for Nkx2.2 and PDX1 and functions as an important transcriptional enhancer. In addition, a potent IRES in the 5′-UTR further restricts Nkx6.1 expression to β-cells. These findings establish that gene regulation through an IRES plays a similar role in development of the mammalian pancreatic islet as in Drosophila development.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the nkx6.1promoter and mapped a region involved in its cell type-specific expression. In addition, we found that the expression of Nkx6.1 also is controlled at the post-transcriptional level, and an IRES in the 5′-UTR plays an important role in directing its expression to islet cells.Like many transcription factor genes, the 5′-flanking region of the mouse nkx6.1 gene lacks a classic TATA box. The TATA box is typically located 30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site and helps specify the transcription initiation site by directing the binding of TFIID. Characteristic of genes that lack TATA boxes, thenkx6.1 gene has multiple transcription initiation sites as mapped by 5′-RACE and RNase protection assay. Also characteristic of TATA-less genes, the transcription initiation sites lie just downstream of two CCAAT boxes, at least one of which is functional in both islet and non-islet cells.Complex interactions among a number of transcription factors control the temporal expression of genes during the development of the pancreas. Tight control over the temporal and spatial expression of these factors is essential for proper development of the endocrine cells. Nkx6.1 is expressed in at least three different cell types during mouse pancreatic development as follows: initial broad expression in the epithelial cells that compose the dorsal and ventral buds, restricted expression after embryonic day 13 in islet cell precursors, and finally in mature β-cells. Studies of mice that lack an intact nkx2.2 gene demonstrate that Nkx2.2 is required for Nkx6.1 expression in the pancreas after E13; specific inactivation of the pdx-1 gene in insulin-expressing cells demonstrates that PDX-1 is required for maintaining Nkx6.1 expression in differentiated β-cells (9Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K.

It can be concluded from these prior studies that Nkx6.1 expression is regulated directly or indirectly by these two factors. The promoter studies reported here support the conclusion that both factors drive Nkx6.1 expression directly, by binding to the nkx6.1 gene promoter.Although there are several binding sites for Nkx2.2 and PDX-1 in the proximal Nkx6.1 promoter, only the sites located at −800 are required for expression specifically in the β-cell line. The more proximal sites may also contribute, but removal of more proximal sequences affects expression in NIH3T3 cells as well. The presence of binding sites for both factors in the β-cell-specific enhancer located at −800 bp is intriguing given the essential role of both factors in Nkx6.1 expression. Despite the juxtaposed binding sites, however, Nkx2.2 does not activate the β-cell-specific enhancer even in the presence of co-expressed PDX-1.We recently found that Nkx2.2 by itself cannot activate transcription even from a construct with 7 tandem repeats of an ideal Nkx2.2-binding site. The NK2 domain just downstream of the homeodomain in Nkx2.2 inhibits the activation domain, and some modification of the NK2-specific domain may be required to allow Nkx2.2 to activate transcription (30Watada H. Mirmira G.H. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When Nkx2.2 is overexpressed as in the co-transfection experiments reported here, the non-islet cells may lack specific modifiers of the NK2 domain, or the capacity of the cells to modify the NK2 domain may be exceeded. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that Nkx2.2 cooperates with PDX1 in regulating the Nkx6.1 promoter in the normal cellular context.In addition, a different array of factors may control Nkx6.1 expression at different points in development. The cells used for these experiments are probably more representative of mature β-cells than undifferentiated pancreatic epithelial cells or islet cell progenitors. During the differentiation of islet cells in the fetal mouse pancreas, the islet cell progenitors transiently express the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor neurogenin3 prior to further maturation and expression of PDX-1 (34Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these early neurogenin3-expressing cells co-express Nkx6.1, but not PDX-1, demonstrating that cells at this stage in differentiation do not require PDX-1 for Nkx6.1 expression (34Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other homeodomain proteins capable of binding to the TAAT sites or other factors such as HNF6 (35Jacquemin P. Durviaux S.M. Jensen J. Godfraind C. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Madsen O.D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) may fill the PDX-1 role at this stage.In addition to controls at the level of the promoter, expression from the nkx6.1 gene is regulated by its long, complex 5′-UTR, which has similarities to the 5′-UTRs found in someDrosophila homeobox genes. For example, ubxcontains a 968-bp 5′-UTR and 2 upstream ATGs, and antpcontains a 1735-bp 5′-UTR and 15 upstream ATGs. Both of these 5′-UTRs contain IRESs that promote developmentally regulated translation. Similarly, the nkx6.1 5′-UTR functions as an IRES; while it can function in all the cells types tested, its activity is significantly higher in islet cell lines. These results demonstrate that the IRES activity of the nkx6.1 5′-UTR shows cell type specificity. In addition, the 5′-UTR also inhibits transcription in the NIH3T3 cells, but not in islet cells, in a position-independent fashion. Taken together, the 5′-UTR contributes significantly to the cell type-specific expression of Nkx6.1.The identified functions of the 5′-UTR, however, cannot completely explain the differences in expression of Nkx6.1 between α- and β-cell lines. No Nkx6.1 protein can be detected in α-cell lines, despite the presence of nkx6.1 mRNA, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation of Nkx6.1 expression contributes to its restriction from α-cells. Although the IRES in the 5′-UTR provides a mechanism for cell type-specific translation of nkx6.1mRNA, the activity of the IRES is similar in αTC1 cells and β-TC3 cells. It is possible that in the context of the intact gene, the IRES may function in a more tightly restricted fashion, or other posttranscriptional mechanisms must play additional roles in the cell type-specific expression of Nkx6.1.It should be noted that further controls provide additional limits on the function of Nkx6.1 once the protein is expressed. When it binds to target genes, Nkx6.1 is a potent transcriptional repressor; but a sequence in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule prevents DNA binding by the homeodomain (14Mirmira R.G. Watada H. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14743-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Presumably only when this binding inhibition is relieved by interactions provided in the appropriate cellular environment can Nkx6.1 then turn off target genes. Together, several layers of regulation ensure that gene targeting bynkx6.1 is tightly restricted temporally and spatially. The development and differentiation of organs like the pancreas require the coordinate activation of unique sets of transcription factors (1Sander M. German M.S. J. Mol.

Among the known pancreatic transcription factors, the homeodomain factor Nkx6.1 is unique in its absolute restriction in the mature pancreas to the β-cells. In the developing fetus, however, Nkx6.1 is initially expressed in almost all the epithelial cells of the pancreatic buds. Starting around embryonic day 13 (E13), Nkx6.1 expression becomes restricted to β-cells and β-cell precursors (13Oster A. Jensen J. Serup P. Galante P. Madsen O.D. Larsson L.I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the nkx6.1 gene causes a severe defect in β-cell differentiation in mice. The nkx6.1 null mutants have normal numbers of insulin-expressing cells through E12.5, but new β-cell formation is blocked after E12.5. Hence, Nkx6.1 is a necessary component of the signals triggering the major wave of β-cell differentiation and proliferation after E12.5. 1M. Sander, L. Sussel, J. Conners, J. Kalamaras, F. DelaCruz, V. Schwitzgebel, A. Hays-Jordan, and M. S. German, submitted for publication.1M. Sander, L. Sussel, J. Conners, J. Kalamaras, F. DelaCruz, V. Schwitzgebel, A. Hays-Jordan, and M. S. German, submitted for publication. Nkx6.1 functions at one step in the hierarchy of transcription factors controlling pancreatic development and differentiation. Although Nkx6.1 represses the transcription of target genes (14Mirmira R.G. Watada H. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14743-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), its downstream genetic targets have not been identified. Upstream of Nkx6.1, two homeodomain transcription factors are known to control its pancreatic expression, Nkx2.2 in the fetal pancreas after E12.5 and PDX1 in adult β-cells (9Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these factors control Nkx6.1 expression and the potential roles of other factors are unknown. Control of cell type-specific gene expression frequently operates at the level of gene transcription, but post-transcriptional mechanisms including controls at the level of translation initiation may play essential roles as well. Generally, cap-dependent ribosomal scanning identifies translation start sites and initiates translation on the majority of cellular mRNAs. This process is severely hampered on long 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR)2 containing multiple upstream reading frames and secondary structure (16Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). Translation of such mRNAs may initiate through a cap-independent mechanism utilizing an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5′-UTR. Cellular mRNAs containing IRESs can be very specifically regulated, providing a post-transcriptional mechanism to control their expression (17Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 18van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By using this mechanism, the translation of a number of mammalian growth factor RNAs is specifically regulated during differentiation or cell growth (19Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Teerink H. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Furthermore, duringDrosophila embryonic development, the 5′-UTRs of mRNAs encoding homeodomain transcription factors Antp and Ubx are known to regulate protein expression in a spatio-temporal manner, although there are no reports of the existence of IRESs in any mammalian homeodomain transcription factor genes (23Oh S.K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Ye X. Fong P. Iizuka N. Choate D. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms that regulate β-cell-specific expression of Nkx6.1, we outlined the structure of the mouse nkx6.1gene and identified a promoter that directs cell type-specific expression in β-cells. A promoter element found approximately 800 bp upstream of the transcription initiation sites contains binding sites for Nkx2.2 and PDX1 and functions as an important transcriptional enhancer. In addition, a potent IRES in the 5′-UTR further restricts Nkx6.1 expression to β-cells. These findings establish that gene regulation through an IRES plays a similar role in development of the mammalian pancreatic islet as in Drosophila development. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized the nkx6.1promoter and mapped a region involved in its cell type-specific expression. In addition, we found that the expression of Nkx6.1 also is controlled at the post-transcriptional level, and an IRES in the 5′-UTR plays an important role in directing its expression to islet cells.Like many transcription factor genes, the 5′-flanking region of the mouse nkx6.1 gene lacks a classic TATA box. The TATA box is typically located 30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site and helps specify the transcription initiation site by directing the binding of TFIID. Characteristic of genes that lack TATA boxes, thenkx6.1 gene has multiple transcription initiation sites as mapped by 5′-RACE and RNase protection assay. Also characteristic of TATA-less genes, the transcription initiation sites lie just downstream of two CCAAT boxes, at least one of which is functional in both islet and non-islet cells.Complex interactions among a number of transcription factors control the temporal expression of genes during the development of the pancreas. Tight control over the temporal and spatial expression of these factors is essential for proper development of the endocrine cells. Nkx6.1 is expressed in at least three different cell types during mouse pancreatic development as follows: initial broad expression in the epithelial cells that compose the dorsal and ventral buds, restricted expression after embryonic day 13 in islet cell precursors, and finally in mature β-cells. Studies of mice that lack an intact nkx2.2 gene demonstrate that Nkx2.2 is required for Nkx6.1 expression in the pancreas after E13; specific inactivation of the pdx-1 gene in insulin-expressing cells demonstrates that PDX-1 is required for maintaining Nkx6.1 expression in differentiated β-cells (9Sussel L.

These compounds represent the first examples of H. pylori-specific antibacterial agents. Cellular activity within this structural class appears to be due to dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibition. Minor structural changes that abrogate in vitro inhibition of the enzyme likewise eliminate cellular activity. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these compounds increase upon addition of orotate to the culture medium in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibition as the mechanism of cellular inhibition. The data presented here suggest that targeted inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis may be a valuable mechanism for the development of antimicrobial agents selective for H. pylori.

Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 926-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the U. S. alone some 80 million people are infected with H. pylori, and a significant portion of those infected will go on to present clinical symptoms of gastric diseases. Worldwide, the rate of H. pylori infection varies from 25 to >75% of the population, depending on sanitation levels and other socioeconomic factors (2Blaser M.J. Br. Med. J. 1998; 316: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Treatment of gastric ulcers was largely based simply on the amelioration of symptoms until the recognition of the causal relationship between H. pylori infection and disease. Eradication of the infection is now the standard of care for these diseases, and a battery of antibacterial agents, in combination with symptom-relieving drugs, has been used to treat H. pyloriinfections. The antibacterials in current clinical use are far from ideal; drawbacks to their use include side effects associated with eradication of beneficial gastrointestinal flora. The widespread use of these antibacterials for treatment of general bacterial infections has generated resistant strains of H. pylori in patient populations. The phenomenon of genetic exchange between H. pylori and other prokaryotes has also been observed, providing an additional potential route to antibacterial resistance (3Suerbaum S. Smith J. Bapumia K. Morelli G. Smith N. Kunstmann E. Dyrek I. Achtman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12619-12624Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Many of these difficulties could be minimized by using agents that were highly selective against H. pylori. The complete genomes of two strains of H. pylori have recently been reported (4Tomb J. White O. Kerlavage A. Clayton R. Sutton G. Fleischmann R. Ketchum K. Klenk H. Gill S. Dougherty B. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou I. Kirkness E. Peterson S. Loftus B. Richardson D. Dodson R. Khalak H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Metabolic pathways for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and for purine salvage are clearly identifiable in these genomes. In striking contrasts, however, is the apparent absence in these genomes of key enzymes of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, common to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (TableI). The absence of these enzymes would make H. pylori critically dependent on de novopyrimidine biosynthesis for both growth and survival. Indeed biochemical data support the suggestion that de novosynthesis is the only route to pyrimidine accumulation for this organism (6Mendz G.L. Jimenez B.M. Hazell S.L. Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.M. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1994; 77: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data suggest that inhibition of one or more of the enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine pathway might be a particularly effective means of treating H. pyloriinfections. Owing to the presence of intact pyrimidine salvage pathways, other bacteria might be refractory to such treatments, thus making inhibitors of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis selective for H. pylori.Table IGenes of pyrimidine biosynthesis and salvage pathwaysGeneFunctionPresence inH. pylori genomes 1-aA positive symbol (+) indicates the presence of the indicated gene in both reported H. pylori genomes (4, 5).

Open table in a new tab We have exploited this unique metabolic feature of H. pylorito identify small molecules that selectively kill this bacterium without effect on human cells or other bacterial species. In this paper we report the first examples of H. pylori-selective antibacterial agents that function by inhibition of a key enzyme of thede novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase).1 H. pyloriand human DHODase were expressed as His6-tagged proteins (on the N and C termini of the protein, respectively) in a DHODase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified by a combination of nickel affinity and S-200 gel filtration chromatography, similar to the conditions reported previously for the enzyme from E. coli (8Marcinkeviciene J. Rogers M.J. Kopcho L. Jiang W. Wang K. Murphy D.J. Lippy J. Link S. Chung T.D.Y. Hobbs F. Haque T. Trainor G.L. Slee A. Stern A.M. Copeland R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The final enzyme samples in each case were >90% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining. Both enzymes were also produced without the His6 tag and displayed similar kinetics and inhibition as that reported here for the His-tagged versions. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli DHODase were expressed and purified as described previously (8Marcinkeviciene J. Rogers M.J. Kopcho L. Jiang W. Wang K. Murphy D.J. Lippy J. Link S. Chung T.D.Y.

Biophys. 2000; 377: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was measured with the DCIP assay described previously (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Marcinkeviciene J. Tinney L. Wang K. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13129-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assay conditions were as follows, except where indicated in the text and figure captions: 0.1m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm l-dihydroorotate (DHO), 0.1 mm coenzyme Q6 (Q6), 0.05 mm2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP), 0.1% Triton X-100. The final enzyme concentration in the assay was between 12 and 25 nm, depending on the enzyme source (i.e. human, H. pylori, etc.). In some experiments with the H. pylorienzyme, the water-soluble quinone coenzyme Q0 (0.03 mm) was used in place of coenzyme Q6, and the Triton X-100 detergent was eliminated from the assay buffer. Assays were run at 25 °C over a 5-min time window, where linear progress curves were observed. The reaction was followed at 600 nm using an extinction coefficient of 20,000m−1 cm−1for DCIP. Initial velocities were determined as the slopes of the progress curves at each condition (9Marcinkeviciene J. Tinney L. Wang K. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13129-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Marcinkeviciene J. Jiang W. Locke G. Kopcho L. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fractional activity of the enzymes in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors was measured relative to enzyme activity in the absence of inhibitor. Compounds were added to assay mixtures from concentrated stocks dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final Me2SO concentration in all assays (including control samples lacking inhibitor) was 1% (v/v). Four replicates were performed for each concentration of inhibitor, and these were averaged to define the fractional activity at each concentration. The entire inhibitor titration experiment was performed at least twice for each inhibitor described here. Plots of fractional activity as a function of inhibitor concentration were constructed, and the data fit to the equation for a standard Langmuir isotherm (12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar) or to Morrison's equation for tight binding inhibition (12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar, 13Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In either case, the apparentK i (IC50) was converted to the trueK i by assuming competitive inhibition with coenzyme Q6 (see below) and using the equation K i= IC50/(1 + [S]/K m) (12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar). Inhibitor modality was determined by measuring the effects of inhibitor concentration on the enzymatic velocity as a function of substrate concentration. In experiments where dihydroorotate (DHO) was the varied substrate, the coenzyme Q6 concentration was fixed at 100 μm, whereas the DHO concentration was held constant at 100 μm when coenzyme Q6 was the varied substrate. For each experiment a total of 20 combinations of substrate and inhibitor concentrations were fit globally to the appropriate equations for competitive (Equation 1), noncompetitive (Equation 2), and uncompetitive (Equation 3) inhibitor modalities (11Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar) using the computational method of Cleland (11Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). The choice of appropriate equation was made based on comparison of the variance, sigma values, and the magnitude of the standard errors associated with the fitted parameters for each equation, as described by Cleland (11Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar).v=Vmax[S][S]+Km1+[I]KiEquation 1 v=Vmax[S][S]1+[I]αKi+Km1+[I]KiEquation 2 v=Vmax[S][S]1+[I]αKi+KmEquation 3 where [S] and K m are the concentration and Michaelis constant of the varied substrate, respectively;K i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor-enzyme complex, and αK i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor-enzyme-substrate complex (12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar). The global fitting used here makes use of all of the data at each combination of substrate and inhibitor to fit the entire data set to a single equation for velocity as a function of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. For such fitting, the confidence interval of the fitted parameters depends on the degrees of freedom for the fitting, which is directly related to the number of substrate/inhibitor concentrations used (14Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 155-180Google Scholar). Hence to maximize the degrees of freedom in a reasonable number of measurements, we ran 20 combinations of substrate/inhibitor concentrations with a single measurement for each concentration. The entire experiment was performed a second time, and the two data sets were averaged and fit to the appropriate kinetic models (EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3). The best fit model was selected from among Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 by comparing the goodness of fit as described above. For visual presentation the results of this fitting are displayed as double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 4, A and B). The lines drawn through the data in the double-reciprocal plots were constructed using the reciprocal velocity equation with the apparentK m and V max values, at each inhibitor concentration, obtained from the global fits of the untransformed data (12Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York2000: 266-317Crossref Google Scholar). Photocross-linking of the enzyme from H. pylori with compound 2 (see below) was performed by incubating the enzyme (500 nm) with 10 μm compound2 and the indicated concentration of coenzyme Q0at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were then dialyzed against 100 volumes of inhibitor-free buffer over night. Residual activity was measure after diluting the enzyme sample (final enzyme concentration 25 nm) into the assay mixture. The percent inhibition reported here is relative to a control sample that was treated as above but without inhibitor present. All of the inhibitors discussed here were synthesized by the Medicinal Chemistry group at DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company. Compound purity and identity were confirmed by a combination of mass spectral and NMR analysis, as will be detailed elsewhere. 2T. S. Haque, S. Tadesse, J. Marcinkevicience, C. Sizemore, M. J.

All other reagents were the highest quality commercially available. All solutions were prepared with deionized, distilled water. MIC measurements for all bacterial species except H. pylori were performed in liquid media according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) Document M7-A4 using a 2-fold serial dilution of compound from 64 to 0.03 μg/ml, in duplicate. MIC determinations for H. pyloriwere performed in liquid medium (H. pylori broth (HP broth): brain/heart infusion broth, 0.25% yeast extract, 10% horse serum) with incubation at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in a humid chamber for 72 h. Minimal medium used for orotate supplementation studies was as defined by Reynolds (15Reynolds D.J. Clayton C.L. Mobley H.L.T. Methods in Molecular Medicine, Helicobacter pylori Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 53-61Google Scholar). For all MIC measurements the turbidity of each sample was determined by visual inspection, and the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of inhibitor resulting in an optically clear bacterial culture. Bacterial strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), except where indicated. Clinical isolates of H. pylori were obtained from the Vanderbilt University H. pylori strain collection (16Peck Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6124-6131PubMed Google Scholar). Human mixed lymphocyte proliferation and human Jurkat cell proliferation assays were performed as described previously in Refs. 17Simon P. Townsend R.M. Harris R.R. Jones E.A. Jaffee B.D. Transplant. Proc. 1993; 25 Suppl. 2: 77-80Google Scholarand 18Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar, respectively. We have focused our attention on the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase), which catalyzes the fourth step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzyme from H. pylori was expressed in an E. colihost deleted for the endogenous pyrD gene (encoding DHODase) (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The amino acid sequence of the H. pylori enzyme displays most similarity to other Gram-negative bacterial DHODases (Fig.1), classifying this enzyme as a family 2 DHODase (19Jensen K.F. Bjornberg O. Paths to Pyrimidines. 1998; 6: 20-28Google Scholar). Family 2 enzymes include all of the known Gram-negative bacterial enzymes and the enzymes from mammalian sources. All of the family 2 enzymes studied to date are membrane-associated flavoproteins that utilize an endogenous FMN redox cofactor and exogenous coenzyme Q6 as an electron acceptor in the FMN oxidative half-reaction of the enzyme. The enzymes from bovine, human, andE. coli have been studied in kinetic detail, and all conform to a two-site Ping-Pong steady state mechanism (20Hines V. Johnston M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Neidhardt E.A. Punreddy S.R. McLean J.E. Hedstrom L. Grossman T.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar, 22Larsen J.N. Jensen K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The existence of a separate binding sites for Q6 has been confirmed for the human enzyme by the recent crystal structure reported by Clardy and co-workers (23Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure ( Lond ). 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); the structure of co-crystals of the human enzyme with the inhibitors brequinar sodium and A771726 demonstrates that both inhibitors bind within the Q6 binding pocket of human DHODase (23Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure ( Lond ). 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The coenzyme Q binding pocket for the H. pylori DHODase displays distinct behavior relative to the mammalian enzyme. We have found that the H. pylori enzyme will donate electrons not only to coenzyme Q6 (K m (at saturating DHO) = 19.0 ± 3.8 μm) but also to the more water-soluble analog coenzyme Q0 (K m = 5.3 ± 0.7 μm). In contrast, the human enzyme showed minimal activity (∼10% that seen with Q6) in the presence of Q0. Furthermore, the H. pylorienzyme will also donate electrons to the bulkier bicyclic naphthoquinones menaquinone (vitamin K2;K m = 8.7 ± 1.3 μm) and menadione (vitamin K3; K m = 5.9 ± 1.4 μm), whereas the human enzyme utilizes these cofactors very poorly (only 5–7% residual activity was observed with these cofactors; this residual activity is most likely due to the quinone-independent, O2 reducing activity of the human enzyme as reported by Lakaschus and Loeffler (24Lakaschus G. Loeffler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). This quinone specificity may reflect differences in the physiological environments that the mammalian and bacterial enzymes experience. The mammalian forms of DHODase are localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here Q6 is the only electron acceptor available to the enzyme. Electron donation to Q6 by mammalian DHODase has the added advantage that these electrons can be directly utilized by the mitochondrial respiratory pathway to fuel oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, chromatographic analysis of H. pylori cells and those of related Helicobacter species demonstrated that these organisms lack Q6 and instead contain menaquinone (menaquinone-6 and -4) as their major isoprenoid quinone (25Moss C.W. Lambert-Fair M.A. Nicholson M.A. Guerrant G.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 395-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Marcelli S.W. Chang H.-T. Chapman T. Chalk P.A. Miles R.J. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 138: 59-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The coenzyme Q binding pocket of the H. pylori enzyme is further distinguished from that of the mammalian enzymes on the basis of inhibition studies. Brequinar sodium and the active metabolite of leflunomide (A771726) are both potent inhibitors of mammalian DHODase, displaying K i values for the human enzyme of ≤6 and 179 nm, respectively (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Davis J.P. Cain G.A. Pitts W.A. Magolda R.L. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1270-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Both compounds are competitive inhibitors with respect to coenzyme Q6 and have been shown through crystallographic studies to share a common binding site within the coenzyme Q pocket of the human enzyme (23Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure ( Lond ). 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We have tested both brequinar sodium and A771726 as inhibitors of the H. pylori and E. coli enzymes (Fig.2). In striking contrast to their effects on mammalian DHODases, neither compound demonstrated any inhibition of the Gram-negative bacterial enzymes at concentrations as high as 100 μm. The data shown for brequinar sodium and A771726 in Fig. 2 are typical titrations for these inhibitors; similar data were obtained in more than three separate titration experiments. These results suggest that there are significant structural differences between the coenzyme Q binding pockets of the Gram-negative bacterial and mammalian forms of DHODase. These differences are reflected in the selectivity of the enzymes for ligands that bind at the coenzyme Q site. Hence this binding pocket may provide a target for the development of selective inhibitors against the bacterial enzymes. We have utilized the H. pylorienzyme to screen a chemical library of >150,000 compounds for potential inhibitors. In this way several distinct chemical classes of compounds were identified that showed >1000-fold selectivity for theH. pylori enzyme over the human enzyme. One class of compounds identified through this screening effort was the pyrazole-based compounds exemplified by compound 1 (TableII). This compound and several structural analogs inhibited the DHODase of H. pylori with nanomolar affinity while displaying no ability to inhibit the cognate enzymes from the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis (9Marcinkeviciene J. Tinney L. Wang K. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13129-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Marcinkeviciene J. Jiang W. Locke G. Kopcho L. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or from human (7Copeland R.A. Davis J.P. Dowling R.L. Lombardo D. Murphy K.B. Patterson T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Table II and Fig. 3). The inhibitor titration shown in Fig. 3 represents a typical experimental data set. This experiment was repeated 8 times, yielding an average IC50 of 167 ± 75 nm. This value was converted to a K i value by assuming competitive inhibition with respect to Q6 (see next section). The average K i value determined by this method was 26 ± 12 nm under assay conditions identical to those used for the human enzyme. K i values for the related compounds 2-4 were determined in a similar fashion and are summarized in Table II. Since the H. pylorienzyme can readily donate electrons to the more water-soluble cofactor Q0, we also determine the K i of compound1 in the absence of Triton X-100 detergent. In the absence of detergent the average (n = 8) K ivalue was reduced to 10.2 ± 0.2 nm. This result most likely reflects some partitioning of the compound into detergent micelles, where it is unavailable for inhibiting the enzyme; the modest activity of the human enzyme using Q0 (in the absence of detergent) was not inhibited by compound 1 at concentrations as high as 100 μm.Table IIChemical structures and in vitro enzyme inhibition constants for four representative pyrazole compoundsa Measured with coenzyme Q6 or Q0 as electron donor in a Triton X-100-containing assay buffer (identical to the assay conditions for the human andE. faecalis enzymes).

Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7John R.A Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In all of these reactions (except in the case of the glycogen phosphorylase family), the two basic chemical properties of the PLP are conserved; it forms an external aldimine between its aldehyde group and the α-amino group of the substrates and withdraws electrons from the substrate by serving as an electron sink (7John R.A Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As a PLP-dependent enzyme, the ACCD's ring-opening reaction starts with a transformation reaction from an internal aldimine between the PLP and the enzyme to an external aldimine. In most of the PLP-dependent enzymes, the next step is the nucleophilic abstraction of the α-substituent, either an α-proton or a carboxylate group, to form an α-carbanionic intermediate. This reaction mechanism cannot be applied to ACCD because the substrate (ACC) does not contain α-hydrogen and the carboxyl group is retained in the product. Therefore, the ring-opening reaction of ACC must be initiated without obvious accessibility to an α-carbanionic intermediate, which is, for PLP-dependent enzymes, the common entry for catalysis. One proposed reaction mechanism is the nucleophilic addition to Cγ followed by the cleavage of the Cα-Cγ bond and β-proton abstraction. Because PLP acts as an electron sink, external aldimine is fairly electrophilic, and the nucleophilic addition to Cγ to rupture the cyclopropane ring of ACC is mechanistically feasible (8Walsh C.

These two kinds of ACCD perform the same activities and have amino acid sequences that are 60% identical. Although the bACCD has an estimated molecular weight that corresponds to the trimeric form of a single polypeptide chain of 338 amino acid residues, the yACCD has a molecular weight that corresponds to the dimeric form of a single polypeptide chain of 341 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 37,500 Da (11Minami R.

In Xenopus embryos this loop can be ectopically induced by injection of BMP-2 RNA. However, cycloheximide treatment subsequent to BMP-2 overexpression revealed that BMP signaling is not direct but requires additional factor(s). As putative mediator we have identified Xvent-2 which is activated by BMP-2/4 signaling and, in turn, activates BMP-4 transcription. Using promoter/reporter assays we have delineated Xvent-2 responsive elements within the BMP-4 gene. We further demonstrate that Xvent-2 which has recently been characterized as a transcriptional repressor can also act, context dependent, as an activator binding two copies of a 5′-CTAATT-3′ motif in the second intron of theBMP-4 gene. Replacement of Xvent-2 target sites within thegoosecoid (gsc) promoter by theBMP-4 enhancer converts Xvent-2 caused repression ofgsc to strong activation. This switch is obviously due to adjacent nucleotides probably binding a transcriptional co-activator interacting with Xvent-2.

Investigations performed withXenopus laevis embryos have shown that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4),1 a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is a key signal for ventralizing the mesoderm, for the inhibition of dorsalizing and neuralizing factors and for converting ectodermal to epidermal cell fate (1Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 2Graff J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus it is evident that the activation of theBMP-4 gene at the ventral side of late blastula/early gastrula stage in Xenopus embryos is of general importance for dorso/ventral pattern formation. However, the molecular nature of factors being responsible for the zygotic activation of this genein vivo is still not clear. Even in the case of invertebrate homologues, like the Drosophila genedecapentaplegic (dpp), the mechanism governing the initial activation at blastoderm stage is not completely understood. It could be shown that the second intron contains elements which contribute to the correct spatial blastoderm pattern (3Huang J.-D. Schwyter D.H. Shirokawa J.M. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Jackson P.D. Hoffmann F.M. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Schwyter D.H. Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3960-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A gradient of the protein dorsal, the homologue of c-Rel in vertebrates, suppresses dpp in the ventral half, but the factors involved in transcriptional activation of dpp in the dorsal half remain to be elucidated. Subsequent expression of dpp in visceral mesoderm is regulated by ultrabithorax (ubx) which itself is up-regulated by dpp (6Hursh D.A. Padgett R.W. Gelbart W.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1211-1222PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thüringer F. Bienz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and, at dorsal closure, the dpp target Fos (FosD) cooperates with Jun (JunD) by regulating the expression of dpp (8Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Hafen E. Science. 1997; 278: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Autoregulatory loops have also been reported for transforming growth factor-β (9Kim S.-J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Xenopus BMP-4 (10Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Lapan P.M. Wright C.V.E. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1992; 115: 639-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While autoinduction of transforming growth factor-β involves activatory protein 1, it is unknown, whether the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is direct or requires additional factors. We here show that the activation of theXenopus BMP-4 gene depends upon BMP signaling, but this activation is not observed in the presence of cycloheximide,i.e. in the absence of protein synthesis. In search of putative mediators we have analyzed the role of transcription factors activated in ventral mesoderm, like the homeodomain proteins Xvent-1 (closely related to Xvent-1B and PV.1) (11Gawantka V.

While all these genes are known to be activated by ectopic expression of BMP-4, only Xvent-2 up-regulatesBMP-4 transcription in vivo, and hence is a candidate to function within the autocatalytic loop.Deletion mutant/reporter gene assays of the Xenopus BMP-4gene (20Metz A.

Kung H.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 516-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that enhancer elements located within the second intron and the 5′-flanking region contribute to transcriptional activation by BMP signaling. We now have further delineated these regions and demonstrate by co-injection experiments that the same regions which respond to BMP signaling are activated by Xvent-2. The direct interaction of Xvent-2 with a corresponding target site within the second intron was demonstrated by mobility shift and DNase I footprint experiments. In contrast to the previous characterization of Xvent-2 as a transcriptional repressor (22Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melby A.E. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) we here document that this factor can additionally work as a transcriptional activator. This dual activity is context dependent and obviously requires a co-activator interacting with Xvent-2 and binding to an adjacent target site. The results suggest a model, in which the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is triggered by maternal BMP-2 activating Xvent-2 and is subsequently maintained by BMP-4 via Xvent-2 as a mediator. It is consistent with the observation that Xvent-2 and BMP-4 show identical spatial expression patterns throughout embryogenesis (14Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe here show that zygotic activation of the BMP-4 gene at late blastula/early gastrula stage can be triggered by BMP-2 which,in vivo, is translated from maternal transcripts being present until the gastrula stage within the embryo (35Clement J.H. Fettes P. Knöchel S. Lef J. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, maternal BMP-4 transcripts being present at a very low level (34Nishimatsu S. Suzuki A. Shoda A. Murakami K. Ueno N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In line with this, injection of truncated BMP receptor prevents formation of BMP-4transcripts at the gastrula stage. Thus it is likely that BMP signaling is a major component not only in the maintenance but also in the activation of the Xenopus BMP-4 gene. Similar conclusions can be drawn from zebrafish mutants. At least the maintenance of zBMP-2 and zBMP-4 is affected in swirl (zBMP-2) mutant embryos; zBMP-4 expression in the ventral marginal region depends on zBMP-2 as indicated by the reduced initial expression and subsequent loss of the marginal zone zBMP-4 expression in swirl mutant embryos (44Kishimoto Y. Lee K.-H. Zon L. Hammerschmidt M. Schulte-Merker S. Development. 1997; 124: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the requirement of BMP signal transducers has been documented. BMP2b and Smad5 (somitabun: sbn) double mutant analysis and RNA injection experiments have shown that sbn acts downstream of BMP2b signaling to mediate BMP2b autoregulation during early dorsoventral pattern formation (45Hild M. Dick A. Rauch G.-J. Meier A. Bouwmeester T. Haffter P. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 1999; 126: 2149-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).However, cycloheximide treatment of BMP-2-injected Xenopusembryos prior to midblastula transition prevents BMP-4transcription; thus it seems clear that the activation and/or the autoregulatory loop are not direct but indirect. As putative mediators we have investigated several genes which are activated by BMP-2/4. In turn, corresponding proteins should also be able to activate theBMP-4 gene when overexpressed within the embryo. We found that Xvent-2, but not Xvent-1, GATA-2, or Xwnt-8 (46Hoppler S. Moon R.T. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)2fulfill both of these requirements. Therefore, the results suggest that Xvent-2 might be directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of the BMP-4 gene. Also, the activatory potential of Xvent-2 for BMP-4 as well as for Xvent-1 transcription (12Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that Xvent-2 does not only work as a repressor as recently suggested (22Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melby A.E. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but additionally serves as a transcriptional activator. We here demonstrate that the GAL4 activator domain/Xvent-2 fusion protein behaves for the BMP-4 promoter in a dose-dependent manner as a transcriptional activator which then is converted to a repressor at higher concentrations. The inhibition of ventral genes observed after injection at high concentrations might be explained by an artificial activation of dorsal genes, like goosecoid and chordin, which are known to suppress ventral genes. Also, a comparison of the activatory potential of Xvent-1 to that of Xvent-2 in the yeast system clearly indicates that Xvent-2, in contrast to Xvent-1, behaves as an activator. Finally, swapping of the BMP-4 intron enhancer to the gsc promoter converts Xvent-2 from acting as a repressor to a transcriptional activator. However, the activatory potential of Xvent-2 on BMP-4 gene transcription requires an additional co-activator, because CHX treatment prevents activation. A search for this co-activator is under current investigation. The results obtained from the present and previous works (12Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Friedle H. Rastegar S.

Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar) can be summarized in a scheme as shown in Fig. 9. Accordingly, BMP-2 triggers the BMP signaling pathway at the early gastrula stage by directly activating Xvent-2. Xvent-2, together with a transcriptional co-activator, activatesBMP-4 and, as recently shown, Xvent-2 suppressesgoosecoid; both, Xvent-2 and GATA-2 activateXvent-1 which serves as a transcriptional repressor for the dorsal lip specific fork head gene XFD-1′.Noteworthy, a comparison of the temporal expression of Xvent-2 (14Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)versus that of BMP-4 (43Köster M. Plessow S. Clement J.H. Lorenz A. Tiedemann H. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 48Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M.J. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar) also supports the notion that Xvent-2 serves as a regulatory component for the zygotic activation ofBMP-4 gene transcription. Actually, Xvent-2transcription clearly precedes that of BMP-4 and the spatial pattern of Xvent-2 which is almost identical to that of BMP-4 is consistent with its role in BMP-4 gene activation.To localize enhancers on the BMP-4 promoter which interact with factors being involved in the autoregulatory loop, we have investigated a series of deletion mutants from the 5′-flanking region and the second intron fused to a luciferase reporter gene by co-injection with BMP-2/4, chordin, Xvent-2, and dominant negative Xvent-2 (P40) RNA. The results demonstrate the existence of two sites, one upstream and one in intron 2, responding to Xvent-2. Comparing reporter gene activities obtained by co-injection with BMP-2/4 to those obtained with Xvent-2 we find a correlation for all mutants tested regarding their potential and their extent of stimulation. Thus, on a qualitative and a quantitative level, Xvent-2 mimics the action of BMP-2/4 and seems to be the major player in the autocatalytic loop. Also, down-regulation observed with chordin directly correlates to BMP-2/4 reactive mutants and can be rescued by Xvent-2. This finding supports our previous notion that transcriptional repression ofBMP-4 by chordin is solely due to chordin/BMP-4 interaction at the protein level, thereby interfering with the autoregulatory loop (20Metz A. Knöchel S. Büchler P. Köster M. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Finally, we have investigated the ability of Xvent-2 to interact with DNA motifs found to be essential in reporter gene activation. We demonstrate that the Xvent-2 responsive element in intron 2 is retarded by the Xvent-2 homeodomain, but we failed in mobility shifts using the upstream Xvent-2 responsive region. Thus, we have to conclude that the action of Xvent-2 on the upstream region is not direct but indirect and requires the action of another, further downstream factor. The intron target was subjected to DNase I footprinting. The result corresponds for both strands and reveals a duplicated 5′-CTAATT-3′ motif as a target motif for Xvent-2. This strongly supports previous findings of a Xom (Xvent-2) target consensus sequence derived by a PCR-based oligonucleotide selection procedure containing exactly this motif (24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The fact that the biological effects observed in reporter gene activation assays coincide with the presence of this element strongly supports the notion that this motif serves as a natural Xvent-2-binding site. Moreover, it displays a high degree of conservation to the 5′-CTATTT-3′ motif, which we have recently described as a Xvent-1 target site within the XFD-1′ promoter (31Friedle H. Rastegar S. Paul H. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In summary, we show both for the wild type gene and for promoter/reporter constructs that the autocatalytic regulation of theBMP-4 gene is mediated by Xvent-2. Results obtained from biological and molecular investigations are compatible with the notion that the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is initially triggered by maternal BMP-2 signals activating Xvent-2 and maintained during early development by Xvent-2. The major contribution of intron 2 to transcriptional activation of BMP-4 coincides with two copies of a 5′-CTAATT-3′ target motif which have the potential to bind to Xvent-2. Although our results do definitely not rule out the possibility that other factors being activated by BMP-4,e.g. msx1 or Xvex-1 (49Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Shapira E. Marom K. Levy V. Yelin R. Fainsod A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), might participate in the autocatalytic loop, we provide the first insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the transcription of the BMP-4 gene inXenopus embryos. Induction and patterning of germ layers in vertebrate embryogenesis depends on intercellular signaling and intracellular signal transduction pathways triggered by various growth factors or growth factor-like molecules. Investigations performed withXenopus laevis embryos have shown that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4),1 a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is a key signal for ventralizing the mesoderm, for the inhibition of dorsalizing and neuralizing factors and for converting ectodermal to epidermal cell fate (1Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 2Graff J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus it is evident that the activation of theBMP-4 gene at the ventral side of late blastula/early gastrula stage in Xenopus embryos is of general importance for dorso/ventral pattern formation. However, the molecular nature of factors being responsible for the zygotic activation of this genein vivo is still not clear. Even in the case of invertebrate homologues, like the Drosophila genedecapentaplegic (dpp), the mechanism governing the initial activation at blastoderm stage is not completely understood. It could be shown that the second intron contains elements which contribute to the correct spatial blastoderm pattern (3Huang J.-D. Schwyter D.H. Shirokawa J.M. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Jackson P.D. Hoffmann F.M. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Schwyter D.H. Huang J.-D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3960-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A gradient of the protein dorsal, the homologue of c-Rel in vertebrates, suppresses dpp in the ventral half, but the factors involved in transcriptional activation of dpp in the dorsal half remain to be elucidated. Subsequent expression of dpp in visceral mesoderm is regulated by ultrabithorax (ubx) which itself is up-regulated by dpp (6Hursh D.A. Padgett R.W. Gelbart W.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1211-1222PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thüringer F. Bienz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and, at dorsal closure, the dpp target Fos (FosD) cooperates with Jun (JunD) by regulating the expression of dpp (8Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Hafen E. Science. 1997; 278: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Autoregulatory loops have also been reported for transforming growth factor-β (9Kim S.-J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Xenopus BMP-4 (10Jones C.M. Lyons K.M. Lapan P.M. Wright C.V.E. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1992; 115: 639-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While autoinduction of transforming growth factor-β involves activatory protein 1, it is unknown, whether the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is direct or requires additional factors. We here show that the activation of theXenopus BMP-4 gene depends upon BMP signaling, but this activation is not observed in the presence of cycloheximide,i.e. in the absence of protein synthesis. In search of putative mediators we have analyzed the role of transcription factors activated in ventral mesoderm, like the homeodomain proteins Xvent-1 (closely related to Xvent-1B and PV.1) (11Gawantka V.

Blood. 1996; 88: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While all these genes are known to be activated by ectopic expression of BMP-4, only Xvent-2 up-regulatesBMP-4 transcription in vivo, and hence is a candidate to function within the autocatalytic loop. Deletion mutant/reporter gene assays of the Xenopus BMP-4gene (20Metz A. Knöchel S. Büchler P. Köster M. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Kim J. Tidman Ault K. Chen H.-D. Xu R.-H. Roh D.-H. Lin M.C. Park M.-J. Kung H.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 516-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that enhancer elements located within the second intron and the 5′-flanking region contribute to transcriptional activation by BMP signaling. We now have further delineated these regions and demonstrate by co-injection experiments that the same regions which respond to BMP signaling are activated by Xvent-2. The direct interaction of Xvent-2 with a corresponding target site within the second intron was demonstrated by mobility shift and DNase I footprint experiments. In contrast to the previous characterization of Xvent-2 as a transcriptional repressor (22Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melby A.E. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) we here document that this factor can additionally work as a transcriptional activator. This dual activity is context dependent and obviously requires a co-activator interacting with Xvent-2 and binding to an adjacent target site. The results suggest a model, in which the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is triggered by maternal BMP-2 activating Xvent-2 and is subsequently maintained by BMP-4 via Xvent-2 as a mediator. It is consistent with the observation that Xvent-2 and BMP-4 show identical spatial expression patterns throughout embryogenesis (14Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fainsod A. Steinbeisser H. De Robertis E.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONWe here show that zygotic activation of the BMP-4 gene at late blastula/early gastrula stage can be triggered by BMP-2 which,in vivo, is translated from maternal transcripts being present until the gastrula stage within the embryo (35Clement J.H. Fettes P. Knöchel S. Lef J. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, maternal BMP-4 transcripts being present at a very low level (34Nishimatsu S. Suzuki A. Shoda A. Murakami K. Ueno N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 43Köster M. Plessow S. Clement J.H. Lorenz A. Tiedemann H. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) could also be translated during early cleavage stages and contribute to zygotic activation of the gene. In line with this, injection of truncated BMP receptor prevents formation of BMP-4transcripts at the gastrula stage.

Dev. 1991; 33: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) could also be translated during early cleavage stages and contribute to zygotic activation of the gene. In line with this, injection of truncated BMP receptor prevents formation of BMP-4transcripts at the gastrula stage. Thus it is likely that BMP signaling is a major component not only in the maintenance but also in the activation of the Xenopus BMP-4 gene. Similar conclusions can be drawn from zebrafish mutants. At least the maintenance of zBMP-2 and zBMP-4 is affected in swirl (zBMP-2) mutant embryos; zBMP-4 expression in the ventral marginal region depends on zBMP-2 as indicated by the reduced initial expression and subsequent loss of the marginal zone zBMP-4 expression in swirl mutant embryos (44Kishimoto Y. Lee K.-H. Zon L. Hammerschmidt M. Schulte-Merker S. Development. 1997; 124: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the requirement of BMP signal transducers has been documented. BMP2b and Smad5 (somitabun: sbn) double mutant analysis and RNA injection experiments have shown that sbn acts downstream of BMP2b signaling to mediate BMP2b autoregulation during early dorsoventral pattern formation (45Hild M. Dick A. Rauch G.-J. Meier A. Bouwmeester T. Haffter P. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 1999; 126: 2149-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cycloheximide treatment of BMP-2-injected Xenopusembryos prior to midblastula transition prevents BMP-4transcription; thus it seems clear that the activation and/or the autoregulatory loop are not direct but indirect. As putative mediators we have investigated several genes which are activated by BMP-2/4. In turn, corresponding proteins should also be able to activate theBMP-4 gene when overexpressed within the embryo. We found that Xvent-2, but not Xvent-1, GATA-2, or Xwnt-8 (46Hoppler S. Moon R.T. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)2fulfill both of these requirements. Therefore, the results suggest that Xvent-2 might be directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of the BMP-4 gene. Also, the activatory potential of Xvent-2 for BMP-4 as well as for Xvent-1 transcription (12Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that Xvent-2 does not only work as a repressor as recently suggested (22Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melby A.E. Clements W.K. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but additionally serves as a transcriptional activator. We here demonstrate that the GAL4 activator domain/Xvent-2 fusion protein behaves for the BMP-4 promoter in a dose-dependent manner as a transcriptional activator which then is converted to a repressor at higher concentrations. The inhibition of ventral genes observed after injection at high concentrations might be explained by an artificial activation of dorsal genes, like goosecoid and chordin, which are known to suppress ventral genes. Also, a comparison of the activatory potential of Xvent-1 to that of Xvent-2 in the yeast system clearly indicates that Xvent-2, in contrast to Xvent-1, behaves as an activator. Finally, swapping of the BMP-4 intron enhancer to the gsc promoter converts Xvent-2 from acting as a repressor to a transcriptional activator. However, the activatory potential of Xvent-2 on BMP-4 gene transcription requires an additional co-activator, because CHX treatment prevents activation. A search for this co-activator is under current investigation. The results obtained from the present and previous works (12Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Friedle H. Rastegar S.

Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar) can be summarized in a scheme as shown in Fig. 9. Accordingly, BMP-2 triggers the BMP signaling pathway at the early gastrula stage by directly activating Xvent-2. Xvent-2, together with a transcriptional co-activator, activatesBMP-4 and, as recently shown, Xvent-2 suppressesgoosecoid; both, Xvent-2 and GATA-2 activateXvent-1 which serves as a transcriptional repressor for the dorsal lip specific fork head gene XFD-1′. Noteworthy, a comparison of the temporal expression of Xvent-2 (14Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)versus that of BMP-4 (43Köster M. Plessow S. Clement J.H. Lorenz A. Tiedemann H. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 48Dale L. Howes G. Price B.M.J. Smith J.C. Development. 1992; 115: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar) also supports the notion that Xvent-2 serves as a regulatory component for the zygotic activation ofBMP-4 gene transcription. Actually, Xvent-2transcription clearly precedes that of BMP-4 and the spatial pattern of Xvent-2 which is almost identical to that of BMP-4 is consistent with its role in BMP-4 gene activation. To localize enhancers on the BMP-4 promoter which interact with factors being involved in the autoregulatory loop, we have investigated a series of deletion mutants from the 5′-flanking region and the second intron fused to a luciferase reporter gene by co-injection with BMP-2/4, chordin, Xvent-2, and dominant negative Xvent-2 (P40) RNA. The results demonstrate the existence of two sites, one upstream and one in intron 2, responding to Xvent-2. Comparing reporter gene activities obtained by co-injection with BMP-2/4 to those obtained with Xvent-2 we find a correlation for all mutants tested regarding their potential and their extent of stimulation. Thus, on a qualitative and a quantitative level, Xvent-2 mimics the action of BMP-2/4 and seems to be the major player in the autocatalytic loop. Also, down-regulation observed with chordin directly correlates to BMP-2/4 reactive mutants and can be rescued by Xvent-2. This finding supports our previous notion that transcriptional repression ofBMP-4 by chordin is solely due to chordin/BMP-4 interaction at the protein level, thereby interfering with the autoregulatory loop (20Metz A. Knöchel S. Büchler P. Köster M. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, we have investigated the ability of Xvent-2 to interact with DNA motifs found to be essential in reporter gene activation. We demonstrate that the Xvent-2 responsive element in intron 2 is retarded by the Xvent-2 homeodomain, but we failed in mobility shifts using the upstream Xvent-2 responsive region. Thus, we have to conclude that the action of Xvent-2 on the upstream region is not direct but indirect and requires the action of another, further downstream factor. The intron target was subjected to DNase I footprinting. The result corresponds for both strands and reveals a duplicated 5′-CTAATT-3′ motif as a target motif for Xvent-2. This strongly supports previous findings of a Xom (Xvent-2) target consensus sequence derived by a PCR-based oligonucleotide selection procedure containing exactly this motif (24Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The fact that the biological effects observed in reporter gene activation assays coincide with the presence of this element strongly supports the notion that this motif serves as a natural Xvent-2-binding site. Moreover, it displays a high degree of conservation to the 5′-CTATTT-3′ motif, which we have recently described as a Xvent-1 target site within the XFD-1′ promoter (31Friedle H. Rastegar S. Paul H. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In summary, we show both for the wild type gene and for promoter/reporter constructs that the autocatalytic regulation of theBMP-4 gene is mediated by Xvent-2. Results obtained from biological and molecular investigations are compatible with the notion that the autoregulatory loop of BMP-4 is initially triggered by maternal BMP-2 signals activating Xvent-2 and maintained during early development by Xvent-2. The major contribution of intron 2 to transcriptional activation of BMP-4 coincides with two copies of a 5′-CTAATT-3′ target motif which have the potential to bind to Xvent-2. Although our results do definitely not rule out the possibility that other factors being activated by BMP-4,e.g. msx1 or Xvex-1 (49Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Shapira E. Marom K. Levy V. Yelin R. Fainsod A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), might participate in the autocatalytic loop, we provide the first insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the transcription of the BMP-4 gene inXenopus embryos.

For instance, gene therapy involves the cellular binding and uptake of DNA as an intact molecule, with subsequent overexpression of the gene product(s). In some cases this overexpression can result in the stimulation of host immune responses as seen with DNA vaccines (1Donnelly J.J. Ulmer J.B. Shiver J.W. Liu M.A. Annu. Rev.

The binding and internalization of bacterial DNA can initiate a variety of responses, both harmful as well as beneficial. Bacterial DNA has been reported to induce potentially harmful inflammation in the lung (4Freimark B.D. Blezinger H.P. Florack V.J. Nordstrom J.L. Long S.D. Deshpande D.S. Nochumson S. Petrak K.L. J.

In contrast, the immunostimulatory motif found in bacterial DNA (CpG) has been shown to mediate a number of beneficial effects. Hartman and colleagues (10Hartmann G. Weiner G.J. Krieg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9305-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) have shown that CpG motifs can activate human dendritic cells, implying a possible role in dendritic cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, the role of CpG motifs as adjuvants has recently been reported (11Deml L. Schirmbeck R. Reimann J. Wolf H. Wagner R. Clin. Chem. Lab.

The mechanism(s) that mediate the cellular binding and internalization of exogenous DNA remains, for the most part, undefined at the molecular level. There are numerous reports of the association of different forms of nucleic acids, such as DNA, RNA, and oligonucleotides, with cell surfaces (13Gasparro F.P. DallAmico R. O'Malley M. Heald P.W.

Whether oligonucleotides are internalized via a receptor-mediated endocytic pathway, a pinocytic mechanism, or a combination of both has not been resolved. Loke et al. (28Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A possible endocytic pathway for oligonucleotide uptake was described by Yakubov et al. (29Yakubov L.A. Deeva E.A. Zarytova V.F. Ivanova E.M. Ryte A.S. Yurchenko L.V. Vlassov V.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1989; 86: 6454-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) but it appeared that pinocytosis was the preferred pathway at a high concentration of oligonucleotides. Recently, the involvement of the macrophage-1 cell-surface molecule as a receptor for oligonucleotide binding has been reported (30Benimetskaya L. Loike J.D. Khaled Z. Loike G. Silverstein S.C. Cao L. el Khoury J. Cai T.Q. Stein C.A. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, whether binding of oligonucleotides to macrophage-1 is the relevant mechanism by which DNA activates cells is unknown. In addition, the mechanism(s) for oligo and/or plasmid DNA binding and internalization by cells lacking macrophage-1 has yet to be established. Other studies substantiate the notion that cells possess specific cell-surface proteins that mediate nucleic acid binding and internalization. Bennett et al. (31Bennett R.M. Gabor G.T. Merritt M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2182-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) provided evidence that cell surface binding of high molecular weight DNA by human leukocytes was mediated by membrane-associated proteins with subsequent uptake and degradation of internalized DNA. Emlen and colleagues (32Emlen W. Rifai A. Magilavy D. Mannik M. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 54-60PubMed Google Scholar), working with hepatic cells, have demonstrated saturable DNA binding, suggesting a receptor-mediated process and Kawabata and colleagues (33Kawabata K. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Pharmac. Res. 1995; 12: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) showed rapid uptake of plasmid DNA by the liver. Takagi and colleagues (34Takagi T. Hashiguchi M. Mahato R.I. Tokuda H. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, characterization of the receptor(s) which mediate the binding and internalization of plasmid DNA remains undefined at the molecular level. The molecular characterization of the cell-surface receptor(s) involved in the binding and internalization of DNA will provide the basis for the potential regulation of DNA binding to cells and the selective enhancement or diminishment of the biological effects of DNA. To facilitate the identification of this cell-surface receptor(s), we have demonstrated that DNA binding to cell surfaces could be inhibited by pretreatment of cells with serum from patients with SLE1 (35Bennett R.M.

We used a serum that inhibited DNA binding to cell surfaces and reacted to cell-surface DNA-binding proteins (21Bennett R.M. Cornell K.A. Merritt M.J. Bakke A.C. Hsu P.H. Hefeneider S.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 86: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to screen a λgt11 cDNA expression library derived from human monocytes. A novel membrane-associated protein of molecular mass ∼130 kDa that binds DNA was identified. The molecular characterization and DNA binding properties of this molecule are detailed in this report. Serum from a patient with SLE was used to screen a λgt11 cDNA expression library from lipopolysaccharide stimulated human monocytes (CLONTECH). This serum was anti-nuclear antigen positive, had been depleted of anti-DNA antibodies by multiple (×6) passages over a DNA-Sepharose column, and had previously been shown to inhibit DNA binding to cell surfaces (21Bennett R.M. Cornell K.A. Merritt M.J. Bakke A.C. Hsu P.H. Hefeneider S.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 86: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Approximately 106 plaques were screened and 10 positive clones were identified and isolated according to the technique of Young and Davis (38Young R.A. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Two clones were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination with 7-deaza-2′-deoxyquanosine-5′-triphosphate (39Maniatis T. Fritsch W.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clone 88 (1.4 kilobases) was investigated further. A 731-bp DNA probe (probe 11) from clone 88 was used to screen a λgt11 phage library from a Raji cell line (CLONTECH Labs). A 2409-bp clone termed 97d42 was purified. It contained 1197 bp of clone 88 and 1212 bp of a new open reading frame sequence. Additional 5′ sequence was obtained using PCR. RNA from HeLa cells was reverse transcribed into single stranded DNA and a poly(A) tail added to the 5′ ends. A PCR product (clone 30F18) was synthesized with gene specific and poly(T) primers. It had a 77-bp overlap with the 5′ end of clone 97d42 and 753 bp of new 5′ sequence containing a contiguous open reading frame with clone 97d42. The remainder of the 5′ sequence was obtained from MOLT-4 cDNA by Marathon cDNA amplification (CLONTECH) according to the manufacture's instructions. This generated the final 1290-bp clone 141F13 containing 340 bp of new 5′ open reading frame and 950 bp of 5′-untranslated region. The full-length coding sequence (3576 bp) was cloned as a single PCR product from MOLT-4 cDNA. The PCR primers for this reaction (5′-ACCCGAGCATGGATCCGCCACCATGGCTGTGCAGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGTATCTAGATCCATGGTGTGGTCAC-3′) introduced aBamHI site (underlined) into the 5′ end and anXbaI site (underlined) at the 3′ end. In addition, three base changes were introduced to create a more frequently observed Kozak sequence around the start codon: TCCACAATGC to GCCACCATG G. This also resulted in changing the second codon in the gene from CCT (coding for proline) to GCT (coding for alanine) (40Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Human MTN Blots (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled 442-bp EcoRV-NcoI restriction fragment from the extreme 3′ end of the coding sequence for the MNAB gene. The blots were prehybridized for 6 h at 42 °C in 5 × SSPE (20 × SSPE contains 3 m NaCl, 0.2m NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.02m Na2EDTA), 10 × Denhardt's solution (50 × contains 1% Ficoll 400, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V), 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50% deionized formamide, and 2% SDS. The random primed32P-labeled probe (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) was denatured for 4 min at 95 °C and added to fresh prewarmed (42 °C) prehybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out for 18 h at 42 °C with gentle shaking. The blots were washed under low stringency conditions in 0.1 × SSC (20 × contains 3m NaCl, 0.3 m Na3citrate·2H2O), 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film. ABamHI-EcoRI fragment of the cDNA coding for amino acids 1–575 (including the ring and zinc finger motifs) of MNAB was cloned in-frame into pGEX-6-P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The resulting vector was named pGEX-MNAB and the fusion protein expressed from this vector was named GST/MNAB. Expression of GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli DH5α was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyrannoside for 2–4 h at 37 °C. The fusion protein was purified from lysates by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted from the column with 15 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Alternatively, the fusion protein was cleaved in situ with Prescission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to release the MNAB peptide from the GST peptide essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. The released peptide was desalted and concentrated (Centricon 30; Amicon, Beverly, MA), then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose to remove traces of GST or GST fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins used as controls in DNA binding assays (GST/CBD, GST/HST.1) were provided by Dr. Rowland Kwok, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Proteins were stored at −80 °C. ABamHI-HpaI cDNA fragment containing the coding sequence for amino acids 1–1190 (missing the two most carboxyl-terminal amino acids) of the MNAB was subcloned into pTriplFlu (constructed by Dr. John Epstein, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The vector contains the sequence coding for an epitope tag from the influenza virus HA in triplicate inserted immediately 3′ of the multicloning site in pcDNA3 which are in-frame with the inserted MNAB cDNA sequence. Polyclonal antibodies were produced to the purified GST/MNAB peptide from which the GST fusion partner had been removed by site-specific proteolysis. Female New Zealand White rabbits (2.3–3.0 kg) were injected subcutaneously with 60 μg of purified MNAB-(1–575) peptide emulsified 1:1 with TitreMax (CytRx Corp., Norcross, GA) in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The rabbits were boosted 4 weeks later with 15 μg of antigen/Titer-Max mixture, again 2 weeks later, and were maintained on a monthly intramuscular injection schedule thereafter. The final 2 injections consisted of a 3–5-μg antigen challenge. The rabbits were bled 7–10 days after each immunization and the sera analyzed for reactivity to the immunizing antigen. Sera were collected from each of the rabbits prior to immunization with the MNAB peptide and stored at −20 °C. All immune sera reacted against the immunizing peptide as assessed by ELISA and Western blot analysis. 2D. Siess, C. T. Vedder, L. S. Merkens, T. Tanaka, A. C. Freed, S. L. McCoy, M. C. Heinrich, M. E. Deffebach, R. M. Bennett, and S. H. Hefeneider, unpublished observations.This sera is referred to as anti-MNAB. Antibody to the human transferrin receptor was provided by Dr. Caroline Enns, OHSU, Portland, OR. Monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin and rabbit anti-GST were from Sigma. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Clones of 293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged MNAB were established by transfection with pTriplFlu-MNAB using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). G418-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution and tested for expression of HA-tagged MNAB by Western blotting. Lysates of cells were prepared on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340, used at 1:100). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and the protein contents were estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad). Lysates were stored at −80 °C. Cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and crude membrane fractions by Dounce homogenation on ice in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture), followed by sequential centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min then 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and pellet from the latter centrifugation were considered cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, respectively. Lysates, fractionations (typically 100 μg), and immunoprecipitates were heated at 85 °C in 2 × sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min, then separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm transfer and identify standards. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in TNT (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20). They were then incubated sequentially for 1–2 h in primary antibody diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk in TNT followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TNT. They were washed extensively in TNT in between each reagent. Antibody binding was detected with ECL and exposure of the membrane to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Lysates were precleared by incubating with protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating the precleared lysates with either rabbit anti-MNAB or preimmune serum at 1:500, or mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or control mouse monoclonal antibody (MOPC141, Sigma) at 5 μg/reaction for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. After incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C, the immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation then washed 3–4 times with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were then heated at 85 °C for 10 min in 25 μl of 2 × sample buffer. Cells (2 × 104) were seeded into the wells of poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml, Sigma) coated 8-well Permanox chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 days at which time the cells were typically 70–80% confluent. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 1 mm each CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Ca,Mg-PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with Ca,Mg-PBS, then permeablized by incubation in permeablization buffer (Ca,Mg-PBS, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05% sodium azide, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated sequentially for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody (1:100 rabbit anti-MNAB, 1:100 sheep anti-transferrin receptor, 1:200 mouse anti-γ-tubulin) then with the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 Cy3 anti-rabbit IgG, 1:50 DTAF anti-mouse IgG (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY), or 1:100 fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-goat IgG (Tago,BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), diluted in permeablization buffer, with extensive washing in permeablization buffer following each antibody incubation. Slides were mounted in Antifade Light (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed with epifluorescence microscopy. Digital images were obtained with a Zeiss Axialphot Photo 3 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu digital charged coupled device camera and processed with QED imaging software. Non-immune sera from the appropriate species were used as controls for the primary antibodies. For doubly stained cells, control staining showed that there was no reactivity between the secondary antibody and the inappropriate primary antibody.2 Human 293 cells were lifted with 8 mm EDTA in PBS and washed once in PBS. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with preimmune serum or anti-MNAB diluted in assay medium (1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS). After washing, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:400 in assay medium. Viable cells were identified by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min with 2.5 μg/ml 7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes) in assay medium. The fluorescence intensity of the cells was analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) with CellQuest software. Ten thousand viable cells were counted in each analysis to determine the geometric mean fluorescence intensity. Means were compared with ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparisons test. Mutagenesis of the zinc finger motif in MNAB was done in pGEX-MNAB using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequences of the complimentary mutagenic primer pairs (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) used were: C416A, 5′-AAATACAAGACTAGCATG GC CCGAGATTTGCGACAGC-3′; C416S, 5′-AAATACAAGACTAGCATG A GCCGAGATTTGCGACAGC-3′; C431A, 5′-GTCCACGAGGAACAAAT GC TACATTTGCCCATTCTCAGG-3′; C431S, 5′-GTCCACGAGGAACAAATT C TACATTTGCCCATTCTCAGG-3′. Altered nucleotides are in bold and underlined. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Purified GST or GST fusion proteins were diluted in ELISA buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) to 1 μg/ml and 100 μl of diluted proteins were added to wells of a microtiter plate containing immobilized calf thymus DNA (United Biotech, Mountainview, CA). After 1 h at room temperature the wells were washed with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and 100 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-GST (Sigma) in ELISA buffer were added. After 1 h at room temperature the wells were washed and 100 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in ELISA buffer were added. After 1 h at room temperature the wells were washed and 100 μl of chromogenic substrate (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine, H2O2; Genzyme Diagnostics, San Carlos, CA) were added. Chromogen conversion was measured by absorbance at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Qiagen (Valencia, CA) column purified pGEM-4Z DNA was linearized withBamHI then sequentially extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) then ethanol precipitated. After resuspension the DNA was labeled by a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP (800 or 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Unincorporated label was removed by spin chromatography through Sephadex G-50. The specific activity of the labeled DNA was determined by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid and scintillation counting. For the binding assay, the GST/MNAB protein and DNA were diluted into binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) to make 2 × stocks. The GST/MNAB protein and DNA were combined and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then 50-μl aliquots were vacuum filtered (∼1 ml/min) through nitrocellulose discs (0.45 μm pore size, Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). The filters were washed 2 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer then counted by scintillation counting in Ecolume (ICN, Irvine, CA). One million plaques from a λgt11 lipopolysaccharide-activated human monocyte cDNA library were screened with an SLE serum that was previously shown to inhibit DNA binding to cell surfaces (21Bennett R.M. Cornell K.A. Merritt M.J. Bakke A.C. Hsu P.H. Hefeneider S.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 86: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ten clones were identified and plaque purified. Sequence analysis of the 1.4-kb clone 88, which was highly reactive on Western blots with the SLE serum, revealed an open reading frame coding for a partial protein.2 The reading frame remained open at the 5′ end and a stop codon was found near the 3′ end of the clone. Thus, clone 88 coded for the 3′ end of a larger protein. Biotinylated DNA was used to isolate DNA-binding proteins from the S49 murine cell line. A 150-kDa protein was obtained that reacted by Western blot with both the SLE serum used to screen the library and with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that was raised against the fusion protein encoded by clone 88.2 Thus, clone 88 appeared to be part of a gene that encoded a DNA-binding protein. The remainder of the gene was cloned and sequenced from several sources as described under “Materials and Methods.” A full-length coding sequence was cloned as a single PCR product from MOLT-4 cDNA. The completed sequence was 4351 nucleotides in length with a predicted open reading frame of 3576 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1192 amino acids. The sequence obtained from MOLT-4 cells matched the sequences obtained from other sources (human monocytes, Raji, and HeLa cell lines). The gene coding for this protein has been termed MNAB, for membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein. A survey of MNAB gene expression by Northern blot analysis revealed two major transcripts of 9.5 and 6.8 kb in all human tissues and cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 1). Several smaller transcript sizes were also observed in some of those tissues and cell lines. Expression was most abundant in spleen, testis, ovary, and small intestine. An homology search using MNAB sequence identified the genomic sequence which was known to be located at q34 on chromosome 9 (GenBank accession number 007066, marker HIM9.89 on Contig CHR9.SL.27). The genomic clone sequence, which covered 85% of the cDNA starting from the 5′ end, revealed the location of 16 complete exons.

https://openalex.org/W2154140079,"Glucagon gene expression is controlled by at least four DNA elements within the promoter; G2, G3, and G4 confer islet-specific expression, while G1 restricts glucagon transcription to α cells. Two islet-specific complexes are formed on G3, the insulin-responsive element of the glucagon gene; one of these corresponds to the paired homeodomain protein Pax-6, a major glucagon gene transactivator that plays a crucial role in α cell development. We describe here the identification of the second complex as Pax-2, another member of the paired box family. Pax-2 is known to be crucial for the development of the urogenital tract and of the central nervous system, but its presence in the endocrine pancreas has not been reported. We detected Pax-2 gene expression by RT-PCR; in islets, Pax-2 is present as two alternative splicing isoforms, Pax-2A and Pax-2B, whereas in the glucagon- and insulin-producing cell lines αTC1 and Min6, a distinct isoform, Pax-2D2, is found in addition to Pax-2B. Both islet-specific isoforms bind to the enhancer element G3 and to the α-specific promoter element G1 that also interacts with Pax-6. Pax-2A and Pax-2B dose-dependently activate transcription from the G3 and the G1 elements both in heterologous and in glucagon-producing cells. Our data indicate that Pax-2 is the third paired domain protein present in the endocrine pancreas and that one of its roles may be the regulation of glucagon gene expression.

In vertebrates, the pax gene family consists of nine members, Pax-1 to Pax-9; these proteins are classified into four groups based on the presence of three conserved sequence motifs, paired domain homology, and similar expression pattern (reviewed in Refs. 4Mansouri A. Stoykova A. Gruss P. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1994; 18: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Group I, represented by Pax-1 and Pax-9, encodes the paired domain and a conserved octapeptide that might act as a repression domain (6Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Group II, formed by Pax-2, Pax-5, and Pax-8, contains the paired domain, octapeptide, and a partial paired-type homeodomain, whereas group III (Pax-3 and Pax-7) encodes a full-length homeodomain downstream of the paired domain and the octapeptide; this homeodomain functions as a second DNA binding motif. The fourth group comprises Pax-4 and Pax-6, which possess the paired domain and the entire homeodomain but are devoid of the octapeptide. Pax proteins are expressed during embryonic development and play a crucial role in organogenesis; mutations of these genes affect the formation of tissues such as placenta, heart, eye, nose, teeth, central nervous system, or B lymphocytes (reviewed in Refs. 4Mansouri A.

Enteroendocrine and pancreatic endocrine development are controlled by the group IV members, Pax-4 and Pax-6. Pax-4 is essential for pancreatic β and δ cells, duodenal and jejunal secretin-positive cells, as well as serotonin- and somatostatin-producing cells in the stomach (7Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K.

In contrast, Pax-6 is required for the development of all pancreatic endocrine cells, duodenal GIP-positive cells, and gastrin- and somatostatin-producing cells in the stomach (8Larsson L.I.

We show here that a third Pax family member, Pax-2, is expressed in the endocrine pancreas and that it transactivates the glucagon gene promoter. Pax-2 is expressed in a spatially and temporally restricted pattern in the developing optic nerve, ears, spinal chord, hindbrain, midbrain, and urogenital system (15Dressler G.R. Deutsch U.

We demonstrate that two Pax-2 isoforms, Pax-2A and Pax-2B, are present in rat pancreatic islets and bind to the insulin-responsive element G3 and to the proximal promoter element G1 of the glucagon gene. Both elements also interact with Pax-6; however, whereas Pax-6 displays a much higher relative binding affinity for G1 than Pax-2, Pax-2 bound G3 stronger than Pax-6. Pax-2 transactivates the G1 and G3 elements both in glucagon-producing cells and in non-islet cells and may thus play a role in the control of glucagon gene transcription.

A minimum of three independent transfections was performed; each of them was carried out in duplicate. cDNA was generated from 2 μg of total RNA isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method followed by a cesium chloride gradient (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar) and 200 ng of random hexamer primers using the SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse paired domain cDNAs were amplified using Min6 cDNA and degenerate primers PaxPDup and PaxPDdown (Table I); the resulting fragment was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene), sequenced, and analyzed using the BLAST Network Service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. To identify Pax-2 isoforms expressed in the endocrine pancreas, primers Pax2–1 and Pax2–2rev (Table I) hybridizing to all known Pax-2 isoforms were used to amplify cDNAs from rat islets and brain, Min6, and αTC1 cells. PCR products from Min6 and αTC1 cells were analyzed by sequencing. Pax-2 amplification products generated from rat islets were subcloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli HB101. The resulting colonies were hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides specific for exon 6 (in Pax-2a and Pax-2-d1), the deletion of exon 6 (in Pax-2b, Pax-2c, and Pax-2d2), exon 10 (in Pax-2c), or a deletion in exon 12 (in Pax-2d1 and Pax-2d2) (Table I). EMSAs were performed as described (35Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibodies raised against the C terminus of Pax-2 (amino acids 188–385) were purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA), and Pax-6 antisera 11, 12, and 13, raised against the Pax-6 paired domain, junction between paired domain and homeodomain, and homeodomain, respectively (37Carriere C.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was tested by analysis of variance and Student's t test where applicable. The threshold for statistical significance wasp < 0.05. Using nuclear extracts from InR1G9 cells, four protein complexes are formed on G3, the insulin-response element of the glucagon gene promoter. Two complexes, C2 and C3, contain widely expressed proteins that may represent CCAAT binding factors, and two correspond to islet-specific proteins (Fig.1; Ref. 26Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); we and others have recently identified one of the islet-specific complexes as the paired homeodomain protein Pax-6 (10Sander M.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The second, slightly slower migrating complex, C1B, was supershifted with antibodies raised against the paired domain of Pax-6 but not with antibodies specific for the Pax-6 homeodomain or the junction between the paired domain and homeodomain, indicating that C1B may represent a protein antigenically related to Pax-6 (Fig. 1; Ref. 11Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To identify C1B, we performed RT-PCR reactions of total RNA prepared from InR1G9 and Min6 cell lines with degenerate primers to conserved domains of the paired box. We were able to amplify not only Pax-6 cDNA sequences but also cDNAs coding for the paired domain protein Pax-2 that comprises a paired domain, the conserved octapeptide, and a partial paired-type homeodomain (5Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of Pax-2 in InR1G9 cells, anti-Pax-2 antibodies were added to EMSA reactions on G3 and indeed recognized complex C1B (Fig. 1); the same results were obtained with nuclear extracts from Min6 and αTC1 cells. We thus conclude that a third paired domain protein, Pax-2, in addition to Pax-6 and Pax-4, is expressed in islet cell lines and interacts with the G3 element of the glucagon gene promoter. Since five Pax-2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing have been described (Fig. 2 A; Refs.38Ward T.A. Nebel A. Reeve A.E. Eccles M.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tavassoli K. Ruger W. Horst J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we analyzed Pax-2 mRNAs in the endocrine pancreas by RT-PCR. Using mRNA from rat islets, Min6, and αTC1 cells, we obtained multiple amplification products hybridizing with a Pax-2 probe (Fig. 2 B). To identify specific isoforms, Pax-2 cDNAs from rat islets were therefore subcloned and hybridized with oligonucleotides discriminating alternatively spliced cDNAs (Table I). 69% (127 out of 184) and 31% (57 out of 184) of these clones corresponded to Pax-2A and Pax-2B, respectively; other isoforms were not detected in rat islets. In contrast, Min6 and αTC1 cells expressed Pax-2B as major and Pax-2D2 as minor alternative splicing products as revealed by direct sequencing of PCR products. To investigate the DNA binding properties of Pax-2 on the glucagon gene promoter, we concentrated on the two isoforms present in rat islets. Pax-2A and Pax-2B were overexpressed in BHK-21 cells, and the resulting nuclear extracts were used for EMSA with the G3 element. Pax-2A and Pax-2B both bound to G3 and comigrated with the Pax-2 (C1B) complex present in nuclear extracts from InR1G9 cells (Fig. 3 A). In addition to its interaction with G3, Pax-6 also binds to the proximal promoter G1 (11Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since Pax-2 and Pax-6 form complexes of equal intensity on G3 using InR1G9 nuclear extracts, we tested whether Pax-2 was also able to bind to G1. Pax-2A- or Pax-2B-containing nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells formed a complex with G1–56 that was recognized by anti-Pax-2 antibodies (Fig. 3 B). However, about 4–10-fold more nuclear extracts were necessary to obtain a Pax-2 complex of similar intensity on G1 as compared with G3, indicating a lower binding affinity of Pax-2 for this site. To test for the presence of Pax-2 in the complexes formed with nuclear extracts from glucagon-producing cells on G1, we added anti-Pax-2 antibodies to EMSA reactions. Three protein complexes were detected: Pax-6 as a monomer, Pax-6 and Cdx-2/3 as a heterodimer, and B2, an as yet unidentified complex (11Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Pax-2 complex formed with Pax-2-containing extracts from BHK-21 cells did not comigrate with any of the complexes detected with InR1G9 nuclear extracts, and the addition of anti-Pax-2 antibodies did not affect any of these complexes. Thus, although Pax-2A and Pax-2B bind to the G3 and, with a lower affinity, to the G1 elements of the glucagon gene promoter, Pax-2 binding activity from glucagon-producing cells is restricted to the G3 element in vitro. Since both potential Pax-2 target sites on the glucagon gene promoter are also bound by Pax-6, we compared the relative affinity of both proteins for G1 and G3 by gel shift competition experiments. The Pax-2 complex formed with InR1G9 nuclear extracts on labeled G3 was competed for by a 10-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide G3, while a 500-fold excess of G1–56 was required for the same reduction. In contrast, competition of Pax-6 by G3 required a 5-fold higher excess of cold oligonucleotide than competition by G1–56 (Fig.4 A). These data indicate that Pax-2 has a slightly better affinity for G3 as compared with Pax-6, whereas G1 is a much better target site for Pax-6 than for Pax-2. To test the binding affinity of Pax-2A and Pax-2B individually on G1, we performed competition experiments with nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells overexpressing Pax-6, Pax-2A, or Pax-2B. When Pax-6-containing extracts were mixed with an excess of Pax-2B-containing extracts, both proteins formed complexes of similar intensity on G1–56 as compared with the individual binding reactions (Fig. 4 B). Competition of the Pax-2B and Pax-6 complexes on G1–56 revealed a better affinity of Pax-2B for G3 than for G1, whereas the opposite was observed for Pax-6. Similar qualitative results were obtained using Pax-2A (Fig.4 C). When a relative excess of Pax-6 versusPax-2A binding activity was used for EMSA, the Pax-2A complex was no longer detected in the combined reaction, and it reappeared only when Pax-6 was competed for by cold G1–56 oligonucleotides (Fig.4 C, right panel). We conclude that the differential affinity of Pax-2 and Pax-6 for G1 and G3, as observed in these competition experiments, provides an explanation of why both proteins form complexes of similar intensity on the G3 element using nuclear extracts from InR1G9 cells, whereas with the same extracts, binding of Pax-2 cannot be detected on G1–56 (Fig. 3). The consensus binding sequences of the Pax-2 and Pax-6 paired domains (41Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 43Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are highly similar and correspond well to the G3 element (Fig.4 D). Although G1 is a lower affinity binding site for both paired domains, this binding site is preceded by an ATTA sequence that may interact with the homeodomain of Pax-6. We indeed previously demonstrated that a Pax-6 protein containing the paired domain, linker domain, and homeodomain has a significantly better binding affinity for G1 compared with the paired domain alone (11Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pax-2 contains only a partial homeodomain that might be unable to interact with DNA (44Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), thus explaining its weaker interaction with G1 as compared with Pax-6. To test the effect of Pax-2 on the transcriptional activation of the glucagon gene promoter, we cotransfected InR1G9 cells with a CAT reporter plasmid driven by the full-length promoter (−292Glu) and increasing amounts of Pax-2 expression plasmids. Pax-2A and Pax-2B dose-dependently increased basal CAT activity by up to 6- and 9-fold, respectively (Fig.5 A). Similar qualitative results were obtained with reporter plasmids containing the individual Pax-2 binding sites, but strikingly, maximal transactivation by Pax-2 was much higher, reaching 46-fold on G3 and 112-fold on G1 (−138Glu), the lower affinity binding site. These data indicate that Pax-2 strongly transactivates the glucagon promoter in glucagon-producing cells through its interaction with the G1 and G3 elements. We then used the same reporter plasmids as above in the non-islet cell line BHK-21 to test whether Pax-2 directly activates the glucagon gene promoter. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of Pax-2A increased CAT activity of −292Glu, G3−31Glu, and −138Glu by up to 5-, 12-, and 10-fold respectively, whereas Pax-2B conferred an 18-, 18-, and 36-fold activation, respectively (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that, in InR1G9 and BHK-21 cells, 1) Pax-2B is a more potent transactivator than Pax-2A on the tested glucagon promoter constructs, particularly in BHK-21 cells and on −138GluCAT, and 2) transactivation of the full-length glucagon gene promoter by Pax-2A and Pax-2B is weaker than activation of either individual binding site. Since both G1 and G3 interact with Pax-2 and Pax-6, we compared the transactivation of different glucagon promoter constructs containing either one or both Pax binding sites (Fig. 6 A). CAT activity driven by the G3 element was similar with Pax-6, Pax-2A, or Pax-2B factors, corresponding to their roughly equal binding affinity to this site. This effect was specific inasmuch as a mutation of G3 that interferes with Pax-2 and Pax-6 binding (G3M6Glu; Ref. 26Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) strongly reduced effector-induced CAT activity. Surprisingly, transactivation of G1−31Glu by Pax-2 was only 30–50% lower than that of Pax-6 despite a significantly lower binding affinity of Pax-2 for G1 compared with Pax-6; this might be accounted for by the large amounts of Pax-2 present in transfected cells. CAT activity conferred by Pax-6 on −138Glu, comprising G1, did not increase significantly compared with G1 alone, whereas Pax-2A- and Pax-2B-mediated activity increased by 2.2- and 2.9-fold, respectively. These data indicate that Pax-2 might interact with additional sites within −138Glu; we indeed observed some transcriptional activation (5–6-fold) of promoter fragments comprising either the first 75 bp or the fragment from base pairs −140 to −100 of the promoter (data not shown). Using a reporter plasmid containing both Pax binding sites (G3−138Glu), additive transactivation by all three proteins as compared with the individual elements was observed. In contrast, CAT activity conferred by the full-length promoter (−292Glu) in the presence of Pax-6 or Pax-2 was less than 25% of that obtained with G3−138. We conclude that Pax-6 and the Pax-2 isoforms A and B transactivate the glucagon gene promoter through G1 and G3. We then assessed whether Pax-2 and Pax-6 were capable of functionally interacting on the G1 and G3 elements. When both cDNAs were cotransfected with either G3−31Glu or −138Glu, no significant increase of CAT activity as compared with either cDNA was observed (Fig. 6 B), except that Pax-2B was additive to Pax-6 on −138Glu, suggesting that Pax-2B might under these conditions interact with other sequences on −138Glu. We conclude from these experiments that Pax-2 and Pax-6 transactivate the glucagon promoter independently from the same binding site and without any functional interaction. Since Pax-2 is expressed in glucagon- and insulin-producing cells, we tested whether it affected insulin gene transcription. Cotransfection of either Pax-2A or Pax-2B in BHK-21 cells had no effect on a reporter construct driven by 410 bp of the rat insulin I gene promoter (Fig.7). Correspondingly, Pax-2 was unable to bind to the CII element, the Pax-6 binding site of the insulin I gene promoter (data not shown). We therefore conclude that Pax-2 transactivates the glucagon gene promoter but may have no role in insulin gene transcription. The functional role of Pax-2 in organogenesis has been extensively studied during kidney and brain development (15Dressler G.R. Deutsch U. Chowdhury K. Nornes H.O. Gruss P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13870-13875Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar); however, its molecular role is still poorly characterized. Only recently, a few Pax-2 in vivo target genes have been described. Pax-2 transcriptionally activates the Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1, Engrailed 2, and, cooperatively with homeodomain proteins, the Pax-5 enhancer (45Song D.L. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Joyner A.L. Development. 1996; 122: 627-635PubMed Google Scholar, 46McConnell M.J. Cunliffe H.E. Chua L.J. Ward T.A. Eccles M.R.

In addition, two Pax-2 target genes with yet unknown function have been identified by chromatin precipitation using mouse embryonic spinal cord (43Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Pax-2 is expressed in the endocrine pancreas and that it transactivates the glucagon gene promoter through twocis-acting sequences, G1 and G3. Both elements interact also with Pax-6, another member of the paired homeobox family; however, the affinity of Pax-2 and Pax-6 for G1 and G3 differs considerably. Both proteins formed complexes of similar intensity on G3 with nuclear extracts from glucagon-producing InR1G9 cells, and, in gel shift competition assays, Pax-2 had a slightly better affinity for G3 as compared with Pax-6. In contrast, Pax-6 bound G1 with an about 50-fold higher affinity than Pax-2; correspondingly, Pax-2 could not be detected within the complexes formed on G1 with InR1G9 nuclear extracts, suggesting that Pax-2 may interact with G1 only in the absence of Pax-6. The differential properties of Pax-6 and Pax-2 can be explained by their DNA binding domains. Pax-6 comprises two functional DNA binding domains and has been shown to recognize target genes either with its paired domain (e.g. the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM), its homeodomain (e.g. rhodopsin), or cooperatively by the paired domain and homeodomain (e.g.neural cell adhesion molecule L1, N-CAM L1) (48Chalepakis G. Wijnholds J. Giese P. Schachner M. Gruss P. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 49Holst B.D. Wang Y. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Pax-6 interacts with the glucagon gene element G3 through the paired domain, whereas high affinity binding of the G1 element requires the paired domain and homeodomain (11Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pax-2 contains a paired domain for which the consensus binding sequence matches nearly perfectly the G3 element (Fig. 4 D). The partial Pax-2 homeodomain, however, like its homologous domain in the Pax-5 protein, might not be capable of binding DNA but rather represent an interaction surface for the TATA-binding protein (44Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 51Eberhard D. Busslinger M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1716-1725Google Scholar). In glucagon-producing cells, Pax-2 might therefore predominantly interact with the glucagon gene element G3. Interestingly, G3 corresponds to the insulin response element of the glucagon gene (26Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the identification of Pax-6 and Pax-2 as G3-interacting proteins will now allow analysis of the molecular mechanisms of insulin action on the glucagon gene promoter. We detected two Pax-2 isoforms, Pax-2A and Pax-2B, in roughly equivalent amounts in rat islets, whereas Min6 and αTC1 cells contained Pax-2B and Pax-2D2 as major and minor isoforms, respectively. This different distribution might reflect changes in alternative splicing occurring during development of the endocrine pancreas or being induced by the generation of tumor cell lines. During kidney development and in Wilms tumor, Pax-2B is the major isoform with Pax-2A being 5-fold less abundant. Pax-2D represents a minor but nonnegligible fraction, and only traces of Pax-2C have been described (39Tavassoli K. Ruger W. Horst J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Concentrating on the two splicing forms found in adult islets, we analyzed the binding and transactivation properties of Pax-2 on the glucagon and insulin gene promoters. Pax-2 acted as a potent transactivator of the glucagon gene. Consistent with the similar binding affinity of Pax-2A and Pax-2B for the isolated G3 and G1 elements, both isoforms transactivated G3−31Glu and G1−31Glu to a similar extent. Our data are consistent with previous reports observing similar binding and transactivation of Pax-2A and Pax-2B on a Pax-2 consensus element and on three recognition sites identified by chromatin precipitation (6Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The role of the 23-amino acid insertion in Pax-2A versus Pax-2B (Fig. 2 A) remains thus to be defined. Surprisingly, transcriptional activation mediated by Pax-2 and more specifically by Pax-2B was markedly increased using the first 138 bp of the glucagon gene promoter. Since this reporter construct comprises only the G1 element as potential Pax-2 binding site (as assessed by gel retardation assays of sequence elements of the promoter; data not shown), our data suggest low and maybe nonspecific interactions of Pax-2 with additional binding sites in a situation of overexpression. Pax-2 activated the G3 and G1 elements similarly to Pax-6, a major transactivator of the glucagon gene. However, no functional interaction on transcription was observed when Pax-2 and Pax-6 were cotransfected into BHK-21 cells, a finding likely to be explained by the fact that both proteins bind to the same sites. These data open the question on the functional role of Pax-2 and Pax-6 in glucagon gene expression. The proximal promoter element G1 by itself confers only weak transcriptional activation and is dependent on either upstream enhancer element G2 or G3 for a high level of expression; on the other hand, G1 is required for G2 or G3 to enhance transcription, since deletion of G1 completely abolishes transcriptional activity (52Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The major enhancer element is represented by G2, deletion of which leads to an about 40% decrease in transcriptional activity, whereas deletion of G3 results in a 25% loss of activity (52Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the full-length promoter, G2 may therefore confer basal enhancer activity, whereas G3 may predominantly act to regulate glucagon gene expression in response to insulin (26Philippe J. Morel C.

Pax-2 and Pax-6 display similar binding and transactivation of the G3 element; furthermore, although Pax-2 binds G1 with much lower affinity compared with Pax-6, it is able to transactivate this element to a similar extent. Inactivation of Pax-2 and Pax-6 in glucagon-producing cells will be necessary to evaluate their respective role in transactivation and regulation of the glucagon gene promoter. Interestingly, we observed much lower activation of transcription by Pax-2 using the full-length promoter compared with G3−138Glu, suggesting the potential presence of negative acting ciselements either between base pairs −292 and −275 or between base pairs −230 and −138 of the glucagon gene promoter. Pax-2 has previously been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor on certain target elements including its own promoter; positive or negative effects on transcription seem to be determined by the sequence of the binding site with transcriptional repression requiring a consensus triple A motif (6Lechner M.S.

Despite its presence in insulin-producing cells, we observed no direct effect of Pax-2 on insulin gene expression; we cannot, however, exclude the possibility that Pax-2 interacts with binding sites distal from −410 bp. The functional role of Pax-2 in β cells remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, we report the detection of a third Pax protein in the endocrine pancreas, Pax-2. Pax-6 and Pax-4 have been shown to be crucial for the development of specific cell lineages in the endocrine pancreas. Whereas mice lacking Pax-6 do not form glucagon-producing α cells, inactivation of the Pax-4 gene has been shown to prevent β and δ cell differentiation. Furthermore, double mutant mice fail entirely to develop pancreatic islet cells (7Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Torres M. Oliver G. Gruss P.

Pax-2 mutant mice do exist and lead to severe malformations of the brain and a lack of the urogenital tract, but no pancreatic phenotype has so far been described.

The optimal configuration of sulfate esters on the N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1→4GlcNAc) core of sulfosialyl-LeX, however, remains unsettled. Using a panel of sulfated lactose (Galβ1→4Glc) neoglycolipids as substrates in direct binding assays, we found that 6′,6-disulfolactose was the preferred structure for L-selectin, although significant binding to 6′- and 6-sulfolactose was observed as well. Binding was EDTA-sensitive and blocked by L-selectin-specific monoclonal antibodies. Surprisingly, 6′,6-disulfolactose was poorly recognized by MECA-79, a carbohydrate- and sulfate-dependent monoclonal antibody that binds competitively to L-selectin ligands. Instead, MECA-79 bound preferentially to 6-sulfolactose. The difference in preferred substrates between L-selectin and MECA-79 may explain the variable activity of MECA-79 as an inhibitor of lymphocyte adhesion to high endothelial venules in lymphoid organs. Our results suggest that both Gal-6-SO4 and GlcNAc-6-SO4 may contribute to L-selectin recognition, either as components of sulfosialyl-LeX capping groups or in internal structures.

Sulfation analysis of acid-hydrolyzed glycans revealed monosulfated monosaccharides and disaccharides (N-acetyllactosamine) with equivalent levels of Gal-6-SO4 and GlcNAc-6-SO4. Analysis of the simplest oligosaccharide side chains identified equivalent levels of two novel sulfated isomers of sialyl-LeX (sLeX), 6′-sulfo-sLeX, containing Gal-6-SO4, and 6-sulfo-sLeX, containing GlcNAc-6-SO4 (see Fig.1), as capping groups of core-2 branched oligosaccharides. The finding of a sLeX motif was significant because this tetrasaccharide binds to all three selectins (reviewed in Refs.21Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin.

McGarvey G.J. Jablonowski J.A. Wong C.-H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 833-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).

In marked contrast, Feizi and co-workers found that this modification eliminates binding to L-selectin (28Galustian C. Lubineau A. le Narvor C. Kiso M. Brown G. Feizi T. J. Biol.

Previously, in an attempt to understand the contribution of the two sulfate esters in question to L-selectin binding, we synthesized a limited series of sulfated lactose derivatives (39Bertozzi C.R. Fukuda S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14271-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As inferred from the ability of these compounds to compete the binding of an L-selectin/IgG chimera to GlyCAM-1, 6′,6-disulfolactose (containing sulfate esters in positions analogous to those in 6′,6-disulfo-sLeX) exhibited significant affinity for L-selectin. In the present study, we have synthesized a more extensive series of mono- and disulfated lactose derivatives with various combinations of sulfate esters on Gal and Glc. These compounds were derivatized with lipid tails, creating neoglycolipids that could be coated onto wells of microtiter plates. Thus, direct binding studies could be done with L-selectin chimeras and L-selectin bearing lymphocytes, allowing specificity controls to verify that the observed binding was functionally relevant. These studies have led to the definition of the minimal sulfated structures that support recognition by L-selectin. In addition, we employed these compounds to investigate the epitope corresponding to MECA-79, a widely used monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes HEV-expressed ligands for L-selectin in human and other species (6Rosen S.D.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The MECA-79 epitope has been shown to be sulfation-dependent, but the structural context for this modification has heretofore not been defined (14Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D.

In the present study, we find that L-selectin favors the disulfated lactose derivative with modifications at both C-6 of Gal and C-6 of Glc, whereas MECA-79 favors the monosulfated lactose derivative bearing Glc-6-SO4. Ninety-six-well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Falcon 3912) were from Becton Dickinson, and 96-well polystyrene plates (Immulon II) were from Dynatech Laboratories, Inc. (Alexandria, VA). The sialyl-LeX analog neoglycolipid (aLeX),N-[O-(3-O-(2-acetic acid)-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-(1→4)-O-[(α-l-fucopyranosyl)-(1→3)]-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)]-1-acetamido-6-(10,12-pentacosadiynamide)-3-thiohexane, was a gift of Dr. Jon Nagy.

Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), EDTA, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (phosphatase substrate) were from Sigma. BCECF/AM was from Calbiochem. Allylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylformamide, and steroyl chloride were from Aldrich. The sialyllactose neoglycolipid was synthesized from 1-β-O-allyllactose by first forming an N-allyl glycoside (42Spevak W. Dasgupta F. Hobbs C.J. Nagy J.O. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 3244-3417Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and then coupling the glycosylamine to steroyl chloride. A solution of 0.63 g (1.0 mmol) of sialyllactose (NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4Glc) (Neose, Horsham, PA) in 10 ml of allylamine was stirred at room temperature for 72 h. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the resulting residue was suspended in hexanes and evaporated five times. The resultingN-allyl glycoside was suspended in 2.5 ml of dimethylformamide; 0.675 ml of steroyl chloride (0.61 g, 2.0 mmol) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide containing 0.697 ml of diisopropylethylamine (0.52 g, 4.0 mmol) was added dropwise over 10 min; and the solution was stirred vigorously for 60 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of methanol and extracted in a solution of 5 ml of hexanes and 5 ml of distilled water. The solution was centrifuged at high speed in a bench-top microcentrifuge. The unreacted steroyl chloride and diisopropylethylamine partitioned into the organic layer; the unreacted N-allylsialyllactose and diisopropylethylamine salts partitioned into the aqueous layer; and the neoglycolipid was trapped in a densely packed foam layer at the interface between the two solvents. This extraction was repeated five times, and the recovered foam layer was suspended in 40% aqueous acetonitrile, frozen, and lyophilized to yield 0.242 g (26%) of sialyllactose neoglycolipid. The calculated mass for C44H78N2O19 was 938.52, and the measured mass was 961.6 [M + Na]+ (liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry, positive mode). GlyCAM-1 was prepared as described previously (43Singer M. Rosen S.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 196: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse serum from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR) was extracted with 4 volumes of 2:1 chloroform/methanol, and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 2000 ×g. The upper aqueous layer was separated from the organic and precipitated protein layers, concentrated to one-half of the original serum volume by boiling, and dialyzed against 20 volumes of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with two changes. This preparation was then diluted with PBS back to the original serum volume and used as an enriched source of GlyCAM-1. GlyCAM-1 was captured onto Immulon II microtiter plate wells using a purified rabbit anti-GlyCAM-1 peptide polyclonal antibody, CAM02 (44Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Dowbenko D. Imai Y. Henzel W.J.

The recombinant human L-selectin/human IgM chimera was prepared by subcloning human L-selectin cDNA, a gift of Dr. Thomas Tedder, into the human IgM vector used to make the murine L-selectin/human IgM chimera. Recombinant protein was produced in transiently transfected COS-7 cells grown in Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The level of expression was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using immobilized goat anti-human IgM polyclonal antibody to capture the chimera from the supernatant and a goat anti-human IgM/alkaline phosphatase conjugate to detect the immobilized chimera. Human IgM was used as a standard. The chimeras were used as crude tissue culture supernatant. Purified MECA-79 (rat IgM) (40Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T.N. Butcher E.C. J.

Neurocytol. 1989; 18: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Hemmerich. Human IgM and the goat anti-human IgM/alkaline phosphatase conjugate were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-rat IgM/alkaline phosphatase was fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The anti-murine L-selectin monoclonal antibody MEL-14 (rat IgG2a) (1Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from hybridoma cell culture supernatant. The control for MEL-14 was an irrelevant rat IgG2a (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The anti-human L-selectin mAb DREG-56 (murine IgG1) and control murine IgG1 were from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The purified rabbit anti-GlyCAM-1 peptide polyclonal antibody CAM02 was generated as described previously (44Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Dowbenko D. Imai Y. Henzel W.J. Grimley C. Fennie C. Gillett N.

Neoglycolipids were resuspended in 85% aqueous ethanol containing 5 μg/ml cholesterol and 2.5 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine. Serial dilutions were coated onto polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates at 40 μl/well, and the solvent was evaporated at 37 °C. It is assumed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of this type that the input concentration of lipid accurately predicts the coating concentration. The finding that the rank orders of reactivity of the neoglycolipids for L-selectin, E-selectin, and MECA-79 are very distinct (see “Results”) indicates that the differences are not just due to variations in the amount of lipid coated. The coated wells were washed once with distilled water and then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h. Tissue culture supernatant containing the selectin/IgM chimera was diluted 1:1 in 2% BSA in PBS and incubated at 100 μl/well for 2 h. After two washes in PBS, goat anti-human IgM/alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in PBS was added at 100 μl/well for 45 min. After five washes in PBS, bound selectin/IgM chimera and human IgM were detected by the addition of phosphatase substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml) in 10% diethanolamine and 0.1 mm MgCl2) at 100 μl/well. Absorbances were recorded at 405 nm on a Bio-Rad microplate reader. All incubations and wash steps were performed at ambient temperature. Microtiter wells were coated with neoglycolipids and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS as described for the L-selectin direct binding assay. MECA-79 and the OZ-42 control antibody were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 1% BSA in PBS and incubated at 100 μl/well for 2 h. The wells were washed twice with PBS, and rabbit anti-rat IgM/alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in PBS was added at 100 μl/well for 45 min. After five washes in PBS, bound antibody was detected by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 100 μl/well. Absorbances were recorded at 405 nm. All incubations and wash steps were performed at ambient temperature. Microtiter plates were coated with 200 μm solutions of neoglycolipid in 85% ethanol, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, and 2.5 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine at 40 μl/well (8 nmol/well). The solvent was evaporated at 37 °C, and the wells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Anti-L-selectin or control mAb was diluted to 2 μg/ml in 2% BSA in PBS and added in equal volumes to tissue culture supernatants containing the L-selectin/IgM chimera. The solutions were incubated for 30 min and then transferred to the neoglycolipid-coated plates at 100 μl/well. After a 2-h incubation, bound chimera was probed and detected as described for the direct binding assay. All incubations and wash steps were performed at ambient temperature. Microtiter plates were coated with neoglycolipid and blocked as described for the antibody inhibition assay. Serial dilutions of EDTA in 2% BSA in PBS were combined in equal volumes with undiluted L-selectin/IgM-containing tissue culture supernatant and added to the neoglycolipid-coated wells at 100 μl/well. After a 2-h incubation, bound chimera was probed and detected as described for the direct binding assay. All incubations and wash steps were at ambient temperature. The EqCal software package (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used to calculate the free calcium and magnesium levels as a function of the amount of EDTA added to the Dulbecco's PBS/Opti-MEM sample buffer. The calculations were based on the following parameters: an initial concentration of 0.90 mm for calcium, an initial concentration of 0.75 mm for magnesium, pH 7.4, 25 °C, and an ionic strength of 0.1 m. L-selectin-expressing Jurkat T-cells were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Arthur Weiss and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Neoglycolipids were diluted to 200 μm in 85% ethanol, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, and 2.5 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine and coated onto microtiter plates at 40 μl/well (8 nmol/well). After drying, the wells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h. Jurkat cells were centrifuged and resuspended to 5 × 106/ml in 0.1% BSA in PBS. The fluorescent dye BCECF/AM was added at a dilution of 1:1000 from a 2 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated with the cells for 20 min in the dark. The labeled cells were centrifuged, resuspended to 2 × 106/ml in 0.1% BSA in PBS, and transferred to the neoglycolipid-coated plate at 100 μl/well. After 30 min, the plate was washed twice with PBS, and 0.1% BSA in PBS was added at 100 μl/well. Arbitrary fluorescence intensity units were recorded at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission on a CytoFluor II fluorescence multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To demonstrate L- selectin-dependent binding, some cells were incubated with 10 mm EDTA or with DREG-56 or a class-matched control antibody at 10 μg/ml for 20 min prior to incubation with the immobilized neoglycolipids. All reactions, washes, and centrifugation steps were performed at ambient temperature. Significant differences among means were determined by one-way analysis of variance. When significant differences were detected, multiple pairwise comparisons were performed using a Tukey test (SigmaStat statistical software, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Unless stated otherwise, the data shown are from representative experiments and are the average of duplicate wells after subtraction of background signal (carrier lipids only), with error bars denoting the range in signal. To investigate the contribution of sulfate esters in defined positions to L-selectin binding, serial dilutions of a panel of sulfated lactose neoglycolipids with 25-atom single chain hydrocarbon tails (Fig. 1) were immobilized on microtiter plate wells and assayed for their ability to support the binding of L-selectin/IgM chimeras. For both the human and murine L-selectin chimeras, the best substrate for binding was 6′,6-disulfolactose ((SO4-6)Galβ1→4(SO4-6)Glc), but significant binding was also observed with the 6′-sulfolactose ((SO4-6)Galβ1→4Glc) and 6-sulfolactose (Galβ1→4(SO4-6)Glc) derivatives (Fig.2, A and B). At a coating concentration of 5 nmol/well, 6′,6-disulfolactose generated a signal 2.4-fold greater than 6-sulfolactose (p < 0.001) and 2.8–3.6-fold greater than 6′- and 3′-sulfolactose ((SO4-3)Galβ1→4Glc) (p < 0.001). Differences in reactivity between 6′,6-disulfolactose and the other sulfated derivatives and between all of the sulfated derivatives and lactose or carrier lipids only (data not shown) were statistically significant (p < 0.001). These results are consistent with previous data in which similar compounds were used as soluble inhibitors of L-selectin binding to GlyCAM-1 (39Bertozzi C.R. Fukuda S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14271-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in the reactivity profiles between the human and murine chimeras; however, the murine chimera consistently generated higher signals than the human chimera at comparable concentrations. There was no detectable binding of either chimera to non-sulfated lactose or sialyllactose (data not shown). Gal-3-SO4 has not been detected in acid hydrolysates of GlyCAM-1 (18Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies have established binding of L-selectin to Gal-3-SO4-containing structures, including sulfatides, 3′-sulfo-Lea((SO4-3)Galβ1→3(Fucα1→4)GlcNAc), and 3′-sulfo-LeX((SO4-3)Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc) (28Galustian C.

A large family of zinc-dependent proteinases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),1is considered to be primarily responsible for this matrix catabolism (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin.

Details of their variety and substrate specificity are documented in several recent reviews (5Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 6Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). The MMPs consist of a large family of proteinases that share many common structural and functional elements. MMPs can be categorized based on amino acid sequence similarity, substrate specificity, and domain structure. They include collagenases, which cleave triple helical interstitial collagens; gelatinases, which cleave denatured collagen, elastin and type IV and V collagens; stromelysins, which mainly cleave proteoglycans; and membrane-type MMPs, which are associated with the activation of pro-MMPs (2Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 3Kiyama R. Tamura Y. Watanabe F. Tsuzuki H. Ohtani M. Yodo M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1723-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to these classical MMPs, other metalloproteinases, mainly with functions other than matrix catabolism, are being discovered at an increasing pace. All MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes and are usually secreted as inactive pro-MMPs. The primary structure of each MMP is composed of some of the following domain motifs: a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain that contains a zinc ion central to catalysis, a linker, a hemopexin-like domain, a fibronectin type II domain, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain (found in membrane-types 1–6), a furin-recognition sequence, and a vitronectin-like domain (7Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). Moreover, each member of the MMP family is characterized by a different domain composition, but contains a propeptide domain of about 80 amino acids with a conserved PRCGVPDV motive that ligates to the catalytic zinc ion via the cysteine residue to maintain the latency of the proenzyme (8Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 9Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K. Hermes J.D. Springer J.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain (about 170 amino acids) contains a zinc-binding motive HEXXHXXGXXH, and all MMPs except MMP-7 have a hemopexin-like domain (about 210 amino acids) at the carboxyl terminus. The hemopexin-like domain is reported to be required for the digestion of native collagen by collagenase-1, -2, and -3 as well as for the binding of TIMP-1 to progelatinase B and TIMP-2 to progelatinase A (10Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The first x-ray crystal structures of the recombinant catalytic domains of human fibroblast collagenase/MMP-1 (11Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G.

Importantly, these detailed atomic resolution structures have revealed the location of the conserved motifs and have enabled the assignment of substrate recognition sites on the proteinases. The catalytic domains of the MMPs have an ellipsoid shape with a small active site cleft on their surfaces. This cleft contains the catalytic zinc atom. Several studies have suggested that the catalytic domain of the isolated MMPs contains two zinc atoms (11Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G. McElroy A.B. Drewry D. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Soler D. Nomizu T. Brown W.E. Chen M. Ye Q.-Z. Van-Wart H.E. Auld D.S. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that are required for enzyme stabilization and catalysis. To date, however, none of these structural studies have dealt with natural or intact MMP-9. Recent reports and our results (reported here) suggest that the intact full-length MMPs contain only a single zinc atom. Together, these discrepant results suggest that the second zinc-binding site may result from a molecular rearrangement and subsequent structural stabilization due to truncation of the polypeptide chain (20Henning B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 725-728Google Scholar, 21Willenbrock F. Murphy G. Phillips I.R. Brocklehurst K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystal and NMR structures of the various MMPs provide a framework for the design of mechanistic studies. However, the actual mechanism of MMP catalysis has yet to be elucidated. Previous studies led to the formulation of the “cysteine switch hypothesis” as a model for understanding the unique structure of MMP zymogens and the means by which activation may be achieved in vitro (8Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cysteine switch model suggests that upon activation, the latent zinc-binding site is converted to a catalytic zinc-binding site by dissociation of the thiol-bearing propeptide from the zinc atom. Cleavage of the propeptide results in a breakdown of the prodomain structure of the enzyme, and the shielding of the catalytic zinc ion is withdrawn. Consequently, the metal ion and the active site pocket are accessible for substrate binding (22Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Human gelatinase B is a matrix metalloprotease (MMP-9) involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, development, and cancer (23Dubois B. Opdenakker G. Carton H. Acta Neurol. Belg. 1999; 99: 53-56PubMed Google Scholar, 24Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Importantly, this MMP is a marker of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (25Opdenakker G. Masure S. Grillet B. Van Damme J. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1991; 10: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gijbels K. Masure S. Carton H. Opdenakker G. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 41: 29-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, gelatinase B may play a role in the enzymatic degradation of the blood-brain barrier and may generate autoimmune peptides from intact myelin constituents, suggesting that it may be at the basis of autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis (27Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 103-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). By analogy with other proteases (28Liotta L.A. Rao C.N. Barsky S.H. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649PubMed Google Scholar), it has also been suggested that the secretion of gelatinase B may play a key role in tumor cell metastasis by providing the basis for the mechanism of extracellular matrix remodeling (29Rao J. Steck P.A. Mohanam S. Stetler-Stevenson W. Liotta L.A. Sawaya R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2208-2211PubMed Google Scholar,30Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils produce three major forms of pro-gelatinase B as follows: 92-kDa monomers, homodimers, and complexes of gelatinase B covalently bound to neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin (31Rudd P. Mattu T.S. Masure S. Bratt T. Van den Steen P. Wornald M.R. Kustner B. Harvery D.J. Borregaard N. Dwek R. Opdenakker G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13937-13950Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Gelatinase B is not produced constitutively by most cells, but instead its activity is induced by different stimuli depending on the cell type, thus providing a means of increasing the local concentration of gelatinolytic activity in response to specific physiological events. Therefore, it is considered to be one of the most complex MMPs in terms of regulation and expression, in addition to possessing a complex domain structure (23Dubois B. Opdenakker G. Carton H. Acta Neurol. Belg. 1999; 99: 53-56PubMed Google Scholar, 24Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Rudd P.

Acta. 1998; 1425: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that glycosylation of the gelatinase B molecule is considerable in terms of molecular volume, but the function of this post-translational modification is as yet not clear (31Rudd P. Mattu T.S. Masure S. Bratt T. Van den Steen P. Wornald M.R. Kustner B. Harvery D.J. Borregaard N. Dwek R. Opdenakker G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13937-13950Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, further structural analysis of the catalytic site of the full-length natural human gelatinase B may contribute to understanding its mode of action. Here we report on our x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies of the catalytic active site of natural human gelatinase B in its latent and activated states. The XAS results are consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the active sites of MMPs in latent and activated forms, which are also reported here. Our results demonstrate the molecular rearrangement and conformational changes that occur upon activation in human gelatinase B at the zinc site. In addition, we show by independent experimental procedures that natural human gelatinase B contains one zinc atom. Natural gelatinase B was isolated from human neutrophils by using a method modified from Masure et al. (24Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats (Red Cross, Antwerp, Belgium) (34Wuyts A. Govaerts C. Struyf S. Lenaerts J.-P. Put W. Conings R. Proost P. Van Damme J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After a 20-min preincubation with 3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 37 °C, 0.5 μmformyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and 3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to stimulate degranulation for the next 20 min. The cell supernatants were harvested, filtered, loaded on a gelatin-Sepharose substrate affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted as described (24Masure S. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The eluate was then dialyzed against assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20). In the next step, the covalent heterodimeric complex of gelatinase B with neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin was removed by affinity chromatography on a monoclonal antibody directed against neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin, courtesy of Dr. T. Bratt and Dr. N. Borregaard (35Strong R.K. Bratt T. Cowland J.B. Borregaard N. Wiberg F.C. Ewald A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purity of gelatinase B was controlled by reducing and non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein staining. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and according to amino acid composition analysis. The active site of gelatinase B was titrated using different concentrations of recombinant human TIMP-1 (Calbiochem) in an enzyme activity assay with a fluorogenic peptide, as described by Knight et al. (37Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The enzyme samples and the appropriate controls were analyzed by gelatin substrate zymography (38Masure S. Billiau A. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This technique provides information about the molecular size and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Gelatinase B activity was measured and quantified by the conversion of a fluorogenic peptide (37Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The metal content in gelatinase B samples was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy using the ICP-AES model “Spectroflame” from Spectro (Kleve, Germany). Prior to measurement, the samples were digested with nitric acid, and the volume was adjusted to 6 ml (final concentration 10%). The zinc content in the protein samples was determined relative to an equivalent amount of gelatinase assay buffer. Enzymatic activity was checked for all samples by zymography and by the conversion of the fluorogenic peptide before XAS data collection. The enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Millipore Centricon-30 (Bedford, MA) apparatus to make a final concentration of 70 μm (6.4 mg/ml). Samples were loaded into copper sample holders (10 × 5 × 0.5 mm) covered with Mylar tape and were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then mounted inside a Displex closed cycle helium cryostat and their temperature was maintained at 30 K to minimize the thermal disorder in the XAS data. XAS data collection was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, beam line X9B. The spectra were recorded at the zinc K-edge in fluorescence geometry at low temperature (30 K). The beam energy was defined using a flat silicon(111) monochromator crystal. The incident beam intensity I0 was recorded using an ionization chamber. The fluorescence intensity was recorded using a 13-element germanium detector. The transmission signal from a zinc foil was measured with a reference ion chamber simultaneously with fluorescence in order to calibrate the beam energy. Several scans of each sample were collected for a total of 1 × 106 counts across the edge. The samples were checked for burning marks after each scan, and the beam position on the sample was changed before each scan to minimize radiation damages. Enzyme activity was checked after exposure to x-rays, and the enzyme was found to be fully active. The average zinc K-edge absorption coefficient μ(E), which was obtained after several independent XAS measurements for each sample, was aligned in absolute energy, using the reference zinc metal foil XAS data as an absolute energy calibrant. Subsequently, the absorption coefficients for different samples were shifted in x-ray energy until their first inflection points were aligned at the same energy (9658 eV). This alignment ensured, to a good approximation, that the same x-ray energy,E 0 = 9658 eV could be used as the photoelectron energy origin in all data sets. The smooth atomic background was removed with the AUTOBK program of the UWXAFS data analysis package, developed at the University of Washington, Seattle (39Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 208/209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The same energy, E 0 = 9658 eV, was chosen for the purpose of background removal as the origin of the photoelectron energy. The R space region for minimizing the signal below the first shell was chosen between 1 and 1.2 Å. After the removal of background, the useful k range in the resultant k 2 weighted χ(k) was between 2.5 and 9 Å−1. Model data for the fitting procedure were constructed by extracting the catalytic zinc site coordinates (in a radius of 6 Å) from the crystallographic coordinates of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) derived from the protein data bank (code 1SLM) (9Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M. Cameron P.M. Esser C.K. Hermes J.D. Springer J.P.

By using the computer code FEFF7 (41Rehr J.J. Mustre, de leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5138Crossref Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 42Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Ankudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 52: 2995-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar), we calculated the theoretical photoelectron scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Total theoretical χ(k) was constructed by adding the most important partial χ(k)s that contributed to ther range of interest. The theoretical XAFS signal was fitted to the experimental data using the non-linear least squares method, implemented in the program FEFFIT (39Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 208/209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (921) Google Scholar) in R space, by Fourier transforming both theory and data. Data and theory were weighted by k and multiplied by a Hanning window function in Fourier transforms. The DFT computational method B3LYP was applied on a model of the first coordination shell around the catalytic zinc ion in the MMPs. The B3LYP/3-21G method was employed for full optimization of the initial model structures, and the optimized structures were then subjected to further optimization with B3LYP/6-31G*. Based on the optimized geometries, the frequency calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory in order to verify the accuracy of the optimized structures and to determine the zero point and vibrational energies, enthalpy, and entropy parameters. All quantum mechanic calculations were carried out with the Gaussian98 program (44Frisch, M. G., Trucks, G. W., H. B., Schlegel, G. E., Scuseria, M. A., Robb, J. R., Cheeseman, V. G., Zakrzewski, J. A., Montgomery, R. E., Jr., Stratmann, J. C., Burant, S., Dapprich, J. M., Millam, A. D., Daniels, K. N., Kudin, M. C., Strain, O., Farkas, J., Tomasi, V., Barone, M., et al. (1998) Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA.Google Scholar). The active site structures of the catalytic zinc ion in natural gelatinase B from neutrophils, in its latent and activated states, were studied by x-ray absorption, near edge structure (XANES), and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. EXAFS is a valuable technique for elucidating the structure of a variety of metal sites in metalloproteins (45Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-458Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). More specifically, EXAFS measures the transition from the core electronic states of the metal to the excited electronic or continuum states. Spectral analysis near the electronic transition (XANES) provides information about the charge state of the metal and its geometry. Spectral analysis above the absorption edge, in the EXAFS region, provides complementary structural information such as coordination numbers, types, and distances from neighboring atoms to the central (absorbing) atom. In addition, XAS is an excellent structural tool to probe the d10 zinc ion, which is generally spectroscopically silent (46Kleifeld O. Frenkel A. Bogin O. Eisenstein M. Brumfeld V. Burstein Y. Sagi I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7702-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore conducted XAS studies to examine the nature and bonding of active site ligands and the changes in metal site structures upon activation of human gelatinase B. Furthermore, EXAFS analysis was used to examine the zinc stoichiometry in human gelatinase B. For fixed geometry of the fluorescence EXAFS experiment, the edge step of the x-ray absorption coefficient should be proportional to the concentration of the absorbing element. Therefore, the number of zinc atoms per protein can be determined by comparing the edge-step intensity measured in the enzyme absorption coefficient data with the calibration curve obtained for standard compounds, where the edge step is measured as a function of the zinc concentration. Aqueous solutions in the range of 0.5–1.5 mm of ZnCl2were chosen as standard compounds for the purpose of edge intensity calibration. The calibration curve presented in Fig.1 shows a linear relationship between the edge- step intensity changes and the function of increasing zinc ion concentration (linearity in the lower concentrations of the calibration curve was obtained by linear extrapolation to zero). The enzyme concentration was independently obtained to be 0.07 mm by conducting an amino acid analysis experiment, a standard Bradford assay, and by titration of the active enzyme with TIMP-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). To obtain the estimated concentration of zinc ion in the enzyme as measured by XAS, we crossed the experimental edge-step intensity value of gelatinase B with the calibration curve. The concentration of zinc ion obtained by this type of analysis was 0.065 mm which is consistent with one zinc atom per enzyme (Fig. 1). These results were repeated using different protein preparation batches and different germanium detectors in measuring the XAS. Since the edge-step analysis may deviate from linearity because of detector limitation at very low concentrations, we further examined the zinc stoichiometry by ICP-AES.Figure 1Edge-step analysis of natural human gelatinase B. The edge intensity of human gelatinase B is compared with the standard calibration curve. Proteins and standards were measured and processed with identical procedures. The zinc:enzyme ratio is consistent with 1:1 stoichiometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The atomic absorption signal of the enzyme was measured and placed on a standard calibration curve, which was obtained by measuring standards of known zinc concentrations in the range of 0–1000 parts/billion. The zinc content of the buffer solution was 2 parts/billion. The enzyme was diluted by a factor of 240 before measuring the atomic absorption. The zinc concentration in the enzyme was 17 parts/billion, which is equivalent to 62 μm in the zinc concentration (the enzyme concentration was 70 μm as described). These results show that the zinc content in the enzyme is consistent with one zinc ion per enzyme in a ratio of 0.89:1 zinc to protein and were found to be in good agreement with our edge-step analysis. The presence of single as opposed to multiple zinc sites simplifies the EXAFS data analysis procedure, since the curve-fitting analysis of the local environment around the multiple zinc ions requires an excessive number of structural variables in the analysis. However, we further examined the possibility of the contribution of multiple zinc atoms by non-linear curve-fitting EXAFS analysis to be detailed. EXAFS analysis of human gelatinase B, in its latent and activated forms, was conducted by fitting the data to theoretical phase shifts and amplitudes. Theoretical models of the proposed structural and catalytic zinc sites were constructed from the crystal structure of MMP-3 (9Becker J.W. Marcy A.I. Rokosz L.L. Axel M.G. Burbaum J.J. Fitzgerald P.M.

In human malignant melanoma the development of advanced and metastatic disease is associated with the induction or up-regulation of the 113-kDa highly glycosylated integral membrane protein, MCAM1/MUC18 (CD146). MCAM is predominantly expressed by smooth muscle and vascular endothelium in normal adult tissues (4Lehmann J.M. Holzmann B. Breitbart E.W. Schmiegelow P. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 841-845PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shih I.M. Elder D.E. Speicher D. Johnson J.P. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2514-2520PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to function as a cell adhesion molecule, mediating cation independent adhesion through interaction with an unidentified ligand (6Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Jansen B. Markhof E. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 769-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shih I.M. Speicher D. Hsu M.Y. Levine E. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar). MCAM was originally identified as a melanoma-associated antigen and is only rarely observed on carcinomas (8Shih I.M. Hsu M.Y. Palazzo J.P. Herlyn M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rummel M.M. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2218-2223PubMed Google Scholar). In melanoma MCAM is a progression antigen, being strongly expressed only in malignant melanocytic lesions and increasing in frequency and strength with increasing vertical thickness of primary tumors. The strongest expression is observed in metastatic lesions (4Lehmann J.M. Holzmann B. Breitbart E.W. Schmiegelow P. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 841-845PubMed Google Scholar, 10Holzmann B. Bröcker E.B. Lehmann J.M. Ruiter D.J. Sorg C. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Studies in animal models suggest that MCAM may in fact play a role in tumor growth or metastasis formation in vivo. De novo expression of MCAM cDNA conferred metastatic potential, as assessed in experimental metastasis assays, to two independent MCAM negative human melanoma cell lines (11Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schlagbauer-Wadl H. Jansen B. Müller M. Polterauer P. Wolff K. Eichler H.G. Pehamberger H. Konak E. Johnson J.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 81: 951-955Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In unrelated experiments, the generation of highly tumorigenic variants by insertional mutagenesis in the slow growing melanoma cell line WM35 was also associated with an induction or up-regulation of MCAM (13Bani M.R. Rak J. Adachi D. Wiltshire R. Trent J.M. Kerbel R.S. Ben-David Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3068-3075Google Scholar). Inasmuch as MCAM expression by melanomas appears to be associated with tumor growth and/or metastatic capacity, it is important to understand how its expression in these cells is regulated. The MCAM 5′ region contains multiple potential binding sites for Sp1 and AP-2 and a CRE (14Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and two recent studies have examined the role of these elements in regulating expression in melanomas. Jean et al. (15Jean D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16501-16508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that constitutive MCAM expression in melanoma cells is due to the loss of the transcription factor AP-2 which represses MCAM promoter activity. Karlen and Braathen (16Karlen S. Braathen L.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were unable to identify a role for AP-2 and concluded that Sp1 is necessary and sufficient to account for constitutive MCAM expression in melanoma cell lines. In the study presented here, approximately 1 kilobase of the 5′ region of the human MCAM gene has been analyzed for promoter activity and transcription factor binding in 3 MCAM positive and 3 MCAM negative cells lines. Deletion and site-specific mutational analyses indicate that Sp1, CRE, and AP-2 are all important regulators of MCAM transcription in melanoma cell lines. Functional AP-2 was observed in both MCAM expressing and nonexpressing cells indicating that MCAM expression does not require the loss of this transcription factor. Furthermore, in this larger panel of cells, 5′ region activity as assessed in transient transfection assays did not correlate with MCAM expression. These results indicate that additional elements are involved in regulating MCAM expression in melanoma cells. Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), obtained through exchange, or established in our laboratory. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. A 934-bpSalI-XbaIII MCAM genomic DNA fragment, isolated from a human leukocyte genomic library (14Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a source for all promoter-luciferase constructs (accession number X68264). A SacI restriction site which was necessary for subsequent 5′-3′ unidirectional digestion by exonuclease III (Erase-a-base system from Promega, Madison, WI)) was introduced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly 5′ of the MCAM DNA fragment. The deletion construct mcluc-173 was generated by exonuclease III digestion. All other constructs were prepared by restriction enzyme digestion (mcluc-106, mcluc-62, and mcluc-7) or by PCR amplification (mcluc-37 and mcluc-del) with sequence-specific oligonucleotides containing the desired restriction sites. Site-specific mutations were introduced using mutated oligonucleotides. For some of the mutations (mcluc-mAP2–131 and mcluc-mAP2–302) the Quick Change system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used and the mutated region was subsequently subcloned into the full-length 5′ region construct mcluc-912. Because of the high GC content of the MCAM promoter, all PCR reactions contained 20% Q solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Mutant constructs were produced using the following specific primers: mcluc-CREmut (−32 bp, TGACGTCA to TCAGGACA) 5′-CAGCTCGAGGCTGCCGGGGGCTGTCCTGAGGG-3′; mcluc-mAP2–23 (−23 bp, CCCCGGC to TTCCCTTC in the context of the deletion construct mcluc-106) 5′-CAGCTCGAGGCTGAAGGGAACTGACGTCAG-3′; mcluc-mAP2+14 (+14 bp, CCTCCGGC to TTTCCTTC; 5′-GCTCAGATCTCGGGAAGGAAAGCGAGAGCC-3′) mcluc-mAP2–131 (−131 bp, CGGGGCCCG to CTGTGCCCG; 5′-GCTGGCGGCGCCTGTGCCCGCCCCCTAGGGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCCCTAGGGGGCGGGCACAGGCGCCGCCAGC-3′), mcluc-mAP2–302 (−302 bp, CCCGGGGC to CTCGGCTC; 5′-GGCTGGCTTCGACTCGGCTCGACTCCGGGCATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCCCGGAGTCGAGCCGAGTCGAAGCCAGCC-3′). All constructs used in this study were sequenced to ensure that only the intended deletions and mutations were introduced. For transfection of the reporter constructs, the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 2.5 × 105 cells were transfected with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent and 1 μg of DNA and assayed 48 h later using luciferase lysis and assay reagents from Promega. 20 μl of cell lysate was measured with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent. Expression of luciferase in cells transfected with the promoterless pXP-2 vector and the pXP-2 plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. To standardize the measured relative light units, the protein content of the lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) and luciferase activity was presented as relative light units/μg of protein. Transfections were carried out in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were performed, using different batches of DNA. DNA was prepared using the JETSTAR 2.0 Plasmid kit (Genomed Inc., Bad Oeyenhausen, Germany). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modified method of Schreiber et al.(18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 107 cells were washed 3 times in PBS and lysed in 2 ml of low salt buffer A (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, complete Mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) + 1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2200 rpm, 4 °C, and washed once with 2 ml of buffer A + Nonidet P-40. 300 μl of buffer C (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, Complete Mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture) was added to 500 μl of pellet volume. The salt concentration of the nuclear suspension was adjusted to 0.4 mm NaCl and nuclear protein was extracted on ice for 45–60 min. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatants aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. CRE binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 15 μl containing 5 μg of nuclear extract and 10,000 cpm of double-stranded MCAM-specific oligonucleotide (5′-CCCCTGACGTCAGCC-3′) in binding buffer (120 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc (Sigma), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)). For supershift assays, proteins were incubated with DNA for 20 min and anti-CREB-1 antibody (1 μl) or control serum (1 μl) added, for a further 20 min (room temperature). Sp1-binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in a 40-μl reaction volume containing 5 μg of nuclear extract and 40,000 cpm of labeled MCAM-specific oligonucleotide (5′-CCTCCCCCGCCCCCC-3′) in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly (dI-dC), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm Pefabloc). In assays with antibodies, the standard binding reaction was performed for 15 min on ice and anti-Sp1 antibody (2 μl) or control serum (2 μl) was added and incubation was continued for another 25 min. AP-2 mobility shift reactions contained 17 μl of the premixed incubation buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 50,000 cpm oligonucleotide (5′-GAACTGACAGCCCCCGGCAGCCCCCG-3′, MCAM-specific sequence is underlined), and 10 μg of nuclear extract in a reaction volume of 25 μl. The reaction was incubated for 20 min on ice. For supershift reactions, antibodies (4 μl of anti-AP-2 or 4 μl of control serum) were added for the last 20 min of a 40-min incubation of protein with DNA. Double-stranded MCAM-specific oligonucleotides containing the CRE, Sp1, and AP-2 sites in the core promoter were end labeled with γ-32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nonlabeled competitor oligonucleotides, when used, were added at the same time as the labeled oligomers. Antibodies to transcription factors and the oligonucleotides containing the consensus recognition motifs used in EMSA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human recombinant AP-2 was purchased from Promega. The contents of the binding reactions were electrophoresed at room temperature on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA running buffer for 2–3 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For MCAM Western blotting, cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and protease inhibitors. The protein content of the samples was measured using the Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad). 0.5 mg of protein lysate was precleared by overnight incubation with horse serum-saturated Sepharose. After preclearing, the samples were exposed to anti-MCAM monoclonal antibody MUC18BA.3, bound to Protein G-agarose (Sigma), overnight at 4 °C. The bound material was eluted from the washed immunosorbents (95 °C, 5 min), separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibody MUC18BA.3 followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (anti-IgM + IgG) 1:5000 (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). The membranes were washed in PBS + 0.1% Tween and the bound antibody was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the detection of AP-2 protein, 30 μg of nuclear extract was separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 1% casein in PBS and incubated with anti-AP-2 serum (C-18, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin 1:8000 (Dako). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy extraction kit from Qiagen. The RNA preparation was subjected to DNase I digestion and phenol extraction followed by RNA precipitation with 100% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. 5 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed in a reaction volume of 20 μl using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5% of the first strand reaction was used for PCR. Samples were subjected to 35 rounds of temperature cycling (94 °C for 35 s, 58 °C for 55 s, 70 °C for 50 s). AP-2 α cDNA-specific primers (5′-GTTACCCTGCTCACATCACTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCGGTGAGATAGTTCTGCAG-3′) are expected to yield a 359-bp fragment. AP-2B cDNA-specific primers (5′-GTTACCCTGCTCACATCACTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAAGGATGGAGGTATAGGAG3′) are expected to yield a 223-bp fragment. The MCAM 5′ region contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but instead an initiator sequence surrounding the transcriptional start 29 bp upstream of the first ATG (14Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The 150-bp region immediately upstream of the initiator is highly GC-rich and contains five potential recognition sequences for the transcription factor Sp1 (−41/−36 bp, −72/−67 bp, −77/−72 bp, −100/−95 bp, and −125/−119 bp), two for AP-2 (−23 bp, −131 bp) and a consensus sequence motif for the cAMP response element at position −32. Additional AP-2 elements are found further upstream at −302 and −505 and downstream at position +14. At positions −208 and −591 CArG box motifs (5′-CC(A or T)6GG) are present and at position −236 is a binding element for the transcription factor MyoD. In order to examine the role of elements in the 5′ region of the MCAM gene in regulating tissue restricted expression, 934 bp (−912/+22 bp) of this region were fused to the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter gene. This construct as well as serially 5′ truncated fragments and constructs carrying deletions and site directed mutations (Fig.1 A) were assessed for activity by transient transfection in a panel of cell lines. The cell lines examined consisted of four melanomas, a glioma, and a colon carcinoma. MCAM expression in these cell lines as determined by Western blotting is shown in Fig. 1 B. MCAM-specific bands at 113 and 100 kDa can be seen in the melanoma cell lines MelJuSo (lane 1) and WM2664 (lane 2) and in the glioma cell line LN215 (lane 6), but not in the melanoma cell lines SB-2 (lane 3) and Mel888 (lane 4) or in the carcinoma cell line Colo320 (lane 5). This MCAM expression pattern was confirmed using immune fluorescence and RT-PCR (data not shown). The luciferase activity driven by the 934-bp MCAM 5′ region (mcluc-912) in each of these cell lines is shown in Fig. 1 C. The promoterless plasmid pXP-2 was used as negative control and luciferase activity is presented as relative light units/μg of protein. Expression ranged from 800-fold (SB-2) to 104-fold (Mel888) over that observed for pXP-2. Luciferase activity driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was higher but showed a similar expression pattern (data not shown), suggesting that the differences observed between the cells reflect differences in transfection efficiencies. The MCAM full-length construct is strongly expressed in both MCAM expressing and MCAM nonexpressing cells indicating that MCAM expression is not solely determined by the transactivating factors which bind to this region. The activity of a series of deletion constructs was similar in all cells and results are presented for LN215, Mel888, and WM2664 (Fig.2). In these studies the luciferase activity of the various constructs is presented in relation to that of the full-length mcluc-912 which was set at 100%. The expression of construct mcluc-del bearing an internal deletion of 151 bp directly upstream of the transcriptional start, was less then 10% of that observed with the intact 5′ region (mcluc-912), indicating a critical role for this region in MCAM transcription. The luciferase activity driven by constructs mcluc-173, consisting solely of the deleted region plus the initiator, and mcluc-106 were similar to (LN215) or higher than (Mel888, WM2664) that observed with the full-length 912-bp region. These observations indicate that all of the information required for optimal promoter activity is present in the first 128 base pairs of the MCAM 5′ region. Further deletion of Sp1 sites (mcluc-62 and mcluc-37) reduced promoter activity to less than 20% of the full-length clone indicating an important role of Sp1 as a transcriptional activator of MCAM expression. The additional deletion of the putative CRE (−32 bp) and the AP2 site at −23 bp (mcluc-7) abolished the remaining activity in all examined cell lines. The minimal region of the MCAM promoter required to drive transcription is therefore included in the 128-bp region from −106 to +22 bp. This region contains 4 Sp1 sites, a CRE site, two AP2-binding sites, and the initiator surrounding the transcription start. DNA mobility shift assays, using an MCAM-specific DNA fragment (−47 bp/−33 bp) containing the proximal Sp1 site produced a double band DNA-protein complex with nuclear extracts from all 6 cell lines. As shown for the cell line MelJuSo (Fig.3 A), this complex was abolished by an excess of unlabeled probe (lanes 2 and3) and by addition of unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lane 4), but not by mutated Sp1 sequence (lane 5) or by an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for the CREB/ATF family (lane 6). An antibody directed against Sp1 specifically blocked formation of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) indicating that the protein binding to this site is immunologically related to Sp1. To assess the role of the cAMP responsive element at −32 bp in the regulation of basal MCAM expression, this site was mutated in the context of the full-length construct and tested in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig.4 A, mutation of the CRE site reduced reporter activity by approximately 70% compared with mcluc-912 in five of the six tested cell lines indicating that this site plays an important role in the MCAM core promoter. Interestingly no reduction of luciferase expression with the CRE mutant could be observed in the cell line WM2664. DNA shift analyses were performed with a MCAM-specific oligonucleotide including this motif (−36 bp/−22 bp). A complex consisting of a double band was detected in nuclear extracts from all 6 cell lines (Fig. 4 B). Binding was abrogated by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 2) and by an excess of consensus CRE oligonucleotide (lane 3), but not by addition of a mutated CRE oligonucleotide (lane 4) or an AP-2 binding motif (lane 5). Identical results were obtained with nuclear extracts from WM2664 and MelJuSo. The observed DNA-protein complex could be partially supershifted with anti-CREB-1 antibody (Fig.4 C, lane 2), indicating that one of the proteins binding to this sequence is CREB1. Although specific protein binding to the CRE site was also shown for the cell line WM2664 this regulatory element seems not to be as important in mediating transcriptional activation as in the other cell lines examined. A perfect consensus AP-2-binding site is located at −23 bp within the MCAM core promoter. To test the role of this site in MCAM transcription it was mutated in the construct mcluc-106, which still shows optimal promoter activity. Luciferase activity driven by mcluc-106 and by the AP-2 mutant (mcluc-mAP2–23) were compared in the six cell lines. As seen in Fig.5 A, mutation of this AP-2 site increased luciferase expression 2.5–5-fold in all four melanoma cell lines indicating that this AP-2 site acts as a negative element in basal expression. The AP-2 mutation had no effect on reporter activity in the carcinoma cell line Colo320 or in the glioma cell line LN215. Gel retardation assays were performed using an oligonucleotide containing the MCAM specific AP-2–23 binding site. This probe reacted with nuclear extracts from all the melanoma cell lines (Fig. 5,B, lanes 1, 6, 7 and 10). This binding is specific as it was abrogated by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 2) and AP-2 consensus binding motif (lane 3), but not by a mutated AP-2 motif (lane 4) or by a Sp1 binding motif (lane 5). No complex formation was detected in the glioma cell line LN215 (lane 8) or in the carcinoma cell line Colo320 (lane 9), observations which are consistent with results of the reporter assays. Antibody supershift experiments identified AP-2 α as the major regulatory factor interacting with the promoter proximal AP-2-binding site in the MCAM 5′ region. As Fig. 5 C shows, anti-AP-2 α antibody supershifted the DNA-protein complex (lane 2) while the control serum did not (lane 3). Incubation of recombinant human AP-2 (rh-AP-2) with the MCAM-specific probe (lane 7) led to formation of a similar complex that was also supershifted with anti-AP-2 α antibody (lane 8). Addition of an anti-AP-2 β antibody (lane 4), or the same amount of control serum (lane 6) to the nuclear extracts did not alter the DNA-protein complex formation. However an anti-AP-2 γ antibody resulted in a faint supershifted band suggesting that AP-2 γ participates in the binding at this site. In light of the observation that mutation of the AP-2-binding site at −23 bp led to an increase in reporter gene activity, the putative AP-2-binding sites at +14, −131, and −302 were also individually mutated and examined for activity in Mel JuSo. As shown in Fig.5 D, mutation of the AP-2-binding site at +14 did not significantly affect the activity of the MCAM promoter, while mutation of the sites at −131 or −302 reduced promoter activity (by 70 and 44%, respectively). Mutations in the AP-2-binding sites led to changes in transcriptional activity only in the melanoma cells. The fact that AP-2 binding was also only observed in these cells raises the question of whether or not AP-2 is expressed in the glioma and carcinoma cell lines. In order to determine this, all of the cell lines were examined for AP-2 expression using RT-PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6 A, AP-2 α mRNA expression was observed in all cells except the carcinoma cell line Colo320 (lane 6). Compared with the melanoma cells, the glioma cells appear to express a lower level of AP-2 mRNA. RT-PCR analyses for AP-2B mRNA, a dominant-negative acting splice variant, indicated that it is expressed in all cells except the carcinoma cell line Colo320 (Fig. 6 D). Expression of AP-2 protein was analyzed by Western blot. 30 μg of nuclear protein were analyzed from each cell and the position of the AP-2 band was determined from the migration of recombinant AP-2 (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). Incubation of an identical blot with control serum indicated that the smaller band is not AP-2 related (data not shown). AP-2 protein was observed in all four melanoma cell lines (lanes 3–6) but was undetectable in the glioma cell line LN215 (lane 7) and in the carcinoma cell line Colo320 (lane 2). The observed lack of AP-2 binding in LN215 and Colo320 can therefore be explained by the absence of detectable AP-2 protein. The highest AP-2 expression appears to be in the MCAM positive cell line WM2664 and in the MCAM negative cell line Mel888. These results show that the transcription factor AP-2 is expressed at similar levels in MCAM positive and in MCAM negative melanoma cells. Expression of the cell adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 is characteristic of malignant melanomas where it increases in frequency and strength with increasing tumor growth and progression to metastatic disease. In light of the evidence that MCAM may actually play a role in tumor growth or metastasis formation in vivo (11Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schlagbauer-Wadl H. Jansen B. Müller M. Polterauer P. Wolff K. Eichler H.G. Pehamberger H. Konak E. Johnson J.P. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3068-3075Google Scholar), an understanding of how expression of this molecule is regulated is of great importance. In this study transient transfection, site-directed mutagenesis, and transcription factor binding were used to define the major regulatory elements present in the 5′ region of the human MCAM gene. The MCAM core promoter was shown to comprise the region from −106 bp to +22 bp containing 4 Sp1 sites, 1 cAMP response element, and two AP-2 sites near the initiator motif containing the transcriptional start (14Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using oligonucleotide competition experiments Karlen and Braathen (16Karlen S. Braathen L.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) could demonstrate only Sp1 binding to the MCAM promoter and concluded that this transcription factor was sufficient to drive constitutive MCAM expression in melanomas. Confirmation that Sp1 is an important regulator of MCAM expression is seen here in the results of deletion analysis where removal of all putative Sp1 sites reduced the promoter activity by 80%. However, site-directed mutagenesis also revealed important regulatory roles for the CRE element at −32 and for several of the putative AP-2-binding sites in the majority of cells studied, and CREB-1 and AP-2 were shown to specifically bind to the MCAM promoter in these cell lines. Mutation of the CRE element which was shown to bind CREB-1, reduced promoter activity by 70% in 5 of the 6 cells examined. A role for CRE in regulating constitutive MCAM expression was suggested by Xie et al. (19Xie S.H. Price J.E. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) who observed that transfection of the melanoma cell line MeWo with a dominant negative CREB mutant led to down-regulation of MCAM expression. The CRE element does not play a crucial role in MCAM expression in all cells inasmuch as mutation of this element did not effect basal MCAM transcriptional activity in the melanoma cell line WM2664. MCAM expression can be up-regulated by exposure to elevated cAMP levels (9Rummel M.M. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2218-2223PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this CRE element may also mediate inducible MCAM expression. A dual role of the CRE in promoting basal and inducible transcription has been described for other genes (20Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Medcalf R.L. Ruegg M. Schleuning W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14618-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutation of the AP-2 sites at +14, −23, −131, and −302 bp suggested that this transcription factor influences MCAM promoter activity in a complex manner. While mutation of the site at +14 bp had no effect on promoter activity, mutation at −23 bp increased reporter activity up to 5-fold and mutations at −131 and −302 bp decreased reporter activity by 70 and 55%, respectively, in melanoma cell lines. The activating role of the AP-2 site at −302 bp is also apparent in the analysis of the deletion constructs as deletion of the region between −341 and −258 bp leads to a reduction in transcriptional activity only in AP-2 positive cells (data not shown). The reduction in reporter activity between mcluc-173 and mcluc-106 is observed in all cells suggesting that positively and negatively acting elements are present in this region. Functional AP-2-binding sites mediating transcriptional activation are frequently found upstream of the core promoter region (22Hyman S.E. Comb M. Pearlberg J. Goodman H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) while AP-2 sites localized within the core promoter have been shown to mediate repression in a variety of genes (24Chen T.-T. Wu R.-L. Castro-Munozledo F. Sun T.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3056-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Chen A. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25994-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EMSAs and supershift analyses indicated specific binding of AP-2 complexes (predominantly AP-2 α homodimers) to the element at −23 bp. The AP-2 mutations had no influence on reporter activity assessed in the glioma or carcinoma cells lines and no AP-2 binding complexes were observed in either cell. Both cells were shown by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis to lack AP-2 expression The use of a larger panel of MCAM positive and MCAM negative cell lines in the present study has led to conclusions which differ in several respects from previously reported studies. Although Karlan and Braathan (16Karlen S. Braathen L.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) did not show that the conditions used for their EMSAs were permissive for AP2 and CREB binding, their failure to observe binding of these factors could also be due to the cell line (Sk Mel 2) studied. Our examination indicates that the CRE- and AP2-binding sites do not contribute to basal MCAM expression in all cell lines. Previous reports also indicated that the activity of the 900-bp MCAM 5′ region as assessed by transient transfection of CAT reporter constructs correlates with MCAM expression (15Jean D. Gershenwald J.E. Huang S. Luca M. Hudson M.J. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16501-16508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Karlen S. Braathen L.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 711-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In both of these studies, the melanoma cell line SB-2 was the sole MCAM negative cell examined. In the present study of 3 MCAM positive and 3 MCAM negative cell lines, no correlation could be observed between reporter activity driven by the 5′ region (−912 bp or deletion constructs) and the MCAM expression status of the cell lines. The reporter activity was similar (103-104 over vector alone) in all lines tested. Although the activity of this region was in fact lowest in the SB-2 cell line, it was highest in the melanoma cell line Me888 which is also MCAM negative (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the expression of MCAM is not solely dependent on the constellation of trans-acting factors binding to the 900-bp MCAM 5′ region studied. The elements relevant for repression of MCAM expression in MCAM negative cells may be located elsewhere or need to be embedded in chromatin to accurately reflect MCAM expression. Jean et al. (15Jean D. Gershenwald J.E. Huang S. Luca M. Hudson M.J. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16501-16508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported an inverse correlation between AP-2 expression and MCAM expression in melanoma cell lines and have proposed that the presence of this transcription factor represses MCAM expression. While the results presented here support a negative effect of AP-2 binding at −23 bp on MCAM promoter activity, all AP-2 expressing cells examined (Mel JuSo, WM-2664, SB2, and Me888) did nevertheless show strong activity of the full-length MCAM 5′ region. This may reflect a counterbalance of the more upstream AP-2 sites, two of which have been shown to have an activating effect on MCAM expression. Furthermore, Mel JuSo and WM-2664 express high levels of MCAM mRNA and protein and are tumorigenic in nude mice (15Jean D. Gershenwald J.E. Huang S. Luca M. Hudson M.J. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16501-16508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) 2B. Jansen, personal communication.; despite the presence of significant levels of AP-2 protein. That the AP-2 present in the MCAM positive cells is functional is evident from gel retardation experiments and from the altered reporter gene expression observed when the AP-2 sites at −23, −131, or −302 bp are mutated. These results do not rule out a role for AP-2 in the regulation of MCAM expression but clearly indicate that AP-2 by itself cannot explain the constitutive MCAM expression in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, they indicate that expression of MCAM by melanoma cells does not require the loss or down-regulation of the transcription factor AP-2.

https://openalex.org/W2044528352,"Abstract The fate of RNA polymerase II in early elongation complexes is under the control of factors that regulate and respond to the phosphorylation state of the C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of the CTD protects early elongation complexes from negative transcription elongation factors such as NELF, DSIF, and factor 2. To understand the relationship between transcript elongation and the sensitivity of RNA polymerase IIO to dephosphorylation, elongation complexes at defined positions on the Ad2-ML and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) templates were purified, and their sensitivity to CTD phosphatase was determined. Purified elongation complexes treated with 1% Sarkosyl and paused at U14/G16 on an HIV-1 template and at G11 on the Ad2-ML template are equally sensitive to dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatase. Multiple elongation complexes paused at more promoter distal sites are more resistant to dephosphorylation than are U14/G16 and G11 complexes. The HIV-1 long terminal repeat and adenovirus 2 major late promoter do not appear to differentially influence the CTD phosphatase sensitivity of stringently washed complexes. Subsequent elongation by 1% Sarkosyl-washed U14/G16 complexes is unaffected by prior CTD phosphatase treatment. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that CTD phosphatase requires the presence of specific elongation factors to propagate a negative effect on transcript elongation. The action of CTD phosphatase on elongation complexes is inhibited by HIV-1 Tat protein. This observation is consistent with the idea that Tat suppression of CTD phosphatase plays a role in transactivation."

Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Nilsen T.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In all of these organisms, this intermolecular process results in a spliced leader sequence at the 5′-end of mature transcripts. In trypanosomes, its importance has been recognized for two reasons. First, the spliced leader supplies an identical 5′ terminal cap for every known messenger RNA (3Perry K.L. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8190-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and second, trans-splicing provides a means to convert polycistronic pre-mRNA to monogenic mRNA (4Johnson P.J. Kooter J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1987; 51: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because trans-splicing joins segments of two independently transcribed RNA molecules, it is distinct from cis-splicing, an intramolecular process that removes introns separating protein-coding sequences on primary transcripts. However,trans-splicing does have a number of characteristics that suggest that it is related to the more widely studiedcis-splicing. Mechanistically, both types of splicing occur through similar steps, which are catalyzed by a spliceosome (5Ruskin B. Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 317-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 6Padgett R.A. Konarska M.M. Grabowski P.J. Hardy S.F. Sharp P.A.

Also, some of the cis-acting sequences intrans-splicing are identical to those observed incis-splicing (9Perry K. Agabian N. Experientia. 1991; 47: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). The trans-splicing reaction essentially occurs through two steps and requires two RNA molecules, the spliced leader RNA carrying the spliced leader sequence and spliced leader intron and the pre-mRNA carrying a 5′-untranslated region followed by the protein coding sequence (7Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4431-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first step of the reaction is a cleavage at the 5′ splice donor site on the spliced leader RNA and the simultaneous formation of a Y-branched intermediate. A 2′-5′ phosphodiester linkage between the first nucleotide at the 5′-end of the spliced leader intron, a guanosine, and an internal adenosine residue (the branch point) upstream of the 3′ splice site of the pre-mRNA characterizes this branched intermediate. During the second step of trans-splicing, the Y-branched intermediate is removed when the spliced leader sequence is ligated to the pre-mRNA at the 3′ splice site. Under most circumstances, this reaction is rapid, perhaps occurring co-transcriptionally. The precursors and intermediates are transient, and the functional end products, mature mRNAs each carrying the capped spliced leader sequence, are the only steady-state RNA detected. In trypanosomes, the disruption of open reading frames duringtrans-splicing is avoided through the use of specific 3′ splice sites upstream of the translation initiation site of a transcript. The locations of these splice sites as well as the branch point sites are determined by the cis-acting sequences on the pre-mRNA. Although these sequences have not been thoroughly investigated, a few important elements have been recognized. The 3′ splice acceptor site always occurs at an AG dinucleotide, the consensus sequence also used during cis-splicing (1Agabian N.

Polypyrimidine tracts play an important role, since the elimination or successive deletion of the polypyrimidine tracts near native 3′ splice acceptor sites often leads to activation of cryptic splice sites or diminished splicing within an intergenic region (12Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Le Bowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M.

The only branch points that have been mapped are those for the highly expressed α− and β−tubulin transcripts of Trypanosoma brucei (16Patzelt E. Perry K.L. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4291-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although branching was shown to occur at one or more A nucleotides upstream of the polypyrimidine tracts associated with the tubulin 3′ splice acceptor sites, no consensus branch site sequence was determined. The present study was initiated to develop a better understanding of the cis-acting sequences near the 3′ splice acceptor site that are involved in trans-splicing. The noncoding sequence separating the 2.65 calmodulin-ubiquitin associated (CUB2.65) and FUS1 ubiquitin fusion genes of the calmodulin-ubiquitin complex of Trypanosoma cruzi presented an ideal environment to analyze the effects of 3′ splice acceptor site mutations (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Swindle J.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).trans-Splicing of the FUS1 transcript occurs quantitatively at the first and only AG dinucleotide between the polypyrimidine tract and the FUS1 translation initiation codon (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). T. cruzi line CL epimastigotes were cultured in liver infusion tryptose medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 mg/ml hemin (19Camargo E.P. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 1964; 6: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar) at 28 °C. Midlog phase cultures (5 × 106 to 2 × 107 cells/ml) were used in all experiments. T. cruzi epimastigote electroporation was performed as described by Hariharan et al. (20Hariharan S. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In all cases, one or two rounds of antibiotic selection were carried out with a recovery period in between. Clonal lines were obtained by serial dilution in the absence of antibiotic selection, and tandem or single gene replacement lines were verified by Southern analysis (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For TcCL:TR3, approximately 275 pmol of the gel-purified 2.7-kb1 MluI–EcoRV fragment from the pBS:CH6N3 plasmid (described below and in the legend to Fig.2 A) was used during electroporation of 3 × 108 epimastigotes. A transformed hygromycin-resistant (Hygr) population was selected by application of 500 μg/ml hygromycin B sulfate at 48 h post-electroporation. For the TcCL:FN3 line, the gel-purified 1.2-kbAflII–EcoRV fragment from the plasmid pBS:FN3 (Fig. 2 B) was used, and for the TcCL:CnFc and TcCL:SAM stable lines, the 2.5-kb MluI–EcoRV “CnFc” fragment from pBS:CnFcII and pBS:SAM plasmids (described below and in the legend to Fig. 2 C) was used. Selection was carried out by application of 250 μg/ml G418.Figure 7TcCL: SAM stable lines produce reduced levels of FUS1/CAT mRNA spliced at the first AG dinucleotide downstream of the branch point.

One hundred μg of total cellular RNA from TcCL:CnFc and each of the TcCL:SAM stable lines was analyzed using primer extension analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Splint-labeled CAT10 primer (Table I) was used to analyze the position of the splice acceptor site of the FUS1/CAT message in each line, and 5′ terminus-labeled Tub10 primer (Table I) was used as an internal control to allow the amount of FUS1/CAT message to be compared between lines. Primer extensions from RNA isolated fromT. cruzi lines appear in the following lanes: nontransformed wild-type T. cruzi (lane 1); TcCL:CnFc (lane 2), TcCL:SAM−59 (lane 3); TcCL:SAM−35 (lane 4); TcCL:SAM−23 (lane 5); TcCL:SAM+10 (lane 6); TcCL:SAM+14 (lane 7); TcCL:SAM+7 (lane 8).

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar) were carried out in a volume of 100 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 0.1 μg of each primer, and either 10 ng of genomic DNA or 1 ng of plasmid DNA as template. Standard amplification conditions were either 2 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles or 2 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 2 min at 70 °C for 30 cycles. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium/cesium chloride method of Sambrooket al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by using TRIzol® (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Blotting, hybridization, and washing conditions used in Northern analyses were as described in Hariharan et al. (20Hariharan S. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Northern hybridizations were carried out on RNA that was size-fractionated on 1.1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes for the ubiquitin, calmodulin,CUB, Neo r, and CAT genes used in Northern analysis were generated by PCR amplification as described previously (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Hariharan S. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem.

The Hyg rprobe was generated using Hyg1 and Hyg2 primers (Table I) to amplify the protein coding sequence template. The tubulin probe was generated using the Tub1 and Tub2 primers (Table I) to amplify the tubulin coding sequence from the p164 plasmid (24Thomashow L.S. Milhuasen M. Rutter W.J. Agabian N. Cell. 1983; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Splint labeling of the primers used during 5′ extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses was performed using a procedure based on the method of Hausner et al. (25Hausner T.-P. Giglio L.M. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Splint labeling was performed by PCR amplification of a 2:1 ratio of biotin-conjugated CAT9 or Neo8 primer to their complementary primers CAT10 or Neo7 in a 50-μl volume in the PCR reaction conditions described above. Five cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 70 °C were carried out followed by binding to avidin-agarose beads (Pierce) in PBS, 500 mm NaCl for 10 min at ambient temperature with periodic vortexing. Binding was followed by one wash step with an equal volume of PBS, 500 mm NaCl. To isolate the labeled primer, the avidin-agarose-bound primers were resuspended in distilled H2O, boiled for 3 min, and pelleted. The labeled primer was released into the supernatant. The 5′ terminus of the Tub10 oligonucleotide was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. Primer extensions were done essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the following modifications and conditions. Unless stated otherwise, 100 μg of total cellular RNA and approximately 33–50 ng of splint-labeled primer were used. Primer annealing was carried out at 42 °C, and primer extensions using RNaseH−, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) were carried out at either 37 or 42 °C for 1 h. Quantitative primer extensions were performed by carrying out simultaneous primer extensions of FUS1/CAT and tubulin transcripts in a single reaction. During the quantitative 5′ extensions, 4 ng of 5′ terminus-labeled Tub10 primer was used during each reaction. The disintegrations/min of the radioactive signals from the primer extension gels and Northern blots were detected using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager, model 860. Analysis of the signals was carried out using Image QuaNT and FragmeNT Analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). S1 nuclease protection analyses were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA probe was generated by linear PCR amplification of AflII-digested pBS:CH6N3 plasmid with splint-labeled Neo8 primer (Fig. 4 C). The 410-nt probe, isolated from a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, was annealed to 100 μg of total RNA overnight at 37 °C. S1 nuclease treatment was performed at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 units of enzyme/μl of reaction. Following digestion, all samples were precipitated, resuspended in 3 μl of formamide sample buffer, and separated on 5% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gels. HeLa cell S100 cytoplasmic extracts with debranching activity were generously provided by Drs. Kenneth Watkins and Nina Agabian (University of California, San Francisco) (7Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Debranching of total cellular RNA was carried out as described previously except that 100 μg of RNA was treated for 2 h (7Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). After debranching, the RNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated prior to annealing with the labeled oligonucleotide and primer extension. The DNA sequencing ladders included in the S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses were Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.)-catalyzed dideoxy sequences of plasmid DNAs with primers chosen to match the 5′-end of the primer used in the S1 protection or 5′ extension experiment. The template plasmid was also matched to the experiment. Midlog epimastigotes were treated with actinomyocin D at a concentration of 10 μg/ml to inhibit transcription. Trypanosomes were collected at the reported time points (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min). RNA was isolated with TRIzol® (Life Technologies, Inc.) and analyzed by Northern blot forFUS1/CAT mRNA. Blots were stripped by boiling for 30 min in 1× SSC, 1.0% SDS and reprobed for tubulin. The plasmids used for all experiments were constructed with the Bluescribe plasmid (pBS+/−) from Stratagene, Inc., and sequenced to verify that unintentional mutations were not introduced. Unless otherwise stated, all PCR fragments and restriction sites were treated with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends prior to ligation. The plasmids pBS:CH6N3 and pBS:FN3 are shown in Fig. 2, Aand B, which shows the alignment of genomic T. cruzi sequences in the plasmid with portions of the wild-type2.65 calmodulin-ubiquitin locus. The “C” and “300” fragments and the Neo r coding sequence were generated by PCR amplification as described previously (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Hariharan S. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The C region consists of the 525-bp sequence immediately upstream of the initiation codon of CUB2.65, including the 3′ splice acceptor site (23Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In pBS:CH6N3, the C fragment is fused to theHyg r gene, generated by PCR amplification of the protein coding sequence with Hyg1 and Hyg2 oligonucleotides. This coding sequence was followed by the 362-bp “SAM6-F” region that consists of the entire sequence between the coding sequences of theCUB2.65 and the downstream FUS1 genes. The “SAM6-F” fragment was generated by PCR amplification of a wild-type “F” sequence with the oligonucleotides 5′F and SAM6, which carried two point mutations (TableI). The Neo r gene is fused to the F region and is flanked at its 3′-end with the 300 intergenic sequence, which separates FUS1 fromPUB12.5 (17Swindle J. Ajioka J. Eisen H. Sanwai B. Jacquemot C. Browder Z. Buck G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The plasmid pBS:FN3 contains an F sequence of 525 bp that extends into CUB2.65 coding sequence, which was generated by PCR amplification with primers Ub-18 and Fuspro1 and carries no point mutations. This fragment is ligated to theNeo r coding sequence, which is in turn followed by the 300 fragment described above. For these experiments pBS:CnFc (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was modified to eliminate the sup4gene, flanked by XhoI restriction sites, by digestion withXhoI and religation. The modified plasmid was named pBS:CnFcII. Fig. 2 C diagrams the pBS:CnFcII construct and shows the alignment of genomic T. cruzi sequences in the plasmid with the wild-type 2.65 calmodulin-ubiquitin locus.

Open table in a new tab To generate the pBS:CnFcSAM plasmids, pBS:CnFcII was mutagenized by site-directed mutagenesis using splice acceptor site mutation (SAM) oligonucleotides: SAM1, SAM2, SAM3, SAM4, CATM1, and CATM2. In all of the plasmids, the F region was sequenced to confirm that no spurious mutations were introduced. The first set of experiments were designed to better understand trans-splicing of the FUS1 transcript by eliminating its wild-type 3′ splice acceptor site in the native locus (18Gillespie R.D. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because CUB2.65 and FUS1 belong to multicopy gene families, stable transformation was used to replace these genes with Hyg and Neo r, respectively, while simultaneously introducing targeted point mutations in the F intergenic region separating them (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Gillespie R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1995692129,"Site-specific recombination is involved in processes ranging from resolution of bacterial chromosome dimers to adeno-associated viral integration and is a versatile tool for mammalian genetics. The bacteriophage λ-encoded site-specific recombinase integrase (Int) is one of the best studied site-specific recombinases and mediates recombination via four distinct pathways. We have characterized a mutant version of λ Int, IntT236I; this mutant can perform the bent-L pathway only, whereas the corresponding IntT236A mutant can perform bent-L, excision and integration pathways. Experiments with both IntT236I and IntT236A show that the hydroxyl group of threonine is necessary for wild-type recombination. Substitution of the threonine by serine leads to nearly complete rescue of the mutant phenotypes. In addition, our data show that the IntT236I mutant is defective partially due to obstructive steric interactions. Comparisons of crystal structures reveal that the threonine at residue 236 may play an important role in stabilizing recombination intermediates through solvent-mediated protein-DNA interactions at the core-binding sites and that the hydroxyl group is important for effective cleavage and Holliday junction formation. Our data also indicate that Int contacts the core sites differently in intermediates assembled in excisive versus bent-L recombination."

In addition, the C. elegans Syt mutants exhibit reduced retrieval of synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane following depolarization (16Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Syts function both as calcium regulators in the exocytotic fusion reaction and as part of the endocytotic vesicle retrieval apparatus. We identified a member of the Syt family, SYT IV, in a screen for neuron-specific immediate-early genes (IEGs) from the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rat syt IVis an IEG in PC12 cells, inducible by depolarization with high potassium and by pharmacologic stimulation with forskolin (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). SYT IV mRNA is restricted to the rat neuroendocrine system, including brain and pituitary, and its levels are elevated in hippocampus and piriform cortex following kainic acid-induced seizures (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, following its stimulation-induced synthesis, SYT IV protein localizes to endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complexes (18Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and to secretory granules (6Ferguson G.D. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. Herschman H.R. J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SYT IV protein can be found in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complexes and in axonal processes in cultured neurons (20Berton F. Cornet V. Iborra C. Garrido J. Dargent B. Fukuda M. Seagar M. Marqueze B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to SYT I null mice, which die shortly after birth (13Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), SYT IV homozygous mutant mice are viable and largely indistinguishable from wild-type littermates by appearance, home cage behavior, and basic neurologic function (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, consistent with its proposed role in modulation of synaptic function (22Littleton J.T. Serano T.L. Rubin G.M. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), SYT IV mutant mice have deficits in fine motor control and some forms of memory (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike most other Syts, the rat SYT IV C2A domain has a single amino acid change that inactivates the calcium binding pocket and renders this domain incapable of binding calcium or phospholipid (23Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This mutation, a serine for aspartate substitution at residue 244 (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is also found in the murine (24Hilbush B.S. Morgan J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) SYT IV orthologues. We now report the identification of a human SYT IV orthologue that has strong homology with murine and rat SYT IV and contains the identical serine for aspartic acid substitution at residue 244, demonstrating this mutation is strongly conserved throughout evolution. Here, we map the chromosomal position of the human SYT IV gene to chromosome band 18q.12.3. This chromosomal assignment suggests SYT IVmay be a candidate gene in the psychiatric disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disease. In addition, the human SYT IV gene position defines an evolutionary break point in regions of synteny between mouse and human chromosomes 18. The proximity of the SYT IV gene to this break point provides an opportunity to define the physical break point. Despite its location close to a break point, the human syt IV gene is transcriptionally regulated much like the rat SYT IV gene. Human SYT IV is inducible in the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line and is specifically expressed in brain but not in non-neuronal tissues. The SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC HTB-11) was propagated, as described by the supplier, in minimal essential medium, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The human expressed sequence tag data base available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Web site was searched using the BLAST alignment tool with the cDNA nucleotide sequence (residues 240–483) from the rat SYT IV sequence (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). From this search, a human clone (GenBankTM accession number AA081755) with high homology to rat SYT IV was identified and obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). This clone was sequenced and analyzed by partial restriction digest analysis. The human SYT IV nucleotide sequence discussed in this paper has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base. Alignment with other orthologues was performed using Meg Align software. SK-N-SH cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and shifted to serum-free conditions 18 h prior to stimulation. The cells were treated continuously with 50 μm forskolin, 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (all from Sigma). 10 μm calcium ionophoreA23187 (Sigma) and 90 mm KCl were delivered for only 30 min and then removed, because the cells were rapidly killed during prolonged continuous treatments of these stimuli. At indicated times, total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Total RNA System (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of total RNA from each time point was denatured, subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred, by capillary blotting, to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For human tissues and human brain,CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) Multiple Tissue Northern blots were used according to the supplier's instructions. The human SYT IV probe was hybridized to cell and tissue RNA filters in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's, 2% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42 °C. The filters were washed three times for 30 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS. Rat-derived SYT I and GAPDH were hybridized and washed as described previously (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All filters were exposed to autoradiographic film overnight at −80 °C. Human SYT IV cDNA was used as a probe to map the gene to human chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (25Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 69: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA probe was labeled with biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc.) using nick translation and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes prepared from normal male peripheral blood lymphocytes using the bromodeoxyuridine synchronization method (25Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 69: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two FISH experiments were performed using the SYT IV probe. The hybridization solution contained 400 ng of probe DNA, 3 μg of Cot 1 DNA, and 7 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA per 10 μl of hybridization mixture (70% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC). This solution was denatured at 75 °C for 5 min, pre-annealed at 37 °C for 10 min, and applied to denatured chromosome slides. The slides were washed 4 times for 5 min at 44 °C in buffer containing 2× SSC and 50% formamide and then washed an additional 3 times for 5 min at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC. Hybridized probe was detected with avidin-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To increase the intensity of the FITC signals, two rounds of amplification were performed using biotinylated anti-avidin (Vector Laboratories). To generate clear reverse bands, metaphase chromosomes were counterstained with chromomycin A3 followed by distamycin A. The images were captured using the Photometrics Cooled-CCD camera (CH250) and the BDS image analysis system (ONCOR Imaging, Gaithersburg, MD). We sought to determine the following: 1) if a SYT IV orthogue exists in humans and 2) if this orthologue contains the conserved aspartate to serine substitution in the C2A domain. We searched the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for sequences homologous to the first 80 amino acids of rat synaptotagmin IV (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a region of relatively little homology with other Syts. An EST with high homology (>90%) to the rat sequence was identified. This human EST is 4.5 kb in length and contains a polyadenylation signal at the 3′ end (data not shown). Sequencing of this clone confirmed high levels of homology with rat SYT IV cDNA throughout the entire open reading frame. The first 1671 nucleotides of the human clone are shown in Fig.1. Overall, the predicted protein product of the human clone is 89.8% (372/425) identical to the rat SYT IV protein and 89.4% (370/425) identical to the murine SYT IV protein (Fig. 2 A). For comparison, the rat and mouse sequences are 97.5% (414/425) identical.Figure 2Human SYT IV shares homology with rodent SYT IV sequences and other members of the Syt family. A,alignment of the amino acid sequences of the human, rat, and mouse SYT IV orthologues. The position of the conserved serine residue (amino acid 244) is indicated with an asterisk. The relative positions of the five aspartic acids in the calcium-binding site (1Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

B, phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the human, rat, and mouse SYT IV orthologues and other members of the Syt family. The human SYT IV sequence is closely related to rodent SYT IV sequences, as are members of the SYT XI family. Abbreviations used are: hu, human; mur, mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Importantly, the human clone also contains, like the mouse, rat, worm, and fly orthologues, a serine residue at position 244 within the first C2 (C2A) domain (Fig. 2 A). In the rat protein, this amino acid residue replaces one of the five aspartic acid residues shown to be critical for C2 domain structure (26Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), rendering rat SYT IV unable to bind calcium or phospholipid through its C2A domain (23Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Rat SYT XI, which also contains this serine residue, has similar calcium binding properties (3von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the human, rat, and mouse SYT IV proteins, and other Syts, clearly demonstrates that the human clone is a member of the SYT IV family (Fig. 2 B). In addition, as proposed previously (3von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), this analysis indicates a strong evolutionary link between SYT IV and SYT XI. Thus, because of the high level of overall identity and strong evolutionary relationship between the human clone and published SYT IV sequences from other species, and the presence of the conserved serine 244 residue, we refer to this EST clone as human SYT IV and presume it to be the human SYT IV orthologue. Our analysis of SYT IV function in mice indicates the SYT IVgene is not essential for survival (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SYT IV homozygous mutant mice are generally indistinguishable from wild-type littermates by appearance and home cage behavior (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SYT IV mutant mice do, however, exhibit deficits in motor performance and hippocampus-dependent memory (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine if theSYT IV gene locus is associated with any known neurologic conditions in humans, we mapped the chromosomal position of the human SYT IV gene using FISH. A human SYT IV cDNA probe was used to map the gene to human chromosome band 18q12.3 (Fig. 3 A). Over 60 cells were scanned on each slide, and a total of 55 metaphase images were captured and evaluated. FITC signals were clearly seen in the chromosome region of band 18q12.3 at its distal border with band 18q21 on two chromatids of at least one chromosome 18 in more than 50% of the cells counted (Fig. 3 A). No other chromosomal sites with a pair of signals were detected in greater than one cell (<1.0%). Two independent experiments were performed and both resulted in the same chromosomal assignment. This assignment to band 18q12.3 distal defines the border between two adjacent regions of human chromosome 18 that are homologous to non-adjacent regions of mouse chromosome 18 (Fig. 3 B). The more centromeric region of Mus musculus 18, defined by the gene for Mep1b, is homologous to Homo sapiens 18q11.2–12.3 (GDB:371066), whereas the neighboring telomeric mouse gene, catna1, maps to H. sapiens5q21-22 (GDB:141920) (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the location of SYT IV in the telomeric sub-band region of H. sapiens18q12.3 places the evolutionary break point between blocks of mouse and human homology at the border of H. sapiens 18q12.3-q21.1 and between the mouse homologues syt IVandcatna1. This observation may facilitate the cloning of this break point in both mouse and human. Interestingly, population studies suggest loci for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia susceptibility map within regions of chromosome 18 that include bands 18q12.1–12.3 (27Van Broeckhoven C. Verheyen G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 88: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both bipolar disease and schizophrenia have been attributed to abnormalities in neurotransmission (28Preisig M. Bellivier F. Fenton B.T. Baud P. Berney A. Courtet P. Hardy P. Golaz J. Leboyer M. Mallet J. Matthey M.L. Mouthon D. Neidhart E. Nosten-Bertrand M. Stadelmann-Dubuis E. Guimon J. Ferrero F. Buresi C. Malafosse A. Am. J.

Thus, the correct localization of theSYT IV gene to human chromosome 18q12.3 distal defines human and mouse evolutionary break points and may establish SYT IV as a candidate gene for the human psychiatric syndromes schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. The SYT IV gene is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to variety of inducers in mouse 2G. D. Ferguson and H. R. Herschman, unpublished observations. and rat cell lines (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, rat SYT IV mRNA is specifically expressed in the brain and is not detectable outside the nervous system (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the human SYT IV gene maps so closely to an evolutionary break point in chromosome 18, we examined whether the human SYT IV gene was also inducible and had similar tissue specificity. By using the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line we find that, much like the rat and mouse genes, human SYT IV mRNA is rapidly and robustly induced by forskolin treatment. SYT IV mRNA levels peak at 4 h and decay to near base-line levels by 24 h (Fig.4 A). Human SYT IV mRNA is approximately 4.5 kb in size, running just below the 28 S ribosomal RNA band, indicating the EST clone is near full length. Agents that elevate intracellular calcium, e.g. the calcium ionophoreA23187 (Fig. 4 A) and potassium depolarization (data not shown), also lead to increases in the levels of SYT IV mRNA. Induction of SYT IV expression by high potassium is not as robust as induction by forskolin in SK-N-SH cells. We have cloned several genes that are inducible in PC12 cells by forskolin and/or elevated potassium, and we examined their induction in rat brain following kainic acid-induced seizures (30Feldman J.D. Vician L. Crispino M. Tocco G. Marcheselli V.L. Bazan N.G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Crispino M. Tocco G. Feldman J.D. Herschman H.R. Baudry M. Brain Res. Mol.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In nearly all cases, these genes, which are strongly induced by kainic acid in rat hippocampus, are more robustly induced by forskolin than by high potassium in PC12 cells. Interestingly, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a potent differentiation agent for the SK-N-SH cell line, does not substantially induce the SYT IV gene (data not shown). This result is similar to our observation in PC12 cells, where we find no SYT IV mRNA induction following treatment with the differentiation agent nerve growth factor (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether human SYT IV is an immediate early gene (IEG), inducible in the absence of protein synthesis through the activation of latent transcription factors, we analyzed the induction of SYT IV mRNA in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Forskolin and high potassium depolarization induce SYT IV mRNA in SK-N-SH cells, even in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating human syt IVis an IEG (Fig.4 B). To investigate the tissue distribution of human SYT IV mRNA, we performed Northern blot analysis on purified poly(A)+ mRNA from various human tissues. SYT IV expression is restricted to brain and is not detectable in other tissues (Fig. 5). Rat SYT IV mRNA was similarly expressed only in brain and pituitary and was not detected in heart, muscle, lung, or liver (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Like SYT IV, human SYT I is strictly expressed in brain (Fig. 5). The distribution of SYT IV mRNA within human brain was also examined by Northern analysis. As observed in rat (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), human SYT IV is most highly expressed in hippocampus (Fig.6). In addition, substantial levels of human SYT IV mRNA can be detected in amygdala and thalamus (Fig.6). SYT I and SYT IV have similar distributions within brain, although quantitative differences are noticeable in the subthalamic nucleus and in caudate. Similar to their distribution in rat (17Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), both SYT I and SYT IV are generally expressed in a rostral to caudal gradient. Human SYT I and SYT IV are more highly expressed in thalamus than in caudate (Fig. 6). In rats, however, SYT I and SYT IV levels are equal in these regions (33Berton F. Iborra C. Boudier J.A. Seagar M.J. Marqueze B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating subtle expression differences exist between rat and human. SYT IV is a depolarization-inducible, labile protein with a metabolic half-life of approximately 2 h in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (6Ferguson G.D. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. Herschman H.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following its stimulation-induced synthesis, SYT IV is rapidly transported to secretory granules (6Ferguson G.D. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. Herschman H.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Thomas D.M. Ferguson G.D. Herschman H.R. Elferink L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, SYT IV interacts with other components of the presynaptic terminal, including syntaxin and SYT I (19Thomas D.M.

Compared with SYT I-SYT I homo-oligomers, SYT IV-SYT I hetero-oligomers have a limited capacity to bind phospholipid (22Littleton J.T. Serano T.L. Rubin G.M. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), indicating that SYT IV can reduce the ability of SYT I to penetrate and bind phospholipid membranes, in effect functioning as a “dominant negative.” These data suggest SYT IV may modulate the calcium sensitivity of the vesicle fusion reaction in vivo. Thus, the relative levels of SYT IV protein in vesicles, modulated by neuronal stimulation, may alter the probability of vesicle fusion and lead to changes in synaptic output. Indeed, a 5-fold overexpression of SYT IV, relative to basal levels, in Drosophila neurons leads to a reduction in post-synaptic response at the fly neuromuscular junction (22Littleton J.T. Serano T.L. Rubin G.M. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because human SYT IV is an immediate early gene (Fig.4 B), is rapidly induced by stimulation (Fig. 4 A), and contains the inactivating serine for aspartate substitution (Fig.2), the SYT IV protein may also function to attenuate synaptic responses at human synapses. The assignment of the human SYT IV gene to chromosome 18 clearly differs from the heuristic assignment to chromosome 5 noted in GenBankTM, an assignment that was predicted only by homology to the mouse genetic map. All genes currently mapping on human chromosome 18 are found on mouse chromosome 18, arranged in two blocks that are interrupted by a region homologous to human chromosome 5. Chromosomal band 18q12.3 and the SYT IV gene define an evolutionary break point between regions of mouse and human synteny (Fig. 3 B), an observation that may facilitate the mapping of additional genes in the future. Moreover, this assignment is of interest with respect to evolution in that genes separated in the mouse by only 1.0 centimorgans (syt IV and catna1) are located on different human chromosomes. The precise localization ofsyt IVat the band 18q12 border supports the possibility that mammalian evolutionary break points tend to occur at discontinuities between functional and structural chromatin domains reflected in Giemsa (18q12) versus reverse bands (18q21) (34Korenberg J.R. Rykowski M.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This fine definition provides the opportunity to determine the sequence of an evolutionary break point and may help to elucidate the mechanisms that predispose to evolutionary change across species. The mapping data presented here suggest that the SYT IV region of human chromosome 18, when compared with porcine, bovine, and murine chromosomes, is most similar to bovine chromosome 24. 3National Animal Genome Research Project. In contrast, the porcine SYT IV region appears to have undergone a translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 6,3 whereas the murine chromosome contains an insertion (Fig. 3 B). These events appear to have occurred independently but at a similar break point, an observation that may be confirmed by mapping of porcine and bovine syt IV genes. It is worth noting that the region of human chromosome 18q12–22 has also been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disease through chromosomal rearrangement mapping and population studies. In small family studies, chromosome 18 rearrangements, including a pericentric inversion of 18 (p1.31;q21.1) (35Hampson R.M. Malloy M.P. Mors O. Ewald H. Flannery A.V. Morten J. Porteous D.J. Muir W.J. Blackwood D.H. Psychiatr. Genet. 1999; 9: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and a translocation of 15;18 (pter-q13.3;q23-qter) (36Calzolari E. Aiello V. Palazzi P. Sensi A. Calzolari S. Orrico D. Calliari L. Holler H. Marzi C. Belli S. Bernardi F. Patracchini P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 67: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were found to segregate with schizophrenia. Similarly, epidemiological (37Berrettini W.H. Biol. Psychiatry. 2000; 47: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and other population studies have suggested loci for bipolar disease and schizophrenia susceptibility exist in this region. How might SYT IV play a role in schizophrenia and/or bipolar disease? The dysregulation of the dopaminergic system has an established role in human psychiatric disease (29Laruelle M. Abi-Dargham A. J. Psychopharmacol. 1999; 13: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For example, abnormal increases in dopamine neurotransmission have been observed in the brains of schizophrenics (38Kugaya A. Fujita M. Innis R.B. Ann. Nucl. Med. 2000; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and are thought to contribute to the pathophysiological basis of this disease (39Keshavan M.S. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1999; 33: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). SYT IV is expressed in dopaminergic brain regions (Fig. 6) and is present in secretory granules of rat PC12 cells (6Ferguson G.D. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. Herschman H.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), vesicles previously shown to contain dopamine (40Wagner J.A. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, SYT IV may participate in the regulation of dopamine release in the human brain. A loss-of-function mutation or an alteration in levels of SYT IV may promote abnormal levels of dopamine release at dopaminergic synapses. Our studies with SYT IV knockout mice have not specifically addressed the physiology of dopaminergic neurons but do support the suggestion that SYT IV modulates synaptic function (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SYT IV homozygous mutant mice exhibit deficits in motor performance on the rotorod, a task sensitive to lesions of the basal ganglia that may alter normal dopamine levels (41Jeljeli M. Strazielle C. Caston J. Lalonde R. Behav. Brain Res. 1999; 102: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, SYT IV mutant mice have deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory (21Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Patients with schizophrenia also display memory deficits that have similarly been attributed to medial temporal lobe and hippocampal dysfunction (42Gold J.M. Randolph C. Carpenter C.J. Goldberg T.E. Weinberger D.R. J. Abnorm. Psychol. 1992; 101: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,43Gold J.M. Randolph C. Carpenter C.J. Goldberg T.E. Weinberg D.R. Clin. Neuropsychol. 1992; 6: 367-373Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The development of suitable animal models for schizophrenia has been problematic. However, such models often employ the use of psychostimulants such as cocaine (44Yamamoto J. Psychopharmacology. 1997; 131: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cocaine can induce SYT IV expression in rat striatum (45Denovan-Wright E.M. Newton R.A. Armstrong J.N. Babity J.M. Robertson H.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, SYT IV has been suggested to play a role in the morphological changes brought about by exposure to psychostimulants (46Ujike H. Kodama M. Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi. 1999; 19: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we identified a human SYT IV orthologue highly homologous to rodent SYT IV proteins that contains a conserved amino acid substitution in its C2A domain. By using FISH, we mapped the humanSYT IV gene to chromosome band 18q12.3. This chromosomal position defines an evolutionary break point between syntenic regions in mouse and human chromosomes 18. In addition, based on results of prior genetic linkage analysis, these data suggest SYT IV is a candidate gene for schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Although near an evolutionary break point, human syt IV, like the rodent syt IV genes, is inducible in neuronal cell lines following stimulation and is specifically expressed in the brain but not in non-neuronal tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2078670350,"The possible contribution of the mature portion of a mitochondrial precursor protein to its interaction with membrane lipids is unclear. To address this issue, we examined the interaction of the precursor to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (pmAAT) and of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 29-residue presequence peptide (mAAT-pp) with anionic phospholipid vesicles. The affinity of mAAT-pp and pmAAT for anionic vesicles is nearly identical. Results obtained by analyzing the effect of mAAT-pp or full-length pmAAT on either the permeability or microviscosity of the phospholipid vesicles are consistent with only a shallow insertion of the presequence peptide in the bilayer. Analysis of the quenching of Trp-17 fluorescence by brominated phospholipids reveals that this presequence residue inserts to a depth of approximately 9 Å from the center of the bilayer. Furthermore, in membrane-bound pmAAT or mAAT-pp, both Arg-8 and Arg-28 are accessible to the solvent. These results suggest that the presequence segment lies close to the surface of the membrane and that the mature portion of the precursor protein has little effect on the affinity or mode of binding of the presequence to model membranes. In the presence of vesicles, mAAT-pp adopts considerable α-helical structure. Hydrolysis by trypsin after Arg-8 results in the dissociation of the remaining 21-residue C-terminal peptide fragment from the membrane bilayer, suggesting that the N-terminal portion of the presequence is essential for membrane binding. Based on these results, we propose that the presequence peptide may contain dual recognition elements for both the lipid and import receptor components of the mitochondrial membrane.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Following translocation into mitochondria, the presequence is proteolytically removed to render the mature form of the protein. In addition to the presequence, a partially folded conformation is also required for efficient import into mitochondria. Molecular chaperones present in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells are involved in maintaining proteins to be translocated in an “import-competent” state (2Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner W.M Craig E.A.

Mitochondrial matrix presequences lack a consensus sequence (5von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), suggesting that secondary structure elements may contribute to function. Presequences are 20–60 residues long and lack ordered secondary structure in aqueous solution (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 6Tamm L.K.

The presence of positive charges and an amphipathic helical character of the presequence have been shown to be essential for import of most proteins into mitochondria (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 6Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 123-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Roise D. Horvath S.J.

The molecular bases for the recognition and binding of presequences to the mitochondrial surface are controversial. It has been hypothesized that the targeting sites for import may involve the lipid phase of the mitochondrial membrane (6Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 123-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Arguments for this view include the high affinity of presequences for anionic phospholipids, the induced changes in secondary structure required for import, and the lack of a consensus sequence. On the other hand, a multisubunit protein receptor complex has been identified in the outer mitochondrial membrane (13Sollner T. Griffiths G. Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This import receptor complex recognizes positively charged presequences that form α-helices (14Schleiff E. Heard T.S. Weiner H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested recently that Tom20, a component of the import receptor complex, preferentially recognizes presequences while membrane-bound (14Schleiff E. Heard T.S. Weiner H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Schleiff E. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13052-13058Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This implies that binding to anionic phospholipids in the outer membrane and subsequent induced change in secondary structure could precede recognition by the protein import complex. Although the interaction of chemically synthesized presequences with membrane-like environments has been extensively studied, very little is known of the interaction of natural mitochondrial precursor proteins with membranes (16Iriarte A. Altieri F. del Solar J. Mattingly J.R. Martinez-Carrion M. Fukui T. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. Wada H. Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 527-529Google Scholar, 17Berezov A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22222-22229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Berezov A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1996; 336: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity of the mature protein, its isoelectric point, or possible effects on the conformation of the presequence by the mature form may affect the binding of the precursor to lipids. For instance, it has been suggested that the passenger protein of an artificial chimeric protein may affect the secondary structure of the signal sequence attached to it, abolishing importin vitro (19Waltner M. Hammen P.K. Weiner H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21226-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, studies using intact authentic mitochondrial precursors are needed to further understand the interaction of targeting presequences with lipid membranes. The dimeric precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase has been purified from bacteria in an active form (20Altieri F. Mattingly J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and represents an example of such a natural mitochondrial precursor. Aspartate aminotransferase exists in animal cells as two isoforms located in the cytosol (cAAT)1 and the matrix of mitochondria (mAAT). The mitochondrial form is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor (pmAAT) with a 29-residue presequence at its N-terminal end that targets the protein to mitochondria (21Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nishi T. Nagashima F. Tanase S. Fukumoto Y. Joh T. Shimada K. Matsukado Y. Ushio Y. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6044-6051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although pmAAT is efficiently imported into mitochondria in vitro, a chimeric protein composed of the pmAAT presequence attached to cAAT was not imported, suggesting that the passenger protein can affect import into mitochondria (23Lain B. Yañez A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4406-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The pmAAT presequence peptide shares the same fundamental characteristics of other matrix-targeting sequences described above (see amino acid sequence in Fig. 3). The binding of pmAAT to liposomes is dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (16Iriarte A. Altieri F. del Solar J. Mattingly J.R. Martinez-Carrion M. Fukui T. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. Wada H. Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 527-529Google Scholar). The mature protein, lacking the 29-residue presequence peptide, is unable to bind to these vesicles under similar conditions, showing that the binding of pmAAT is dependent on the presence of the presequence peptide. However, at low ionic strength, the mature protein can bind to negatively charged vesicles because of its basic character (16Iriarte A. Altieri F. del Solar J. Mattingly J.R. Martinez-Carrion M. Fukui T. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. Wada H. Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 527-529Google Scholar, 17Berezov A. Iriarte A.

Biochem Biophys. 1996; 336: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this work we analyze the interaction of the pmAAT presequence with model membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids. Several pertinent questions are addressed, such as the influence of the mature portion of the pmAAT protein on the binding of the presequence to lipid vesicles, the overall conformation of the presequence region when bound to phospholipid vesicles, and elements of the topology of the presequence in the membrane and its depth of insertion. We have used both a synthetic peptide corresponding to the rat liver pmAAT presequence (mAAT-pp) as well as the full-length pmAAT precursor purified as a recombinant protein. As a fluorescence-reporting group, we introduced a tryptophan residue at position 17 in the presequence, (F17W mutant), either during chemical synthesis of the mAAT-pp peptide or by site directed mutagenesis of pmAAT. Proteolytic access to unique arginine residues within the presequence was also used to assess the topology of the presequence while bound to model membranes. pmAAT was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (20Altieri F. Mattingly J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAAT was obtained by tryptic treatment of the precursor protein (trypsin:pmAAT molar ratio, 1:100) and a subsequent CM-Sepharose chromatography step (20Altieri F. Mattingly J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant F17W-pmAAT was prepared by digesting the cDNA for rat liver pmAAT previously cloned in Bluescript KS (pBSKS-4) (21Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloning into the pALTER vector from Promega. Mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type and F17W-mutant mAAT-pp peptides were synthesized at the Protein Core Facility of the School of Biological Sciences and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). 6-Carboxyfluorescein (CF), diphenylhexatriene (DPH), 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, disodium salt (ANTS), andp-xylenebis(pyridinium bromide) (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other regents were of the highest purity available. When appropriate, non-linear least-squares fitting of the data was performed using Sigma Plot 4.01 (Jandel Corp.). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by sonication with a microprobe (Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc.) of a suspension of lipids in the appropriate buffer for a minimum of 6 min, or until the turbidity had cleared, while maintained under an argon atmosphere. The vesicles were then centrifuged briefly in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove titanium particles. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by the reverse phase evaporation method (24Szoka F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μmol of lipids in chloroform were mixed to give the appropriate composition. The solution was dried under a stream of argon and dissolved in 1 ml of ether, followed by the addition of 300 μl of lipid buffer (10 mmHEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The suspension was sonicated for 10 min in a bath sonicator to create a stable emulsion. The remaining ether phase was evaporated at low pressure in a rotavapor until a stable gel was formed. The gel was collapsed by a brief vortexing, and 700 μl of lipid buffer were then added. The ether phase was further evaporated for 90 min under high vacuum. The sample was passed several times through two stacked 0.2- and 0.4-μm filters (Nucleopore) to obtain a homogeneous population of liposomes and to remove multilamellar vesicles. The lipid concentration of the suspension was determined by phosphorous analysis (25Barlet G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after hydrolysis for 30 min in 70% perchloric acid at 200 °C. Peptide-lipid association was studied by monitoring the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of F17W-mAAT-pp or F17W-pmAAT upon addition of SUVs. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 25 °C using an SLM 8100C spectrofluorometer set on photon counting, with excitation at 296 nm and 4-nm slits in the excitation and emission pathways. When vesicles were present, spectra were corrected for the fluorescence of vesicles alone. To determine the degree of association of mAAT-pp and pmAAT with lipid vesicles, small aliquots of one of the components (peptide or vesicles) were successively added to a fixed amount of the other component in 1.4 ml of lipid buffer. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded at 338 nm (λex = 296 nm) 5 min after mixing the vesicles and peptide/protein. The contents of the cuvette were continuously stirred. The increase in fluorescence was calculated after correction for the change in volume caused by a given addition. The binding of peptide to lipid bilayers can be described in terms of a simple bimolecular equilibrium model, which assumes that a distinct number of lipid monomers in a membrane comprise an individual peptide binding site.P+nL⇌P:LnEquation 1 P represents the peptide/protein, Lrepresents the phospholipid, and n is the number of lipid molecules that provide one binding site for the peptide. The binding can be described in terms of a dissociation constant of the lipid/peptide complex, K d. For the lipid titration experiments, the total concentration of lipid, [Lt ], is much higher than the concentration of peptide bound to the membrane, [P:Ln ] or [Pb ], as shown in Equation 2.Kd=[P][Lt/n]/[Pb]Equation 2 [P] is the equilibrium concentration of free peptide in solution. According to the law of mass conservation (total concentration of peptide, [Pt ] = [Pb ] + [P]), Equation 2 can be transformed into Equation 3.[Pb]=[Pt][Lt]/(Kd+[Lt]/n)Equation 3 The fluorescence intensity values at saturating concentrations of SUVs are an indication of maximum partitioning of peptide in the membrane. Thus, the concentration of bound peptide can be calculated using Equation 4.[Pb]=((F−F0)/(F∞−F0))[Pt]Equation 4 F 0, F, andF ∞ represent the fluorescence intensity in the absence of vesicles, at a given amount of vesicles, and in the presence of saturating amounts of vesicles, respectively. From Equation 4 and the law of mass action, we obtain Equation 5.F/F0=1+((Fmax/F0)−1)[Lt]/(nKd+[Lt])Equation 5 From a plot of F/F0 versus[Lt ] (Fig. 1 A), the value ofnK d was obtained from a fit of Equation 5 to the data. This parameter must be regarded as an apparent dissociation constant (K app), which provides an index of the affinity of the peptide for the membrane. Note that when (F/F 0) − 1 = ((F max/F 0) − 1)/2,nK d = [L], the concentration of lipid required to attain binding of 50% of the available peptide. For the peptide titration experiments, the increase in fluorescence at 338 nm was measured upon addition of small aliquots of mAAT-pp to a fixed concentration of SUVs. In the peptide titration experiments, we must also consider the conservation relationship for the lipid, [L/n] = [Lt /n] − [P:Ln ] in addition to the mass conservation of the peptide indicated before. L/nis the concentration of unoccupied binding sites, andLt /n is the total amount of lipid binding sites. Substituting for free peptide and free lipid in Equation2 and solving for bound peptide yields the quadratic equation shown in Equation 6.[Pb]=Equation 6 (Kd+[Pt]+[Lt/n]±((Kd+[Pt]+[Lt/n]) 2−4[Pt][Lt/n]) 1/2)/2In this equation, only the subtraction gives meaningful values. In order to calculate [Pb ] using Equation 4, we extrapolated F ∞ from a double-reciprocal plot of the total peptide fluorescence versus total concentration of lipid obtained in a separate experiment. CD data were collected in a Jasco spectropolarimeter model J-720 using the software provided by the manufacturer for collection and analysis of the data. All the buffers were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter to eliminate dust and other particles, and extensively degassed under vacuum. The CD spectra were recorded using a 0.1-cm cuvette at room temperature. Either the lipid buffer or a more far-UV transparent buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm KF, pH 7.5) was used. The spectra were corrected for the buffer contribution by subtraction of an appropriate blank and for the changes in volume due to the addition of the lipid suspension. The spectrum labeled 4 in Fig. 2 was truncated below 200 nm because the noise caused by turbidity precluded the recording of data at lower wavelengths. Molar ellipticity values were calculated according to the following expression: [θ] = (θ/10) (114/lc), where θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, 114 is the mean residue molecular weight in g/mol, l is the path length in cm, and c is the concentration in g/cm3. [θ] has the units of degree cm2dmol−1. The factor 10 in the previous equation originates from the conversion of mol−1 to dmol−1. LUVs (POPC:POPG, 1:1) containing CF were prepared essentially according to the method described above with the following modifications. The lipid buffer was substituted with a solution containing 50 mm CF in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. After extrusion, free CF was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column (1 × 20 cm) equilibrated in lipid buffer. The content of CF was measured by absorbance (ε492 nm =72,000 m−1) before disruption of the liposomes with 0.1% Triton X-100. The release of carboxyfluorescein from the liposomes as induced by interaction with pmAAT or mAAT-pp was followed at room temperature by monitoring the increase in fluorescence at 540 nm after excitation at 430 nm. Release of vesicular contents was also monitored by the ANTS/DPX assay (26Ellens R.M. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). LUVs containing 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 10 mm Hepes were obtained by encapsulating this mixture in 50% PG vesicles as described above. Nonencapsulated material was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column. Dilution of the probes upon release of the vesicle contents would result in a relief of the quenching of the ANTS fluorescence by DPX. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 520 nm after excitation at 355 nm. In each case, the zero level of leakage corresponded to the fluorescence of vesicles alone at time 0 and 100% leakage was the maximum fluorescence intensity obtained after complete release of the probes by treatment of the vesicles with 0.1% Triton X-100. Internal and external osmolarities were adjusted with NaCl. To decrease light scattering due to the presence of LUVs, a filter (3-68) was placed between the sample and the emission monochromator. To measure changes in DPH anisotropy at a constant temperature upon interaction with mAAT-pp or pmAAT, DMPC:DMPG (1:1) SUVs, prepared as described before, were diluted to a lipid concentration of 200 μm in lipid buffer and 0.5 μl of a solution of DPH in acetonitrile was added (DPH:lipid molar ratio, 1:300). After equilibration for 30 min at room temperature, increasing concentrations of peptide or protein were added to 1.2 ml of vesicles in a 3-ml cuvette. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 490 nm, respectively. The temperature of the cell compartment in the fluorometer was maintained at 38 °C by a Haake F3 water bath and monitored by a Digi-Sense temperature control with a microprobe inside the cuvette. This temperature is above the melting temperature of the SUVs used (23 °C) as reflected in the low value of r(≈0.070) obtained for vesicles alone in the absence of peptide. The anisotropy was measured in a T-format, and it was automatically calculated using the software provided by the manufacturer according to the expression: r = (I vv −I vh)/(I vv − 2I vh), where r is the anisotropy of the sample, I vv is the fluorescence detected when the excitation and emission polarizers are set at 90°, andI vh is the fluorescence of the sample detected when the excitation polarizer is set at 90° and the emission polarizer is set at 0°. To minimize light scattering, filters (3-75) were placed between the sample and the two detectors. The samples were kept under constant stirring. The F17W mutant of pmAAT or mAAT-pp containing a tryptophan residue at position 17 of the presequence peptide was used in these experiments. The fluorescence intensity of the peptide or protein was measured at 388 nm (λex = 296 nm) in samples prepared either in lipid buffer alone, or lipid buffer containing unlabeled SUVs (20% POPC, 50% POPG, and 30% PSPC) or SUVs of similar composition but containing 30% brominated PSPC (BrPSPC) instead of PSPC. BrPSPC is commercially available brominated at either positions 6 and 7 or 11 and 12 of the stearoyl acyl chains. Vesicles were prepared by sonication as described before. The quenching efficiency was defined as (ΔF 0 − ΔF) × 100/ΔF 0, where ΔF 0and ΔF are the increase in fluorescence upon binding of peptide or protein to unlabeled vesicles and to liposomes containing brominated phospholipids, respectively. To calculate the depth of insertion using the “parallax” analysis (27Ladokhin A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 946-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the following equation was used. ZCF=Lc1+(−1/πC)lnF1/F2−L2122L21Equation 7 Z CF is the depth of the fluorophore from the center of the bilayer, L c1 is the distance from the shallow quencher to the center of the bilayer,L 21 is the distance between both quenchers,F 1 and F 2 are the fluorescence intensities of the fluorophore when incubated with membranes containing the shallow and deep quencher, respectively. Finally, C represents the two-dimensional quencher concentration in the plane of the membrane in mole fraction of quencher lipid in total lipid per unit area. The values for the constants wereL c1 = 10.8 Å, L 21 = 4.5 Å according to x-ray diffraction data (28McIntosh T.J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); C = (0.3)/70 Å2, the average surface area per lipid molecule (29Lewis B.A. Engelman D. J. Mol.

The intact precursor of mitochondrial aspartate transferase binds to vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids (16Iriarte A. Altieri F. del Solar J. Mattingly J.R. Martinez-Carrion M.

Cardiolipin-containing vesicles showed the highest affinity of all the acidic phospholipids tested. However, similar levels of binding"
https://openalex.org/W2043935368,"As in any good marriage, open communication is critical when pre- and postsynaptic cells commit to building a synapse. After the initial flirtation of growth cone and target cell, the hard work of synaptogenesis begins. The presynaptic cell constructs an active zone and clusters synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter. The postsynaptic cell localizes neurotransmitter receptors adjacent to these presynaptic release sites. A lively interplay between these two cells ensures that the amount of transmitter released and the number of receptors that are localized is appropriate for the physiological function of that synapse. To understand synapse formation, we must identify these signals that pass between the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Much of our knowledge of synaptogenesis comes from the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where agrin acts as a nerve-derived signal to activate the tyrosine kinase MuSK in muscle and initiate the clustering of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This signaling pathway is also required for presynaptic differentiation, although the mechanism remains obscure (reviewed by 12Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). While this ligand/receptor interaction is a simple and attractive model for synaptogenesis, to date agrin and MUSK have been shown to act only at the vertebrate NMJ, and no analogous molecules have been identified for other types of synapses. In hopes of identifying such factors at a glutamatergic synapse, Broadie and colleagues have conducted a large-scale genetic screen for molecules that are required for a functional Drosophila NMJ (which uses glutamate as its transmitter). In this issue of Neuron, 7Featherstone D.E. Rushton E.M. Hilderbrand-Chae M. Phillips A.M. Jackson F.R. Broadie A.M Neuron. 2000; 27 (this issue,): 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar present the first fruits of this labor, the unexpected finding that presynaptic glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, the enzyme that synthesizes GABA from glutamate) is required to induce the postsynaptic glutamate receptor field. Before a synapse forms, Drosophila muscles express low levels of glutamate receptors that are homogeneously distributed across the cell surface. Contact between nerve and muscle induces clustering of preexisting receptors and initiates the insertion of many new receptors (1Broadie K. Bate M Neuron. 1993; 11 (a): 607-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Broadie K. Bate M Nature. 1993; 361 (b): 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Saitoe M. Tanaka S. Takata K. Kidokoro Y Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While the nerve-derived factor that initiates these events is unknown, electrical activity in the nerve is necessary (1Broadie K. Bate M Neuron. 1993; 11 (a): 607-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Saitoe M. Tanaka S. Takata K. Kidokoro Y Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that neurotransmitter release could be the signal that induces the clustering of its own receptor, as is the case at glycinergic synapses (reviewed by 4Craig A.M Neuron. 1998; 21: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, mutations that abolish evoked neurotransmitter release have no effect on the development of the postsynaptic receptor field. In fact, syntaxin mutants, which have no evoked or spontaneous transmitter release, cluster glutamate receptors normally (3Broadie K. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. O'Kane C.J. Schulze K.L. Sweeney S.T Neuron. 1995; 15: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). If vesicular release of transmitter is not the signal that induces the receptor field, then what is? To address this question, Featherstone et al. turned to a powerful but labor-intensive approach—a direct and systematic screen for mutations that disrupt receptor clustering. They screened over 6000 mutants for those that died late in embryogenesis, when the synapse is first necessary. After discarding mutants with gross morphological defects, all remaining lines were subjected to a detailed electrophysiological analysis at the NMJ. In addition to isolating mutations in well-known synaptic proteins, this screen also identified a number of alleles that disrupt the function of Drosophila glutamic acid decarboxylase, DGAD1. This enzyme synthesizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from glutamate and so is necessary for GABAergic transmission. Surprisingly, these mutants also have a profound deficit in their postsynaptic receptor field at the glutamatergic NMJ. Featherstone and colleagues have characterized a number of gad mutants, demonstrated that they are defective in the synthesis of GABA, and shown that multiple alleles have a profound defect in receptor clustering. Mutants exhibit a ∼4-fold reduction in response to either synaptically released or iontophoretically applied glutamate. Since there is no change in the single-channel amplitude of glutamate receptors in the mutant, the reduction in current likely represents a decrease in the number of functional receptors. Since other synaptic components localize normally, the receptor phenotype is not secondary to gross defects in synapse formation. How does GAD activity influence the development of the receptor field? Since presynaptic activity is required for the clustering of glutamate receptors, one explanation for the role of GAD would be a disruption of presynaptic activity due to defects in GABAergic interneurons. This is unlikely, however, because the mutants display normal motor neuron activity. A more direct role for GAD is suggested by its localization—GAD protein localizes to presynaptic terminals of motor neurons at the NMJ. Featherstone et al. demonstrate that motor neuron–expressed GAD is essential for receptor clustering by the elegant use of mosaic, transgenic rescue. Using a promoter that only expresses in 4 of the 200 neurons in each segment of the fly nervous system, they show that expression of GAD in a single, identified motor neuron in an otherwise gad mutant embryo rescues receptor clustering at only that neuron's NMJ. In fact, overexpression of GAD in this motor neuron leads to a 5-fold increase in the clustering of receptors compared to wild type. Hence, presynaptic GAD activity appears to be a critical regulator of the postsynaptic receptor field. Since GAD converts glutamate to GABA, it could act by supplying GABA or by regulating glutamate levels. There is no evidence that GABA is a transmitter at the Drosophila NMJ; Featherstone et al. could find no response to GABA agonists or antagonists. Nonetheless, GABA could act as a trophic factor through an uncharacterized metabatropic receptor to regulate receptor clustering. An alternate explanation is that GAD regulates neuronal glutamate levels and that glutamate inhibits the formation or stabilization of the glutamate receptor field. In this model, gad mutants would accumulate high levels of glutamate that would lead to the desensitization and possible internalization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Overexpression of GAD would decrease glutamate levels, resulting in less downregulation of receptor. This model is consistent with a number of recent studies in mammalian culture systems demonstrating that glutamate can lead to the rapid internalization of its receptors (9Lissin D.V. Carroll R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How do we reconcile this potential role for glutamate with previous studies showing no requirement for vesicular release of transmitter? Featherstone et al. suggest that nonvesicular leak of glutamate could regulate extracellular glutamate levels, as has been seen in mammalian cultured neurons (8Jabaudon D. Shimamoto K. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Scanziani M. Gahwiler B.H. Gerber U Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8733-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, then other aspects of glutamate metabolism at the synapse, such as reuptake mechanisms, could also affect the levels of postsynaptic receptor. Future studies of glutamate's role in the trafficking of its receptor would be greatly aided by anatomical assays of receptor localization to complement the physiological analysis of Featherstone et al. Synaptic efficacy at the Drosophila NMJ is regulated by powerful homeostatic mechanisms (reviewed by 5Davis G.W. Goodman C.S Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At the mature NMJ, decreases in postsynaptic receptor activity lead to an upregulation of neurotransmitter release and the maintenance of synaptic strength (10Petersen S.A. Fetter R.D. Noordermeer J.N. Goodman C.S. DiAntonio A Neuron. 1997; 19: 1237-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 6DiAntonio A. Petersen S.A. Heckmann M. Goodman C.S J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3023-3032PubMed Google Scholar). The characterization of gad mutants suggests that such homeostatic forces may also act at the embryonic NMJ to shape synapse formation. However, one key ingredient is missing—the role of activity. If GAD controls glutamate levels, which in turn negatively regulate the postsynaptic receptor field, then how does the strength of the synapse feed back into this regulatory cascade? Such feedback is necessary to match postsynaptic sensitivity to presynaptic output. Possibilities include activity-dependent regulation of GAD itself or of the molecules that control nonvesicular glutamate release and glutamate reuptake. Such activity-dependent regulation of transmitter metabolism coupled with ligand-dependent regulation of receptor expression would provide a powerful mechanism for setting the gain at a developing synapse."
