https://openalex.org/W1480101062,"A calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been purified from rat brain. It was monitored during the purification by its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synapsin I. A 300-fold purification was sufficient to produce kinase that is 90-95% pure as determined by scans of stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has a specific activity of 2.9 mumol of 32P transferred per min/mg of protein. Thus, the kinase is a relatively abundant brain enzyme, perhaps comprising as much as 0.3% of the total brain protein. The Stokes radius (95 A) and sedimentation coefficient (16.4 S) of the kinase indicate a holoenzyme molecular weight of approximately 650,000. The holoenzyme is composed of three subunits as judged by their co-migration with kinase activity during the purification steps and co-precipitation with kinase activity by a specific anti-kinase monoclonal antibody. The three subunits have molecular weights of 50,000, 58,000, and 60,000, and have been termed alpha, beta', and beta, respectively. The alpha- and beta-subunits are distinct peptides, however, beta' may have been generated from beta by proteolysis. All three of these subunits bind calmodulin in the presence of calcium and are autophosphorylated under conditions in which the kinase is active. The subunits are present in a ratio of about 3 alpha-subunits to 1 beta/beta'-subunit. We therefore postulate that the 650,000-Da holoenzyme consists of approximately 9 alpha-subunits and 3 beta/beta'-subunits. The abundance of this calmodulin-dependent protein kinase indicates that its activation is likely to be an important biochemical response to increases in calcium ion concentration in neuronal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1568217878,"A 125I-labeled derivative of rat epidermal growth factor-like transforming growth factor (125I-eTGF) that retains the chemical and biological properties of native eTGF has been prepared to characterize the interaction of eTGF with epidermal growth factor (EGF) membrane receptors. Binding of 125I-eTGF and 125I-labeled mouse EGF (125I-EGF) to membrane preparations from human placenta and the A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell line was competed for to the same extent and with the same potency by either unlabeled eTGF or EGF. Components of placenta membranes and A431 membranes (145-170 kDa) were the major species affinity-labeled by cross-linking with membrane-bound 125I-eTGF or 125I-EGF. Affinity labeling of these receptor species was fully inhibited by both native eTGF and native EGF when present in excess during incubation of membranes with 125I-eTGF or 125I-EGF. The binding affinity and capacity of receptors in A431 membranes and placenta membranes were strikingly similar for eTGF and EGF. However, binding of 125I-eTGF to membrane receptors was highly sensitive to pH, being optimal only within the pH 8.0-8.5 range whereas EGF binding was optimal at pH 7.0-9.0. eTGF binding and EGF binding were modified in parallel by exposure of placental membranes to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or wheat germ agglutinin. Prolonged exposure of A431 cells to eTGF or EGF induced the same extent of down-regulation of both eTGF binding and EGF binding. eTGF-induced down-regulation of receptors in A431 cells followed the same kinetics as EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. The data indicate that despite the limited sequence homology between eTGF and EGF, these two ligands exhibit a remarkably similar mode of interaction with a common eTGF/EGF membrane receptor type."

https://openalex.org/W1526920045,"Tubulin is a major substrate for endogenous Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation in synaptic cytoplasm. The present study details the purification to apparent homogeneity and characterization of a brain cytosolic Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase which phosphorylates tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins as major substrates. The cytosolic kinase system, purified by sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose resin, calmodulin-affinity resin, and Fractogel TSK HW-55, chromatographs as a homogeneous complex of approximately 600,000 Da on Sephacryl S-300. This calmodulin-dependent kinase possesses a group of properties which specifically characterize this enzyme system: 1) the enzyme contains two calmodulin-binding doublets, rho and sigma, of approximately 52,000 and 63,000 Da, respectively; 2) both the rho and the sigma subunits demonstrate isoelectric points between 6.7 and 7.2; 3) both the rho and sigma subunits demonstrate autophosphorylation; 4) both the rho and sigma subunits show significant homologies as assessed by tryptic peptide fingerprints; 5) in the absence of substrate, both the rho and sigma subunits manifest lower mobility autophosphorylated species; 6) the kinase phosphorylates beta-tubulin equally on threonine and serine residues. Substrate specificity, kinetic parameters, calmodulin-binding properties, subunit composition, and subunit isoelectric points clearly differentiate this enzyme from other previously reported calmodulin-dependent kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1526530838,"The metabolism of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG), one of the most promising new anti-herpes virus compounds, in HeLa cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 was compared with that in the uninfected HeLa cells. In the virus-infected cells, the uptake of DHPG was enhanced and the major metabolites were found to be the mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives. The formation of these metabolites was dependent on the extracellular concentration of DHPG (0.5 to 5.0 microM). Virus-induced thymidine kinase was capable of phosphorylating DHPG to its monophosphate which could be further phosphorylated to the di- and triphosphate derivatives by the host cellular enzymes. Incorporation of the DHPG into DNA was observed in virus-infected cells. In contrast with 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, DHPG seemed not to serve as a chain terminator, but to be incorporated internally into DNA strands."
https://openalex.org/W1559121852,"Appropriately stimulated neutrophils release peroxidase and undergo a respiratory burst to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). We report here that both the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide system and OH released in this way can degrade the leukotrienes (LT) formed by neutrophils. More LTB4 and LTC4 were recovered from the supernatants of chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils (which are unable to respond to stimulation with a respiratory burst) than from normal or myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. When radiolabeled LTC4 was added, 72% of the LTC4 was recovered from the chronic granulomatous disease cells in contrast to 0% from the myeloperoxidase-deficient and normal cells. Inhibitor studies using catalase, superoxide dismutase, azide, mannitol, or ethanol suggested that LTC4 degradation was mediated primarily by the myeloperoxidase system in normal cells and by OH in myeloperoxidase-deficient cells. LTC4 degradation by the cell-free myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide system and the OH -generating acetaldehyde-xanthine oxidase-Fe2+ system had inhibitor profiles comparable to normal and myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils, respectively. LTC4 degradation products formed by the stimulated neutrophils and model systems included the 5-(S), 12-(R)- and 5-(S), 12-(S)-6-trans-isomers of LTB4. Thus phagocytes may modulate LT activity in inflammatory sites by the inactivation of these potent biologic mediators by at least two oxidative mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1574360588,"We have determined the sequence of the DNA encoding the A2 (gamma) and B subunits of Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin. The order of the subunits as they would be transcribed is A2-B and the termination codon of the A2 subunit overlaps the initiation codon of the B subunit by four bases. Sequence analysis revealed a region capable of coding for a 21-amino acid leader peptide located at the NH2 terminus of the B subunit. While the nucleotide sequence homology between the cholera enterotoxin subunits and the analogous sequences of the genes for Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) was 72 and 77% for the A2 and B subunits, respectively, the predicted amino acid sequences of the A2 subunits were less similar. Twenty-nine of 46 (63%) amino acids of the A2 subunits and 98 of 124 (79%) amino acids of the B subunits were identical between cholera enterotoxin and LT. The predicted amino acid sequence of the enterotoxin from a V. cholerae El Tor biotype strain reported here differs from the previously published amino acid sequences of the toxin from a classical biotype of V. cholerae at seven residues. Comparison of the A2 and B amino acid sequences among El Tor and classical biotypes of V. cholerae and E. coli LT demonstrates two regions of highly conserved sequences: 12 and 22 uninterrupted amino acids are the same among the A2 and B subunits, respectively, from the three strains."
https://openalex.org/W1524730607,"Particulate preparations from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells retain the enhanced ability to incorporate 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into ribosomal protein S6 (Smith, C. J., Rubin, C. S., and Rosen, O. M. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 2641-2645). A cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase that phosphorylates S6 and casein and that may be involved in the increase in S6 phosphorylation produced by insulin has been isolated based upon the observation that there is 1.5-3.0-fold higher activity in particulate preparations derived from insulin-treated cells than there is in comparable preparations from control cells. The enzyme activity was purified 2071-fold by KCl extraction, phosphocellulose chromatography, and gel filtration. The S6 phosphorylating activity was also characterized by its behavior on casein-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose chromatography and its sedimentation in glycerol gradients. None of these procedures resolved the S6 and casein kinase activities. Some of the properties of this kinase, including a molecular weight of about 35,000, inhibition by F- or phosphate, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose, and insensitivity to inhibition by GTP, are similar to those of a previously described enzyme, casein kinase I (Dahmus, M. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3319-3325; Hathaway, G. M., and Traugh, J. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 762-768)."
https://openalex.org/W1574905950,"Hep-G2 cells, pulse-labeled with L-[35S]methionine, incorporate radioactivity within 2 min into precursor forms of fibrinogen and into fibrinogen. Pulse-labeled intracellular fibrinogen is first composed of radioactive B beta chains, followed by nascent A alpha chains. Radioactive gamma chains accumulate in the cells and later contribute, via intermediate forms, to the assembly of fibrinogen. Following a pulse-chase incubation with L-[35S]methionine, the radioactive composition of newly secreted fibrinogen also reflects the fact that there is a large intracellular pool of gamma chains."
https://openalex.org/W2142872108,"Vasopressin stimulated a 40% decrease in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and a 15% decrease in [32P]phosphatidylinositol within 30 s of addition to hepatocytes prelabeled for 60 min with 32P. In hepatocytes prelabeled with [3H]inositol for 60 min, vasopressin produced 20% breakdown of phosphatidylinositol and 33% breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within 30 s. There was a 40% increase in total phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within 30 s of vasopressin addition. Breakdown of phosphatidylinositol accounted for disappearance of 95% of the inositol lipid label. In hepatocytes from rats labeled in vivo with [3H]inositol, vasopressin stimulated 10% loss of labeled phosphatidylinositol. Loss of [32P]phosphatidylinositol due to vasopressin was followed by reincorporation of label to levels greater than control while 32P reuptake into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate did not exceed control values. With in vitro [3H]inositol-labeled hepatocytes, loss of label from the phosphoinositides was followed by reuptake of tritium label to control levels. In hepatocytes labeled in vivo with [3H]inositol, reuptake of [3H]inositol label did not occur. These data indicate that the hormone-sensitive pool of hepatocyte phosphoinositides can be labeled by both in vitro and in vivo procedures. Vasopressin induces a rapid decrease of labeled phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within 30 s."
https://openalex.org/W1568234338,"The subcellular distribution of the Na+/H+ antiporter in renal proximal tubule cells was studied with differential and density gradient centrifugation. Enzyme markers for basolateral membranes [Na+/K+)-ATPase), brush border membranes (maltase), and a variety of intracellular organelles (NADPH cytochrome c reductase, thiamine pyrophosphatase, acid phosphatase, and succinate cytochrome c reductase) were simultaneously assayed in sucrose density gradients. Basolateral membranes (median rho = 1.150) were well separated from brush border membranes (median rho = 1.165) by this technique. Markers for other cellular organelles had intermediate or bimodal distributions. To determine the cellular location of the Na+/H+ antiporter, Na+-dependent collapse of preformed pH gradients was assayed in the sucrose density gradient fractions using acridine orange. Na+/H+ antiporter activity paralleled the distribution of the brush border membrane fractions; activity in the peak basolateral membrane fraction was less than 5% of that in the peak brush border fraction. To determine whether antiporter activity was potentially detectable in all cell fractions, nigericin was added to each fraction and K+/H+ exchange was assayed with acridine orange. Activity was present in all sucrose density gradient fractions. In addition, there was no alteration in Na+/H+ exchange activity measured in brush border membranes after mixing with cell sol or basolateral membranes, showing that neither inhibitors nor activators of the Na+/H+ antiporter were present in any of the cell fractions. These controls confirmed the finding that Na+/H+ antiporter activity was absent from basolateral membranes. The presence of the Na+/H+ antiporter in brush border membranes and its absence from basolateral membranes is consistent with its playing an important role in the vectorial transport of H+ from blood to tubular lumen in the renal proximal tubule."

https://openalex.org/W1528802303,"Studies of beta-adrenergic receptors on several types of intact target cells indicate that agonists, but not antagonists, show prominent KD/Kact discrepancies–lower affinities (KD) in equilibrium binding studies (i.e. in competition with antagonist radioligands) than in functional assays (Kact). In this report we show that intact S49 lymphoma cells initially bind beta-adrenergic agonists in a high affinity manner but that this high affinity binding rapidly converts to a low affinity state. This time course is similar to that of agonist-mediated desensitization in S49 cells. In competitive binding studies conducted with [125I]iodocyanopindolol or [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, IC50 values for beta-adrenergic agonists increased 13-200-fold between 1 and 60 min, whereas antagonists yielded similar IC50 values at the two time points. The binding of antagonists, but not agonists, could be simulated by a computer model based on the law of mass action. In contrast with results in intact S49 cells, crude membrane fractions yielded similar IC50 values for agonists in 1- and 60-min incubations with [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Moreover, time-dependent decreases in apparent affinity of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol were observed not only in wild type S49 cells but also in several S49 variants (UNC, cyc-, H21a) having defects in Ns, the guanine nucleotide binding protein that couples receptors to activation of adenylate cyclase, and in Kin-, an S49 variant with absent cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These results show that beta-adrenergic receptors of intact S49 cells demonstrate a prominent time-dependent decrease in apparent affinity for agonists and that this decrease in affinity does not require cAMP generation, the Ns components defective in several S49 variants or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The rapid conversion of agonist binding from high to low affinity can account for the rapid desensitization of intact cells to catecholamines and probably explains previously reported KD/Kact discrepancies of intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551150403,"Cyclic GMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase purified greater than 13,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from calf liver exhibited a single protein band (Mr approximately 102,000) on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Enzyme activity comigrated with the single protein peak on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration. From the sedimentation coefficient of 6.9 S and Stokes radius of 67 A, an Mr of 201,000 and frictional ratio (f/fo) of 1.7 were calculated, suggesting that the native enzyme is a nonspherical dimer of similar, if not identical, peptides. The effectiveness of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ in supporting catalytic activity depended on the concentration of cGMP and cAMP present as substrate or effector. Over a wide range of substrate concentrations, optimal concentrations for Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ were about 10, 1, and 0.2 mM, respectively. At concentrations higher than optimal, Mg2+ inhibited activity somewhat; inhibition by Co2+ (and in some instances by Mn2+) was virtually complete. At low substrate concentrations, activity with optimal Mn2+ was equal to or greater than that with Co2+ and always greater than that with Mg2+. With greater than or equal to 0.5 microM cGMP or 20 to 300 microM cAMP and for cAMP-stimulated cGMP or cGMP-stimulated cAMP hydrolysis, activity with Mg2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+. In the presence of Mg2+, the purified enzyme hydrolyzed cGMP and cAMP with kinetics suggestive of positive cooperativity. Apparent Km values were 15 and 33 microM, and maximal velocities were 200 and 170 mumol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ increased apparent Km and reduced Vmax for cGMP with little effect on Km or Vmax for cAMP. Co2+ increased Km and reduced Vmax for both. cGMP stimulated cAMP hydrolysis approximately 32-fold in the presence of Mg2+, much less with Mn2+ or Co2+. In the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+ and Co2+ at concentrations that increased activity when present singly inhibited cGMP-stimulated cAMP hydrolysis. It appears that divalent cations as well as cyclic nucleotides affect cooperative interactions of this enzyme. Whereas Co2+ effects were observed in the presence of either cyclic nucleotide, Mn2+ effects were especially prominent when cGMP was present (either as substrate or effector)."
https://openalex.org/W1483489328,"Abstract The aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase inducers 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3-methylcholanthrene, and benzo(a)pyrene were all shown to bind in a saturable manner to a distinct component in cytosol from both rat and C57BL/6J mouse liver. This component was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and was found to have a Stokes radius of 61 +/- 1.5 A and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.4 S under high salt conditions. Based on these parameters, which were identical for the rat and mouse receptor, a molecular weight of 111,000 was calculated. The same Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient were observed regardless of the ligand used for labeling of the receptor protein [(3H]TCDD, 3-[3H]methylcholanthrene or [3H]benzo(a)pyrene). On the other hand, 3-[3H]methylcholanthrene and [3H]benzo(a)-pyrene exhibited much more nonspecific binding than [3H]TCDD, at least partially due to contaminating serum components, and it cannot be excluded that some previous findings on low molecular weight hepatic receptors for these polyaromatic hydrocarbons may actually be explained in this way. Clearly, use of thoroughly perfused livers would seem to be a prerequisite for investigations on specific binding of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase inducers to liver cytosol. The rat hepatic TCDD receptor was also shown to be retained on DEAE-Sepharose (eluted at 0.2-0.3 M NaCl), hydroxylapatite (eluted at 0.15-0.17 M phosphate), and heparin-Sepharose (eluted at 0.3-0.4 M NaCl). In conclusion, the TCDD receptor showed similar physicochemical and chromatographic characteristics to those previously reported for the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. However, ligand competition experiments indicated that the TCDD receptor is not identical to any steroid receptor. In line with this, monoclonal anti-glucocorticoid receptor-IgG antibodies did not react with the TCDD receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1523902471,"A low molecular weight iron-sulfur protein has been purified from Tritrichomonas foetus by deoxycholate extraction of whole cells, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The purified protein was essentially homogeneous as judged by isoelectric focusing, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration. A pI of 4.3 was observed. The molecular weight of the protein was estimated to be 12,000. Chemical and spectral analysis showed the protein to have a [2Fe-2S] cluster. The absorbance spectrum of the oxidized protein showed maxima at 280, 340, 458 and shoulders at 410 and 550 nm. The maximum observed A458/A280 ratio was 0.82 and the absorbance of the oxidized protein at 458 nm was 8,000 M-1 X cm-1. The low temperature EPR spectrum of the protein reduced with dithionite revealed axial symmetry with features at g values of g = 1.94 and g = 2.02. The oxidized protein gave no EPR signal in the g = 1.8 to 2.2 range. Cell fractionation studies indicated the localization of this protein in the hydrogenosome. The protein was able to function as an electron transport component in the reduction of metronidazole (a 5-nitroimidazole derivative) by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase from T. foetus and also from Trichomonas vaginalis and Clostridium pasteurianum as well as in the reduction of cytochrome c by plant NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This protein has the characteristics of a ferredoxin and is likely to be a physiological electron carrier in hydrogenosomal pyruvate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1591207989,"We have previously shown that a DNA topoisomerase I from mouse mammary carcinoma cells is inhibited by heparin. Taking advantage of this enzyme-heparin interaction, we developed a rapid and efficient method of purification of this enzyme to near homogeneity by extraction of chromatin with 0.15 M phosphate buffer followed by two-step column chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed that the final preparation is composed of two polypeptides with apparent Mr approximately 98,000 (p98) and 102,000 (p102), p98 comprising 70% and p102 30%. Extraction and renaturation of the polypeptides from the gel shows that both p98 and p102 seem to possess topoisomerase activity. Partial proteolytic digestion of p98 and p102 with Staphylococcus aureus V8 and chymotrypsin yielded a series of identical peptides, indicating that the two polypeptides are structurally related. The enzyme sedimented through sucrose density gradient with s20,w of 4.0 S, and thus is monomeric in solution."

Protein sequence analyses covering 80% of the protein were consistent with the sequence deduced from the DNA. The mature binding protein has 271 amino acid residues and shows substantial homology to D-galactose-binding protein. A signal peptide sequence of 23 or 25 residues was also deduced from the DNA sequence. It shows the characteristic features of prokaryotic signal peptides.

https://openalex.org/W1638874881,"A new mitochondrial protein was isolated to pure form. This protein was indispensable for the formation of the cytochrome c1-c complex; hence, it was provisionally named the hinge protein for formation of the cytochrome c1-c complex, or for simplicity, merely called the hinge protein. The simplest method for the preparation of the pure protein involved essentially pH 5.5 treatment of high purity of two-band cytochrome c1 prepared from an improved method. The use of two band cytochrome c1 prepared by an improved method was preferred because the improved method apparently yielded less tight bonding between the heme-containing and colorless protein entities than that from the original methods (King, T. E. (1978) Methods Enzymol. 53, 181-191). The c1-c complex comprised 1 molar equivalent each of the hinge protein, cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c. It was demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography that in the absence of the hinge protein, there was no complex formation between cytochromes c and one-band c1. In titration of the complex formed between one-band cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c with the hinge protein present by using the increase of the Soret-Cotton effect as a criterion (Chiang, Y. L., Kaminsky, L. S., and King, T. E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 29-36), a sharp break was observed which showed the three species to be present in equivalent amounts. The hinge protein showed low extinction in the 280 nm region and exhibited poor color value and diffuse character of the band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The molecular weight was found to be (i) 9,800 from sedimentation equilibrium, (ii) 11,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and (iii) 23,000 with a Stokes radius of 22.4 A from gel filtration chromatography estimated from a standard curve with proteins of known molecular parameters. The disparities in these data from the actual value of 9,175 from calculations based on amino acid sequence, as previously reported (Wakabayashi, S., Takeda, H., Matsubara, H., Kim, C.

https://openalex.org/W1587760369,"To determine the size and subunit structure of the pancreatic cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor, 125I-CCK33 was covalently cross-linked to its receptor on mouse pancreatic acinar plasma membranes utilizing the bifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate. When CCK was cross-linked at pH 7.4 to either purified plasma membranes or to isolated pancreatic acini and then followed by preparation of plasma membranes, the major labeled protein band revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was Mr = 120,000 in the absence of reducing agent and Mr = 80,000 in the presence of reducing agent. A similar banding pattern was also observed when different cross-linkers, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) or dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate), were employed. At pH 6.0, where CCK binding to its receptors is optimal, the labeling pattern was similar to that seen at 7.4, although the two bands were more heavily labeled. Both the binding of CCK to its receptors on plasma membranes and the appearance of the two cross-linked proteins on gels were inhibited in a parallel manner by increasing concentrations of unlabeled CCK8; similar results were observed with dibutyryl cyclic GMP, a competitive inhibitor of CCK binding and action. The data indicate, therefore, that the CCK receptor possesses subunit structure whereby an Mr = 76,000 binding subunit is linked to an Mr = 40,000 nonbinding subunit by a disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1514440124,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the phosphorylation by A431 membranes of tyrosine residues in the myosin regulatory light chain (LC20) from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. In the presence of EGF, the Km of the EGF receptor kinase for LC20 is 73 microM and the V max is 17 nmol/min/mg. Two moles of phosphate are incorporated into tyrosine per mol of LC20. Trypsin digestion of the phosphorylated LC20 produces two phosphopeptides which are phosphorylated to approximately equal extents. Sequential Edman degradation of the separated phosphopeptides shows that tyrosines 142 and 155 of the protein are phosphorylated. Tyrosine 142 is located within a sequence similar to that of autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases in that five of the seven amino acids on the NH2-terminal side are acidic. Tyrosine 155 has no acidic amino acids near its NH2-terminal side. A comparison of the initial rates of phosphorylation of the two tyrosines shows that tyrosine 142 is phosphorylated at three times the rate of tyrosine 155."
https://openalex.org/W1497480433,"Two new vitamin D metabolites were isolated in pure form from separate incubations of homogenates of chick small intestinal mucosa or rat kidney employing either 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (28 microM) or 1 alpha,24R,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 as substrate (0.17-1.3 microM). The newly characterized compounds and the amounts isolated in pure form from separate isolations are, respectively: 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-24-oxo-vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3), 147 micrograms from kidney and 4.2 and 40 micrograms from intestine; 1 alpha,23,25-trihydroxy-24-oxo-vitamin D3 (1,23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3), 155 micrograms from kidney and 5.9 and 34 micrograms from intestine. Their structures were identified after extensive high pressure liquid chromatography by means of ultraviolet absorption spectrometry, mass spectrometry of the free compounds and their trimethylsilylated derivatives, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, specific chemical reduction of the 24-oxo functionality with sodium borohydride, as well as direct comparison with synthetic 1,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3. These structural assignments for both compounds correct previous determinations which had been proposed (Ohnuma, N., Kruse, J. R., Popjak, G., and Norman, A. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5097-5102). The activity of the C-24 oxidation pathway used for the production of the 1,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3 and 1,23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3 can be enhanced 10-fold by prior priming of the chicks or rats with a single intravenous dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1-12 nmol/100 g body weight); the induction of the enzyme activity is maximal by 3-6 h and returns to basal levels within 12 h. Further, 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,24,25(OH)3D3, and 1,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3 all were found to be capable of serving as a precursor with chick intestine and rat kidney homogenates of 1,23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3. Collectively these results suggest the existence of a C-24 oxidation pathway for metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 by the target intestinal mucosa and kidney to 1,23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3.

One complementing plasmid, YEp13-511, with a DNA insert of 4.8 kilobase pairs, has been characterized in detail. This plasmid restores respiratory competency in JM28, results in increased cytochrome c oxidase activity and a new form of subunit V in JM28 mitochondria, and is capable of selecting mRNA for subunit V. These results indicate that YEp13-511 carries the COX5 gene and that the subunit V encoded by this plasmid gene is capable of entering the mitochondrion and assembling into a functional holocytochrome c oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1533755764,"Analysis of products derived from 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase-leukotriene pathway showed that this fatty acid is readily converted to leukotriene (LT)A3. When 10,000 X g supernatant from rat basophilic leukemia cell homogenates was incubated with 30 microM fatty acid, 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid produced 6.2 +/- 1.1 nmol of LTA3 and arachidonic acid 15.5 +/- 1.9 nmol of LTA4 (n = 4). However, only insignificant amounts of LTB3 were formed (0.15 +/- 0.04 nmol of LTB3 and 4.2 +/- 0.4 nmol of LTB4, n = 4). These data indicate that the LTA-hydrolase requires not only the three double bonds of the triene but also the double bond at C-14 to efficiently convert LTA to LTB. These findings have significant implications for essential fatty acid deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1515210411,"Abstract Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was deglycosylated with anhydrous HF and compared with native hCG for binding and biological activity. The deglycosylated hormone (DG-hCG) had the same affinity as hCG for gonadotropin receptors in murine Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1) but was less than 1% as potent as hCG in stimulating cyclic AMP production in these cells. Exposure of MLTC-1 cells for 30 min to hCG caused a desensitization of hCG-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, whereas DG-hCG did not induce desensitization even after 4 h. hCG induced down-regulation of hCG receptors; by 4 h, 40% of the receptors had disappeared, whereas there was no receptor loss in cells exposed to DG-hCG for the same time. By 6 h, receptor down-regulation began to occur in the DG-hCG-treated cells and could be mimicked by exposing the cells to dibutyryl cyclic AMP or cholera toxin. Thus, the small increase in cyclic AMP generated by DG-hCG appears to result in some loss of receptors. Cells were incubated with iodinated hCG or DG-hCG for 30 min, washed, and incubated in fresh medium. Both bound ligands were degraded as measured by disappearance of cell-associated radioactivity and appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble label in the medium. The half-lives were 3 and 6 h for hCG and DG-hCG, respectively. Our results indicate that DG-hCG in contrast to hCG does not cause either rapid desensitization of hCG-stimulated adenylated cyclase or rapid down-regulation of hCG receptors. Therefore, receptor occupancy alone is insufficient to induce these phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1579278793,"We used an intersecting pool strategy to recognize chimeric plasmids containing Chinese hamster ribosomal protein cDNAs. The screening procedure involved hybridization-selection of messenger RNAs, cell-free translation of selected mRNAs, and electrophoresis of polypeptide products on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. The protocol was designed to recognize ribosomal protein S14 cDNAs specifically. Of 500 chimeric plasmids screened, two possessed cDNAs complementary to S14 mRNA and 18 contained sequences complementary to other ribosomal protein messages. Previously we demonstrated that mutations affecting Chinese hamster ovary cell ribosomal protein S14 are responsible for genetic resistance to the translational inhibitor emetine (emt b). Because emetine-resistant mutant and wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells elaborate mRNAs that encode electrophoretically distinguishable forms of S14 protein, we were able to identify S14 cDNA clones unambiguously. The data described here indicate that: 1) clone pCS14-1 contains most, if not all, of the S14 coding sequence as a cDNA; 2) S14 mRNA is approximately 0.01% of a Chinese hamster cell's polyadenylated messenger RNA; and 3) genomic DNA-encoding ribosomal protein S14 is a low, perhaps single, copy sequence with a complex structure, including several, long intervening sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1489933658,"To evaluate serotonin receptor kinetics in skeletal muscle, we synthesized and developed 2-[125I]iodolysergic acid diethylamide [( 125I]iodoLSD) as a high affinity, high specific activity probe of serotonergic receptor function. The kinetics of binding of this probe and the profile of agonist and antagonist displacement have been compared to results obtained using [125I] iodopindolol as a probe for beta-adrenergic receptor binding. [125I]IodoLSD was prepared by chloramine-T iodination and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Fluorescence, ultraviolet, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra as well as mass spectroscopy demonstrate that the iodinated compound is 2-iodoLSD. This probe bound in a concentration-dependent fashion to sarcolemma in a manner consistent with existence of a single population of specific receptors having a Kd of 1.46 nM and an abundancy of 47 fmol/mg of protein. Half-maximal binding of the probe occurred within 1.0 min and equilibrium binding was observed at 8.0 min. The apparent t 1/2 for the probe-receptor complex was 40 s; the Kd calculated from kinetic data was 1.69 nM. The IC50 for displacement of iodoLSD was 330 +/- 185 nM for methysergide, 757 +/- 309 nM for cyproheptadine, and 2,570 +/- 1,390 nM for serotonin. Adrenergic antagonists such as l-propranolol and oxprenolol also displaced [125I]iodoLSD, but did so with IC50 values of 17,800 +/- 5,100 and 23,300 +/- 5,500 nM, respectively. Using [125I]iodopindolol as a receptor probe, we found the order of potency for adrenergic antagonists to be l-propranolol greater than oxprenolol much much greater than practolol. Serotonergic antagonists, although effective in displacing [125I]iodopindolol, did so only at very high concentrations. These results are consistent with the existence of separate and discrete D-serotonergic and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle and the finding that adrenergic agonists and antagonists may interact with low affinities with the serotonergic receptor, but that serotonergic agonists and antagonists interact poorly, if at all, with the beta 2-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1535647297,"To study the regulation of expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene by steroid hormones, the entire ovalbumin gene and its flanking sequences were cloned together with the bacterial gene for xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in plasmid pBR322. This recombinant plasmid was linearized and used to transform an estrogen-responsive breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) which was shown to possess estrogen receptors and to be estrogen responsive. Transformants were selected by their ability to grow in a medium containing mycophenolic acid and xanthine. The entire ovalbumin gene was integrated into high molecular weight DNA within all transformants analyzed and it retained its original sequence organization. Ovalbumin mRNA and protein were identified from these transformant cells and they were found to be indistinguishable from the authentic counterparts. An 8- to 10-fold increase in the amount of ovalbumin mRNA was observed to be present in cells cultured in 10(-8)M estradiol. We also constructed a hybrid gene containing the 5'-flanking sequence and the first exon of the ovalbumin gene which was linked to the xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene such that expression of this bacterial gene would be promoted and regulated by the chicken sequences. After introduction of this hybrid gene into MCF-7 cells, we observed that the survival of the transformed cells in our selection medium was highly dependent on the presence of estradiol. Our results indicated that the chicken ovalbumin sequence was expressed properly and was regulated to some extent by estradiol in this heterologous system."
https://openalex.org/W1492547835,"Abstract We have compared the characteristics of glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) in the envelope of purified nuclei and microsomes from rat liver. The latency of mannose-6-P hydrolysis, permeability to EDTA, and susceptibility of the enzyme to protease-mediated inactivation all indicated that the permeability barrier defined by the envelope in situ is significantly disrupted in isolated nuclei (i.e. in vitro). Latency of mannose-6-P hydrolysis was demonstrated to provide a quantitative measure of the degree of nuclear membrane disruption. Electron micrographs confirmed the existence of substantial regions of the envelope in vitro where the permeability barrier to EDTA was (i.e. an intact component). The kinetics of glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzed by the component was obtained by subtracting the contribution of enzyme in disrupted regions from the total enzymic activity of untreated nuclei. The characteristics of glucose-6-phosphatase in and fully disrupted membranes of nuclei were indistinguishable from microsomes with respect to (a) the kinetics of glucose-6-P hydrolysis, (b) the effects of incubations with mannose-6-P, N-ethylmaleimide, and protease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, (c) the extremely high latency of carbamyl phosphate:glucose phosphotransferase activity, and (d) both the patterns of response of activity and the change in latency of glucose-6-phosphatase induced by fasting, experimental diabetes, and cortisol injection. Our results show clearly that apparent differences in the glucose-6-phosphatase activity of untreated preparations of nuclei and microsomes are simply expressions of significant differences in the degree of intactness of their respective permeability barriers. Since flattened cisternae, characteristic of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in situ, are preserved in regions of the envelope of isolated nuclei, the present findings constitute the most direct and definitive evidence to date that the properties of glucose-6-phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum in situ are faithfully reproduced with microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1518550248,"recA protein binds to duplex DNA in the presence of Mg2+ and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) forming a stiff nucleoprotein filament with a distinct axial repeat which contains 17 +/- 1 base pairs and spans 8-9 nm along the fiber (Di Capua, E., Engel, A., Stasiak, A., and Koller, Th. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 87-103; Dunn, K., Chrysogelos, S., and Griffith, J. (1982) Cell 28, 757-765). Measurement of the protein:DNA ratio in these filaments utilizing double label analysis and isopycnic density banding shows that there are 2 recA monomers for every 17 base pairs. The DNA is also partially unwound in this filament. Utilizing the recA-induced relaxation of naturally supertwisted SV40 DNA, we show that the DNA is unwound by 11.5 +/- 1.5 degrees/base pair which corresponds to 180-200 degrees for each repeat unit along the filament length."

https://openalex.org/W1560949187,"Abstract In an accompanying report (Bozzaro, S., and Roseman, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13882-13889), evidence is presented that the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contains three cell surface receptors specific for D-glucose, D-mannose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, respectively. The synthetic probes used for these studies consisted of the sugars covalently linked to polyacrylamide gels. In the present experiments, starved cells were placed on these and other immobilized sugars to determine whether the sugar derivatives influenced normal development in this organism. When D. discoideum cells are on a solid surface under water, they form aggregation centers and strands of cells (which radiate from the center), send signals i.e. pulses of cyclic AMP from the center down the strands, and finally, after cells in the strands migrate to the center, form tight aggregates. These results were obtained on all polyacrylamide gel derivatives tested except one class, derivatives of D-glucose (O- and S-glucosides, cellobiosides, and maltosides). On these gels, aggregation centers and strands formed normally, but at a certain point stopped signaling and suddenly dissociated, with the cells rapidly migrating away from one another by negative chemotaxis (see Appendix to this report). Furthermore, a simultaneous dissociation of several centers was often observed. Following a brief period of random movement after dissociation, aggregation centers once again formed and the cycle was repeated. This cycle was repeated as often as 30 times or more over a 24-h period. The cells on the glucoside gels became aggregation-competent at the same time as the control cells, and the adhesion-dissociation cycle appeared to have no effect on the synthesis of some developmentally regulated proteins, such as UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Interpretations of the phenomenon and its potential for studying gene regulation in this organism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563457226,"In vivo treatment of rats with triiodothyronine (30 micrograms/100 g of body weight for 4 consecutive days) inhibited poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase activity of cardiocyte nuclei, but low enzymatic activity of nuclei of noncardiocyte origin remained unaffected. RNA synthesis in cardiocyte nuclei isolated from triiodothyronine-treated rats was augmented. A positive correlation was observed between the degree of inhibition of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase and cardiac ventricular enlargement in triiodothyronine-treated animals. RNA synthesis in isolated cardiocyte nuclei was inhibited by in vitro poly(ADP)-ribosylation only when cardiocyte nuclei were obtained from triiodothyronine-treated animals. In vitro poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins were isolated from cardiocyte nuclei by solvent partitioning between phenol and aqueous phases. About 90% of the protein-poly(ADP)-ribose adducts partitioned into the aqueous fraction, and the chain length of polymers in this phase was between medium (n = 4-9) and long (n greater than 32), whereas the phenol phase contained protein-oligomer and monomer adducts. Not only the chain length of oligomers but the nature of modified proteins appeared to participate in determining the partitioning of polymer-protein adducts, and different proteins were separated from the two phases by gel electrophoresis. More than 90% of protein-polymer adducts formed by cardiocyte nuclei were not extracted by 0.25 N HCl, indicating prevalence of nonhistone proteins as polymer acceptors. Gel electrophoresis and near quantitative recovery of adducts in a gel system that protected from degradation of adducts to free polymers confirmed the predominance of nonhistone proteins as main acceptors and demonstrated an artifact of autoradiography that seemed to indicate histone H1 as a significant acceptor. Treatment with triiodothyronine diminished poly(ADP)-ribosylation of certain groups of proteins more than others, implying some degree of selectivity of action of the hormone. Catabolism of the polymer in vitro was not affected by triiodothyronine treatment."

Addition of deoxycholate solubilized egg phosphatidylcholine to the beta-adrenergic receptor, that is 5-10% pure and in 0.1% digitonin, followed by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration in buffers containing 30 mM MgCl2 results in 65-70% of the receptor being incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. The beta-adrenergic receptor as detected by photoaffinity labeling using [125I]azidobenzylpindolol in membranes and after alprenolol-Sepharose chromatography is a Mr = 40,000 peptide. Addition of deoxycholate extracts of human erythrocyte membranes, which contain the guanine nucleotide stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Ns) but not beta-adrenergic receptor, were used to reconstitute a guanine nucleotide-mediated change in agonist affinity for the receptor. These results demonstrate that the alprenolol-Sepharose affinity purified beta-adrenergic receptor is functional in both ligand binding and coupling to Ns. The procedure is rapid, efficient and should be generally applicable to beta-adrenergic receptor and Ns from several different membrane systems."
https://openalex.org/W1648589031,"Adenylate kinase prepared from a temperature-sensitive adk mutant of Escherichia coli was thermolabile at 40 degrees C while the wild type enzyme was stable. The degree of thermolability of the mutant enzyme was concentration-dependent in that a much greater thermolability was observed in the concentrated crude homogenate than in a 50-fold dilution of the crude homogenate. This concentration dependence was lost after extensive purification of the mutant adenylate kinase, although the enzyme was still thermolabile. A protein was identified that co-purified with the wild type and mutant enzyme through several purification steps and that altered the degree of thermolability of the mutant adenylate kinase. A homogeneous preparation of the adenylate kinase-associated protein gave a single band on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel with Mr = 34,000. The interaction of this protein with adenylate kinase explains why the thermolability of the mutant adenylate kinase changed during purification and the dependence of the thermolability on concentration. The adenylate kinase-associated protein may be important in regulating the activity of adenylate kinase and subsequently affecting the rate of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1529567423,"ATP-dependent calcium sequestration was previously localized in vesicles of mitotic apparatus isolated from sea urchins. We now demonstrate that the mitotic apparatus contains an ATP-regenerative system characterized as creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2). Mitotic apparatus isolated with vesicles intact converted ADP to ATP if phosphocreatine was present. Omission of ADP or phosphocreatine gave negligible ATP. When mitotic apparatus were washed with detergent-containing buffer to remove vesicles, their ability to produce ATP from ADP and phosphocreatine was reduced. Assays of creatine kinase activity using NADP+:glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase indicated that 70% of the creatine kinase activity was extractable with 0.5% Triton X-100. The insoluble residue containing the skeleton of the mitotic apparatus had the rest of the activity. Experiments with a luciferin/luciferase assay showed that Triton removed above 82% of the activity. Preparations of intact mitotic apparatus were free of cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) activity and therefore free of mitochondria. About 10(8) mitotic apparatus (total volume about 1 liter) could produce 17 mmol of ATP/min when substrates were not limiting. The creatine kinase enzyme activity described herein and the previously described membrane vesicular calcium sequestration system are nonmitochondrial, integral constituents of the sea urchin mitotic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W198178067,"The biochemical mechanisms of serotonergic and adrenergic action on skeletal muscle cyclic nucleotide, glycogen, and amino acid metabolism have been investigated in intact rat epitrochlaris skeletal muscle preparations. Endogenous catecholamine levels in these preparations were 28.6 +/- 2.1 pg/mg of muscle. Release of these catecholamines by tyramine produced a 25% inhibition of alanine and glutamine release. Pretreatment of animals in vivo with 6-hydroxydopamine depleted catecholamine content by 85%. On incubation, preparations from these pretreated animals showed no effect of tyramine on amino acid metabolism. Serotonin (10(-5) M) and epinephrine (10(-5) M) inhibited alanine and glutamine release equally in preparations from 6-hydroxydopamine-pretreated as compared to control rats. Adrenergic antagonists such as dl-propranolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M), oxprenolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M), and practolol (10(-6)-10(-4) M) blocked equally the inhibition of alanine and glutamine release, prevented the stimulations of muscle cAMP levels, phosphosphorylase a formation, and the depletion of muscle glycogen produced by either epinephrine or serotonin. In contrast, serotonergic antagonists such as methysergide (10(-8)-10(-6) M) and cyproheptadine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) blocked the inhibition of alanine and glutamine release, the stimulations of muscle cAMP levels and phosphorylase a formation, and the decreased muscle glycogen content effected by serotonin but not by epinephrine. Incubation of muscles with both epinephrine and serotonin together produced additive stimulation of muscle cAMP levels, but not of the inhibition of alanine and glutamine release. These data indicate that the action of these agonists on skeletal muscle protein and amino acid, glycogen, and cyclic nucleotide metabolism proceeds directly via separate and discrete serotonergic and adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase mechanisms in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1510093777,"Although luteinizing hormone (LH) is known to down-regulate its own receptor in several gonadal cell types, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. To elucidate these mechanisms we have examined the role of cAMP and progesterone in LH-stimulated down-regulation of the LH receptor, using cultured granulosa cells as a model. LH receptors were induced by culturing the cells with follicle-stimulating hormone for 2 days, and once induced, could be down-regulated by a brief exposure to LH. Down-regulation also occurred when cells were cultured with activators of adenylate cyclase, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, or analogues of cAMP. Cholera toxin and N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, like LH, decreased the number of LH receptors, without affecting affinity for 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The extent of receptor loss after treatment with LH plus cholera toxin was no greater than that caused by LH alone. LH, hCG, and deglycosylated hCG, which binds to the LH receptor but has little bioactivity, caused down-regulation, and their relative capacity to cause down-regulation was highly correlated with their relative capacity to stimulate cAMP production. Indirect evidence suggested that maximal down-regulation requires activation of adenylate cyclase for at least 3 h. Consistent with this idea, a 3-h exposure to dibutyryl cAMP caused near-maximal down-regulation. Progesterone secretion was enhanced by all agents that caused down-regulation of the LH receptor; however, there was little correlation between progesterone secretion and down-regulation. Furthermore, maximal down-regulation occurred when progesterone secretion was inhibited greater than 99% with cyanoketone. These data indicate that cAMP, but not progesterone, plays a central role in LH receptor down-regulation in the granulosa cell and that elevation of intracellular cAMP levels for 3 h is both necessary and sufficient to trigger maximal down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1562058736,"The trinitrophenyl derivative of ATP, 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate, has been used as a spectroscopic probe to investigate threonine-promoted conformational changes in the aspartokinase region of aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase I in an attempt to relate the structural effects of threonine binding to inhibition of enzymatic activity. Binding of this analogue substrate to the enzyme is characterized by a 9-fold enhancement in probe fluorescence. Saturating levels of the feedback inhibitor, threonine, produce a 77% increase in fluorescence enhancement, indicating an increase in the rigidity or hydrophobicity of the nucleotide-binding site in the inhibited form of the enzyme. Threonine titration studies indicate that the two inhibitor-binding sites found on each subunit do not contribute equally to the fluorescence-detected conformational change. Comparison of the spectral change with the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity has revealed the exclusive involvement of the non-kinase threonine sites. No transition can be detected as a consequence of inhibitor binding at the kinase subsites. The results of the 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate study have provided further evidence for a concerted kinase-dehydrogenase conformational change which is induced by threonine interaction with the high affinity binding sites and which provides maximal inhibition of homoserine dehydrogenase and the majority of aspartokinase inhibition. The failure to observe a distinct enzyme form produced by threonine occupation of the low affinity kinase sites suggests that no large structural reorganization of the kinase active site is produced as a result of this binding event. The conformational change, suggested by the cooperativity of threonine binding, must instead involve only a subtle or highly localized alteration which does not perturb the environment of the ATP-binding cleft."

N. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 158-165) has been purified and shown to possess both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities and is rather stable in the presence of L-threonine. Its two activities are still inhibited by threonine, but noncooperatively in contrast to the native protein. The aspartokinase activity is found to be more sensitive to threonine than the dehydrogenase activity. In the absence of threonine, the different chains of the hybrid (Mr = 89,000 + 59,000) dissociate first into monomers, this being followed by the pairing of two homologous chains to form two homodimers. In the presence of L-threonine, the two homodimers do not dissociate to re-form the hybrid fragment. The NH2-terminal analysis of different chains of the hybrid shows that the homodimers correspond, respectively, to the dimer of the native protein (Mr = 2 X 89,000) and to a dimer already described (Veron, M., Falcoz-Kelly, F., and Cohen, G.

The original gene fragment encodes for an enzymatically active polypeptide having an apparent molecular weight of 77,000. Mutant polypeptides as small as 46,000 Da were found to retain significant enzymatic activity and to confer several cya+ phenotypes on the E. coli host. More extensive deletions resulting in polypeptides as small as 33,000 Da did not have assayable amounts of adenylate cyclase activity, but the biochemical properties of the transformed cya- host implicate the presence of low levels of enzymatic activity. These data suggest that the structure of the intact enzyme is composed of discrete functional domains. Such a structure for this adenylate cyclase should both facilitate investigations of the chemical mechanism of the reaction and allow structure-function relationships in this physiologically important enzyme to be investigated on a molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1482420240,"We describe herein two different effects of protease inhibitors and substrates on receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) obtained from the intestinal mucosa of vitamin D-deficient chicks: inhibition of binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to its receptor and stabilization of the receptor. Both L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), a chymotrypsin inhibitor, and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), a trypsin inhibitor, block [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding to the receptor. Fifty per cent inhibition of binding occurs at 20 microM TPCK, and 100% inhibition at 100-200 microM; TLCK is about 25-fold less effective. At higher concentrations (10-100 mM), the chymotrypsin substrates N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and tryptophan methyl ester and the cathepsin B inhibitor leupeptin also inhibit [3H] 1,25(OH)2D3 binding to its receptor. Different inhibitors and substrates interact with the receptor differently: TPCK (20 microM) and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mM) are reversible, noncompetitive inhibitors, L-tryptophan methyl ester (20 mM) is a reversible competitive inhibitor, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (300 microM) shows no effect on [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding to its receptor. The most stable form of unoccupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors from chick intestinal mucosa was that obtained from a low salt chromatin preparation (t 1/2 = 6.0 h). The presence of KCl drastically decreased receptor stability (t 1/2 = 1.8 h); and the addition of 2.5 mM CaCl2 further reduced their stability. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Trasylol inhibited the KCl-induced receptor instability, but did not prevent the additional instability in the presence of CaCl2. In summary, TPCK and TLCK exert direct effects on the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor molecule, independent of their protease inhibitor function. These compounds may prove useful as covalent affinity labels for the receptor. On the other hand, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Trasylol stabilize 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors, probably via inhibition of KCl-activated nuclear protease(s). This receptor stabilization will be advantageous in receptor assays and/or purification procedures."

https://openalex.org/W1536936272,"Cytochrome c has been covalently attached to Sepharose 6MB to study the effects of immobilization on the molecule. A detailed study of the resulting product was conducted based on its three characteristic properties: spectra, oxidation-reduction potential, and biological activity. The spectral properties demonstrated that cytochrome c was essentially the same after attachment. No major conformational changes were indicated. The redox potentials for most samples of immobilized cytochrome c loaded with different amounts of protein were generally 20-25 mV lower than native cytochrome c (270 mV). Heavily loaded samples, however, showed no difference in potential. The Km values for immobilized cytochrome c with cytochrome oxidase and reductase from submitochondrial particles were comparable to the soluble protein. Vmax values are more strongly affected by immobilization, especially for the reductase. It has been demonstrated that the submitochondrial particles cannot penetrate the pores of the support material and therefore only the cytochrome c molecules on the surface are available for reaction. As a support material, Sepharose 6MB, which is CNBr activated, hydrolyzes at a significant rate at the pH of the coupling reaction, and this must be considered in establishing coupling conditions for protein immobilization."

Computer simulation and direct measurement of the EPR spectra from these complexes demonstrate a paramagnetic broadening of 0.6 +/- 0.1 G in the line width of the Cu2+ spectrum due to the paramagnetic Fe3+ bound at the other site. The distance between the two metal binding sites is calculated to be 41.6 +/- 2.8 A."
https://openalex.org/W2150804227,"Drosophila genomic DNAs containing a chromosomal locus 87C1 70,000-dalton heat shock protein gene, the locus 79B actin gene, and the 88F actin gene have been used as templates in an in vitro HeLa transcription system. RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription initiates from specific sites on the heat shock protein gene and the 79B actin gene. The locations of the transcription start sites were determined by two types of experiments: sizing of RNA runoff transcripts and S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' terminus of the in vitro transcripts. Transcription initiates at or near the in vivo initiation site of the heat shock protein gene and initiates at or near a site 14 nucleotides downstream of the in vivo start site of the 79B actin gene. The addition of the 79B actin, 88F actin, or heat shock protein templates to a HeLa extract transcription reaction precluded the transcription of a second template subsequently added. The exclusion occurs rapidly, within 15 s, is not dependent on transcription, and is only partially resistant to high concentrations of the second added template. We propose that stable protein-promoter complexes play an important role in maintaining exclusive transcription of the first template added in vitro."
