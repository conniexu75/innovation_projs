https://openalex.org/W2025692275,"IN two separate experiments it has been found that, 24 hr. after the administration of bovine pituitary growth hormone to mice with the hereditary syndrome of obesity and hyperglycæmia (1 mgm. of growth hormone per mouse), changes had occurred in the amounts of insulin and hyperglycæmic-glycogenolytic factor extractable from the pancreas using a standardized acid alcohol technique1. In each experiment values for insulin and hyperglycæmic-glycogenolytic factor values were compared in the following four groups of animals (ten or twelve animals per group) : obese-hyperglycæmic mice and their non-obese sibs treated with growth hormone, and two groups of the same description but not treated with growth hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2016720933,"IN the routine screening of drugs in mice, we have found only ten out of ten thousand compounds which produce sustained tremor. One of these, 1-4 dipyrrolidino-2-butyne, ‘Tremorine’, in doses of 5–20 mgm./kgm. produces tremor, salivation, meiosis, slight muscular weakness and rigidity lasting several hours. The effects are similar in mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, dogs and monkeys. In the last-named species the picture is strikingly similar to human Parkinsonism. The antagonism of these effects is complete with various drugs used for treating Parkinsonism. Atropine, scopolamine and others are highly effective in small doses of 1–2 mgm./kgm. In contrast, hypnotics, anticonvulsants and ganglionic blocking agents were without effect on tremor in doses below those causing marked depression. It thus offers a specific method for the testing of possible anti-Parkinson agents."

https://openalex.org/W2984743822,"IN connexion with our studies on the relaxing effect of the pyruvate phosphokinase system1, the following procedure was used for preparing the muscle fibres. Rabbit psoas is washed in 50 per cent (v/v) aqueous glycerol (as in the original treatment of Szent-Györgyi2) for two days at 0° C, then stripped into bundles of approximately ¼ mm. diameter and shaken at room temperature (about 25° C.) in 20 per cent (v/v) glycerol for various lengths of time. After one to two hours extraction, the fibres develop maximal isometric tension in a bath consisting of 0.1 M potassium chloride, 4 mM magnesium chloride, and 4 mM adenosine triphosphate, and there is no sign of spontaneous relaxation. However, addition of 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate brings about immediate relaxation. Further details on the relaxation with phosphoenolpyruvate will be published elsewhere; here, we wish to report on the results obtained by extracting psoas fibres in 20 per cent (v/v) glycerol for at least 24 hr. If such an exhaustively washed fibre is placed in a bath containing the above concentrations of potassium and magnesium chlorides and adenosine triphosphate, maximal tension develops, and upon the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate a spontaneous oscillation occurs as shown in Fig. 1."

Since glutamic-γ-semialdehyde spontaneously cyclizes nearly completely to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid2, hydrogenation of the latter becomes a key reaction in the biogenesis of proline."

These advantages are the immediate visual presentation of the image and a great reduction in the amount of ultra-violet radiation necessary for the production of the image, the latter advantage being due to the much greater quantum efficiency of photocathodes over photographic emulsions."

https://openalex.org/W1970205574,"ALTHOUGH it has long been known that the rare-earth metals interfere with blood clotting both in vitro and in vivo, it was not until 1950 that Vincke and Sucker1 described, in neodymium 3-sulpho-isonicotinate, a compound that was sufficiently soluble and free of toxic effects for clinical use. It is given by intravenous injection in 2.5 per cent solution and was at first regarded as a prothrombinopenic agent on the basis of a prolonged one-stage ‘prothrombin’ time. Recently, using newer techniques, Beller and Mammen2 have reported that neodymium acts by reducing factor VII and factor X, leaving prothrombin normal. We have meantime been studying, independently, the mode of action of this salt, using in particular the blood thromboplastin generation test3, with the following results."

https://openalex.org/W2093129882,"AN approximate identification of sugars separated from hydrolysates of biological material can usually be made by paper chromatography. Positive identification is usually achieved by the measurement of some specific physical property such as optical rotation, or the preparation of derivatives possessing characteristic melting points. It frequently happens that sugars separated from hydrolysates are present in insufficient amounts to enable such methods of identification to be used."

https://openalex.org/W1994837907,"RAUWOLSCINE (kindly supplied by Mrs. A. Chatterjee, University College of Science and Technology, Calcutta), an alkaloid of Rauwolfia canescens Linn.1, has been found to be a potent adrenolytic compound2,3. It has further been shown to be α-yohimbine4. Yohimbine is an adrenergic blocking alkaloid; but it produces certain other effects, such as stimulation of the central nervous system, local anæsthesia and vague aphrodisiac activity5, which have precluded its use in clinical practice. No detailed report has appeared so far of any investigation of these properties; we have therefore examined these pharmacological actions of rauwolscine with the following results."

https://openalex.org/W1972795603,"IN 1949–50 Engstrom and Lindstrom published a method for determining the cell mass by means of absorption measurements in soft X-radiation. In the wave-length range 6–12 A., the absorption of the X-radiation is proportional to the mass of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen substances. The cells are photographed together with a reference system in which the absorption – wave-length relationship is the same. The photographic emulsion and process are the main limit to accuracy and resolving power."

https://openalex.org/W1976183514,"DURING my investigation of the tolerance for morphine and codeine using ‘coughing dogs’1, I noted that acquired tolerance for these drugs by which their antitussive effects were completely lost was reduced or eliminated by an electric shock or a cardiazol shock. Morphine (2–6 mgm./kgm.) given intravenously completely depressed coughing for 1–6 hr. in such dogs on the first day of administration. By continued daily application of the drug, the dogs acquired tolerance in five to ten days; but the same drug failed to depress coughing afterwards. Similar tolerance for codeine developed in eight to fourteen days. The dogs thus made tolerant for morphine or codeine were subjected to an electric shock (a.c. 90–100 V., 2 sec.) or cardiazol shock (30–50 mgm./ kgm.). On the following day, each antitussive drug was one-fourth to three-fourths as potent, or in a few cases, quite as potent, as on the first day of administration, indicating that the shock had reduced or eliminated the tolerance."

Recently, Kershaw, Chalmers and Lavoipierre2, analysing the pattern of mosquito survival in laboratory conditions, showed that, for a cohort of 1,200, the Gompertz function was linear for both male and female."
