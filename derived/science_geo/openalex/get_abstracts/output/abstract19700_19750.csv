https://openalex.org/W2020231002,"DEFECTS in the NF1 gene have been implicated in the inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by several developmental abnormalities including an increased frequency of benign and malignant tumours of neural crest origin (neuro-fibromas and neurofibrosarcomas respectively)1. The NF1 gene encodes a ubiquitous protein homologous to p!20GAP, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the products of the ras proto-oncogenes2–6. When expressed in non-mammalian systems, the region of the NF1 gene homologous to p!20GAP produces a protein with GAP-like activity7–9. Here we present evidence that the ras proteins in malignant tumour cell lines from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis are in a constitutively activated state, as judged by the guanine nucleotide bound to them, and are necessary for cellular proliferation. These cells contain P21rasand p120GAP that are both functionally wild type, but barely any functional NF1 protein. Our results show that the NF1 protein is normally essential for correct negative regulation of ras proteins in the cell, even in the presence of normal p120GAP, and they support the hypothesis that NF1 is a tumour-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of ras."

https://openalex.org/W1525901333,"The antigen receptors on B lymphocytes are cell-surface immunoglobulins. Antibodies against surface IgM (sIgM) coimmunoprecipitate several sIgM-associated proteins. Incubation of anti-IgM complexes with [gamma-32P]ATP leads to the phosphorylation on tyrosine of IgM-associated proteins including MB-1 and a protein of 72 kDa. Peptide mapping and reimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the 72-kDa phosphoprotein is PTK72, a protein-tyrosine kinase that is expressed at highest levels in B lymphocytes. MB-1 is also phosphorylated in immune complexes prepared with antibodies to PTK72, indicating that components of the IgM complex are associated with PTK72. In addition, PTK72 is associated with sIgD complexes isolated from spleen B lymphocytes. The cross-linking of sIgM antigen receptors on B lymphocytes leads to the rapid phosphorylation of PTK72 on tyrosine and to the activation of PTK72 as measured by autophosphorylation and by the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate in anti-PTK72 immune complexes. These results suggest that the signaling cascade initiated by engagement of the B cell antigen receptor involves the increased enzymatic activity of PTK72, which is already present in a preformed antigen receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492952392,"We have determined the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the major protein core of the human heparan sulfate proteoglycan HSPG2/perlecan of basement membranes. Eighteen overlapping cDNA clones comprise 14.35 kilobase pairs (kb) of contiguous sequence with an open reading frame of 13.2 kb. The mature protein core, without the signal peptide of 21 amino acids, has a M(r) of 466,564. This large protein is composed of multiple modules homologous to the receptor of low density lipoprotein, laminin, neural cell adhesion molecules, and epidermal growth factor. Domain I, near the amino terminus, appears unique for the proteoglycan since it shares no significant homology with any other proteins. It contains three Ser-Gly-Asp sequences that could act as attachment sites for heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Domain II is highly homologous to the LDL receptor and contains four repeats with perfect conservation of all 6 consecutive cysteines. Next is domain III which shares homology to the short arm of laminin A chain and contains four cysteine-rich regions intercalated among three globular domains. Domain IV, the largest module with greater than 2000 residues, contains 21 repeats of the immunoglobulin type as found in neural cell adhesion molecule. Near the beginning of this domain, there is a stretch of 29 hydrophobic amino acids which could allow the molecule to interact with the plasma membrane. Domain V, similar to the carboxyl-terminal globular G-domain of laminin A and to the related protein merosin, contains three globular regions and four EGF-like repeats. In situ hybridization and immunoenzymatic studies show a close association of this gene product with a variety of cells involved in the assembly of basement membranes, in addition to being localized within the stromal elements of various connective tissues. Our studies show that this proteoglycan is present in all vascularized tissues and suggest that this unique molecule has evolved from the utilization of modular structures with adhesive and growth regulatory properties."

https://openalex.org/W1499552914,"To continue our mutagenesis study of the polymerase active site of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, we have characterized new mutants with substitutions at Asp705, Glu710, and Glu883, and have investigated further the mutations in residues Arg668, Gln849, and Asp882, which showed strong Kcat effects in our previous study. To determine which step of the reaction is rate-limiting for each mutant protein, we measured the effect on the reaction rate of an alpha-thio-substituted dNTP. One group of mutants showed a substantial sulfur elemental effect, while a second group, like wild-type Klenow fragment, was unaffected by the phosphorothioate substitution. Consistent with earlier data, these results imply that, between formation of the enzyme-DNA-dNTP ternary complex and completion of phosphodiester bond formation, there are two kinetically distinct steps, only one of which is sensitive to sulfur substitution. The rather complex elemental effect data obtained with the mutant derivatives of Klenow fragment are more consistent with the elemental effect being the result of a steric clash in one of the transition states than with explanations based on electronegativity differences between sulfur and oxygen. The data suggest that the side chain of Asp882 is involved in the proposed steric clash, and that Gln849 and Glu883 participate in the sulfur-sensitive step of the reaction. Based on our results, and comparisons with other phosphoryl transfer enzymes, possible mechanisms for the polymerase reaction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589541819,"The Escherichia coli fadR gene product, FadR, is a multifunctional regulator of fatty acid metabolism. In this work we have purified FadR by a two-step procedure employing two ion-exchange columns. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein confirms the sequence of the protein derived from analysis of the DNA sequence (DiRusso, C. C. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 7995-8009) and indicates that the initiating methionine is cleaved from the mature protein. Purified FadR binds to a 326-base pair HaeIII fragment of fadB DNA which carries the fadB promoter. DNase I footprinting localizes the operator to a sequence, 5‘ ATCTGGTACGACCAGAT 3‘, at +1 to +17 nucleotides relative to the start of transcription. Using protein-DNA gel retention assays, we estimate the Keq of FadR binding to the fadB operator to be approximately 3 x 10(-10) M. Binding of FadR is specifically inhibited by long chain fatty acyl-CoA compounds. The apparent Ki values for oleoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and palmitoleoyl-CoA are each 5 nM while that of myristoyl-CoA is 250 nM. Decanoyl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, and free fatty acids inhibited binding only at concentrations above 1 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1528749730,"Addition of NaCl or KCl in the presence of 50 nM ATP induces a shift in the sedimentation coefficient (apparent S20,w) of kinesin from 9.4 S at low ionic strength to 6.5 S at high ionic strength. The midpoint for the transition occurs at ionic strength values of 0.39, 0.25, and 0.18 for pH values of 6.3, 6.9, and 8.3, respectively. Gel filtration experiments indicate that the transition to the 6.5 S species is accompanied by a decrease in the diffusion coefficient. Under all conditions which were tested, the 64-kDa beta subunits comigrate with the 120-kDa alpha subunits without any evidence for dissociation of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. These results are consistent with the change in sedimentation coefficient being due to a conformational transition between a folded form at low ionic strength and an extended form at high ionic strength. This conformational transition is not significantly affected by the nature of the nucleotide bound at the active site since similar results are obtained both in the presence of excess EDTA, which removes the bound ADP, and after replacement of the bound ADP with adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate. The alpha 2 form of kinesin, which lacks the beta subunits, undergoes a similar transition between a 6.7 S form at low ionic strength and a 5.1 S form at high ionic strength with a midpoint for the transition at an ionic strength of 0.5 at pH 6.9. Electron microscopic observation also indicates a transition between a folded conformation at low ionic strength and an extended conformation at high ionic strength for both the alpha 2 beta 2 and alpha 2 species."
https://openalex.org/W1607513672,"A transformation-sensitive human protein (IEF SSP 3521) that is 2-fold up-regulated in SV40-transformed MRC-5 fibroblasts has been purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, microsequenced, and cDNA cloned using oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The 2.1-kilobase cDNA encodes a 543-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 62.6 kDa and a calculated pI of 6.77. Expression of the cDNA in AMA cells using the vaccinia virus expression system followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the protein comigrated with IEF SSP 3521. The protein contains the tetratricopeptide repeat found in families of fungal proteins required for mitosis and RNA synthesis. In particular, the protein has 42% amino acid sequence identity to STI1, a stress-inducible mediator of the heat shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Northern blot analysis indicated that the 3521 mRNA is up-regulated in several transformed cells. Immunofluorescence studies using a polyclonal antibody raised against the purified protein revealed that the antigen is present mainly in the nucleus of SV40 transformed MRC-5 fibroblasts, while it localizes to the Golgi apparatus and small vesicles in their normal counterparts. The possible physiological role of IEF SSP 3521 is discussed in the light of the structural relationship with STI1."

https://openalex.org/W1480553100,"Erythropoietin is the major regulator of the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursors, but little is known about its molecular mechanism of action. Using a human erythroleukemic cell line (HEL), we investigated whether p21ras is involved in erythropoietin signal transduction. We found that stimulation of HEL cells with erythropoietin induces a 5-fold increase in the amount of GTP bound to the endogenous p21ras. This effect is dose-dependent and occurs very rapidly. We also observed that erythropoietin causes tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in a time-dependent manner that correlates with the p21ras activation. Moreover, inhibition of tyrosine kinases by genistein totally prevents the erythropoietin-induced accumulation of a p21ras.GTP complex. By using an antiserum against the GTPase-activating protein, we found that p120GAP is rapidly phosphorylated in tyrosine in response to erythropoietin. Furthermore, the ability of a lysate from erythropoietin-stimulated HEL cells to induce in vitro hydrolysis of GTP bound to p21ras was strongly reduced. These results demonstrate that activation of p21ras is an early event in the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway, and they suggest that accumulation of the p21ras.GTP complex may be triggered by inhibition of GTPase-activating protein activity."

https://openalex.org/W1600133349,"Acetyl-coenzyme A:N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase is ubiquitous in species ranging from bacteria to mammals and is involved in the metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamines derived from mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amines and nitroarenes. The nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes O-acetyltransferase of Salmonella typhimurium was determined, and its deduced amino acid sequence was compared with those of arylamine N-acetyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.5) of higher organisms. The gene of S. typhimurium encoded a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 32,177. Chromosome DNA of S. typhimurium TA1538/1,8-DNP, an O-acetyltransferase-deficient strain, had a -1 frameshift mutation of CCC to CC at the coding region. To date, 11 genes encoding N-acetyltransferase have been cloned from human, rabbit, hamster, and chicken. The N-terminal region of O-acetyltransferase of S. typhimurium with about 170 amino acids showed 25-33% homology with the corresponding region of N-acetyltransferase of the higher organisms. Of the 5 cysteine residues of O-acetyltransferase of S. typhimurium, Cys69 was the only residue that was conserved in all N-acetyltransferases of the higher organisms. The amino acid sequence of Arg-Gly-Gly-X-Cys, including the Cys69, was highly conserved. The mutant O-acetyltransferase of S. typhimurium, which contained Ala69 instead of Cys69, no longer showed the activities of O- and N-acetyltransferase. These results suggest that the Cys69 of S. typhimurium and its corresponding cysteine residues of the higher organisms are essential for the enzyme activities as acetyl-coenzyme A-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1528191943,"A number of studies have demonstrated that a major portion of the ligand binding site of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is near cysteines 192 and 193 of the alpha subunit. The role of conserved tyrosine and aspartate residues within this region in ligand binding and receptor activation was investigated using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes. Wild-type receptors are half-maximally activated (K1/2) by 20 microM acetylcholine with a Hill coefficient, n, of 1.9. Substitution of alpha Y190 and alpha Y198 with phenylalanines (alpha Y190F, alpha Y198F) or alpha D200 with asparagine (alpha D200N) shifts the K1/2 to 408, 117, and 75 microM, respectively, with no effect on the Hill coefficient. To further study the effects of these mutations on activation, the responses of the receptors to the partial agonists phenyltrimethylammonium (PTMA) and tetramethylammonium (TMA) were examined. Wild-type receptors are half-maximally activated by 73 microM PTMA and 2 mM TMA. In contrast, alpha Y190F, alpha Y198F, and alpha D200N receptors are not activated by PTMA and TMA by concentrations of up to 500 microM or 5 mM, respectively. However, PTMA and TMA do act as competitive antagonists of the mutant receptors, an indication that the binding of these compounds is not abolished by these mutations. Comparison of the the Ki values for TMA and PTMA inhibition with the K 1/2 values for TMA and PTMA activation of wild-type receptors indicates that the affinities of these compounds are similar in wild-type and mutant receptors. Therefore, alpha Y190F, alpha Y198F, and alpha D200N mutations do not significantly alter the affinity of the ligand binding site; rather, these mutations appear to interfere with the coupling of ligand binding to channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W2015774783,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism of signaling in pathways that regulate T cell receptor-mediated cell activation, cell proliferation, and the cell cycle. Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is though to affect normal cell signaling, tyrosine phosphorylation may be associated with HIV cytopathicity. In both HIV-infected cells and transfected cells that stably express HIV envelope glycoproteins undergoing HIVgp41-induced cell fusion, a 30-kilodalton protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine with kinetics similar to those of syncytium formation and cell death. When tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A, envelope-mediated syncytium formation was coordinately reduced. These studies show that specific intracellular signals, which apparently participate in cytopathicity, are generated by HIV and suggest strategies by which the fusion process might be interrupted."
https://openalex.org/W1551220962,"Although transcription of mast cell (MC) secretory granule neutral protease genes has been shown to distinguish MC subclasses in mucosal and serosal environments, the specific cytokines that regulate the expression of these genes have not been determined. To examine cytokine-mediated gene regulation, bone marrow-derived MC (BMMC) differentiated in vitro were obtained by culturing mouse bone marrow progenitor cells in the presence of WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium, concanavalin A-stimulated splenocyte-conditioned medium (BMMCC), or recombinant (r) interleukin (IL)-3 (BMMCIL-3). All three populations of BMMC expressed the serosal MC-specific transcripts that encode mouse MC serine protease (MMCP)-5, MMCP-6, and MC carboxypeptidase A. However, only BMMCC contained MMCP-2 mRNA, a late expressed gene selectively transcribed by intestinal mucosal MC that proliferate during helminthic infestation in response to the T cell-derived cytokines IL-3, IL-4, and IL-10. When BMMCIL-3 were exposed to rIL-10 in the presence of either rIL-3 or rIL-4, they expressed MMCP-2 mRNA. Not only was the transcription of the MMCP-2 gene in BMMC dependent on continuous exposure of the cells to rIL-10, but the level of MMCP-2 mRNA in these cells could be down-regulated by rIL-3. These studies comparing the effects of two cytokines on the transcriptional regulation of secretory granule protease genes in MC demonstrate that rIL-10 induces BMMCIL-3 to express the mucosal MC protease MMCP-2, that rIL-3 attenuates the rIL-10-induced expression of this gene, and that transcription of the MMCP-2 gene is reversed in the absence of rIL-10."
https://openalex.org/W1534201638,"Calpastatin, a specific inhibitor of calpain, consists of a unique N-terminal domain (domain L) and four repetitive calpain-inhibition domains (domains 1-4). Calpastatin cDNA of human was reported to have two deletions in domains L and 1, as compared with that of pig and rabbit. We isolated human calpastatin genomic DNA clones, and the sequence analysis revealed seven exons for domain L and five exons for domain 1. Those deletions in the human cDNA were retained in its genomic DNA as exons 3 and 11. By the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, three calpastatin cDNAs, full-length domains L and 1, and two natural mutants with deletions in either exon 3 or in both exons 3 and 5, were cloned from human fibroblast WI-38 cell line mRNA. Domain L was found to be rich in basic amino acid residues, especially for exon 3, and its N-terminal half was highly conserved among species. The isoelectric points (pI) of domain L and domains 1-4 were calculated to be 10.27 and 4.26-4.90, respectively. Moreover, human tissues and cell lines displayed different patterns of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products in agarose gel electrophoresis. Therefore, alternative splicing is most likely the cause for the molecular diversity, and the multiple isoforms are implicated for specific physiological roles."

A soluble squalene synthetase protein with an estimated mass of 32-35 kDa, as determined by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 column, was solubilized out of the microsomes by controlled proteolysis with trypsin. Approximately 25% of the activity was recovered in a soluble form. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity utilizing a series of column chromatography purification steps on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and phenyl-Sepharose sequentially. The purified enzyme showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Initial kinetic analysis indicated an S0.5 values for trans-farnesyl diphosphate of 1.0 microM and for NADPH of 40 microM. The Vmax with respect to trans-farnesyl diphosphate was calculated at 1.2 mumol/min/mg. NADH also serves as substrate for the reaction with S0.5 value of 800 microM. Western blot analysis utilizing rabbit antisera raised against the purified, trypsin-truncated enzyme showed a single band for the isolated solubilized enzyme at 32-33 kDa and a band for the intact microsomal enzyme at about 45-47 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1590684872,"CCAAT-binding factors A (CBF-A) and B (CBF-B) are two subunits of the heteromeric CCAAT-binding factor. Portions of CBF-A and CBF-B have a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to segments of the HAP3 and HAP2 subunits of a yeast multimeric transcription factor. We show here that the subunits of CBF interact with each other in the absence of DNA binding. This interaction was revealed by cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation studies. Both the DNA binding and subunit interaction functions of CBF-B have been examined by mutational analysis. A segment of 83 amino acids from residues 252 to 334, which corresponds to the evolutionarily conserved portion of CBF-B, is necessary and sufficient for CBF-A-dependent DNA binding. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of this segment (or mutations in arginine residues in this carboxyl-terminal part) abolish DNA binding, but do not alter subunit interactions between CBF-A and CBF-B. Mutations in hydrophobic amino acids within the amino-terminal part of the evolutionarily conserved sequence at positions 252-334 result in loss of both DNA binding and subunit interaction activities. Our results indicate that the evolutionarily conserved segment of CBF-B contains both DNA-binding and subunit interaction domains and that the integrity of both domains is essential for DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1530087074,"Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) has recently been identified as a target for antiviral and antifungal therapy. Candida albicans is a dimorphic, asexual yeast that is a major cause of systemic fungal infections in immunosuppressed humans. Metabolic labeling studies indicate that C. albicans synthesizes one principal 20-kDa N-myristoyl-protein. The single copy C. albicans NMT gene (ca-NMT1) was isolated and encodes a 451-amino acid protein that has 55% identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMT. C. albicans NMT1 is able to complement the lethal phenotype of S. cerevisiae nmt1 null mutants by directing efficient acylation of the approximately 12 endogenous N-myristoylproteins produced by S. cerevisiae. C. albicans NMT was produced in Escherichia coli, a prokaryote with no endogenous NMT activity. In vitro studies of purified E. coli-derived S. cerevisiae and C. albicans NMTs revealed species-specific differences in the kinetic properties of synthetic octapeptide substrates derived from known N-myristoylproteins. Together these data indicate that C. albicans and S. cerevisiae NMTs have similar yet distinct substrate specificities which may be of therapeutic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1630233667,"The molecular basis of a mutation conferring an erythromycin-resistance phenotype was explored, as an approach to the role of 23 S rRNA in the peptidyl-transferase activity of 50 S ribosomal subunits. Mutagenization of an Escherichia coli strain, which carried the multicopy plasmid pLC7-21 containing the rrnH operon, led to the production of an erythromycin-resistant strain. Plasmid pBFL1 isolated from this mutant was able to transform the sensitive RecA- strain EM4 and to induce a type of antibiotic resistance. Two ribosome populations occurred in EM4/pBFL1: normal particles coded for by the seven rrn chromosomal genes and mutated particles containing rRNA of plasmid origin. The latter particles displayed in vitro lower affinity and susceptibility to erythromycin than wild type particles. The mutation within plasmid pBFL1 was mapped by a multiple primer extension technique. Three synthetic primers were used to sequence the central loop in domain V of 23 S rRNA, leading to identification of a C to U transition at position 2611. This base change was proved to be responsible for the erythromycin-resistance phenotype by the plasmid-plasmid marker rescue technique. A molecular explanation for the rrn mutations leading, respectively, to undissociated and to dissociated types of resistance to the MLSb (macrolide-lincosamide-synergimycin B) group of antibiotics is proposed. These results and some literature data support the notion that rRNA bases involved in antibiotic resistance play a conformational role in the ribosomal binding sites for the MLSb antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1542852458,"The NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase was purified to apparent homogeneity from Lactobacillus bulgaricus and its complete amino acid sequence determined. Two gaps in the polypeptide chain (10 residues) were filled by the deduced amino acid sequence of the polymerase chain reaction amplified D-lactate dehydrogenase gene sequence. The enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits (specific activity 2800 +/- 100 units/min at 25 degrees C). Each subunit contains 332 amino acid residues; the calculated subunit M(r) being 36,831. Isoelectric focusing showed at least four protein bands between pH 4.0 and 4.7; the subunit M(r) of each subform is 36,000. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters, Km, Vm, and kcat/Km, suggested an enzymic residue with a pKa value of about 7 to be involved in substrate binding as well as in the catalytic mechanism. Treatment of the enzyme with group-specific reagents 2,3-butanedione, diethylpyrocarbonate, tetranitromethane, or N-bromosuccinimide resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. In each case, inactivation followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Inclusion of pyruvate and/or NADH reduced the inactivation rates manyfold, indicating the presence of arginine, histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues at or near the active site. Spectral properties of chemically modified enzymes and analysis of kinetics of inactivation showed that the loss of enzyme activity was due to modification of a single arginine, histidine, tryptophan, or tyrosine residue. Peptide mapping in conjunction with peptide purification and amino acid sequence determination showed that Arg-235, His-303, Tyr-101, and Trp-19 were the sites of chemical modification. Arg-235 and His-303 are involved in the binding of 2-oxo acid substrate whereas other residues are involved in binding of the cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1587560668,"We have recently isolated cDNA clones representing four alternative splice forms of a T cell-specific transcription factor, TCF-1. Here we report the characterization of the human gene encoding this factor. The TCF-1 gene is contained in 10 exons including an untranslated first exon. The DNA-binding high mobility group (HMG) box of TCF-1 is encoded by the closely spaced exons VI and VII. Differential splicing involves an alternative exon (IX) and three splice acceptor sites in exon X. Based on comparison of sequence and on the placement of an alternative exon, TCF-1 appears closely related to the recently characterized HMG box transcription factor TCF-1 alpha/LEF. In particular, the HMG boxes encoded by the two TCF genes are virtually identical. The TCF-1 gene resides on chromosome 5 band q31.1. The TCF-1 promoter coincides with a CpG island. As determined by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis, the promoter is preferentially active in T cells. The promoter does not contain TCF-1/TCF-1 alpha binding sites and is therefore not autoregulated. This observation implies the existence of yet uncharacterized T cell transcription factors that are active during early T cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1504597376,"We have used a fluorescence-activated cytotoxicity protocol, 9-(1‘-pyrene)nonanol (P9OH)/UV selection (Morand, O. H., Allen, L.-A. H., Zoeller, R. A., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1034, 132-141), to isolate a series of plasmalogen-deficient mutants in a murine, macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7. Three of these mutants, RAW.7, RAW.12, and RAW.108, displayed varying degrees of plasmalogen deficiency (48, 17, and 14% of wild-type levels, respectively), and all three mutants were deficient in peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) acyltransferase activity (5% of wild-type). Unlike previously described Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants, the RAW mutants contained intact, functional, peroxisomes and normal levels of alkyl-DHAP synthase activity, a peroxisomal, membrane-bound enzyme. In RAW.7 and RAW.108 cells, the loss of peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase is the primary lesion. RAW.12 displayed not only a deficiency in the DHAP acyltransferase activity, but also displayed a second lesion in the biosynthetic pathway, a deficiency in delta 1‘-desaturase activity (plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, EC 1.14.99.19), the final step in plasmenylethanolamine biosynthesis. The deficiencies expressed in the mutants represent unique lesions in plasmalogen biosynthesis. Since the RAW cell line is a macrophage-like responsive cell line, these mutants can be used to examine the role of plasmalogens in cellular functions such as arachidonic acid metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, protein secretion, and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1563739761,"In an attempt to identify proteins involved in the secretory response, bovine chromaffin cells were modified with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM concentrations less than 30 microM enhanced norepinephrine secretion evoked by nicotine or by K+ depolarization and increased Ca(2+)-dependent secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells. Higher concentrations of NEM inhibited secretion. The protein modified by NEM which was responsible for the enhancement of secretory activity appeared to rapidly diffuse out of the digitonin-permeabilized cells. When proteins which diffuse from control digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated with pertussis toxin and [32P]NAD, several proteins were ADP-ribosylated. However, when proteins from cells preincubated with 30 microM NEM were incubated with pertussis toxin and [32P]NAD, these GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) were not ADP-ribosylated, which suggests that they were modified in the cell by NEM. Stimulation of norepinephrine secretion by NEM was not additive with that caused by pertussis toxin. Modification of chromaffin cells with pertussis toxin or with 30 microM NEM caused a 40-50% decrease in the amount of cytoskeletal F-actin. This decrease in cytoskeletal F-actin may account for the increase in secretory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1582008322,"Three human plasma proteins contain intramolecular thioester bonds: complement components C3 and C4 and alpha 2-macroglobulin. Their thioesters form when glutamine and cysteine residues react in the newly translated proteins and ammonia is released. We have reversed this reaction by treating C3 with ammonia to cleave the thioester and reform the original Gln and Cys. Thioester scission initiates a multistep conformational transition. One intermediate was sufficiently stable to be isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. It lacked native C3 functions and was shown to contain one free sulfhydryl group. Incubation of this ammonia-inactivated C3 intermediate in the absence of ammonia resulted in refolding to a native C3 conformation and recovery of thioester-dependent functions, as evidenced by: 1) return of hemolytic function, 2) return of autolytic cleavage of the alpha-chain, and 3) return of the ability to attach to surfaces during complement activation. Refolding and thioester reformation were dependent on a free SH group and were inhibited by HgCl2 and other thiol-specific reagents. Incubation of ammonia-inactivated C3 at 25 degrees C at pH 7.4 resulted in recovery of 70% of the original C3 function. Refolding and thioester reformation exhibited a Gibbs free energy of +5.2 kcal/mol and were favored over unfolding to the final inactive form. During reformation of native C3 from 14CH3NH2-treated C3, return of the native conformation was accompanied by release of radiolabel from the protein and return of hemolytic complement function. These results suggest that folding of C3 provides both the energy and environment necessary to react the Gln and Cys residues, release ammonia, and form the thioester bond."
https://openalex.org/W1564650554,"Genetic evidence argues that the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II functions directly in the regulation of transcription of many eukaryotic genes. The observation that partial deletion of the CTD of yeast RNA polymerase II reduces the ability of the enzyme to respond to signals from a variety of upstream activating sequences led to the proposal that the CTD plays a role in the dialogue between regulatory factors that bind upstream activating sequences and the general or transcription factors associated with RNA polymerase II at the promoter (Scafe, C., Chao, D., Lopes, J., Hirsch, J. P., Henry, S., and Young, R. A. (1990) Nature 347, 491-494). Biochemical evidence for an interaction of the CTD with specific components of the basal transcription apparatus, however, has been lacking. To identify target(s) for CTD action, we probed steps in assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex with monoclonal antibodies specific for the CTD. Our findings reveal a novel interaction of the CTD with a high molecular mass form of the TATA factor. This interaction occurs during binding of RNA polymerase II to its promoter and requires the action of additional basal transcription factors; it is not observed when the single-subunit yeast transcription factor IID serves as the TATA factor."
https://openalex.org/W1485152408,"The influx of L-threonine through system ASC does not influence the membrane potential in cultured human fibroblasts although comparable fluxes of amino acids through another Na(+)-dependent agency, system A, effectively depolarize the cells. The membrane potential, however, stimulates the influx of amino acids through system ASC with a maximal effect at -50 mV. The sensitivity of amino acid influx through system ASC to the membrane potential is not constant, but rather, is dependent on intracellular and extracellular concentrations of the substrates, Na+ and amino acids, of the system. Conditions which favor the loading of the ASC carrier at the external surface reduce the sensitivity of ASC-mediated amino acid influx to the membrane potential; in contrast, the sensitivity of this amino acid influx increases under conditions which favor loading of the carrier at the internal surface. Trans-stimulation, a well-known characteristic of system ASC, also varies with the concentrations of the substrates of the system and, in fact, this characteristic is not observed when external Na+ is low. These data may be accommodated by a model in which an electrically silent mode of operation of the transporter is dominant. The influence of the membrane potential on the transport system is dependent on the extent to which a charge-translocating step in the cycling of the carrier is rate limiting (relative rate limitance)."
https://openalex.org/W1498362088,"The leucine aminopeptidase of Aeromonas proteolytica (EC 3.4.11.10) is a monomeric metalloenzyme having the capacity to bind two Zn2+ atoms in the active site. Structural information of this relatively small aminopeptidase that could illuminate the catalytic mechanism of the metal ions is lacking; hence, we have obtained sequences from the purified enzyme, cloned the corresponding gene, and expressed the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. The deduced primary amino acid sequence of this secreted protease suggests a potential signal peptide at the NH2 terminus. Expression of the recombinant and native proteins in E. coli and in extracts of culture media of A. proteolytica indicates that the aminopeptidase is secreted as an active and thermosensitive 43-kDa protein that is rapidly transformed to thermostable forms of 30 and 32 kDa. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the A. proteolytica leucine aminopeptidase with other Zn(2+)-binding metalloenzymes failed to show homologies to the consensus binding sequence His-Glu-X-X-His for the metal ion."
https://openalex.org/W1605657905,"Methylation interference and missing contact analyses demonstrate that nuclear factor I (NF I) recognizes an NF I-like site (5'-GGG(N)6GCCAG-3') within the alpha-globin promoter rather than the adjacent CCAAT box. Consistent with this, mutations within the CCAAT box do not alter significantly the affinity and specificity of the interaction whereas elimination of the 5'-GGG-3' half-site of the recognition sequence reduces the DNA binding strength of NF I by 2 orders of magnitude down to the range of unspecific interaction. On the other hand, the mutated alpha-globin promoter sequence that is no longer bound by NF I, although it retains an intact CCAAT box, interacts specifically with a protein component from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. From these results we conclude that NF I is not the factor that interacts with the CCAAT box and that the second half of the canonical 5'-TGG(N)6GCCAA-3' NF I binding site cannot be regarded as identical with the CCAAT promoter element, as suggested previously."

https://openalex.org/W1495028397,"The amidrazone of D-mannonolactam (see compound 5, Fig. 1) was synthesized chemically as a mimic of the mannopyranosyl cation and tested as a potential inhibitor of mannosidases. In this study compound 5 is shown to be a more general mannosidase inhibitor than other currently known compounds and exhibits properties not previously observed with any other mannosidase inhibitors. Thus D-mannonolactam amidrazone not only inhibits the Golgi mannosidase I (IC50 = 4 microM) and mannosidase II (IC50 = 90-100 nM), but it is the first inhibitor that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the soluble or endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase (IC50 = 1 microM). This compound also inhibited the aryl-mannosidases regardless of anomeric configuration although it was much more effective on enzymes recognizing alpha-linked mannose, i.e. jack bean and mung bean alpha-mannosidases (IC50 = 400 nM) as compared with fungal beta-mannosidase (IC50 = 150 microM). Mannonoamidrazone was tested in animal cell cultures using influenza virus-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a model system, and was found to prevent almost completely the formation of complex types of N-linked oligosaccharides with the formation of about equal amounts of Man9(GlcNAc)2 and Man8(GlcNAc)2 structures. Thus D-mannonolactam amidrazone is a potent but broad spectrum mannosidase inhibitor whose structure and properties should provide valuable insight into the design of other useful glycosidase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1482691597,"Prothymosin alpha (PT-alpha) mRNA levels were evaluated at different stages during the cell cycle. NIH 3T3 cells were synchronized: (a) by serum deprivation, (b) by mitotic shake off after nocodazole arrest, and (c) by double thymidine block. Cell synchronism was estimated by flow cytometry. In cells grown in serum-free medium, PT-alpha mRNA levels were almost undetectable. 14 h after serum restoration PT-alpha mRNA was induced as had been described by others (Eschendfeldt, W. H., and Berger, S. L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 9403-9407). PT-alpha mRNA induction seems to require the synthesis of proteic factor(s) since PT-alpha mRNA response to serum restoration was abolished in the presence of cycloheximide. Interestingly, cycling cells that were synchronized at different stages of the cycle by means of mitotic shake off after nocodazole arrest or double thymidine block did not show variations in the levels of PT-alpha mRNA when progressed synchronously through the cycle. On the contrary, histone H4 mRNA was expressed only during the S phase. These data indicate that PT-alpha mRNA was present in roughly the same amount through all phases of the cell cycle, arguing against the concept that PT-alpha is a cell cycle-regulated gene."

https://openalex.org/W1592353191,"Abstract We have recently shown that thrombin-stimulated human platelets have specific, saturable receptors for factor IXa, occupancy of which promotes factor X activation (Ahmad, S. S., Rawala-Sheikh, R., and Walsh, P.N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3244-3251, 20012-20016; Rawala-Sheikh, R., Ahmad, S. S., and Walsh, P. N. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2606-2611). To study the structural requirements for factor IXa binding to platelets, we have carried out equilibrium binding studies with human factor IXa after replacing the first epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain by the corresponding polypeptide region of factor X (Lin, S.-W., Smith, K. J., Welsch, D., and Stafford, D. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 144-150). The chimeric protein, factor IX(Xegf1), as well as the wild-type, factor IXwt, produced in embryo kidney cells, and factor IX isolated from human plasma were radiolabeled with 125I and activated with factor XIa. Direct binding studies with thrombin-activated platelets showed normal stoichiometry and affinity of binding of factor IXa(Xegf1) (566 sites/platelet, Kd = 0.69 nM) and factor IXawt (590 sites/platelet, Kd = 0.61 nM) in the presence of factor VIIIa (5 units/ml) and factor X (1.5 microM) compared to factor IXaN (558 sites/platelet, Kd = 0.67 nM). The concentration of factor IXaN, factor IXawt, and factor IXa(Xegf1) required for half-maximal rates of factor Xa formation were 0.63, 0.7, and 0.83 nM, indicating that the Kdapp for binding of factor IXa(Xegf1) to the factor X activating complex on activated platelets is normal. These studies suggest either that the EGF-1 domain of factor IXa is not involved in factor IXa binding to platelets or that the EGF-1 domain from factor X when inserted into factor IXa, suffices to promote normal factor IXa binding."

https://openalex.org/W2123497748,"Crystallographic studies of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum suggest that active-site Asn111 interacts with Mg2+ and/or substrate (Lundqvist, T., and Schneider, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12604-12611). To examine possible catalytic roles of Asn111, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace it with a glutaminyl, aspartyl, seryl, or lysyl residue. Although the mutant proteins are devoid of detectable carboxylase activity, their ability to form a quaternary complex comprised of CO2, Mg2+, and a reaction-intermediate analogue is indicative of competence in activation chemistry and substrate binding. The mutant proteins retain enolization activity, as measured by exchange of the C3 proton of ribulose bisphosphate with solvent, thereby demonstrating a preferential role of Asn111 in some later step of overall catalysis. The active sites of this homodimeric enzyme are formed by interactive domains from adjacent subunits (Larimer, F. W., Lee, E. H., Mural, R. J., Soper, T. S., and Hartman, F. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15327-15329). Crystallography assigns Asn111 to the amino-terminal domain of the active site (Knight, S., Anderson, I., and Branden, C.-I. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215, 113-160). The observed formation of enzymatically active heterodimers by the in vivo hybridization of an inactive position-111 mutant with inactive carboxyl-terminal domain mutants is consistent with this assignment."
https://openalex.org/W1483399418,"The insect cell line derived from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) does not express the activities of the trifunctional NADP-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. The lack of synthetase activity was confirmed by the inability to incorporate radiolabeled formate into nucleotides. The cells express, instead, a Mg2+ and NAD-dependent bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase with properties similar to the enzyme found in the mitochondria of transformed mammalian cells. In contrast, the enzyme in Sf9 cells is localized in the cytoplasm. Nutritional studies in defined medium with dialyzed serum demonstrated that the Sf9 cell does not required added purines or pyrimidines for growth. It is auxotrophic for cysteine and glycine; this latter requirement is probably due to the absence of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Incorporation of labeled glycine and serine into DNA indicates that only serine is a source of one-carbon units. These results suggest that the mitochondria in Sf9 cells do not play a major role in folate-mediated metabolism."
