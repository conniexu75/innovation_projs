https://openalex.org/W2036078488,"The near-field optical interaction between a sharp probe and a sample of interest can be exploited to image, spectroscopically probe, or modify surfaces at a resolution (down to âˆ¼12 nm) inaccessible by traditional far-field techniques. Many of the attractive features of conventional optics are retained, including noninvasiveness, reliability, and low cost. In addition, most optical contrast mechanisms can be extended to the near-field regime, resulting in a technique of considerable versatility. This versatility is demonstrated by several examples, such as the imaging of nanometric-scale features in mammalian tissue sections and the creation of ultrasmall, magneto-optic domains having implications for highdensity data storage. Although the technique may find uses in many diverse fields, two of the most exciting possibilities are localized optical spectroscopy of semiconductors and the fluorescence imaging of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048205085,"A new magnetic material with appreciable optical transmission in the visible region at room temperature has been isolated as a gamma-Fe(2)O(3)/polymer nanocomposite. The synthesis is carried out in an ion-exchange resin at 60 degrees C. Magnetization and susceptibility data demonstrate loading-dependent saturation moments as high as 46 electromagnetic units per gram and superparamagnetism for lower loadings where particle sizes are less than 100 angstroms. Optical absorption studies show that the small-particle form of gamma-Fe(2)O(3) is considerably more transparent to visible light than the single-crystal form. The difference in absorption ranges from nearly an order of magnitude in the ""red"" spectral region to a factor of 3 at 5400 angstroms. The magnetization of the nanocomposite is greater by more than an order of magnitude than those of the strongest room-temperature transparent magnets, FeBO(3) and FeF(3)."
https://openalex.org/W1999419352,"By means of high-resoluton transmission electron microscopy, both C(60) and C(70) fullerenes have been found in a, carbon-rich Precambrian rock from Russia The fullerenes were confirmed by Fourier transform mass spectrometry with both laser desorption and thermal desorption/electron-capture methods to verify that the fullerenes were indeed present in the geological sample and were not generated by the laser ionization event. The mass spectra were measured under conditions sufficient to resolve the (13)C/(12)C isotopic ratios for C(60) and C(70) and indicate that these ratios correspond to the normal range of isotopic values."
https://openalex.org/W1988512998,"Studies in heterogeneous catalysis have long speculated on or have provided indirect evidence for the role of hydrogen embedded in the catalyst bulk as a primary reactant. This report describes experiments carried out under single-collision conditions that document the distinctive reactivity of hydrogen embedded in the bulk of the metal catalyst. Specifically, the bulk H atom is shown to be the reactive species in the hydrogenation of CH(3) adsorbed on Ni(111) to form CH(4), while the H atoms bound to the surface were unreactive. These results unambiguously demonstrate the importance of bulk species to heterogeneous catalytic chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2006355515,"Oceanic plankton have been hypothesized to occur in micropatches (<10 meters) that can have a large impact on marine ecosystem dynamics. Towed video microscopy was used to unobtrusively determine distributions of oceanic plankton over a continuum of scales from microns to hundreds of meters. Distinct, taxa-specific aggregations measuring less than 20 centimeters were found for copepods but not for nonmotile (cyanobacterial colonies) or asexual (doliolid phorozooids) forms, which suggests that these small patches are related to mating. Significant patchiness was also found on larger scales and was correlated among taxa, indicating physical control. These video observations provide new insights into basic plankton ecology by allowing quantitative assessment of individual plankton in their natural, undisturbed state."
https://openalex.org/W1994126491,"Silicic tuffs infilling an ancient submarine caldera, at Mineral King in California, show microscopic fabrics indicative of welding of glass shards and pumice at temperatures >500 degrees C. The occurrence indicates that subaqueous explosive eruption and emplacement of pyroclastic materials can occur without substantial admixture of the ambient water, which would cause chilling. Intracaldera progressive aggradation of pumice and ash from a thick, fast-moving pyroclastic flow occurred during a short-lived explosive eruption of approximately 26 cubic kilometers of magma in water >/=150 meters deep. The thickness, high velocity, and abundant fine material of the erupted gas-solids mixture prevented substantial incorporation of ambient water into the flow. Stripping of pyroclasts from upper surfaces of subaqueous pyroclastic flows in general, both above the vent and along any flow path, may be the main process giving rise to buoyant-convective subaqueous eruption columns and attendant fallout deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2070367141,"The drift of spiral waves toward regions of higher light intensity was observed experimentally in the ruthenium-catalyzed Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. A light gradient can thus be used to manipulate optical information in new computational systems based on photochemical media. The drift of a gradient that is rotationally invariant in space is three to four times as fast as that of a translationally invariant gradient. Simulations based on the use of a cellular automaton, which is made isotropic by a semirandom distribution of cells, are in agreement with the experimental results."
https://openalex.org/W2023362159,"The rate coefficients for the reaction of hydroxyl (OH) radicals with methyl chloroform (CH(3)CCI(3)) were measured between 243 and 379 kelvin with the pulsed photolysis-laserinduced fluorescence method. The measured rate coefficients at 298 and 277 kelvin were approximately 20 and approximately 15%, respectively, lower than earlier values. These results will increase the tropospheric OH concentrations derived from the CH(3)CCI(3) budget analysis by approximately 15%. The predicted atmospheric lifetimes of species whose main loss process is the reaction with OH in the troposphere will be lowered by 15% with consequent changes in their budgets, global warming potentials, and ozone depletion potentials."
