https://openalex.org/W2088094960,"To characterize proteins that bind to the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and the kappa light chain enhancers, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with end-labeled DNA fragments was used. Three binding proteins have been found. One is NF-A, a factor found in all tested cell types that binds to the octamer sequence found upstream of all Ig variable region gene segments and to the same octamer in the heavy chain enhancer. The second, also ubiquitous, protein binds to a sequence in both the heavy chain and the kappa enhancers that was previously shown to be protected from methylation in vivo. Other closely related sites do not compete for this binding, implying a restriction enzyme-like binding specificity. The third protein binds to a sequence in the kappa enhancer (and to an identical sequence in the SV40 enhancer) and is restricted in its occurrence to B cells."

https://openalex.org/W1969560454,"Expression of the ras oncogene is thought to be one of the contributing events in the initiation of certain types of human cancer. To determine the cellular activities that are directly triggered by ras proteins, the early consequences of microinjection of the human H-ras proteins into quiescent rat embryo fibroblasts were investigated. Within 30 minutes to 1 hour after injection, cells show a marked increase in surface ruffles and fluid-phase pinocytosis. The rapid enhancement of membrane ruffling and pinocytosis is induced by both the proto-oncogenic and the oncogenic forms of the H-ras protein. The effects produced by the oncogenic protein persist for more than 15 hours after injection, whereas the effects of the proto-oncogenic protein are short-lived, being restricted to a 3-hour interval after injection. The stimulatory effect of the ras oncogene protein on ruffling and pinocytosis is dependent on the amount of injected protein and is accompanied by an apparent stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity. These rapid changes in cell membrane activities induced by ras proteins may represent primary events in the mechanism of action of ras proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2048574196,"A process unique to lymphocyte differentiation is the rearrangement of genes encoding antigen-specific receptors on B and T cells. A mouse mutant (C.B-17scid) with severe combined immune deficiency, i.e., that lacks functional B and T cells, shows no evidence of such gene rearrangements. However, rearrangements were detected in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed bone marrow cells and in spontaneous thymic lymphomas from C.B-17scid mice. Most of these rearrangements were abnormal: approximately 80% of Igh rearrangements deleted the entire Jh region, and approximately 60% of TCR beta rearrangements deleted the entire J beta 2 region. The deletions appeared to result from faulty D-to-J recombination. No such abnormal rearrangements were detected in transformed tissues from control mice. The scid mutation may adversely affect the recombinase system catalyzing the assembly of antigen receptor genes in developing B and T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2039513425,"Embryos derived from oskar females lack pole cells and the specialized pole plasm including polar granules. In addition, the abdominal region remains unsegmented and eventually dies. Transplantation of cytoplasm from normal embryos into mutant embryos reveals that osk-dependent activity is strictly localized at the posterior pole and has three distinct functions. In mutant embryos the activity will normalize pole cell formation when transplanted into the posterior pole and abdominal segmentation after transplantation to a more anterior, the prospective abdominal, region. Furthermore, osk activity can provoke the formation of a second ""posterior center"" at the anterior. The participation of the osk product in the establishment of a source of morphogenetic activity in the posterior pole plasm is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2037586575,"Transgenic mice bearing a c-myc oncogene subjugated to the lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E mu) develop clonal B lymphoid malignancies, but most young E mu-myc mice lack malignant clones. Their prelymphomatous state has allowed us to examine how constitutive c-myc expression influences B cell development. We find that early stages are overrepresented, even before birth. Pre-B cells of polyclonal origin increase greatly, while B cells develop in reduced number. Both the pre-B and the B cells appear to be in an active state, since they are larger than normal and a greater fraction are in the cell cycle. Enforced myc expression has thus favored proliferation over maturation. Hence, a normal function of c-myc may be to regulate differentiation as well as to promote cell cycling."

https://openalex.org/W1603982546,"A family of major arabinose- and mannose-containing phosphorylated lipopolysaccharides was isolated from Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The only antigenic member of the family, lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-B, was purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography in detergent and recovered in large quantities (15 mg/g of bacteria). It yielded a broad diffuse band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but appeared homogeneous by this criterion and gel filtration. Besides arabinose and mannose, it contained glycerol and a polyol phosphate and was acylated by lactate, succinate, palmitate, and 10-methyloctadecanoate. The phosphate was released by alkalinolysis and identified by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as myoinositol 1-phosphate. Thus, the group-specific arabinomannan of the genus Mycobacterium in the native state is acylated, contains the substituents of phosphatidylinositol, and is apparently membrane associated. LAM-B is one of the dominant immunogens of the leprosy bacillus reacting readily with antibodies from lepromatous leprosy patients and monoclonal antibodies in plate and nitrocellulose enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and on electrophoretic immunoblots. It is immunologically cross-reactive with a like product from M. tuberculosis. LAM-B is clearly the pervasive glycoprotein antigen of the leprosy bacillus and may be the long sought lipoteichoic acid-like polymer of Mycobacterium with a role in cell wall physiology, macrophage recognition, and perhaps an involvement in cross-protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1492988786,"fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) stimulated the formation of inositol bis- and trisphosphate in the [3H]inositol-labeled plasma membranes from the human leukemic (HL-60) cells differentiated to neutrophil-like cells by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The stimulatory effect of fMLP was completely dependent on the simultaneous presence of GTP and Ca2+. The fMLP-stimulated formation of the phosphorylated inositols was markedly reduced by the prior ADP-ribosylation of the membranes with pertussis toxin. This toxin ADP-ribosylated a Mr approximately 40,000 protein, presumably the alpha subunit of Gi and/or Go, in the membranes. Reconstitution of the membranes ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin with Gi or Go purified from rat brain restored the fMLP-stimulated formation of the phosphorylated inositols. The efficiency of the rat brain Gi and Go in this capacity was roughly equal. The rat brain Gi or Go ADP-ribosylated beforehand by pertussis toxin was inactive in this reconstitution. These results indicate that both rat brain Gi and Go have the potency to couple functionally the fMLP receptor to the phospholipase C-mediated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and suggest that Gi or Go may be involved in the mechanism of signal transduction from the fMLP receptor to this reaction in the differentiated HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993565704,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the proliferation of various mammalian cells in culture, but its physiological role is not well defined. In mature male mice, large amounts of EGF are produced in the submandibular gland; it is present in the circulation at approximately 5 nanograms of EGF per milliliter of plasma. Sialoadenectomy (removal of the submandibular glands) decreased the amount of circulating EGF to an undetectable level but did not affect the circulating levels of testosterone or follicle-stimulating hormone. The number of mature sperm in the epididymis decreased by as much as 55 percent; the number of spermatids in the testis decreased by 40 to 50 percent; and the number of spermatocytes increased by about 20 percent. Administration of EGF to sialoadenectomized mice restored both the sperm content of the epididymis and the number of spermatids in the testis to normal. Thus, EGF may play a role in male reproductive function by stimulating the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2049090800,"The secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by the interaction of hypothalamic and gonadal hormones. Recently, proteins termed inhibins that selectively suppress FSH secretion have been purified and characterized from the gonadal fluids of several species. Antibodies to a synthetic peptide encompassing the amino terminal 25 residues of the recently characterized porcine inhibin were used to develop a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for inhibin and to neutralize endogenous inhibin during the estrous cycle of the rat. The administration of 20 international units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) stimulated the secretion of inhibin in intact immature female rats, whereas ovariectomy caused an abrupt decrease in plasma inhibin concentrations that were not prevented by the injection of PMSG. The infusion of a polyclonal antiserum to inhibin, from 12 noon on proestrus to 1 a.m. on the morning of estrus, as well as its acute intravenous injection during diestrus I or II, caused an increase in plasma FSH (but not luteinizing hormone) concentrations. These results support the hypothesis of a feedback loop between the release of ovarian inhibin and FSH in the female rat."
https://openalex.org/W2090295342,"To study regulation of transcription by distant elements, a wild-type lac operator was inserted upstream of a promoter-constitutive operator control region. The upstream operator is shown to aid in repression of transcription from the mutant control region. The effectiveness of the upstream operator as a function of its distance from the mutant control region parallels the length dependence observed for DNA cyclization. A quantitative model is proposed for action-at-a-distance of DNA control sites in which protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are mediated by DNA looping. In this model, the effective concentrations of interacting proteins that are tethered by DNA are determined by the length of the intervening DNA and by its inherent bending and torsional stiffness. This model makes a number of predictions for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic control sequences located far from their sites of action."
https://openalex.org/W2079651862,"The homeotic Antennapedia (Antp) gene of Drosophila is required for the normal differentiation of the thoracic segments during embryonic development and metamorphosis. Antibodies to a recombinant Antp protein were used to localize the protein in whole mount embryos. Antp is expressed in the nuclei of cells of the thoracic embryonic epidermis and several segments of the ventral and peripheral nervous systems. Analysis of Antp expression in mutant embryos revealed three levels of Antp regulation by genes of the bithorax complex, pleiotropic homeotic loci, and Antp itself. The distributions of the Antp and the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) proteins in doubly-labeled embryos suggest that the Ubx protein may be one direct negative regulator of Antp gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1549277283,"Challenge of human or murine melanoma cells with sodium arsenite, heavy metals (Zn2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+), or thiol-reactive agents (p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide) induced the synthesis of four stress proteins with molecular masses of 100, 90, 72 (a doublet), and 32 (human) or 34 (murine) kDa. Enhanced expression of the 32- and 34-kDa polypeptides (p32 and p34) preceded or paralleled the synthesis of the other stress proteins. Hyperthermia, the calcium ionophore A23187, and amino acid analogs (L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and L-canavanine) induced the formation of the major stress proteins, but failed to increase synthesis of p32 and p34. Characterization of the dose and time dependence of p32 and p34 synthesis in human (A375) and murine (B16-F10) melanoma cells, respectively, indicated that these proteins were subject to similar regulatory mechanisms. Electrophoretic analysis of stressed cells pulsed with different metabolic precursors revealed that p32 and p34 were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine or 3H-amino acids but not by [3H]mannose or [35S]cysteine. Polyclonal antibodies raised against human p32 cross-reacted with murine p34. These data suggest that p32 and p34 are closely regulated human and murine gene products, respectively, whose synthesis can be modulated by thiol-reactive reagents. Induction of p32 and p34 by these agents, but not by heat shock, suggests that these proteins are a subset of stress-inducible gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1481524180,"The portions of the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) alpha-subunit that contribute to the allosteric antagonist-binding site and to the agonist-binding site have been localized by affinity labeling and proteolytic mapping. [3H]Meproadifen mustard was employed as an affinity label for the allosteric antagonist-binding site and [3H]tubocurare as a photoaffinity label for the agonist-binding site. Both labels were found in a 20-kDa proteolytic fragment generated from the AChR alpha-subunit by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. This 20-kDa peptide also contains the 3H-labeled 4-(N-maleimido)-alpha-benzyltrimethylammonium iodide-reactive site and binds 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin. N-terminal sequencing established that the 20-kDa fragment began at Ser-173 of the alpha-subunit. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A could be bound to the second of the two major V8 cleavage products, an 18-kDa peptide. This peptide was also sensitive to treatment with endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase H, consistent with the presence of N-linked carbohydrate on this fragment. The N terminus of this peptide was found to be Val-46 of the alpha-subunit sequence. Experiments designed to map disulfide bonds within the AChR alpha-subunit indicate that no bonds exist between the 18-kDa fragment (containing Cys-128 and Cys-142) and the 20-kDa fragment (containing Cys-192, Cys-193, and Cys-222). These results establish that the 20-kDa fragment contributes to both the acetylcholine and the allosteric antagonist-binding sites, whereas there is no evidence that the 18-kDa fragment is part of either site."
https://openalex.org/W1510143258,"The kinetic mechanism of guinea pig neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase was investigated using a continuous spectrophotometric assay that monitors product diene formation at 236 nm due to substrate oxygenation. Progress curves for reactions with both arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are characterized by 1-3-min lag phases in the attainment of steady-state velocities and product inhibition, as indicated by the total cessation of the reaction prior to complete depletion of substrate. The dependence of the steady-state velocity on arachidonic acid concentration appears to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with Vmax = 4.2 +/- 0.4 nmol of 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid/min/mg of protein and Ks = 25 +/- 4 microM. The addition of Ca2+ results in an overall activation: lag phases are shortened to 10-20 s, Vmax increases to 24 +/- 2 nmol/min/mg of protein, and Ks decreases to 7.7 +/- 1.7 microM; and a change in a mechanism to one involving substrate inhibition (Kss = 13 +/- 1 microM). The observed activation by Ca2+ has a half-maximal response at around 30 microM. In the presence of Ca2+, ATP causes an increase in Vmax to 30 +/- 4 nmol/min/mg of protein without changing Ks or Kss and a reduction of the lag to less than 5 s. The half-maximal response for ATP is 31 +/- 7 microM. Oxygenation of eicosapentaenoic acid in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP occurs with similar kinetics, except for significantly less substrate inhibition: Vmax = 31 +/- 6 nmol/min/mg of protein, Ks = 7 +/- 1 microM, and Kss = 33 +/- 2 microM. This is the first report suggesting a kinetic mechanism for 5-lipoxygenase, which accounts for substrate inhibition, regulation by Ca2+, and ATP and substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1562054825,"Urokinase-related proteins in human urine occur mainly as a 1:1 complex of urokinase with an inhibitor (Stump, D. C., Thienpont, M., and Collen, D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1267-1273). BALB/c mice were immunized with this urokinase-urokinase inhibitor complex and spleen cells fused with mouse myeloma cells, resulting in hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Three antibodies reacting with the complex but not with urokinase were utilized to develop a sensitive (0.5 ng/ml) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the urokinase inhibitor, which was used for monitoring its purification by chromatography on zinc chelate-Sepharose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, SP-Sephadex C-50, and Sephadex G-100. A homogenous glycoprotein of apparent Mr 50,000 was obtained with a yield of 40 micrograms/liter urine and a purification factor of 320. One mg of the purified protein inhibited 35,000 IU of urokinase within 30 min at 37 degrees C. This protein was immunologically related to both the purified urokinase-urokinase inhibitor complex and to the inhibitor portion dissociated from it by nucleophilic dissociation. It was immunologically distinct from all known protease inhibitors, including the endothelial cell-derived fast-acting inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator, the placental inhibitor of urokinase and protease nexin. In electrophoresis the protein migrated with beta-mobility. Inhibition of urokinase occurred with a second order rate constant (k) of 8 X 10(3) M-1 s-1 in the absence and of 9 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 in the presence of 50 IU of heparin/ml. The urokinase inhibitor was inactive towards single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasmin, but it inhibited two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator with a k below 10(3) M-1 s-1 and thrombin with a k of 4 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 in the absence and 2 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 in the presence of heparin. The concentration of this urokinase inhibitor in plasma from normal subjects determined by immunoassay was 2 +/- 0.7 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 25). The protein purified from plasma by immunoabsorption had the same Mr, amino acid composition, and immunoreactivity as the urinary protein. Furthermore, when urokinase was added to plasma, time-dependent urokinase-urokinase inhibitor complex formation was observed at a rate similar to that observed for the inhibition of urokinase by the purified inhibitor from urine. This urokinase inhibitor, purified from human urine, most probably represents a new plasma protease inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W2078751365,"Mutations at the Notch locus affect the fate of cells in the neurogenic region of the Drosophila embryo so that epidermal precursors become neuroblasts. We have analyzed the cellular requirements for wild-type Notch gene function by means of genetic mosaics, using a cuticle marker to distinguish hypodermal cell genotype. Cells that were genotypically Notch never gave rise to hypoderm within the neurogenic region of mosaic embryos. Mosaic dividing lines within the neurogenic region juxtapose N+ hypoderm with regions of neural hypertrophy. This autonomous action of Notch in hypodermal cells is consistent with a local function of the protein during neurogenesis. Comparison of clone distribution in Notch mosaics and controls suggests that islands of wild-type hypodermal cells fail to differentiate cuticle."
https://openalex.org/W1601260221,Two putative serum precursors which cross-react with antiserum against murine senile amyloid protein (ASSAM) were isolated from the high density lipoprotein (HDL) of normal mouse serum. Apolipoproteins designated and have the same molecular weight as tissue amyloid fibril protein. ApoSASSAM-1 and apoSASSAM-2 migrate to an intermediate position between apoA-I and apoC on alkaline-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are present mainly in HDL apoproteins and to a slight extent in very low density lipoprotein apoproteins when compared to apoC. ApoSASSAM-1 and apoSASSAM-2 are polymorphic; there are two apparent isoproteins of apoSASSAM-1 with isoelectric points of 4.72 and 4.79 and two major isoproteins of apo-SASSAM-2. Subunit bands of separated by alkaline-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and that migrated to the same positions as apoSASSAM-1 and apoSASSAM-2 were labeled by anti-apoSASSAM-1 antiserum. The amino acid compositions of apoSASSAM-1 and apoSASSAM-2 were much the same and closely resembled those of and mouse apoA-II. Sequence analysis of apoSASSAM and revealed a blocked amino terminus. ApoSASSAM is considered to be a mouse apoA-II and probably transforms to amyloid fibril ASSAM in tissues through a process yet to be clarified.
https://openalex.org/W1672566905,"Two major brain microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MAP2 and tau, were found to bind to the intermediate filaments reassembled from neurofilament 70-kDa subunit protein (= 70-kDa filaments). The binding was saturable. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) for the binding of MAP2 to the 70-kDa filaments was estimated to be 4.8 X 10(-7) M, and the maximum binding reached 1 mol of MAP2/approximately 30 mol of 70-kDa protein. The apparent KD for the tau binding was 1.6 X 10(-6) M, and the maximum binding was 1 mol of tau/approximately 3 mol of 70-kDa protein. It was also found that MAP2 and tau did not compete with each other for binding to the 70-kDa filaments. Most interestingly, calmodulin, a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein in eukaryotic cells, was found to inhibit the binding of MAP2 and tau to the 70-kDa filaments. The inhibition by calmodulin was regulated by changes in Ca2+ concentration around 10(-6) M, and was canceled by trifluoperazine, a calmodulin inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2031193665,"Procedures have been developed for the purification of a nearly homogeneous, highly active phosphate transport system from rat liver mitochondria in either a two-subunit (alpha, beta) or a single subunit (beta) form. Significantly, both forms display a similar high magnitude N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive Pi/Pi exchange activity upon incorporation into phospholipid vesicles. The transport system is extracted from hypotonically shocked mitoplasts with Triton X-114 and purified in the presence of cardiolipin by sequential chromatography on hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, and Affi-Gel 501. Depending on the conditions used to elute the transporter from Affi-Gel 501, preparations are obtained which, when analyzed by high resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, consist of either a single 33-kDa protein (beta) or a 33-kDa (beta) plus a 35-kDa (alpha) component. In preparations yielding the latter result, both bands display a nearly equivalent Coomassie staining intensity. Furthermore, after alkylation with NEM, the two protein bands co-migrate. Fluorography indicates that the coalesced band contains [3H]NEM. Upon reconstitution of the purified Pi carrier into liposomes, direct measurement of both the initial transport rate and the amount of protein that actually incorporates into the phospholipid vesicles yields a specific transport activity of 22.6 mumol/min/mg of protein. The exchange is characterized by a first order rate constant of 0.85 min-1, a t1/2 of 49 s, and is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents (i.e., NEM, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and mersalyl). It is also substantially inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate, N-acetylimidazole, phenylglyoxal, and 5-dimethylaminoaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride. In addition to providing a simple, rapid method for preparing the NEM-sensitive phosphate carrier in nearly homogeneous form, these studies provide new information about the catalytically active species of the carrier, its kinetic properties, and its inhibitor sensitivities."

This rearrangement resulted in the formation of a hybrid gene, part immunoglobulin and part T-cell receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1481943575,"We have studied in rat liver the subcellular sites and topography of xylosylation and galactosylation reactions occurring in the biosynthesis of the D-glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-D-xylose linkage region of proteoglycans and of glucuronosylation reactions involved in both glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and bile acid and bilirubin conjugation. The specific translocation rate of UDP-xylose into sealed, vesicles from the Golgi apparatus was 2-5-fold higher than into sealed right-side-out vesicles from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Using the above vesicle preparations, we only detected endogenous acceptors for xylosylation in the Golgi apparatus-rich fraction. The specific activity of xylosyltransferase (using silk fibroin as exogenous acceptor) was 50-100-fold higher in Golgi apparatus membranes than in those from the RER. Previous studies had shown that UDP-galactose is translocated solely into vesicles from the Golgi apparatus. In these studies, we found the specific activity of galactosyltransferase I to be 40-140-fold higher in membranes from the Golgi apparatus than in those from the RER. The specific translocation rate of UDP-D-glucuronic acid into vesicles from the Golgi apparatus was 10-fold higher than into those from the RER, whereas the specific activity of glucuronosyltransferase (using chondroitin nonasaccharide as exogenous acceptor) was 12-30-fold higher in Golgi apparatus membranes than in those from the RER. Together, the above results strongly suggest that, in rat liver, the biosynthesis of the above-described proteoglycan linkage region occurs in the Golgi apparatus. The specific activity of glucuronosyltransferase, using bile acids and bilirubin as exogenous acceptor, was 10-25-fold higher in RER membranes than those from the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that transport of UDP-D-glucuronic acid into the RER lumen is not required for such reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1539688565,"The effects of modifiers of Ca2+ uptake and release in sarcoplasmic reticulum were studied in human platelet membranes. AgNO3,p-chloromercuribenzoate (pClHgBzO), N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt), quercetin, vanadate, A23187, and caffeine all had the same effects on Ca2+ uptake in platelet membranes as had been observed for sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results strengthen our earlier conclusion that the Ca2+-pump proteins from internal human platelet membranes and muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum are very similar in functional properties. The sulfhydryl reagents Ag+ and pClHgBzO elicited rapid release of Ca2+ from platelet membranes in the presence of ATP, whereas MalNEt induced slow release. Quercetin also caused slow release of Ca2+ from platelet membranes in the presence of ATP. The effects of all three sulfhydryl reagents could be reversed by dithiothreitol, and Ag+-induced release was also reversed by ruthenium red. These effects are similar to those observed in sarcoplasmic reticulum, but in contrast caffeine did not induce Ca2+ release. In the absence of ATP, passively loaded platelet membranes did not release Ca2+ when exposed to sulfhydryl reagents. However, AgCl and pClHgBzO inhibited inositol trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release from platelet membranes and this effect was reversed by dithiothreitol. Ruthenium red also inhibited InsP3-induced release, but ATP was found not to be required for InsP3-mediated release. LiCl enhanced Ca2+ release from platelet membranes. These results demonstrate that the InsP3-gated Ca2+ release channel is a separate entity from the Ca2+-pump and that essential protein sulfhydryls are involved in the release process."

Three positive clones were isolated and shown to have overlapping restriction endonuclease maps. The positive recombinant phage with the longest cDNA insert (1.4 kilobases (kb)) was used for production of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Rabbit antiserum raised against the fusion protein recognized a single rat brain polypeptide of Mr 80,000 which was identified as protein kinase C by the following criteria: electrophoretic co-migration with purified protein kinase C, partial co-purification with protein kinase C, and disappearance from the cytosol of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated GH3 cells. The nick-translated cDNA hybridized with two mRNAs, 8 kb and 3.5 kb, whose tissue distribution was in agreement with that reported for protein kinase C activity. Hybrid selection with immobilized cDNA identified mRNA encoding a protein of Mr 80,000 that could be precipitated by antibody to purified protein kinase C. Treatment of GH3 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which promotes translocation and subsequent degradation of protein kinase C, did not alter the level of either message."
https://openalex.org/W197163872,"[3H,35S]Dermatan/chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans produced during culture of fibroblasts in medium containing varying concentrations of sulfate were tested for their susceptibility to chondroitin ABC lyase and chondroitin AC lyase. Chondroitin ABC lyase completely degraded [3H]hexosamine-labeled and [35S] sulfate-labeled dermatan/chondroitin sulfate to disaccharides. Chondroitin AC lyase treatment of the labeled glycosaminoglycans produced different results. With this enzyme, dermatan/chondroitin sulfate formed at high concentrations of sulfate yielded small glycosaminoglycans and larger oligosaccharides but almost no disaccharide. This indicated that the dermatan/chondroitin sulfate co-polymer contained mostly iduronic acid with only an occasional glucuronic acid. As the medium sulfate concentration was progressively lowered, there was a concomitant increase in the susceptibility to degradation by chondroitin AC lyase. Thus, the labeled glycosaminoglycans formed at the lowest concentration of sulfate yielded small oligosaccharides including substantial amounts of disaccharide. The smaller chondroitin AC lyase-resistant [3H,35S]dermatan/chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides were analyzed by gel filtration. Results indicated that, in general, the iduronic acid-containing disaccharide residues present in the undersulfated [3H,35S]glycosaminoglycan were sulfated, whereas the glucuronic acid-containing disaccharide residues were non-sulfated. This work confirms earlier reports that there is a relationship between epimerization and sulfation. Moreover, it demonstrates that medium sulfate concentration is critical in determining the proportions of dermatan to chondroitin (iduronic/glucuronic acid) produced by cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2097683227,"N-Linked oligosaccharides, when hydrolyzed by glycerol-containing preparations of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endo) F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum were found to have glycerol attached to their reducing ends. The absence of a reducing end was confirmed by high-field 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the incorporated glycerol was verified through mass spectrometry and collisionally activated decomposition fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry techniques. Periodate oxidation of [1(3)-14C]glycerol-labeled oligosaccharides indicated glycerol was glycosidically linked via its 1(3) carbon to the C1 of the reducing end N-acetylglucosamine. In a second, less favored reaction, the glycerol glycoside was hydrolyzed by Endo F using water as the terminal nucleophile, thus regenerating the N-acetylglucosamine reducing end. Glycerol could be removed from Endo F preparations without affecting enzyme stability, and chitobiosyl core hydrolysis in its absence provided intact oligosaccharides with normal N-acetylglucosamine reducing ends. The incorporation of labeled glycerol may provide a useful method for monitoring of Endo F release of oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1603847643,"5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase has been purified to homogeneity (30,000-fold) from human full-term placenta by a procedure involving covalent chromatography on organomercurial-agarose as the major step. The specific activity of the homogeneous enzyme is 10.2 mumol of 5'-methylthioadenosine cleaved per min per mg of protein, and the overall yield is about 20%. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 98,000, as determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and Superose 6B, and is composed by three apparently identical subunits with a molecular weight of 32,500. The isoelectric point is 5.5, and the optimal pH ranges from 7.2 to 7.6. The resistance of the enzyme to thermal inactivation is increased remarkably by the addition of 5'-methylthioadenosine or phosphate. The homogeneous enzyme shows an absolute requirement for -SH-reducing agents and is specifically and rapidly inactivated by thiol-blocking compounds. The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is fully reversible with a Keq of 1.39 X 10(-2) (in the direction of phosphorolysis) at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. The Km values for 5'-methylthioadenosine, phosphate, adenine, and 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate are 5, 320, 23, and 8 microM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W74905178,"Initiation factor eIF-4D is represented by about 11 X 10(6) molecules/HeLa cell (0.45% of the cytoplasmic protein molecules). The fraction of eIF-4D that contains the post-translational modification of lysine converted to hypusine is not regulated with respect to translation rate in HeLa cells. It is proportional to the rate of eIF-4D synthesis in exponentially growing cells (maximal protein synthesis rates) as well as in serum-depleted cells (protein synthesis rates depressed about 6-8-fold). In cells in which protein synthesis is arrested by cycloheximide, no hypusine addition or exchange is detected. During rapid repressions of protein synthesis due to either heat shock or hypertonic shock there is no change in the extent of eIF-4D containing hypusine. These results are most consistent with an eIF-4D biogenesis in which all molecules are modified to contain hypusine during or shortly after the translation process itself, and the modification state is not regulated thereafter."
https://openalex.org/W1542793366,"Diverse particulate and soluble stimuli trigger two metabolic bursts in mouse peritoneal macrophages important in the inflammatory and/or cytotoxic actions of the cells: release, oxygenation, and further metabolism of arachidonic acid from endogenous phospholipids and reduction of molecular oxygen to reactive intermediates. We tested the hypothesis that the release of arachidonic acid or formation of its metabolites are obligatory intermediate steps in triggering the NADPH oxidase that reduces O2 to O-2. With phorbol diesters as stimuli, the following inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase suppressed release of H2O2 at nontoxic concentrations (microM range): p-bromophenacyl bromide, quinacrine, eicosatetraenoic acid, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and phenidone. Indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid were ineffective. However, the suppressive effect of the first five agents on H2O2 release could be attributed to their suppression of macrophage glucose uptake at the same concentrations, a previously unrecognized effect of these compounds. Further, concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, and thrombin each stimulated abundant arachidonate release without H2O2 release. Finally, noncytolytic concentrations of cycloheximide and/or emetine suppressed arachidonate release without affecting H2O2 secretion triggered either by phorbol esters or zymosan. Release and metabolism of arachidonic acid and secretion of reactive oxygen intermediates appear to be two frequently coincident but mutually independent metabolic pathways in the mouse peritoneal macrophage."
https://openalex.org/W1586215767,"The effects of human apolipoproteins on the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction were studied by using purified human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol vesicles. When the assay mixtures contained an optimal amount or excess of apo-A-I, the addition of apo-A-II, apo-C-II, apo-C-III1, or apo-C-III2 inhibited the enzymatic reaction. However, at suboptimal apo-A-I concentrations, the addition of low concentrations of these apolipoproteins exhibited activating effects. The relative activating effects were greater at lower apo-A-I levels. Under no circumstance did the combined activating effect of apo-A-I and other apolipoproteins exceed the maximum activating effect observed with the optimal level of apo-A-I alone. Since apo-A-II, apo-C-II, and apo-C-III did not show significant activating effects in the absence of apo-A-I, these apolipoproteins apparently did not act as true activator proteins for the enzymatic reaction. The activation of the enzymatic reaction by apo-A-I alone was shown to be due in part to the enhancement of the enzyme transfer between the substrate particles. The replacement of the transfer-enhancing effect of apo-A-I by apo-A-II, apo-C-II, or apo-C-III appears to be responsible for their apparent activating effects in the presence of suboptimal levels of apo-A-I. These apolipoproteins seemed to coexist with both the enzyme and apo-A-I on the substrate particles under the conditions when they showed the activating effect. However, at the concentrations inhibitory to the enzymatic reaction, these apolipoproteins displaced both the enzyme and apo-A-I from the phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1524315984,"The effects of the binding of smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC) kinase on the microenvironments of different regions of calmodulin (CaM) were investigated by comparing the acylation rate constants of the seven lysine amino groups of free CaM with those of CaM complexed with MLC kinase. Equimolar amounts of CaM and CaM-MLC kinase complex were trace labeled with [3H]acetic anhydride in the presence of phenylalanine as a standard nucleophile. After completion of the reaction, equal amounts of a trace 14C-acetylated CaM sample, together with [14C]acetylphenylalanine, were added to each reaction mixture. The 3H/14C-labeled CaM and acetylphenylalanine were then isolated from each solution. After complete reaction with nonradioactive acetylating reagent, 3H/14C ratios (r) were determined for each epsilon-N-acetyllysine in the two CaM samples. These values were obtained either from isolated peptide fragments containing one lysine or from epsilon-N-acetyl phenylthiohydantoin lysine obtained by Edman degradation of peptide fragments containing two lysines. From the ratios, protection factors (= rfree/rcomplex) were determined as a measure of the perturbation produced by MLC kinase binding. These protection factors were corrected, using the isotope ratios of the internal standard, for differences in the degree of competition for labeling reagent between the two mixtures. In two separate labeling experiments employing different levels of trace labeling, very little change was observed in the reactivities of four lysines on MLC kinase binding (lysines 13, 30, 77, and 94). Small but reproducible decreases (about 2-fold) were observed in the reactivities of lysines 21 and 148, while lysine 75 underwent a major (more then 7-fold) decrease in labeling. In conjunction with previously published data, these results are interpreted as suggesting that the major perturbation in lysine 75 is a direct effect of MLC kinase contact with CaM and that a region in the central helix containing this residue, but not lysine 77, represents or is near the CaM-binding site for MLC kinase. The smaller changes in reactivities at lysines 21 and 148 may reflect a conformational change that occurs in CaM as a result of binding to MLC kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2054996763,"Acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase is a lysosomal-membrane enzyme deficient in a genetic disorder, Sanfilippo disease type C. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from cytoplasmic acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to terminal alpha-glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate within the organelle. Previous kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme carries out a transmembrane acetylation via a ping-pong mechanism; the reaction can therefore be dissected into two half reactions--acetylation of the enzyme, and transfer of the acetyl group to glucosamine. Cells derived from patients were found to differ in their ability to perform each half reaction. Five cell lines (derived from three families) were able to catalyze acetylation of the lysosomal membrane and to carry out acetyl-CoA/CoA exchange, whereas a sixth cell line was devoid of this activity."
https://openalex.org/W1673224547,"The question of whether the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 affects collagen production relative to total protein synthesis or has possible effects on collagen degradation was investigated. Cultured normal human fibroblasts were incubated with radioactive proline, and the radioactivity of collagenase-sensitive and -resistant proteins was used to calculate the rates of protein production. The net production of collagen relative to total proteins was inhibited by A23187 in a dose-related manner, and 50% inhibition of basal collagen production was achieved with 0.6 microM A23187. There was a 70% decrease in the absolute rate of collagen production in the presence of 0.6 microM A23187 which represented a 4-fold greater inhibition of collagen production than of noncollagen protein production. The major mechanism for the decreased net production of collagen was decreased synthesis, rather than increased degradation. Ca2+ mobilization induced by cholecystokinin octapeptide was also associated with selective inhibition of collagen production in normal human fibroblasts. These studies establish that the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 induces a selective decrease in collagen polypeptide synthesis by normal human fibroblasts and suggest a modulatory role of Ca2+ on collagen metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1502629343,"We have reported that a single injection of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D3, into vitamin D-deficient chicks produces a marked increase in the formation of duodenal putrescine by two pathways, one from ornithine and one from spermidine (Shinki, T., Takahashi, N., Kadofuku, T., Sato, T., and Suda, T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2185-2190). In this work, the conversion of [3H]ornithine into [3H]putrescine catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase was compared with the conversion of [14C]spermidine into [14C]putrescine catalyzed by spermidine N1-acetyltransferase and polyamine oxidase. Using the in situ duodenal loop method in the presence or absence of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, we evaluated the relative contributions of these two pathways in the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced duodenal synthesis of putrescine. Prior administration of alpha-difluoromethylornithine inhibited neither the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced increase in duodenal spermidine N1-acetyltransferase activity nor the vitamin-induced enhancement of the duodenal putrescine content, although it completely suppressed the duodenal ornithine decarboxylase activity induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The duodenal content of spermidine decreased time-dependently after injection of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The increase of duodenal putrescine by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 coincided quantitatively with the amount of putrescine synthesized from spermidine but not from ornithine after injection of the vitamin. These unexpected results clearly indicate that spermidine N1-acetyltransferase has a larger role than ornithine decarboxylase in the increase of duodenal putrescine synthesis induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The polyamine metabolism reported here may be related to the characteristics of intestinal epithelial cells such as the short lifetime (90-108 h) and typical gradient of differentiation from the crypt to villus regions."

https://openalex.org/W2293328405,"Microsomal preparations from chondroitin 6-sulfate-producing chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage and from chondroitin 4-sulfate-producing mouse mastocytoma cells were incubated with varying concentrations of 3'-phosphoadenylylphospho[35S]sulfate and chondroitin hexasaccharide in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. [35S]Sulfate incorporation into hexasaccharide and into endogenous microsomal chondroitin 6-sulfate or endogenous microsomal chondroitin 4-sulfate was measured. With both microsomal systems, Triton X-100 increased the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into hexasaccharide but had much less effect on the incorporation into endogenous chondroitin sulfate. Higher concentrations of hexasaccharide inhibited the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into endogenous chondroitin sulfate. The apparent Km for 3'-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate for both the 6-sulfotransferase and 4-sulfotransferase with hexasaccharide and with endogenous chondroitin sulfate in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 were all similar. However, the apparent Km for hexasaccharide was lower in the presence of Triton X-100 for both the microsomal sulfotransferases. This is consistent with solubilization of sulfotransferases, and indicates that hexasaccharide access to these enzymes had been limited in the particulate system. Examination of 35S-oligosaccharide products formed with each system demonstrated good 6-sulfation or 4-sulfation of penultimate GalNAc at the non-reducing end of the chondroitin hexasaccharide. However, no 6-sulfation of terminal GalNAc at the non-reducing end of a chondroitin pentasaccharide derived from hexasaccharide was observed, and there was only minimal 4-sulfation of this terminal GalNAc. Concurrent addition of GalNAc to hexasaccharide resulting in heptasaccharide did not appear to promote significant 6-sulfation or 4-sulfation of newly added non-reducing terminal GalNAc."
https://openalex.org/W1488554688,"The alkylating agent 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone (BrNAP) binds covalently to each of 10 isozymes of purified rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (P-450a-P-450j) but substantially inhibits the catalytic activity of only cytochrome P-450c. Regardless of pH, incubation time, presence of detergents, or concentration of BrNAP, treatment of cytochrome P-450c with BrNAP resulted in no more than 90% inhibition of catalytic activity. Alkylation with BrNAP did not cause the release of heme from the holoenzyme or alter the spectral properties of cytochrome P-450c, data that exclude the putative heme-binding cysteine, Cys-460, as the major site of alkylation. Two residues in cytochrome P-450c reacted rapidly with BrNAP, for which reason maximal loss of catalytic activity was invariably associated with the incorporation of approximately 1.5 mol of BrNAP/mol of cytochrome P-450c. Two major radio-labeled peptides were isolated from a tryptic digest of [14C]BrNAP-treated cytochrome P-450c by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of each peptide was determined by microsequence analysis, but the identification of the residues alkylated by BrNAP was complicated by the tendency of the adducts to decompose when subjected to automated Edman degradation. However, results of competitive binding experiments with the sulfhydryl reagent 4,4'-dithiodipyridine identified Cys-292 as the major site of alkylation and Cys-160 as the minor site of alkylation by BrNAP in cytochrome P-450c."
https://openalex.org/W1525483793,"Cell cultures derived from human neonatal foreskins (HF cells) are susceptible to phorbol-12,13-didecanoate- (PDD) induced inhibition of queuine uptake, but this inhibition is pronounced only in early passage HF cells. The present analysis of five different primary cultures demonstrated that, between 10 and 30 population doublings beyond the primary cultures, HF cells gradually became refractile to PDD-induced inhibition of queuine uptake, after which PDD begins to stimulate queuine uptake. Treating late passage HF cells with conditioned medium from early passage HF cells partially restored the PDD-induced inhibition of queuine uptake. This indicates the existence of a factor produced by early passage HF cells that permits PDD to inhibit queuine uptake. The tumor promoter, teleocidin, mimics the effects of PDD on queuine uptake. Both PDD and teleocidin are known to activate protein kinase C; therefore, this kinase may be an intermediary in tumor promoter-induced effects on queuine uptake. Epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta stimulated queuine uptake in both early and late passage HF cells. Growth factor stimulation of uptake was enhanced by PDD in late passage cells but inhibited by PDD in early passage cells. Polyinosinic polycytidylic acid treatment of late passage HF cells partially restored PDD-induced inhibition of queuine uptake. Human recombinant beta-interferon, plus or minus PDD, had no effect on queuine uptake. PDD did not inhibit queuine uptake in the immortal human and non-human cell lines examined."
https://openalex.org/W1505855205,"1,4-beta-D-Glucan glucohydrolase (exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase) (EC 3.2.1.74) was isolated from growth supernatants of Torulopsis wickerhamii and was subjected to hydrodynamic, optical (CD), and kinetic analysis after purification to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and isopycnic banding centrifugation in cesium chloride. The last step was found to separate the enzyme from strongly associating, high molecular weight polysaccharide. Enzyme homogeneity was established by isoelectric focusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and analytical high performance size exclusion chromatography using dual detection. The native exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase was found to be a dimer of 151,000 +/- 21,100 daltons by high performance size exclusion chromatography and 143,600 +/- 1,800 daltons by sedimentation equilibrium. The enzyme has a 12% linked carbohydrate content (mostly mannose) and no essential metal ions. Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was found to be optimal at pH 4.25 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme was found to produce beta-D-glucose from cellodextrins (indicating retention of anomeric configuration during hydrolysis) and demonstrated depolymerization from the non-reducing polymer terminus. The enzyme followed competitive type inhibition with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside as substrate and demonstrated high values of Ki for D-glucose and D-cellobiose inhibition (190 and 230 mM, respectively). The exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase was found to hydrolyze cellotetraose more rapidly than D-cellobiose and aryl-beta-D-glycosides more rapidly than all other substrates. Low levels of activity were found for the polymeric substrates beta-glucan (yeast cell walls), Avicel, and Walseth cellulose. Although this enzyme demonstrates broad disaccharide substrate specificity, a characteristic common to beta-D-glucosidases from many sources, the ability to hydrolyze higher cellodextrins more rapidly than cellobiose renders this enzyme the first exo-1,4-beta-D-glucosidase purified from yeast."

This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of glycine and acetyl-CoA to produce CO2, CoA, and the stable product aminoacetone. Bovine aminoacetone synthetase is a dimer (Mr 56,000) of identical subunits and contains 2 mol of pyridoxal phosphate/mol of dimer. The holoenzyme was resolved by dialysis against cysteine and has a pI of 5.2. The holoenzyme shows an absorption maximum at 428 nm which undergoes a shift to 335 nm when reduced with sodium borohydride. The Km values of glycine and acetyl-CoA were 22 mM and 53 microM, respectively. Initial velocity studies indicate that the condensation reaction proceeds by an ordered mechanism. With the exception of aminomalonate, bovine aminoacetone synthetase acts specifically on glycine and acetyl-CoA. Coupled reactions of purified bovine aminoacetone synthetase and porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase demonstrated the interconversion of threonine and glycine."
https://openalex.org/W1523039330,"Previous chemical and structural studies have proposed a major role for Asp-49 in the calcium-mediated activation of phospholipases A2. Recently, a new class of phospholipases A2 has been characterized with a lysine in the place of aspartate at position 49 (Maraganore, J. M., Merutka, G., Cho, W., Welches, W., Kezdy, F. J., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13839-13843; Maraganore, J. M., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4797-4804). Although both the Lys-49 and Asp-49 phospholipases require calcium for enzymatic activity, the Lys-49 enzymes appear to be unique in their ability to bind phospholipids prior to undergoing calcium-mediated activation. We have successfully crystallized the Lys-49 phospholipase A2 from the venom of the American cottonmouth water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus). The crystals are tetragonal, the space group being P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 71.05 A, and c = 57.76 A. There is only one molecule in the asymmetric unit and the crystals provide good quality diffraction data to 2.2 A."
