https://openalex.org/W4281476185,"Abstract The post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection—also referred to as Long COVID—have been described, but whether breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (BTI) in vaccinated people results in post-acute sequelae is not clear. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33,940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including contemporary ( n = 4,983,491), historical ( n = 5,785,273) and vaccinated ( n = 2,566,369) controls. At 6 months after infection, we show that, beyond the first 30 days of illness, compared to contemporary controls, people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59, 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.54), including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated ( n = 113,474), people with BTI exhibited lower risks of death (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89). Altogether, the findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease; hence, reliance on it as a sole mitigation strategy may not optimally reduce long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings emphasize the need for continued optimization of strategies for primary prevention of BTI and will guide development of post-acute care pathways for people with BTI."
https://openalex.org/W4281479206,"Quantum computers hold the promise of solving computational problems that are intractable using conventional methods1. For fault-tolerant operation, quantum computers must correct errors occurring owing to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy2. Here we demonstrate quantum error correction using the surface code, which is known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors3-6. Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit, we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit, building on recent distance-two error-detection experiments7-9. In an error-correction cycle taking only 1.1 μs, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit-flip and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in post-processing. We find a low logical error probability of 3% per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error-correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps10, support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable."
https://openalex.org/W4281489365,"Abstract Future quantum internet applications will derive their power from the ability to share quantum information across the network 1,2 . Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections 3 . Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms 4–10 , moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities. Our work demonstrates a prime building block for future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications 2,11–13 ."
https://openalex.org/W3216176305,"Quantum computers can be protected from noise by encoding the logical quantum information redundantly into multiple qubits using error-correcting codes1,2. When manipulating the logical quantum states, it is imperative that errors caused by imperfect operations do not spread uncontrollably through the quantum register. This requires that all operations on the quantum register obey a fault-tolerant circuit design3-5, which, in general, increases the complexity of the implementation. Here we demonstrate a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we make use of the recently introduced paradigm of flag fault tolerance, where the absence or presence of dangerous errors is heralded by the use of auxiliary flag qubits6-10. We perform a logical two-qubit controlled-NOT gate between two instances of the seven-qubit colour code11,12, and fault-tolerantly prepare a logical magic state8,13. We then realize a fault-tolerant logical T gate by injecting the magic state by teleportation from one logical qubit onto the other14. We observe the hallmark feature of fault tolerance-a superior performance compared with a non-fault-tolerant implementation. In combination with recently demonstrated repeated quantum error-correction cycles15,16, these results provide a route towards error-corrected universal quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W4281482094,"The study and application of transition metal hydrides (TMHs) has been an active area of chemical research since the early 1960s1, for energy storage, through the reduction of protons to generate hydrogen2,3, and for organic synthesis, for the functionalization of unsaturated C-C, C-O and C-N bonds4,5. In the former instance, electrochemical means for driving such reactivity has been common place since the 1950s6 but the use of stoichiometric exogenous organic- and metal-based reductants to harness the power of TMHs in synthetic chemistry remains the norm. In particular, cobalt-based TMHs have found widespread use for the derivatization of olefins and alkynes in complex molecule construction, often by a net hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)7. Here we show how an electrocatalytic approach inspired by decades of energy storage research can be made use of in the context of modern organic synthesis. This strategy not only offers benefits in terms of sustainability and efficiency but also enables enhanced chemoselectivity and distinct, tunable reactivity. Ten different reaction manifolds across dozens of substrates are exemplified, along with detailed mechanistic insights into this scalable electrochemical entry into Co-H generation that takes place through a low-valent intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W4281482429,"Diatoms account for up to 40% of marine primary production1,2 and require silicic acid to grow and build their opal shell3. On the physiological and ecological level, diatoms are thought to be resistant to, or even benefit from, ocean acidification4-6. Yet, global-scale responses and implications for biogeochemical cycles in the future ocean remain largely unknown. Here we conducted five in situ mesocosm experiments with natural plankton communities in different biomes and find that ocean acidification increases the elemental ratio of silicon (Si) to nitrogen (N) of sinking biogenic matter by 17 ± 6 per cent under [Formula: see text] conditions projected for the year 2100. This shift in Si:N seems to be caused by slower chemical dissolution of silica at decreasing seawater pH. We test this finding with global sediment trap data, which confirm a widespread influence of pH on Si:N in the oceanic water column. Earth system model simulations show that a future pH-driven decrease in silica dissolution of sinking material reduces the availability of silicic acid in the surface ocean, triggering a global decline of diatoms by 13-26 per cent due to ocean acidification by the year 2200. This outcome contrasts sharply with the conclusions of previous experimental studies, thereby illustrating how our current understanding of biological impacts of ocean change can be considerably altered at the global scale through unexpected feedback mechanisms in the Earth system."

https://openalex.org/W4281559894,"It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has predisposed adolescents to risky behaviors such as substance use and subsequent substance use disorder (SUD). However, it is unknown how the pandemic has changed the prevalence of SUD among adolescents in Uganda. We aimed to determine the prevalence of SUD and associated factors among adolescents in southwestern Uganda. Retrospectively, psychiatry ward records from November 2018 to July 2021 were collected from the largest tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda. A total of 441 adolescent records were included in the analysis, with a mean age was 17±1.88 years, and the majority were males (50.34%). The overall prevalence of SUD was 7.26% (5.90% and 9.80% before and during the pandemic). Despite a little rise in SUD (3.9% increment) during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no statistical difference compared to before the pandemic. The likelihood of being diagnosed with SUD was more among older adolescents at any period. In addition, having a diagnosis of bipolar mood disorder reduced the likelihood of SUD during the pandemic. This study indicated no statistical change in the diagnosis of SUD among adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. As older-male adolescents (17 to 19 years) were at higher risk of SUD, there is a need for early intervention for this group."
https://openalex.org/W4281570906,"Effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread and frequent testing of the population for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saliva has emerged as an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal samples for surveillance testing as it does not require specialized personnel or materials for its collection and can be easily provided by the patient. We have developed a simple, fast, and sensitive saliva-based testing workflow that requires minimal sample treatment and equipment. After sample inactivation, RNA is quickly released and stabilized in an optimized buffer, followed by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and detection of positive samples using a colorimetric and/or fluorescent readout. The workflow was optimized using 1,670 negative samples collected from 172 different individuals over the course of 6 months. Each sample was spiked with 50 copies/μL of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus to monitor the efficiency of viral detection. Using pre-defined clinical samples, the test was determined to be 100% specific and 97% sensitive, with a limit of detection of 39 copies/mL. The method was successfully implemented in a CLIA laboratory setting for workplace surveillance and reporting. From April 2021-February 2022, more than 30,000 self-collected samples from 755 individuals were tested and 85 employees tested positive mainly during December and January, consistent with high infection rates in Massachusetts and nationwide."
https://openalex.org/W4281552385,"Low birth weight is one of the primary causes of child mortality and several diseases of future life in developing countries, especially in Southern Asia. The main objective of this study is to determine the risk factors of low birth weight and predict low birth weight babies based on machine learning algorithms.Low birth weight data has been taken from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2017-18, which had 2351 respondents. The risk factors associated with low birth weight were investigated using binary logistic regression. Two machine learning-based classifiers (logistic regression and decision tree) were adopted to characterize and predict low birth weight. The model performances were evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the curve.The average percentage of low birth weight in Bangladesh was 16.2%. The respondent's region, education, wealth index, height, twin child, and alive child were statistically significant risk factors for low birth weight babies. The logistic regression-based classifier performed 87.6% accuracy and 0.59 area under the curve for holdout (90:10) cross-validation, whereas the decision tree performed 85.4% accuracy and 0.55 area under the curve.Logistic regression-based classifier provided the most accurate classification of low birth weight babies and has the highest accuracy. This study's findings indicate the necessity for an efficient, cost-effective, and integrated complementary approach to reduce and correctly predict low birth weight babies in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4281567275,"Background Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) may require lifelong medical care due to late effects of cancer treatments. Little is known about of their healthcare utilization and expenditures at long-term especially in publicly funded health care system. We aim to estimate and describe the health care expenditures among long-term CCS in France. Methods A total of 5319 five-year solid CCS diagnosed before the age of 21 between 1945 and 2000 in France were identified in the French Childhood Cancer Survivors Study cohort (FCCSS) and the French cancer registry. Information about health care expenditure was taken from the French national health data system between 2011 and 2016, and was described according to survivors’ characteristics. Generalized linear models were used to determine associations between health care expenditures and survivors’ characteristics. Results Mean annual amount of healthcare expenditures was € 4,255. Expenditures on hospitalizations and pharmacy represents 60% of total expenditures. Mean annual of healthcare expenditures were higher at increasing age, among women survivors (€ 4,795 vs € 3,814 in men) and in central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors (€ 7,116 vs € 3,366 in lymphoma and € 3,363 in other solid tumor survivors). Conclusions Childhood cancer survivorship is associated with a substantial economic burden in France. We found that female gender and CNS primary cancer were associated with increased healthcare expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W4281569113,"Background Though many trials had examined the effectiveness of taking insulin with or without oral agents, there are limited real-world data, particularly among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the resource limited settings. This study aimed to examine level of glycemic control among patients with T2DM after initiation of insulin and factors associated with poor glycemic control. Methods An analysis of retrospective medical records of patients with T2DM who initiated insulin due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia by oral agents was conducted from 2015–2020 in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Difference in median fasting plasma glucose (FPG) before and after insulin initiations was examined by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Kruskal Wallis test was performed to explore difference in the median level of FPG among treatment groups. A logistic regression model was also used to identify associated factors of poor glycemic control after insulin initiation. Statistical significance was declared at p &lt; 0.05. Results Of 424 enrolled patients with T2DM, 54.7% were males and the mean age was 59.3±9.3 years. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was significant deference in FPG before and after insulin initiation (P &lt; 0.001). A declining trend of blood glucose was observed during the 1-year follow-up period of post-initiation. However, majority of the participants did not achieve target glucose levels. Participants who had higher FPG and systolic blood pressure (SBP) before insulin initiation were found more likely to have poor glycemic control after insulin initiation. Similarly, patients who received atorvastatin compared with simvastatin were found to have poor glycemic control in the post-period of initiation (P = 0.04). Premixed insulin was associated with a lower likelihood of poor glycemic control than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Following insulin initiation, a significant change in glycemic level and declining trend of FPG was observed during a 1-year follow-up period. However, the majority of patients still had a poorly controlled glycemic level. Appropriate management focusing on predictors of glycemic control would be of a great benefit to achieve glycemic control."
https://openalex.org/W4281563159,"Loss of FXR, one of bile acid receptors, enlarged livers. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a dominant oncogene, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the relationship between FXR and YAP1 was unspecified in bile acid homeostasis in HCC. Here, we used TIMER2.0, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database and discovered that FXR was positively correlated with better prognosis in liver cancer patients. Our previous research showed that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) inhibited cell proliferation in HepG2 and HepG22215 cells. However, the relationship of YAP1 and the bile acid receptor FXR remains elusive during DHA treatment. Furthermore, we showed that DHA improved FXR and reduced YAP1 in the liver cancer cells and mice. Additionally, the expression of nucleus protein FXR was enhanced in Yap1LKO mice with liver cancer. DHA promoted the expression level of whole and nuclear protein FXR independent of YAP1 in Yap1LKO mice with liver cancer. DHA declined cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, but not sterol 27-hydroxylase, and depressed cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid of liver tissue in Yap1LKO mice with liver cancer. Generally, our results suggested that DHA improved FXR and declined YAP1 to suppress bile acid metabolism. Thus, we suggested that FXR acted as a potential therapeutic target in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W4281677559,"More than 70% of new HIV infections in Asia occurred in eight countries in 2020: Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam-with a rising incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those at risk of acquiring HIV, yet wide-scale implementation of PrEP, on a daily or event-driven basis, has been limited in Asia.The Optima HIV model was applied to examine the impact of scaling-up PrEP over five-years to cover an additional 15% of MSM compared with baseline coverage, a target deemed feasible by regional experts. Based on behavioral survey data, we assume that covering 15% of higher-risk MSM will cover 30% of all sexual acts in this group. Scenarios to compare the impact of generic-brand daily dosing of PrEP with generic event-driven dosing (15 days a month) were modelled from the start of 2022 to the end of 2026. Cost-effectiveness of generic versus branded PrEP was also assessed for China, the only country with an active patent for branded, higher cost PrEP. The impact on new HIV infections among the entire population and cost per HIV-related disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted were estimated from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2031 and from 2022 to 2051.If PrEP were scaled-up to cover an additional 15% of MSM engaging in higher-risk behavior from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2026 in the eight Asian countries considered, an additional 100,000 (66,000-130,000) HIV infections (17%) and 300,000 (198,000-390,000) HIV-related DALYs (3%) could be averted over the 2022 to 2031 period. The estimated cost per HIV-related DALY averted from 2022 to 2031 ranged from US$600 for event-driven generic PrEP in Indonesia to US$34,400 for daily branded PrEP in Thailand. Over a longer timeframe from 2022 to 2051, the cost per HIV-related DALY averted could be reduced to US$100-US$12,700.PrEP is a critical tool to further reduce HIV incidence in highly concentrated epidemics. Implementing PrEP in Asia may be cost-effective in settings with increasing HIV prevalence among MSM and if PrEP drug costs can be reduced, PrEP could be more cost-effective over longer timeframes."
https://openalex.org/W4281569392,"Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading worldwide. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has had a critical role in tracking the emergence, introduction, and spread of new variants, which may affect transmissibility, pathogenicity, and escape from infection or vaccine-induced immunity. As anticipated, the rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in Iraq in February 2021 is due to the introduction of variants of concern during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave in Iraq (2021), we sequenced 76 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes using NGS technology and identified genomic mutations and proportions of circulating variants among these. Also, we performed an in silico study to predict the effect of the truncation of NS7a protein (ORF7a) on its function. We detected nine different lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 lineage was predominant (80.20%) from February to May 2021, while only one B.1.351 strain was detected. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis showed that multiple strains of the B.1.1.7 lineage clustered closely with those from European countries. A notable frequency (43.33%) of stop codon mutation (NS7a Q62stop) was detected among the B.1.1.7 lineage sequences. In silico analysis of NS7a with Q62stop found that this stop codon had no considerable effect on the function of NS7a. This work provides molecular epidemiological insights into the spread variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Iraq, which are most likely imported from Europe."

https://openalex.org/W4281559030,"Lymph node culture-positive tuberculosis (LNTB+) is associated with increased mycobacterial antigen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared to LN culture-negative tuberculosis (LNTB-). However, the frequencies of CD4 + , CD8 + T cells and NK cells expressing Th1/Tc1/Type 1 (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2), Th17/Tc17/Type 17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22) cytokines and cytotoxic (perforin [PFN], granzyme [GZE] B, CD107a) markers in LNTB+ and LNTB- individuals are not known. Thus, we have studied the unstimulated (UNS) and mycobacterial antigen-induced frequencies of CD4 + , CD8 + T and NK cells expressing Th1, Th17 cytokines and cytotoxic markers using flow cytometry. The frequencies of CD4 + , CD8 + T and NK cells expressing cytokines and cytotoxic markers were not significantly different between LNTB+ and LNTB- individuals in UNS condition. In contrast, upon Mtb antigen stimulation, LNTB+ individuals are associated with significantly increased frequencies of CD4 + T cells (PPD [IFNγ, TNFα], ESAT-6 PP [IFNγ, TNFα], CFP-10 PP [IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2]), CD8 + T cells (PPD [IFNγ], ESAT-6 PP [IFNγ], CFP-10 PP [TNFα]) and NK cells (PPD [IFNγ, TNFα], ESAT-6 PP [IFNγ, TNFα], CFP-10 PP [TNFα]) expressing Th1/Tc1/Type 1, but not Th17/Tc17/Type 17 cytokines and cytotoxic markers compared to LNTB- individuals. LNTB+ individuals did not show any significant alterations in the frequencies of CD4 + , CD8 + T cells and NK cells expressing cytokines and cytotoxic markers compared to LNTB- individuals upon HIV Gag PP and P/I antigen stimulation. Increased frequencies of CD4 + , CD8 + T and NK cells expressing Th1/Tc1/Type 1 cytokines among the LNTB+ group indicates that the presence of mycobacteria plays a dominant role in the activation of key correlates of immune protection or induces higher immunopathology."
https://openalex.org/W4281676663,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), caused by mutations in NOTCH3, is the most common cause of hereditary cerebral small vessel disease. Whether it will involve systemic vasculopathy such as retinal vessel remains unknown. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a noninvasive technique for visualising retinal blood flow. We analysed vessel density and retinal thickness in patients with CADASIL and investigated their correlations with disease severity.This prospective study enrolled 35 patients with CADASIL (59 eyes) and 35 healthy controls (54 eyes). OCT-A was used to measure the vessel density of the macular region and the thickness of retinal layers. Patients with CADASIL were divided into stroke (n = 20) and nonstroke (n = 15) subgroups and underwent cognition and gait speed evaluation. Neuroimaging markers of cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity, lacunae, and cerebral microbleeds were examined through brain magnetic resonance imaging.The OCT-A parameters, including vessel density, were comparable between the patients with CADASIL and the controls. In patients with CADASIL, vessel density in the superficial retinal plexus in the macula as was inner retinal thickness was significantly lower in the stroke than the nonstroke subgroup. Macular vessel density and inner retinal thickness were positively correlated with gait speed, while negatively correlated with number of lacunae.OCT-A is potentially a useful tool for evaluating disease severity, ischaemic burden, and neurodegeneration in patients with advanced CADASIL."
https://openalex.org/W4281554412,"Introduction Breast cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in females. In developing countries like Tunisia, the frequency of this cancer is still growing. The aim of this study was to determine the crude and standardized incidence rates, trends and predictions until 2030 of breast cancer incidence rates in a Tunisian governorate. Methods This is a descriptive study including all female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in Monastir between 2002 and 2013. The data were collected from the cancer register of the center. Tumors were coded according to the 10 th version of international classification of disease (ICD-10). Trends and predictions until 2030 were calculated using Poisson linear regression. Results A total of 1028 cases of female breast cancer were recorded. The median age of patients was 49 years (IQR: 41–59 years) with a minimum of 16 years and a maximum of 93 years. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) was of 39.12 per 100000 inhabitants. It increased significantly between 2002 and 2013 with APC of 8.4% (95% CI: 4.9; 11.9). Prediction until 2030 showed that ASR would reach 108.77 (95% CI: 57.13–209.10) per 100000 inhabitants. Conclusion The incidence and the chronological trends of breast cancer highlighted that this disease is of a serious concern in Tunisia. Strengthening preventive measures is a primary step to restrain its burden."
https://openalex.org/W4281753788,"Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is often used to detect focal liver lesions (FLLs), though DWI image quality can be limited in the left liver lobe owing to the pulsatile motion of the nearby heart. Flow-compensated (FloCo) diffusion encoding has been shown to reduce this pulsation artifact. The purpose of this prospective study was to intra-individually compare DWI of the liver acquired with conventional monopolar and FloCo diffusion encoding for assessing metastatic FLLs in non-cirrhotic patients. Forty patients with known or suspected multiple metastatic FLLs were included and measured at 1.5 T field strength with a conventional (monopolar) and a FloCo diffusion encoding EPI sequence (single refocused; b-values, 50 and 800 s/mm 2 ). Two board-certified radiologists analyzed the DWI images independently. They issued Likert-scale ratings (1 = worst, 5 = best) for pulsation artifact severity and counted the difference of lesions visible at b = 800 s/mm² separately for small and large FLLs (i.e., &lt; 1 cm or &gt; 1 cm) and separately for left and right liver lobe. Differences between the two diffusion encodings were assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Both readers found a reduction in pulsation artifact in the liver with FloCo encoding (p &lt; 0.001 for both liver lobes). More small lesions were detected with FloCo diffusion encoding in both liver lobes (left lobe: six and seven additional lesions by readers 1 and 2, respectively; right lobe: five and seven additional lesions for readers 1 and 2, respectively). Both readers found one additional large lesion in the left liver lobe. Thus, flow-compensated diffusion encoding appears more effective than monopolar diffusion encoding for the detection of liver metastases."
https://openalex.org/W4281552913,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is an important complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), that may delay surgical or endovascular treatment and may influence patient outcome. This prospective follow-up study intended to collect data on the prevalence, severity, influencing factors and long-term outcome of TTC in patients suffering from non-traumatic SAH.Consecutive patients admitted with the diagnosis of non-traumatic SAH were included. Intitial assessment consisted of cranial CT, Hunt-Hess, Fisher and WFNS scoring, 12-lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transcranial duplex sonography and collecting laboratory parameters (CK, CK-MB, cardiac troponin T, NT-proBNP and urine metanephrine and normetanephrine). Diagnosis of TTC was based on modified Mayo criteria. TTC patients were dichotomized to mild and severe forms. Follow-up of TTE, Glasgow Outcome Scale assessment, Barthel's and Karnofsky scoring occurred on days 30 and 180.One hundred thirty six patients were included. The incidence of TTC in the entire cohort was 28.7%; of them, 20.6% and 8.1% were mild and severe, respectively. TTC was more frequent in females (30/39; 77%) than in males (9/39; 23%) and was more severe. The occurrence of TTC was related to mFisher scores and WFNS scores. Although the severity of TTC was related to mFisher score, Hunt-Hess score, WFNS score and GCS, multivariate analysis showed the strongest relationship with mFisher scores. Ejection fraction differences between groups were present on day 30, but disappeared by day 180, whereas wall motion score index was still higher in the severe TTC group at day 180. By the end of the follow-up period (180 days), 70 (74.5%) patients survived in the non-TTC, 22 (81.5%) in the mild TTC and 3 (27%) in the severe TTC group (n = 11) (p = 0.002). At day 180, GOS, Barthel, and Karnofsky outcome scores were higher in patients in the control (non-TTC) and the mild TTC groups than in the severe TTC group.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a frequent finding in patients with SAH, and severe TTC may be present in 8% of SAH cases. The severity of TTC may be an independent predictor of mortality and outcome at 6 months after disease onset. Therefore, a regular follow-up of ECG and TTE abnormalities is warranted in patients with subrachnoid hemorrhage for early detection of TTC.The study was registered at the Clinical Trials Register under the registration number of NCT02659878 (date of registration: January 21, 2016)."
https://openalex.org/W4281560231,"Chemoresistance poses a great barrier to breast cancer treatment and is thought to correlate with increased matrix stiffness. We developed two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide (PAA) and three-dimensional (3D) alginate in vitro models of tissue stiffness that mimic the stiffness of normal breast and breast cancer. We then used these to compare cell viability in response to chemotherapeutic treatment. In both 2D and 3D we observed that breast cancer cell growth and size was increased at a higher stiffness corresponding to tumours compared to normal tissue. When chemotherapeutic response was measured, a specific differential response in cell viability was observed for gemcitabine in 2 of the 7 breast cancer cell lines investigated. MCF7 and T-47D cell lines showed gemcitabine resistance at 4 kPa compared to 500 Pa. These cell lines share a common phenotype of progesterone receptor (PGR) expression and, indeed, pre-treatment with the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) mifepristone abolished resistance to gemcitabine at high stiffness. Our data reveals that combined treatment with SPRMs may therefore help in reducing resistance to gemcitabine in stiffer breast tumours which are PGR positive."
https://openalex.org/W4281561759,"Resolvin E1 (RvE1), a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM), improves glucose homeostasis in inbred mouse models of obesity. However, an impediment toward translation is that obesity is a highly heterogenous disease in which individuals will respond very differently to interventions such as RvE1. Thus, there is a need to study SPMs in the context of modeling the heterogeneity of obesity that is observed in humans. We investigated how RvE1 controls the concentration of key circulating metabolic biomarkers using diversity outbred (DO) mice, which mimic human heterogeneity. We first demonstrate that weights of DO mice can be classified into distinct distributions of fat mass (i.e., modeling differing classes of obesity) in response to a high-fat diet and in the human population when examining body composition. Next, we show RvE1 administration based on body weight for four consecutive days after giving mice a high-fat diet led to approximately half of the mice responding positively for serum total gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, insulin, glucose, leptin, and resistin. Interestingly, RvE1 improved hyperleptinemia most effectively in the lowest class of fat mass despite adjusting the dose of RvE1 with increasing adiposity. Furthermore, leptin levels after RvE1 treatment were the lowest in those mice that were also RvE1 positive responders for insulin and resistin. Collectively, these results suggest a therapeutic fat mass-dependent window for RvE1, which should be considered in future clinical trials. Moreover, the data underscore the importance of studying SPMs with heterogenous mice as a step toward precision SPM administration in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4281567918,"Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a glycoprotein component of dengue virus (DENV) that is essential for viral replication, infection and immune evasion. Immunization with NS1 has been shown to elicit antibody-mediated immune responses which protect mice against DENV infections. Here, we obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human subjects with secondary dengue infections, which were used to construct a dengue immune phage library displaying single-chain variable fragments. Phage selective for DENV NS1 were obtained by biopanning. Twenty-one monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against DENV NS1 were generated from the selected phage and characterized in detail. We found most anti-NS1 mAbs used IGHV1 heavy chain antibody genes. The mAbs were classified into strongly and weakly-reactive groups based on their binding to NS1 expressed in dengue virus 2 (DENV2)-infected cells. Antibody binding experiments with recombinant NS1 proteins revealed that the mAbs recognize conformational epitopes on the β-ladder domain (amino acid residues 178–273) of DENV NS1. Epitope mapping studies on alanine-substituted NS1 proteins identified distinct but overlapping epitopes. Protruding amino acids distributed around the spaghetti loop are required for the binding of the strongly-reactive mAbs, whereas the recognition residues of the weakly-reactive mAbs are likely to be located in inaccessible sites facing toward the cell membrane. This information could guide the design of an NS1 epitope-based vaccine that targets cross-reactive conserved epitopes on cell surface-associated DENV NS1."
https://openalex.org/W4281571740,"Following the ‘people-oriented’ concept, increased attention should be paid to the heterogeneity of community residents when configuring public service facilities. Taking Shanghai as an example, this study analyzed the spatial pattern of urban and rural community differentiation and evaluated spatial differences in the level of accessibility to four types of public service facilities based on the shortest travel distance. There were significant differences between community types in Shanghai, with a clear circular structure in the urban and rural spaces. Here, facility accessibility decreased from the core to the periphery. Population density, income level, and the shortest walking distance to facilities revealed a significant negative correlation. Age level, household registration, and the shortest walking distance to facilities were partially weakly correlated or uncorrelated. The spatial matching of population density and facility accessibility simultaneously presented a circular pattern and heterogeneity, while planned new towns in suburbs and mid-suburbs presented a double-medium-sized match of the same community type. From the perspective of community differentiation, mechanisms behind the formation of the spatial pattern of facility accessibility included urban-rural pattern continuity and differences in allocation specifications, the continuity of population agglomeration and the accumulation of facility construction, and urban planning guidance and population agglomeration."
https://openalex.org/W4281652225,"Bed bug outbreaks pose a major challenge in urban environments and cause significant strain on public resources. Few studies have systematically analyzed this insect epidemic or the potential effects of policies to combat bed bugs. Here we use three sources of administrative data to characterize the spatial-temporal trends of bed bug inquiries, complaints, and reports in New York City. Bed bug complaints have significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) from 2014–2020, the absolute number of complaints per month dropping by half (875 average complaints per month to 440 average complaints per month); conversely, complaints for other insects including cockroaches and flies did not decrease over the same period. Despite the decrease of bed bug complaints, areas with reported high bed bug infestation tend to remain infested, highlighting the persistence of these pests. There are limitations to the datasets; still the evidence available suggests that interventions employed by New York City residents and lawmakers are stemming the bed bug epidemic and may serve as a model for other large cities."
https://openalex.org/W4281708528,"Many studies on body representation intend to change the perceived size, material, and structure of the body. However, whether the perception of a stimulus can be modified by manipulating body representation remains largely unexplored. Thus, the current study investigated the relationship between transparency of body representation and pain perception. Using augmented reality technology, we made the participants’ limbs transparent and analyzed changes in body representation. Using a questionnaire, we confirmed that the participants perceived their limb as transparent. Simultaneously, their sense of ownership of the limb decreased, because they felt that it no longer belonged to their body. The participants were given an electrical stimulus to assess their subjective perception of pain intensity. An increase in limb opacity decreased the perception of pain, which, in turn, increased the feeling of transparency. These results suggested that the feeling of transparency in their limb favored the decrease in perceived pain. This effect was modified by body ownership, where high levels reinforced the analgesic effect. However, body ownership displayed a positive relationship with perceived pain. The study suggests that body transparency may constitute a strategy for decreasing refractory pain given that body ownership is retained at a high level."
https://openalex.org/W4281718161,"The salivary gland can be permanently impaired by radiation treatment for head and neck cancers. Efforts at tissue regeneration have focused on saliva-producing acinar cells. However, myoepithelial cells are also critical to gland function, but mechanisms that regulate their differentiation are poorly defined. To study myoepithelial differentiation, we employed mSG-PAC1 murine salivary gland epithelial cells. We demonstrate that mSG-PAC1 spheroids exhibit phenotypic plasticity between pro-acinar and myoepithelial cell fates. Increased expression of pro-acinar/acinar or myoepithelial RNAs was identified from spheroids cultured under different media conditions by microarray followed by gene-set enrichment analysis. Spheroids cultured with different medium components expressed proteins typical of either acinar or myoepithelial cells, as detected by immunocytochemistry. We demonstrate that the pattern of TAZ expression in the epithelial compartment of the differentiating murine salivary gland correlates with the expression of the myoepithelial marker alpha-SMA, as is the case for TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids. Our analysis also indicates that YAP/TAZ target genes are upregulated together with myoepithelial markers. Importantly, siRNA targeting of TAZ expression in mSG-PAC1 spheroids diminished the expression of myoepithelial markers. Our results in this in vitro cell model implicate TAZ signaling in myoepithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4281755728,"A dielectric spectroscopy method was applied to determine major fatty acids composition in vegetable oils. Dielectric constants of vegetable oils were measured in the frequency range of 5-30 MHz. After data pre-treatment, prediction models were constructed using partial least squares (PLS) regression between dielectric spectral values and the fatty acids compositions measured by gas chromatography. Generally, the root means square error of validation (RMSECV) was less than 11.23% in the prediction of individual fatty acids. The determination coefficient (R2) between predicted and measured oleic, linoleic, mono-unsaturated, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids were 0.84, 0.77, 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. These results indicated that dielectric spectroscopy coupled with PLS regression could be a promising method for predicting major fatty acid composition in vegetable oils and has the potential to be used for in-situ monitoring systems of daily consumption of dietary fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W4281557234,"Spike timing-dependent plasticity, related to differential Hebb-rules, has become a leading paradigm in neuronal learning, because weights can grow or shrink depending on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic signals. Here we use this paradigm to reduce unwanted (acoustic) noise. Our system relies on heterosynaptic differential Hebbian learning and we show that it can efficiently eliminate noise by up to -140 dB in multi-microphone setups under various conditions. The system quickly learns, most often within a few seconds, and it is robust with respect to different geometrical microphone configurations, too. Hence, this theoretical study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully transfer differential Hebbian learning, derived from the neurosciences, into a technical domain."
https://openalex.org/W4281558262,"Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) have long been recognized being safe and effective in treating bone fracture nonunion and osteoporosis. However, the mechanism of osteogenic action of PEMFs is still unclear. While primary cilia are reported to be a sensory organelle for PEMFs, and nitric oxide (NO) plays an indispensable role in osteogenic effect of PEMFs, the relationship between NO and primary cilia is unknown. In this study, effects of treatment with 50 Hz 0.6 mT PEMFs on osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, NO secretion, and ciliary location of specific proteins were examined in rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) with normal or abrogated primary cilia. It was found that PEMFs stimulated the osteogenic differentiation by activating the NOS/NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway, which need the existence of primary cilia. All components of the signaling pathway including iNOS, eNOS, sGC, PKG-1, and PKG-2 were localized to primary cilia, and eNOS was phosphorylated inside the primary cilia. Besides, primary cilia were elongated significantly by PEMF treatment and changed dynamically with the activation NO/cGMP pathway. When the pathway was blocked by L-NAME, PEMFs could no longer elongate the primary cilia and stimulate the osteoblastic differentiation. Thus, this study for the first time observed activation of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in ciliary compartment of osteoblasts, and PEMFs could not stimulate the osteoblastic differentiation if the NO signaling pathway was blocked or the ciliogenesis was inhibited. Our findings indicate the interdependent relationship between NO and primary cilia in the PEMF-promoted osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4281560211,"We study the correlation between phylogenetic and geographic distances for the languages of the Andic branch of the East Caucasian (Nakh-Daghestanian) language family. For several alternative phylogenies, we find that geographic distances correlate with linguistic divergence. Notably, qualitative classifications show a better fit with geography than cognacy-based phylogenies. We interpret this result as follows: The better fit may be due to implicit geographic bias in qualitative classifications. We conclude that approaches to classification other than those based on cognacy run a risk to implicitly include geography and geography-related factors as one basis of genealogical classifications."
https://openalex.org/W4281560685,"Parents' tracking of developmental milestones can assist healthcare providers with early detection of developmental delays and appropriate referrals to early intervention. Crowdsourcing is one way to update the content and age data distribution of developmental checklists for parents and providers. This feasibility study examined which developmental milestones parents chose to track and what they added beyond traditional milestones, using the babyTRACKS crowd-based mobile app.We analyzed the developmental diaries of 3,832 children, registered in the babyTRACKS app at an average age of 9.3 months. Their parents recorded a median of 5 milestones per diary, selecting from the accumulating lists of age-appropriate milestones or authoring new milestones. The final database included 645 types of milestones; 89.15% were developmental, of which 43.6% were comparable to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) milestones while the rest were crowd-authored. Milestones were categorized into developmental domains: Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Oral Motor, Self-Care, Cognitive, Language Comprehension, Speech, Non-Verbal Communication, Social, Emotional, and Regulation.On average, the milestone domains of Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Cognitive and Social were the most added to diaries (20%-30% of a diary). Within the Cognitive, Speech and Language Comprehension domains there were significantly more CDC comparable versus crowd-authored milestones (29% versus 21%, 22% versus 10%, 8% versus 4%). In contrast, within the Regulation and Oral Motor domains there were more crowd versus CDC milestones (17% versus 3%, 9% versus 3%). Crowd-authored Speech milestones were significantly older by 7 months than CDC milestones.Tracking daily observations of child development provides a window into personally relevant milestones for the child and parent. The crowd of parents can independently track and add new milestones across main developmental domains. Regulation and Oral Motor development especially interest parents. Parents may be less aware of early progress in Language Comprehension and Speech; thus, these domains require more structured screening. Designing mobile early screening which is crowd-based engages parents as proactive partners in developmental tracking."
https://openalex.org/W4281561201,"Viruses play critical roles in the dynamics of microbial communities. Lytic viruses, for example, kill significant fractions of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes daily. The dynamic interplay between viruses and microbes results from an overlap of physiological, ecological, and evolutionary responses: environmental changes trigger host physiological changes, affecting the ecological interactions of host and virus and, ultimately, the evolutionary pressures influencing the two populations. Recent theoretical work studied how the dependence of viral traits on host physiology (viral plasticity) affects the evolutionarily stable host cell size and viral infection time emerging from coevolution. Here, we broaden the scope of the framework to consider any coevolutionary outcome, including potential evolutionary collapses of the system. We used the case study of Escherichia coli and T-like viruses under chemostat conditions, but the framework can be adapted to any microbe-virus system. Oligotrophic conditions led to smaller, lower-quality but more abundant hosts, and infections that were longer but produced a reduced viral offspring. Conversely, eutrophic conditions resulted in fewer but larger higher-quality hosts, and shorter but more productive infections. The virus influenced host evolution decreasing host size more noticeably for low than for high dilution rates, and for high than for low nutrient input concentration. For low dilution rates, the emergent infection time minimized host need/use, but higher dilution led to an opportunistic strategy that shortened the duration of infections. System collapses driven by evolution resulted from host failure to adapt quickly enough to the evolving virus. Our results contribute to understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbes and virus, and to improving the predictability of current models for host-virus interactions. The large quantitative and qualitative differences observed with respect to a classic description (in which viral traits are assumed to be constant) highlights the importance of including viral plasticity in theories describing short- and long-term host-virus dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4281563399,"Pulmonary ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs in many clinical conditions and causes severe damage to the lungs. Diabetes mellitus (DM) predisposes to pulmonary I/R injury. We previously found that remote liver ischemia preconditioning protected lungs against pulmonary I/R injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether remote liver ischemic postconditioning (RLIPost) attenuates pulmonary damage induced by I/R injury in non-diabetic or diabetic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into non-diabetic and diabetic groups. All rats except for the sham were exposed to 45 min of left hilum occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. RLIPost was conducted at the onset of pulmonary reperfusion by four cycles of 5 min of liver ischemia and reperfusion. Lung injury was assessed by the wet/dry weight ratio, pulmonary oxygenation, histopathological changes, apoptosis and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Reperfusion-associated protein phosphorylation states were determined. RLIPost offered strong pulmonary-protection in both non-diabetic and diabetic rats, as reflected in reduced water content and pulmonary structural damage, recovery of lung function, inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation after ischemia-reperfusion. RLIPost induced the activation of pulmonary STAT-3, a key component in the SAFE pathway, but not activation of the proteins in the RISK pathway, in non-diabetic rats. In contrast, RLIPost-induced pulmonary protection in diabetic lungs was independent of SAFE or RISK pathway activation. These results demonstrate that RLIPost exerts pulmonary protection against I/R-induced lung injury in non-diabetic and diabetic rats. The underlying mechanism for protection may be different in non-diabetic (STAT-3 dependent) versus diabetic (STAT-3 independent) rats."

The cardiovascular risk assessment can guide the decision-making on various preventive measures such as initiating or deferring statin therapy. Thus, our study aimed to assess the physicians' knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases risk assessment. Also, we evaluated the physician-patient discussion and counseling practices before statin therapy initiation in concordance with recommendations from the latest clinical practice guideline.A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2020 and January 2021. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 350 physicians (GPs, residents, specialists, and consultants). Two trained pharmacists distributed the questionnaires in 5 major tertiary governmental hospitals and more than ten private hospitals. Also, private clinics were targeted so that we get a representative sample of physicians at different workplaces.A total of 270 physicians filled the questionnaire out of 350 physicians approached, with 14 being excluded due to high missing data, giving a final response rate of 73%. Participants had suboptimal knowledge and practices with a high positive attitude toward atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases risk assessment. The knowledge and practices were higher among consultants, participants from the cardiology department, those with experience years of more than nine years, and those who reported following a specific guideline for cholesterol management or using a risk calculator in their practice. Notably, the risk assessment and counseling practices were lower among physicians who reported seeing more patients per day.Physicians had overall low knowledge, suboptimal practices, and a high positive attitude toward cardiovascular risk assessment. Therefore, physicians' training and continuing medical education regarding cholesterol management and primary prevention clinical practice guidelines are recommended. Also, the importance of adherence to clinical practice guidelines and their impact on clinical outcomes should be emphasized."

However, there are daily variations in the ECGs of BrS patients, which presents a challenge when diagnosing BrS. Although many susceptibility genes have been identified, the SCN5A gene is reportedly the main causative gene of BrS. However, most patients do not have an evidence of genetic predisposition to develop BrS. In addition, the diagnosis and risk stratification for ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with BrS presents some problems. Meanwhile, circulating micro RNAs (miRNAs) have drawn increased attention as potential biomarkers of various diseases. We hypothesize that circulating miRNAs may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for BrS.We enrolled 70 Japanese BrS patients and 34 controls for the screening cohort. A total of 2,555 miRNA sequences were detected using the 3D-Gene miRNAs labeling kit and 3D-Gene Human miRNAs Oligo Chip. We compared the expression of the miRNAs between the BrS patients and the controls. We validated whether the miRNA were significantly up- or downregulated in the screening cohort using RT-PCR. We also enrolled 72 Japanese BrS patients and 56 controls to replicate these miRNAs.Eight miRNAs (hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-4485-5p, hsa-miR-550a-5p, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-23a-3p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p) were downregulated, and one miRNA (hsa-miR-873-3p) was upregulated by more than 3-fold in BrS patients. The multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p, and hsa-miR-23a-3p were independently associated with BrS (P < 0.0001). The AUC based on cross validation was 0.871 with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.5% and 81.1%, respectively.The plasma miRNAs are potential noninvasive biomarkers of BrS, and the constructed logistic model was useful for discriminating BrS."
https://openalex.org/W4281572660,"Although there is a strong association between depressive symptoms and markers of inflammation, it remains unclear whether depressive symptoms at one point in life may predict inflammation later in life. Moreover, despite extant literature linking sleep with both depressive symptoms and inflammation, there is little research investigating poor sleep as a mechanism linking depressive symptoms with later inflammation. The links between depression and physical health can also vary by gender. In longitudinal analyses with data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, we examined whether depressive symptoms were associated with inflammatory markers 11 years later and whether these associations were mediated by sleep disturbances or moderated by gender. Participants reported depressive symptoms and demographic information at baseline. At 11-year follow-up, the same participants (n = 968) reported depressive symptoms, sleep quality and duration using validated scale items, and provided a blood sample from which inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quantified. Actigraphy assessment of sleep was obtained in a subsample (n = 276). After adjusting for concurrent depressive symptoms and other relevant covariates, baseline depressive symptoms were associated with CRP 11 years later in the full sample, and with IL-6 among women. Subjective sleep quality mediated the association between depressive symptoms and CRP. Results suggest that depressive symptoms may be longitudinally associated with inflammation; however, directionality issues cannot be determined from the present work, particularly as inflammation markers (which might have been associated with baseline depressive symptoms) were not available at baseline. Findings further suggest that longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and inflammation may potentially be explained by sleep and may reflect gender specific patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4281687578,"An explosion with a discontinuous gas supply (DGS-explosion) is more complicated than a common secondary explosion. We present the results of a study on the propagation laws of the DGS-explosion induced by a gas explosion in excavation roadways. A rectangular tube was established using ANSYS, similar to an excavation roadway in an underground coal mine. The gas, flame, and shock wave propagation laws were determined by analyzing the explosive gas as it exited the excavation roadway. The results show that the initial explosion caused the flame generated in the DGS-explosion to be significantly stretched. Moreover, the shock wave was reflected by the end of the tube, which resulted in the reverse migration of the local gas after the DGS-explosion. Meanwhile, with the increase in local gas concentrations, the pressure peak and the entire explosion system can increase after the DGS-explosion. The flame region, temperature peak, and flame irregularity in the tube positively correlate with the concentration. These results can provide theoretical support and an experimental basis for preventing and responding to accidents caused by gas explosion accidents."

Thymol, carvacrol and linalool displayed approximately 50% inhibition at 1.5 mmol/litre concentrations using para-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP). UV-Vis spectroscopy give evidence of the formation of lipase-linalool, lipase-carvacrol and lipase-thymol complex at the ground state. Three molecules also showed complex formation with HSA at the ground state. Fluorescence spectroscopy shows strong binding of lipase to thymol (Ka of 2.6 x 109 M-1) as compared to carvacrol (4.66 x 107 M-1) and linalool (5.3 x 103 M-1). Number of binding sites showing stoichiometry of association process on lipase is found to be 2.52 (thymol) compared to 2.04 (carvacrol) and 1.12 (linalool). Secondary structure analysis by CD spectroscopy results, following 24 hours incubation at 25°C, with thymol, carvacrol and linalool revealed decrease in negative ellipticity for lipase indicating loss in helical structure as compared with the native protein. The lowering in negative ellipticity was in the order of thymol > carvacrol > linalool. Fluorescence spectra following binding of all three molecules with HSA caused blue shift which suggests the compaction of the HSA structure. Association constant of thymol and HSA is 9.6 x 108 M-1 which along with 'n' value of 2.41 suggests strong association and stable complex formation, association constant for carvacrol and linalool was in range of 107 and 103 respectively. Docking results give further insight into strong binding of thymol, carvacrol and linalool with lipase having free energy of binding as -7.1 kcal/mol, -5.0 kcal/mol and -5.2 kcal/mol respectively. To conclude, fungal lipases can be attractive target for controlling their growth and pathogenicity. Employing UV-Vis, Fluorescence and Circular dichroism spectroscopy we have shown that thymol, carvacrol and linalool strongly bind and disrupt structure of fungal lipase, these three phytochemicals also bind well with HSA. Based on disruption of lipase structure and its binding nature with HSA, we concluded thymol as a best anti-lipase molecule among three molecules tested. Results of Fluorescence and CD spectroscopy taken together suggests that thymol and carvacrol are profound disrupter of lipase structure."

We investigate the relation between scaled operating accruals and size-adjusted abnormal returns for nonfinancial firms listed in the Stoxx Europe 600 index for the period 2000-2021. We find consistent evidence of (1) a higher long-term operating accrual anomaly than working capital accrual, especially, when asset and liability components are separated (2) long-short trading strategies aimed at taking advantage of the anomaly that achieves significant annual returns between 2% and 6% and (3) this trading strategy strongly reduces the risk of stock portfolios during an economic crisis due to its countercyclical nature.

Extensive genetic testing of dogs through consumer and veterinary channels using a high-density SNP genotyping microarray coupled with links to clinical records presents the opportunity for a large-scale genome-wide association study to elucidate the molecular risk factors associated with cryptorchidism in dogs. Using an inter-breed genome-wide association study approach, a significant statistical association on canine chromosome 10 was identified, with the top SNP pinpointing a variant of HMGA2 previously associated with adult weight variance. In further analysis we show that incidence of cryptorchidism is skewed towards smaller dogs in concordance with the identified variant's previous association with adult weight. This study represents the first putative variant to be associated with cryptorchidism in dogs."

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CTTS in gastric adenocarcinoma in patients who underwent curative-intent surgical resection.This was a cross-sectional study that included two groups: gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 42) and gastritis (n = 50). The gastritis group was then subdivided into H. pylori-positive (n = 25) and H. pylori-negative (n = 25) groups. Gastric tissue samples were analysed to determine CTTS expression through immunohistochemistry. Samples were obtained by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy or surgical specimens.In patients with gastritis, the age ranged from 18 to 78 years. Among them, 34% were male, and 66% were female. In patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the age ranged from 37 to 85 years. Among them, 50% were male. When comparing the expression of CTTS between the two groups, only 16% of the gastritis samples had an expression higher than 25%. Alternatively, among patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 19% had expression between 25-50%, 14.3% between 51-75%, and 26.2% had expression higher than 75% (p < 0.001). In the gastritis group, CTTS expression was significantly higher in patients with a positive test for H. pylori than negative test for H. pylori: 87.5% and 38.5%, respectively (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant association between CTTS positivity and clinicopathological variables, including tumour staging, histological type, angiolymphatic invasion, recurrence, current status and death.CTTS expression is higher in gastric adenocarcinoma samples. Patients with gastritis due to H. pylori also show a higher expression of CTTS than patients with negative results for this bacterium."

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the cut-off value for EIB that provides the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Participants who underwent the ECT between 2007 and 2018 were categorized according to ΔFEV1: definite EIB (ΔFEV1 ≥ 15%), borderline (10% ≤ ΔFEV1 < 15%), and normal (ΔFEV1 < 10%). Distinct characteristics of the definite EIB group were identified and explored in the borderline EIB group. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the optimal cut-off value. Of 128 patients, 60 were grouped as the definite EIB group, 23 as the borderline group, and 45 as the normal group. All participants were men, with a median age of 20 years (interquartile range [IQR:] 19-23 years). The definite EIB group exhibited wheezing on auscultation (P < 0.001), ΔFEV1/FVC ≥ 10% (P < 0.001), and ΔFEF25-75% ≥ 25% (P < 0.001) compared to other groups. Eight (8/23, 34.8%) patients in the borderline group had at least one of these features, but the trend was more similar to that of the normal group than the definite EIB group. A cut-off value of ΔFEV1 ≥ 13.5% had a sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 93.5% for EIB. Wheezing on auscultation, ΔFEV1/FVC ≥ 10%, and ΔFEF25-75% ≥ 25% after ECT may be useful for the diagnosis of EIB, particularly in individuals with a ΔFEV1 of 10-15%. For EIB, a higher cut-off value, possibly ΔFEV1 ≥ 13.5%, should be considered as the diagnostic criterion."
https://openalex.org/W4281559504,"Text formats are common in bioinformatics, as they allow for editing and filtering using standard tools, as well as, since text formats are often human readable, manual inspection and evaluation of the data. Bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving field, hence, new techniques, new software tools, new kinds of data often require the definition of new formats. Often new formats are not formally described in a standard or specification document. Although software libraries are available for accessing the most common formats, writing parsers for text formats, for which no library is currently available, is a very common though tedious task, utilized by many researchers in the field. This manuscript presents the open source software library and toolset TextFormats (available at https://github.com/ggonnella/textformats), which aims at simplifying the definition and parsing of text formats. Formats specifications are written in a simple data description format using an interactive wizard. Automatic generation of data examples and automatic testing of specifications allow for checking for correctness. Given the specification for a text format, TextFormats allows parsing and writing data in that format, using several programming languages (Nim, Python, C/C++) or the provided command line and graphical user interface tools. Although designed as a general purpose software, the main target application field, for the above mentioned reasons, is expected to be in bioinformatics: Thus, the specifications of several common existing bioinformatics formats are included."
https://openalex.org/W4281563848,"This unicentric randomized clinical trial was designed to compare the surgical outcomes of mitomycin C-enhanced trabeculectomy (MMC-TRAB) with and without subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (TAAC) injection in patients with non-inflammatory glaucomas. This trial is registered at the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under the register number RBR-53f8nh. Consecutive non-inflammatory glaucoma patients requiring surgical intervention were randomized into two groups. In the control group, eyes underwent standard MMC-TRAB, while in the intervention group, besides the standard MMC-TRAB, these eyes also received a subtenon TAAC injection (4mg) close to the bleb site at the end of the surgery. The main outcomes of the study were surgical success rates, intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of medications at all timepoints. Success was defined as IOP ≤ 15 mmHg and subdivided in complete or qualified according to the need of medication. A total of 75 eyes of 63 different patients were included (intervention group = 39 eyes; control group = 36 eyes). There was no difference between groups at baseline (p>0.11). Multivariable regression analysis indicated that IOP levels were significantly lower in the intervention group at 18 and 24 months of follow-up when number of medications was considered as a covariate (P<0.001). Complete success rates were higher in the intervention group at 06 (90.9% vs 68.7%; p = 0.03), 12 (87.2% vs 66.7%; p = 0.02) and 18 months (87.2% vs 66.7%; p = 0.02). Additionally, although success rates at 24 months were higher in the intervention group (82.0% vs 66.7%; p = 0.09), this difference did not reach statistical significance. Qualified success rates did not significantly differ between groups at all timepoints. In conclusion, this study found significantly lower IOPs levels at 18 and 24 months of follow-up and higher complete success rates until 18 months of follow-up, with the use of subtenon TAAC as an adjuvant to standard MMC-TRABs in non-inflammatory glaucoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281570515,"In many countries, the current vaccination rates are stagnating, to the extent that vaccine hesitancy-the delay or refusal to take recommended vaccinations-forms a major obstacle to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. This tendency is particularly concerning when observed among healthcare workers who are opinion leaders on medical matters for their patients and peers. Our study surveys 965 employees of two large Swiss hospitals and profiles vaccine-hesitant hospital employees using not only socio-demographic characteristics, but also a comprehensive set of standard behavioral preference measures: (i) Big-5 personality traits, (ii) risk-, time- and social preferences, and (iii) perceived prevailing social norms. Using multinomial probit models and linear probability models, we find that vaccine-hesitant hospital employees are less patient and less likely to perceive vaccination as the prevailing social norm-in addition to replicating previously published socio-demographic results. Our findings are robust to a range of model specifications, as well as individual and situational covariates. Our study thus offers actionable policy implications for tailoring public-health communications to vaccine-hesitant hospital employees."
https://openalex.org/W4282016594,"Many people use social media as a primary information source, but their questionable reliability has pushed platforms to contain misinformation via crowdsourced flagging systems. Such systems, however, assume that users are impartial arbiters of truth. This assumption might be unwarranted, as users might be influenced by their own political biases and tolerance for opposing points of view, besides considering the truth value of a news item. In this paper we simulate a scenario in which users on one side of the polarity spectrum have different tolerance levels for the opinions of the other side. We create a model based on some assumptions about online news consumption, including echo chambers, selective exposure, and confirmation bias. A consequence of such a model is that news sources on the opposite side of the intolerant users attract more flags. We extend the base model in two ways: (i) by allowing news sources to find the path of least resistance that leads to a minimization of backlash, and (ii) by allowing users to change their tolerance level in response to a perceived lower tolerance from users on the other side of the spectrum. With these extensions, in the model we see that intolerance is attractive: news sources are nudged to move their polarity to the side of the intolerant users. Such a model does not support high-tolerance regimes: these regimes are out of equilibrium and will converge towards empirically-supported low-tolerance states under the assumption of partisan but rational users."
