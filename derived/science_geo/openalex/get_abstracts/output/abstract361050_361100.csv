https://openalex.org/W2001999652,"Inhibitors of PI3 kinase are in development for the treatment of cancer. But whether these compounds will work as single agents remains to be seen. Engelman et al. now show that a PI3K-mTOR inhibitor is effective in a mouse model of lung cancer induced by a mutant PIK3CA but has no effect on Kras-induced tumors. Combining the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor induced regression of mouse Kras tumors, suggesting that such combinations may be beneficial in human tumors ( pages 1315–1316 ). Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been identified in the p110-α catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA)1. They are most frequently observed in two hotspots: the helical domain (E545K and E542K) and the kinase domain (H1047R). Although the p110-α mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. In this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-α H1047R. Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan–PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography–computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. In contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. However, when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, ARRY-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers. These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and, when combined with MEK inhibitors, may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2012836529,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a congenital disorder of progressive and widespread postnatal ossification of soft tissues and is without known effective treatments. Affected individuals harbor conserved mutations in the ACVR1 gene that are thought to cause constitutive activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2). Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model. These results support the role of dysregulated ALK2 kinase activity in the pathogenesis of FOP and suggest that small molecule inhibition of BMP type I receptor activity may be useful in treating FOP and heterotopic ossification syndromes associated with excessive BMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2108170307,"The authors examine how brain inflammation affects the development of epilepsy. They show that genetic or antibody-mediated blockade of leukocyte-vascular interactions reduces epileptogenesis in mice ( pages 1309–1310 ). The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder that affects approximately one percent of the world population, are not well understood1,2,3. Using a mouse model of epilepsy, we show that seizures induce elevated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules and enhanced leukocyte rolling and arrest in brain vessels mediated by the leukocyte mucin P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, encoded by Selplg) and leukocyte integrins α4β1 and αLβ2. Inhibition of leukocyte-vascular interactions, either with blocking antibodies or by genetically interfering with PSGL-1 function in mice, markedly reduced seizures. Treatment with blocking antibodies after acute seizures prevented the development of epilepsy. Neutrophil depletion also inhibited acute seizure induction and chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, which is known to enhance neuronal excitability, was induced by acute seizure activity but was prevented by blockade of leukocyte-vascular adhesion, suggesting a pathogenetic link between leukocyte-vascular interactions, BBB damage and seizure generation. Consistent with the potential leukocyte involvement in epilepsy in humans, leukocytes were more abundant in brains of individuals with epilepsy than in controls. Our results suggest leukocyte-endothelial interaction as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy."

https://openalex.org/W2096980067,"Background The brainstem contains descending circuitry that can modulate nociceptive processing (neural signals associated with pain) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the medullary dorsal horn. In migraineurs, abnormal brainstem function during attacks suggest that dysfunction of descending modulation may facilitate migraine attacks, either by reducing descending inhibition or increasing facilitation. To determine whether a brainstem dysfunction could play a role in facilitating migraine attacks, we measured brainstem function in migraineurs when they were not having an attack (i.e. the interictal phase). Methods and Findings Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), we mapped brainstem activity to heat stimuli in 12 episodic migraine patients during the interictal phase. Separate scans were collected to measure responses to 41°C and noxious heat (pain threshold+1°C). Stimuli were either applied to the forehead on the affected side (as reported during an attack) or the dorsum of the hand. This was repeated in 12 age-gender-matched control subjects, and the side tested corresponded to that in the matched migraine patients. Nucleus cuneiformis (NCF), a component of brainstem pain modulatory circuits, appears to be hypofunctional in migraineurs. 3 out of the 4 thermal stimulus conditions showed significantly greater NCF activation in control subjects than the migraine patients. Conclusions Altered descending modulation has been postulated to contribute to migraine, leading to loss of inhibition or enhanced facilitation resulting in hyperexcitability of trigeminovascular neurons. NCF function could potentially serve as a diagnostic measure in migraine patients, even when not experiencing an attack. This has important implications for the evaluation of therapies for migraine."
https://openalex.org/W2092921827,"Sex-dependent differences in adaptation to famine have long been appreciated, thought to hinge on female versus male preferences for fat versus protein sources, respectively. However, whether these differences can be reduced to neurons, independent of typical nutrient depots, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver, was heretofore unknown. A vital adaptation to starvation is autophagy, a mechanism for recycling amino acids from organelles and proteins. Here we show that segregated neurons from males in culture are more vulnerable to starvation than neurons from females. Nutrient deprivation decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased autophagosome formation, and produced cell death more profoundly in neurons from males versus females. Starvation-induced neuronal death was attenuated by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy; Atg7 knockdown using small interfering RNA; or L-carnitine, essential for transport of fatty acids into mitochondria, all more effective in neurons from males versus females. Relative tolerance to nutrient deprivation in neurons from females was associated with a marked increase in triglyceride and free fatty acid content and a cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent increase in formation of lipid droplets. Similar sex differences in sensitivity to nutrient deprivation were seen in fibroblasts. However, although inhibition of autophagy using Atg7 small interfering RNA inhibited cell death during starvation in neurons, it increased cell death in fibroblasts, implying that the role of autophagy during starvation is both sex- and tissue-dependent. Thus, during starvation, neurons from males more readily undergo autophagy and die, whereas neurons from females mobilize fatty acids, accumulate triglycerides, form lipid droplets, and survive longer."
https://openalex.org/W1981955271,"When viruses infect cells, they trigger changes such as exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Thorpe et al. have shown that this 'inside-out' phosphatidylserine can be targeted by an antibody, and this approach can clear virus infection in mice. There is a pressing need for antiviral agents that are effective against multiple classes of viruses. Broad specificity might be achieved by targeting phospholipids that are widely expressed on infected host cells or viral envelopes. We reasoned that events occurring during virus replication (for example, cell activation or preapoptotic changes) would trigger the exposure of normally intracellular anionic phospholipids on the outer surface of virus-infected cells. A chimeric antibody, bavituximab, was used to identify and target the exposed anionic phospholipids. Infection of cells with Pichinde virus (a model for Lassa fever virus, a potential bioterrorism agent) led to the exposure of anionic phospholipids. Bavituximab treatment cured overt disease in guinea pigs lethally infected with Pichinde virus. Direct clearance of infectious virus from the blood and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of virus-infected cells seemed to be the major antiviral mechanisms. Combination therapy with bavituximab and ribavirin was more effective than either drug alone. Bavituximab also bound to cells infected with multiple other viruses and rescued mice with lethal mouse cytomegalovirus infections. Targeting exposed anionic phospholipids with bavituximab seems to be safe and effective. Our study demonstrates that anionic phospholipids on infected host cells and virions may provide a new target for the generation of antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W2087726216,"The release of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal, India, caused the worst industrial accident in history. Exposures to industrial isocyanates induce lacrimation, pain, airway irritation, and edema. Similar responses are elicited by chemicals used as tear gases. Despite frequent exposures, the biological targets of isocyanates and tear gases in vivo have not been identified, precluding the development of effective countermeasures. We use Ca(2+) imaging and electrophysiology to show that the noxious effects of isocyanates and those of all major tear gas agents are caused by activation of Ca(2+) influx and membrane currents in mustard oil-sensitive sensory neurons. These responses are mediated by transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), an ion channel serving as a detector for reactive chemicals. In mice, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1 dramatically reduces isocyanate- and tear gas-induced nocifensive behavior after both ocular and cutaneous exposures. We conclude that isocyanates and tear gas agents target the same neuronal receptor, TRPA1. Treatment with TRPA1 antagonists may prevent and alleviate chemical irritation of the eyes, skin, and airways and reduce the adverse health effects of exposures to a wide range of toxic noxious chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2051147455,"Identification of genes that modulate longevity is a major focus of aging-related research and an area of intense public interest. In addition to facilitating an improved understanding of the basic mechanisms of aging, such genes represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention in multiple age-associated diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. To date, however, targeted efforts at identifying longevity-associated genes have been limited by a lack of predictive power, and useful algorithms for candidate gene-identification have also been lacking.We have utilized a shortest-path network analysis to identify novel genes that modulate longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on a set of previously reported genes associated with increased life span, we applied a shortest-path network algorithm to a pre-existing protein-protein interaction dataset in order to construct a shortest-path longevity network. To validate this network, the replicative aging potential of 88 single-gene deletion strains corresponding to predicted components of the shortest-path longevity network was determined. Here we report that the single-gene deletion strains identified by our shortest-path longevity analysis are significantly enriched for mutations conferring either increased or decreased replicative life span, relative to a randomly selected set of 564 single-gene deletion strains or to the current data set available for the entire haploid deletion collection. Further, we report the identification of previously unknown longevity genes, several of which function in a conserved longevity pathway believed to mediate life span extension in response to dietary restriction.This work demonstrates that shortest-path network analysis is a useful approach toward identifying genetic determinants of longevity and represents the first application of network analysis of aging to be extensively validated in a biological system. The novel longevity genes identified in this study are likely to yield further insight into the molecular mechanisms of aging and age-associated disease."
https://openalex.org/W2118806856,"We have previously reported that airborne particulate matter air pollution (PM) activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in alveolar epithelial cells through a pathway that requires the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of p53. We sought to examine the source of mitochondrial oxidant production and the molecular links between ROS generation and the activation of p53 in response to PM exposure. Using a mitochondrially targeted ratiometric sensor (Ro-GFP) in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) and cells stably expressing a small hairpin RNA directed against the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, we show that site III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is primarily responsible for fine PM (PM2.5)-induced oxidant production. In alveolar epithelial cells, the overexpression of SOD1 prevented the PM2.5-induced ROS generation from the mitochondria and prevented cell death. Infection of mice with an adenovirus encoding SOD1 prevented the PM2.5-induced death of alveolar epithelial cells and the associated increase in alveolar-capillary permeability. Treatment with PM2.5 resulted in the ROS-mediated activation of the oxidant-sensitive kinase ASK1 and its downstream kinase JNK. Murine embryonic fibroblasts from ASK1 knock-out mice, alveolar epithelial cells transfected with dominant negative constructs against ASK1, and pharmacologic inhibition of JNK with SP600125 (25 μm) prevented the PM2.5-induced phosphorylation of p53 and cell death.

The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has emerged as a common mechanism by which particulates might initiate signaling pathways that end in these diverse pathologic conditions (11Nel A. Science.. 2005; 308: 804-806Google Scholar). We have reported that the PM-induced generation of ROS requires a functional electron transport chain, suggesting that PM might induce the inadvertent transfer of electrons from one or more sites in the electron transport chain to molecular oxygen (12Soberanes S. Panduri V. Mutlu G.M. Ghio A. Budinger G.R. Kamp D.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.. 2006; 174: 1229-1238Google Scholar).One of the mechanisms by which exposure to PM can contribute to alveolar epithelial dysfunction, lung injury and inflammation, and lung cancer is by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to induce cell death (11Nel A. Science.. 2005; 308: 804-806Google Scholar, 12Soberanes S. Panduri V. Mutlu G.M. Ghio A. Budinger G.R. Kamp D.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.. 2006; 174: 1229-1238Google Scholar). We have reported that this process requires the activation of p53; however, the molecular events linking the generation of ROS by the mitochondrial electron transport chain with the activation of p53 are not known (12Soberanes S. Panduri V. Mutlu G.M. Ghio A. Budinger G.R. Kamp D.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.. 2006; 174: 1229-1238Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to PM2.5 induces the generation of ROS from site III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These mitochondrially derived oxidants activate the mitogen-activated signaling kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), which activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The activation of JNK is required for the phosphorylation of p53 and the subsequent cell death. Inhibition of mitochondrial oxidant production in mouse lungs prevents PM2.5-induced cell death and the associated PM2.5-induced increase in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParticulate Matter (PM2.5)—The Washington, D.

Anti-c-Jun was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (J4399). Anti-human SOD1 was purchased from MBL International (Woburn, MA), and anti-human SOD2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and all of the cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. EUK-134 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem.Isolation and Culture of Alveolar Epithelial Cells—Alveolar type II cells were isolated from rats as described previously (15Mutlu G.M. Snyder C. Bellmeyer A.

A549 cells were obtained from ATCC. All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The ρ0 A549 cells were generated by incubating wild type cells in medium containing ethidium bromide (100 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (100 μg/ml) for 3–5 weeks. The lack of DNA encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit IV was confirmed by PCR using the primer sequences described previously (16Budinger G.R. Tso M. McClintock D.S. Dean D.A. Sznajder J.I.

Murphy M.P. Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N.S. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 177: 1029-1036Google Scholar) and amplified in Platinum E packaging cells. The packaging cells and the cells infected with the Rieske iron-sulfur shRNA were grown in medium containing 100 μg/ml uridine. A lentiviral vector encoding the mito-Ro-GFP probe with a mitochondrial localization sequence was created using the ViraPower lentiviral transformation kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The PCR product from the plasmid sequence was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-CAC CAT GCC GCT AGC GCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC-3′; then the PCR product was cloned into the ViraPower lentiviral plasmid and transfected into packaging cells, and the filtered supernatant was used to infect A549 cells. The cells were selected by their ability to grow in blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and/or puromycin (5 μg/ml). Transient transfection of A549 cells was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen).Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—We employed an oxidant-sensitive ratiometric probe (Ro-GFP) that was originally described by Remington and co-workers (21Dooley C.T. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Google Scholar, 22Hanson G.T. Aggeler R. Oglesbee D. Cannon M. Capaldi R.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 13044-13053Google Scholar), who validated its responsiveness to a variety of intracellular oxidants both ex vivo and in living cells. The sequence for the Ro-GFP probe with a mitochondrial localization sequence was cloned into a lentiviral vector (Virapower Lentiviral Expression System; Invitrogen) and was expressed in packaging cells. The resulting virus was used to infect A549 cells, and stably expressing clones were selected by their ability to grow in blasticidin. The vector was also cloned into an adenoviral vector as described previously. Expression of the probe was confirmed by examining the cells using fluorescence microscopy. Appropriate localization of the probe to the mitochondria was confirmed by co-staining with the mitochondrial probe MitoTracker (10 μm, 10 min in the dark) (Invitrogen).Oxidation of the mito-Ro-GFP probe was assessed using flow cytometry. After treatment, the cells were removed from the plate using trypsin, and equal aliquots of the resulting suspension were transferred to tubes containing medium alone or medium containing 1 mm dithiothreitol or 1 mm t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). After 10 min, the ratio of fluorescence (emission of 535 nm) at excitations of 405 and 488 nm was measured in 5,000 cells/condition using a DakoCytomation CyAn high speed multilaser droplet cell sorter. The oxidation state of the cells was calculated as the completely reduced ratio (dithiothreitol) less the untreated value divided by the difference in the ratio observed with dithiothreitol and t-BOOH (17Guzy R.D.

Particulate matter was vortexed immediately prior to instillation. After each aliquot the mice were placed in the right and then the left lateral decubitus positions for 10–15 s.Adenoviral Infection in Mice—Type I adenoviral vectors were instilled into the lungs of mice as described previously (25Mutlu G.M. Adir Y. Jameel M. Akhmedov A.T. Welch L. Dumasius V. Meng F.J. Zabner J. Koenig C. Lewis E.R. Balagani R. Traver G. Sznajder J.I. Factor P. Circ. Res.. 2005; 96: 999-1005Google Scholar). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital or isoflurane and intubated with a 20-gauge angiocath. A Hamilton syringe was used to instill 1 × 109 pfu of virus in 50% bovine surfactant (Infrasurf; Forest Pharmaceuticals) and balance Tris-EDTA buffer through the angiocath. The virus was administered in two equal aliquots, 3–5 min apart, after which the animals were extubated and allowed to recover from anesthesia with the administration of supplemental oxygen as required to treat hypoventilation.Histology—A 20-gauge angiocath was sutured into the trachea, the lungs and heart were removed en bloc, and the lungs were inflated to 15 cm of H2O with 4% paraformaldehyde. The heart and lungs were fixed in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (15Mutlu G.M. Snyder C. Bellmeyer A. Wang H. Hawkins K. Soberanes S. Welch L.C. Ghio A.J. Chandel N.S. Kamp D.W. Sznajder J.I. Budinger G.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.2006Google Scholar).Assessment of Lung Permeability—Lung permeability was assessed using a modification of a described previously technique (26Budinger G.R. Mutlu G.M. Eisenbart J. Fuller A.C. Bellmeyer A.A. Baker C.M. Wilson M. Ridge K. Barrett T.A. Lee V.Y. Chandel N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 4604-4609Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and 125 μl of fluorescein isothiocynate-dextran (molecular mass, 4,000 kDa) 0.05 g/ml (Sigma-Aldrich) was delivered into the retro-orbital plexus using a 26-gauge needle. The mice were kept sedated for 30 min, after which a 20-gauge angiocath was sutured into the trachea for the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Immediately following the bronchoalveolar lavage, 450 μl of blood was collected from the right ventricle into a syringe containing 50 μl of sodium citrate (final dilution 1:10). Relative lung permeability was estimated from the difference in the fluorescence of the plasma and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measured by using a microplate reader (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520 nm).Assessment of Cell Death—Cell death was assessed using a commercially available photometric immunoassay that detects histone-associated DNA fragments (Roche Applied Science); an antibody that detects cleaved caspase-3 in cell lysates and a commercially available assay that detects caspase-9 activity (BioVision, Mountain View, CA).Immunoblotting—Protein immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Budinger G.R. Mutlu G.M. Eisenbart J. Fuller A.C. Bellmeyer A.A. Baker C.M. Wilson M. Ridge K. Barrett T.A. Lee V.Y. Chandel N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 4604-4609Google Scholar). The cell lysates were mixed with sample loading buffer (125 mm Tris base (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). After heating, the protein was resolved on a SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the gel was stained with Ponceau S to verify uniform transfer. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-T (100 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Relative quantification was performed using the ratio of the densitometry of the protein of interest to the appropriate loading control as measured using Image J software (16Budinger G.R. Tso M. McClintock D.S. Dean D.A. Sznajder J.I. Chandel N.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 15654-15660Google Scholar).Kinase Assays to Measure the Activity of c-Jun—Kinase assays to measure the activity of c-Jun were performed using a commercially available assay according to the manufacturer's directions (Cell Signaling; catalog number 9810), except the incubation with ATP was extended to 1 h. Kinase assays were also performed using a modification of a procedure described previously (27Vadasz I. Dada L.A. Briva A. Trejo H.E. Welch L.C. Chen J. Toth P.T. Lecuona E. Witters L.A. Schumacker P.T. Chandel N.S. Seeger W. Sznajder J.I. J. Clin. Investig.. 2008; 118: 752-762Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were obtained after exposure to PM2.5, and c-Jun was immunoprecipitated by incubating ∼500 μg of protein with 5 μl of c-Jun antibody overnight (4 °C) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The complexes were pulled down with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and then washed in lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of myelin basic protein, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C in 35 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled c-Jun was detected by autoradiography.TUNEL Staining of Lung Sections—End labeling of exposed 3′-OH ends of DNA fragments in paraffin-embedded tissue was done utilizing the TUNEL AP in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's directions. After staining, 20 fields of alveoli (400×) were randomly chosen, and the nuclei and total nuclei were counted using an automated program (Image J) (26Budinger G.R. Mutlu G.M. Eisenbart J. Fuller A.C. Bellmeyer A.A. Baker C.M. Wilson M. Ridge K. Barrett T.A. Lee V.Y. Chandel N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 4604-4609Google Scholar).Statistics—Differences between groups were explored using analysis of variance. When the analysis of variance indicated a significant difference, individual differences were explored using t tests with a Dunnett correction for multiple comparisons against control conditions. All of the analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSThe Generation of ROS Is Required for PM2.5-induced Cell Death in Alveolar Epithelial Cells—We previously reported that exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to PM10 collected from Düsseldorf, Germany induced the generation of ROS (15Mutlu G.M. Snyder C. Bellmeyer A. Wang H. Hawkins K. Soberanes S. Welch L.C. Ghio A.J. Chandel N.S. Kamp D.W. Sznajder J.I. Budinger G.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.2006Google Scholar). To determine whether PM2.5-induced cell death is oxidant-dependent, we infected primary rat alveolar type II cells and A549 cells with an adenoviral vector encoding mito-Ro-GFP 48 h before exposure to PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2) from Washington, D. C. Four hours later, we measured the oxidation of the probe in cells that had been treated with PBS vehicle or with the combined superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic EUK-134 (20 μm) for 30 min before and during the PM2.5 exposure (28Buccellato L.J. Tso M. Akinci O.I. Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 6753-6760Google Scholar). Treatment with EUK-134 prevented the PM2.5-induced oxidation of the probe in both A549 cells and primary alveolar type II cells. Treatment with t-butyl hydroperoxide was used as a positive control (Fig. 1A). Cell death (DNA fragmentation) was measured in identically treated cells 24 h after PM2.5 exposure. Treatment with EUK-134 prevented cell death in response to PM2.5 in A549 and primary rat alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1B).PM-induced Cell Death Requires the Generation of ROS by the Mitochondria in Alveolar Epithelial Cells—Using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye, we previously reported that the administration of PM10 to alveolar epithelial cells resulted in the generation of ROS from the mitochondria. To directly measure PM2.5-induced mitochondrial oxidant production, we generated A549 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 A549 cells). Wild type and ρ0 A549 cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding the mito-Ro-GFP, and the oxidation of the probe was measured every 10 s after treatment with PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2) or PBS using flow cytometry. Treatment with PM2.5 resulted in rapid (60 s) oxidation of the probe in wild type cells; however, minimal oxidation of the probe was seen in ρ0 cells (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2PM2.5-induced mitochondrial oxidant production is inhibited by the overexpression of SOD1. A, wild type and ρ0 A549 cells were infected with mito-Ro-GFP, and 24 h later the cells were treated with PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2) or PBS. The cells were harvested at the times shown, and the oxidation state of the probe relative to the fully reduced and oxidized values was measured using flow cytometry. B–D, A549 cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding no transgene (Ad Null, B) or increasing amounts of an adenovirus encoding SOD1 (Ad SOD1, C) or SOD2 (Ad SOD2, D) measured in pfu, and 24 h later their abundance was measured in cell lysates by immunoblotting. Separate groups of cells were simultaneously infected with 2 pfu/cell of the mito-Ro-GFP virus and 5 pfu/cell of Ad Null, Ad SOD1, or Ad SOD2. Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2), and the oxidation of the probe was measured every 10 s for 250 s using flow cytometry. E, cells infected as in B–D were treated PM2.5 (5 μg/cm2), and oxidation of the probe was measured 4 h later using flow cytometry.

Budinger G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med.. 2007; 42: 165-174Google Scholar). The resulting H2O2 is reduced by catalase or indirectly by glutathione peroxidase, both of which are present in excess in the mitochondria (29Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med.. 2007; 42: 165-174Google Scholar). The cells were simultaneously infected with the 2 pfu/cell of the mito-Ro-GFP virus and 5 pfu/cell of a null virus (Ad Null), SOD1 (Ad SOD1), or SOD2 (Ad SOD2). Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2), and the oxidation of the probe was measured every 10 s for 250 s using flow cytometry. Compared with PBS-treated cells, the cells infected with the null virus showed significant oxidation of the probe after treatment with PM2.5 (Fig. 2B). Cells infected with SOD1 showed increased expression of SOD1 in whole cell lysates and showed no significant oxidation of the probe in response to PM2.5. The cells infected with SOD2 showed increased expression of SOD2 in whole cell lysates and an attenuated PM2.5-induced oxidation of the probe (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were obtained when identically infected cells were exposed to PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2), and oxidation of the probe was measured 4 h later (Fig. 2E).To determine whether the inhibition of oxidant generation by SOD1 or SOD2 could prevent cell death, A549 cells were infected with a null virus, SOD1, or SOD2 24 h before exposure to PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2) or PBS, and DNA fragmentation was measured 24 h later. Compared with cells infected with the null virus, there was a significant increase in DNA fragmentation in cells infected the SOD2 adenovirus 24 h after treatment with PM2.5. By contrast, no significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed in cells infected with SOD1 (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these results, cells infected with the null or SOD2 adenovirus, but not the SOD1 adenovirus, showed a significant increase in caspase-9 activity (Fig. 3B) and cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 3C) 24 h after treatment with PM2.5.FIGURE 3The overexpression of SOD1 prevents PM2.5-induced apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. A549 cells were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding a null virus, SOD1, or SOD2 and 24 h later were treated with PM2.5 (50 μg/cm2) or PBS. After 24 h, cell death was measured as DNA fragmentation (A), caspase-9 activation (B), and cleavage of caspase-3 (C). An asterisk indicates p < 0.05 when compared with untreated controls.

https://openalex.org/W2156268500,"Despite the growing understanding of PDGF signaling, studies of PDGF function have encountered two major obstacles: the functional redundancy of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in vitro and their distinct roles in vivo. Here we used wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), MEF null for either PDGFRα, β, or both to dissect PDGF-PDGFR signaling pathways. These four PDGFR genetically defined cells provided us a platform to study the relative contributions of the pathways triggered by the two PDGF receptors. They were treated with PDGF-BB and analyzed for differential gene expression, in vitro proliferation and differential response to pharmacological effects. No genes were differentially expressed in the double null cells, suggesting minimal receptor-independent signaling. Protean differentiation and proliferation pathways are commonly regulated by PDGFRα, PDGFRβ and PDGFRα/β while each receptor is also responsible for regulating unique signaling pathways. Furthermore, some signaling is solely modulated through heterodimeric PDGFRα/β."
https://openalex.org/W2027650871,"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is one of the key regulators of mitotic cell division. In addition to an N-terminal protein kinase catalytic domain, Plk1 possesses a phosphopeptide binding domain named polo box domain (PBD) at its C terminus. PBD is postulated to be essential for Plk1 localization and substrate targeting. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening system to identify inhibitors of PBD-dependent binding and screened a chemical library. We isolated a benzotropolone-containing natural compound derived from nutgalls (purpurogallin (PPG)) that inhibited PBD-dependent binding in vitro and in vivo. PPG not only delayed the onset of mitosis but also prolonged the progression of mitosis in HeLa cells. Although apparently normal bipolar spindles were formed even in the presence of PPG, the perturbation of chromosome alignment at metaphase plates activated the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway. These results demonstrate the predominant role of PBD-dependent binding on smooth chromosome congression at metaphase."

Previous studies by us and others demonstrated that Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination induces both degradation and cytoplasmic localization. Here we describe MSL2, a novel E3 ligase for p53 that promotes ubiquitin-dependent cytoplasmic p53 localization. Unlike Mdm2 or most other p53 E3 ligases, MSL2-mediated p53 ubiquitination does not affect the stability of p53. Moreover, the MSL2-mediated effect on p53 is Mdm2-independent.

Once p53 localizes to the mitochondria, both directly activated and enabled pathways are utilized to induce apoptosis (18Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 1718-1723Google Scholar). p53 interacts with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl family such as BclXl and Bcl2 at the outer mitochondrial membrane to release and allow the oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic factors Bak and Bax. These in turn promote the formation of pores in the mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic activators from the mitochondria (21Dumont P. Leu J.I.

Alternatively, p53 can interact directly with Bak, releasing Bak from its inhibitory interaction with Mcl1 and thereby directly activating Bak-induced apoptosis (23Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M.

Recently, a role for cytoplasmic p53 in autophagy was described, providing further evidence that changes on subcellular localization of p53 have profound effects on the cell (37Tasdemir E. Maiuri M.C. Galluzzi L. Vitale I. Djavaheri-Mergny M. D'Amelio M. Criollo A. Morselli E. Zhu C. Harper F. Nannmark U. Samara C. Pinton P. Vicencio J.M. Carnuccio R. Moll U.M. Madeo F.

Gu W. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 307-315Google Scholar). Instead of affecting p53 levels by ubiquitination, E4F1-mediated oligoubiquitination in the hinge region has been shown to stimulate the induction of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle arrest (38Le Cam L. Linares L.K. Paul C. Julien E. Lacroix M. Hatchi E. Triboulet R. Bossis G. Shmueli A. Rodriguez M.S. Coux O. Sardet C. Cell.. 2006; 127: 775-788Google Scholar). Notably, if cytoplasmic p53 localization is crucial for p53-mediated apoptosis, Mdm2 would act as a positive regulator of the p53 apoptotic response by promoting said cytoplasmic localization of p53. Such a pro-apoptotic function for Mdm2 is somewhat inconsistent with genetic data that identifies Mdm2 as the primary negative regulator of p53 (39Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G.

Another interesting aspect of the role Mdm2 plays in establishing cytoplasmic p53 pools arises from data describing the localization of p53QS, a p53 mutant unable to bind Mdm2 (41Lin J. Chen J.

Barcarse E.A. Zhang X.Q. O'Gorman S. Wahl G.M. Nat. Genet... 2000; 26: 37-43Google Scholar), which may contribute to its apoptotic ability despite known transactivation deficiencies (42Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev... 1995; 9: 2170-2183Google Scholar, 43Jimenez G.S. Nister M. Stommel J.M. Beeche M. Barcarse E.A. Zhang X.Q. O'Gorman S. Wahl G.M. Nat.

Life Sci... 1999; 55: 96-107Google Scholar, 46Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ.. 2001; 12: 175-186Google Scholar), as well as a C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (47Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 32699-32703Google Scholar). These intrinsic localization sequences contribute to a basal level of cytoplasmic shuttling of p53; however, additional factors promoting cytoplasmic p53 localization are thought to be required to explain the cytoplasmic localization and apoptotic ability of p53 mutants such as p53QS, which cannot be regulated by Mdm2. Identifying novel mechanisms that regulate cytoplasmic p53 levels may help to explain the pro-apoptotic activity of both wild type p53 and p53 mutants such as p53QS. Such information should provide additional insights into the extent to which both the transactivation-dependent and -independent functions of p53 contribute to its overall pro-apoptotic activity. Here, we describe a novel interacting partner for p53, MSL2 (male-specific lethal-2), which contributes to establishing cytoplasmic pools of p53-independent of Mdm2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—H1299, 293, U2OS, and MEF p53-/-Mdm2-/- cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate protocol or by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Plasmid Construction—To generate MSL2 expression constructs, the full-length MSL2 cDNA or deletion mutants were amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready HeLa cDNA (Clontech/BD Biosciences) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo vector (Invitrogen) or the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, MSL2 was subcloned into an expression vector to generate pIRES-F-HA-MSL2 for the generation of the stable line. The F-ΔRING-MSL2 construct, lacking the first 107 amino acids, was amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready HeLa cDNA using a primer containing the FLAG sequence to generate the pTOPO-F-MSL2 Δ107 expression construct. Point mutants of p53 used in the experiments were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged expression constructs for p53 and MSL2 using the calcium phosphate method as described previously. To immunoprecipitate the ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged proteins in co-immunoprecipitation assays or from the U2OS F-HA-MSL2 stable line, transfected cells or U2OS control and U2OS F-HA-MSL2 cells lines were lysed 24 h post-transfection in BC100 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and fresh proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments between F-p53 and the GFP-MSL2 subfragments, BC200 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and fresh proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) was used for cell lysis, wash steps, and elution. In all immunoprecipitations, the whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated M2-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After five washes with BC100, the bound proteins were eluted using FLAG-peptide (Sigma)/BC100 for 3 h at 4 °C. The eluted material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by antibodies as indicated. Whole cell lysates for inputs in ubiquitination assays and for p53 target analysis were lysed in FLAG-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 10% glycerol, and fresh proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)).GST Pulldown Assay—GST protein and GST-p53 (FL), GST-p53(NT)-(1-73), GST-p53(M)-(100-290), and GST-p53(CT)-(290-393) were purified as described previously (48Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 50607-50611Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled F-HA-MSL2 was prepared by in vitro translation using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 3 μg of GST protein was preincubated with in vitro translated F-HA-MSL2 for 3 h at 4 °C in BC100 buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). GST beads were then added, and the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted for 1 h at 4 °C in BC100 buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for detection by autoradiography.In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—The p53 lysine to arginine mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. For p53 ubiquitination assays, H1299 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 8 μg of pCIN4-His-HA-Ub, 2 μg of pCIN4-FLAG-p53, and 10 μg of pIRES-F-HA-MSL2 or 2 μg of Mdm2 plasmid as indicated. 24 h post-transfection cells were treated for 6 h with MG132 (20 μm) before harvesting. 10% of the cell suspension was kept for input and lysed in FLAG-lysis buffer. The remaining cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer I (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole). 30 μl of nickel-agarose beads was added, and lysates were rotated for 4 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed for 5 min at room temperature once in 1 ml of buffer I, once in 1 ml of buffer II (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole), and three times in 1 ml of buffer III (same composition as buffer II except at pH 6.3). Bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and 150 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature and resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Ubiquitinated p53 species were detected by Western blot using p53-specific DO-1 antibody. For MSL2 autoubiquitination assays, H1299 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of MSL2 expression constructs and 8 μg of pCIN4-His-HA-Ub and processed identically to the p53 ubiquitination assays.Immunofluorescence Staining—H1299 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated p53 expression plasmids and 8 μg of the indicated MSL2 expression constructs using the calcium phosphate method. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C and then rehydrated for 5 min at room temperature with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro). The cells were then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 1% BSA (Sigma)/Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered salt solution (DPBS) (Cellgro) for 1 h. Primary antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or full-length p53 antibody (FL-393, SC-6243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1% BSA/DPBS was incubated with the cells for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with 1% BSA/DPBS for 20 min. Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) or Alexa 568 anti-rabbit antibody for DO-1 or 393, respectively, was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, after a 15-min 1% BSA/DPBS wash, the cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in the last wash to visualize the nuclei. For the leptomycin B treatment, cells were incubated 24 post-transfection for 4 h with leptomycin B (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml before fixation. Quantitation of subcellular localization is based on 100 cells counted for each sample from three separate experiments. Subcellular localization was quantified for three separate experiments and presented as the mean ± S.D.Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions—Cells were harvested, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted. The cells were then suspended in 5 volumes of cold HB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. After vortexing for 5 s, the homogenate was spun for 10 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic fraction, was transferred to a fresh tube, and the salt concentration was adjusted to 200 mm with 5 m NaCl. The crude nuclear pellet was suspended in FLAG-lysis buffer and vortexed vigorously at 4 °C for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Nuclear and cytoplasmic factions were analyzed by Western blot as indicated.siRNA-mediated Knockdown of MSL2 and DNA Damage Treatment—The ablation of MSL2 was performed by transfection of U2OS cells with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool oligoset by Dharmacon (Dharmacon L020828-01), consisting of four different oligos targeting four different regions of MSL2. Transfections of the siMSL1 or control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus siControl non-targeting pool D-001810-10-20 (Dharmacon)) was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). To induce DNA damage, cells were treated with etoposide (20 μm) for 6 h.RESULTSMSL2 Is a Novel Binding Partner of p53—Human MSL2 is the homolog to the Drosophila melanogaster protein male-specific lethal-2, a member of the fruit fly dosage compensation complex (49Mendjan S. Akhtar A. Chromosoma (Berl.).. 2007; 116: 95-106Google Scholar, 50Smith E.R. Cayrou C. Huang R. Lane W.S. Cote J. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 9175-9188Google Scholar, 51Rea S. Xouri G.

Oncogene.. 2007; 26: 5385-5394Google Scholar), has been shown to interact, modify, and regulate p53 (53Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 24: 841-851Google Scholar), suggesting a potential regulatory node between the mammalian dosage compensation complex and p53. MSL2 is the only member of the mammalian dosage compensation complex containing a RING domain with potential E3 ligase function (49Mendjan S. Akhtar A. Chromosoma (Berl.).. 2007; 116: 95-106Google Scholar, 50Smith E.R. Cayrou C. Huang R. Lane W.S. Cote J. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 9175-9188Google Scholar), leading us to determine whether p53 interacts with this member of the complex in addition to the known interaction between p53 and hMOF (53Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 24: 841-851Google Scholar). p53 null H1299 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for p53 and F-HA-MSL2, cells were harvested and lysed 24 h post-transfection, and tagged MSL2 was immunoprecipitated. Western blot analysis of inputs (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3) and immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6) shows that MSL2 immunoprecipitates co-expressed p53 in vivo (Fig. 1B, lane 5). An in vitro GST pulldown assay was used to determine whether the p53 interaction with MSL2 is direct and to map the specific p53 domain involved in the interaction (Fig. 1C). Recombinant full-length GST-p53 (Fig. 1C, lane 3), as well as a C-terminal GST-p53 fragment (Fig. 1C, lane 6), was able to interact with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled F-HA-MSL2 in vitro. Neither GST-protein alone nor the GST-p53(NT) and GST-p53(M) subfragments were able to interact with MSL2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, and 5, respectively). Currently, no commercial antibodies are available that can detect human MSL2. To support the in vivo interaction data obtained from cotransfection experiments, a U2OS cell line was established that stably expresses low levels of F-HA-MSL2. Using U2OS wild type cells as controls together with the F-HA-MSL2 U2OS stable line, an interaction between endogenous p53 and the stably expressed F-HA-MSL2 was observed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Low levels of stably expressed F-HA-MSL2 co-immunoprecipitate endogenous p53 from F-HA-U2OS cells (Fig. 1D, lane 4), whereas no p53 was detected after control immunoprecipitation from wild type U2OS cells (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Although the use of a stable line does not entirely substitute for co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins, the observed interaction in the stable cell line supports the overexpression and in vitro interaction data presented in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. Together, these experiments identify MSL2 as a novel interacting partner for p53 both in vivo and in vitro.Effect of the MSL2-RING Domain on Intrinsic E3 Ligase Activity and Subcellular Localization of MSL2—Proteins containing a RING domain commonly possess intrinsic E3 ligase activity (54Fang S. Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cancer Biol... 2003; 13: 5-14Google Scholar). To establish whether MSL2 has a functional RING domain capable of promoting ubiquitination, we generated a truncation mutant that has the RING domain deleted (ΔRING-MSL2) (Fig. 2A). To test whether MSL2 has intrinsic E3 ligase activity and whether this activity is dependent on the RING domain, a His6-tagged ubiquitin construct was cotransfected with MSL2 or ΔRING-MSL2, and their ability to autoubiquitinate was analyzed. Ubiquitinated proteins were purified using Ni-NTA beads, and Western blot analysis of the elutions showed that wild type MSL2 (Fig. 2B, lane 4), but not ΔRING-MSL2 (Fig. 2B, lane 2), could autoubiquitinate. To ensure that the deletion of the RING domain does not affect the subcellular localization of MSL2, GFP-tagged full-length MSL2 and ΔRING-MSL2 were transfected into U2OS cells, and the localization of transfected MSL2 constructs was observed by fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C, full-length GFP-MSL2 (upper panel) and GFP-ΔRING-MSL2 (lower panel) localize to the nucleus when expressed exogenously, indicating that the MSL2-RING domain, although required for the ubiquitination activity of MSL2, does not affect the subcellular localization of MSL2.FIGURE 2Effect of the MSL2-RING domain on intrinsic E3 ligase activity and subcellular localization of MSL2. A, schematic representation of full-length MSL2 and ΔRING-MSL2, a truncation mutant with the N-terminal 107 amino acids deleted to remove the active RING domain. B, MSL2 has ubiquitination activity. 293 cells were transfected with tagged wild type MSL2 and ΔRING-MSL2 constructs in the presence of His-HA-ubiquitin (UB). After treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h, cells were lysed and ubiquitinated proteins purified using Ni-NTA beads. Elutions were analyzed by Western blot as indicated. AB, antibody. C, MSL2 and ΔRING-MSL2 localize to the nucleus.

DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MSL2 Is an E3 Ligase for p53—To determine whether MSL2 can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, H1299 cells were transfected with p53 and either wild type MSL2 or ΔRING-MSL2 in the presence of His-tagged ubiquitin. After purification of ubiquitinated proteins, Western blot analysis showed that MSL2, but not ΔRING-MSL2, could ubiquitinate p53 in vivo (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). To ensure that the loss of p53 ubiquitination by the ΔRING-MSL2 construct was not due to a loss of interaction between p53 and the MSL2 constructs, H1299 cells were transfected with HA-tagged p53 alone (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 6) or in the presence of either FLAG-tagged full-length MSL2 (lanes 2 and 7) or FLAG-tagged ΔRING-MSL2 (lanes 3 and 8). As shown in Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 9, respectively, both full-length MSL2 and ΔRING-MSL2 were able to co-immunoprecipitate HA-p53. Therefore, the loss of ubiquitination by ΔRING-MSL2 observed in Fig. 3A, lane 5, was caused by the absence of the MSL2-RING domain rather than a lost interaction between p53 and ΔRING-MSL2. With the exception of Mdm2-mediated p53 monoubiquitination, occurring at low Mdm2 levels (28Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science.. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Google Scholar), and E4F1 ubiquitination in the hinge region (38Le Cam L. Linares L.K. Paul C. Julien E. Lacroix M. Hatchi E. Triboulet R. Bossis G. Shmueli A. Rodriguez M.S. Coux O. Sardet C. Cell.. 2006; 127: 775-788Google Scholar), p53 polyubiquitination is associated primarily with targeting p53 for proteasomal degradation. Cotransfection of the various p53-specific E3 ligases with p53 leads to significant reduction of p53 levels (4Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 307-315Google Scholar). To determine whether MSL2 affects p53 levels, H1299 cells were transfected with p53 alone (Fig. 3C, lane 2) and in combination with either wild type MSL2 or ΔRING-MSL2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 3-5). Neither overexpression of MSL2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4) or of ΔRING-MSL2 (Fig. 3C, lane 5) affected p53 levels after cotransfection (Fig. 3C, lane 2 versus lanes 3-5), indicating that MSL2-mediated ubiquitination does not result in proteasomal degradation of p53 and hence does not regulate p53 stability in vivo.FIGURE 3MSL2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 that does not regulate p53 levels. A, MSL2 ubiquitinates p53. H1299 cells were transfected with p53, MSL2, ΔRING-MSL2, and His-HA-Ub as indicted.

Using M2-beads, FLAG-tagged MSL2 constructs were immunoprecipitated (IP), and elutions were analyzed for co-immunoprecipitation of HA-p53 by Western blot as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2069786663,"The journal Impact factor (IF) is generally accepted to be a good measurement of the relevance/quality of articles that a journal publishes. In spite of an, apparently, homogenous peer-review process for a given journal, we hypothesize that the country affiliation of authors from developing Latin American (LA) countries affects the IF of a journal detrimentally.Seven prestigious international journals, one multidisciplinary journal and six serving specific branches of science, were examined in terms of their IF in the Web of Science. Two subsets of each journal were then selected to evaluate the influence of author's affiliation on the IF. They comprised contributions (i) with authorship from four Latin American (LA) countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico) and (ii) with authorship from five developed countries (England, France, Germany, Japan and USA). Both subsets were further subdivided into two groups: articles with authorship from one country only and collaborative articles with authorship from other countries. Articles from the five developed countries had IF close to the overall IF of the journals and the influence of collaboration on this value was minor. In the case of LA articles the effect of collaboration (virtually all with developed countries) was significant. The IFs for non-collaborative articles averaged 66% of the overall IF of the journals whereas the articles in collaboration raised the IFs to values close to the overall IF.The study shows a significantly lower IF in the group of the subsets of non-collaborative LA articles and thus that country affiliation of authors from non-developed LA countries does affect the IF of a journal detrimentally. There are no data to indicate whether the lower IFs of LA articles were due to their inherent inferior quality/relevance or psycho-social trend towards under-citation of articles from these countries. However, further study is required since there are foreseeable consequences of this trend as it may stimulate strategies by editors to turn down articles that tend to be under-cited."
https://openalex.org/W2016087379,"Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) regulate the function of several transient receptor potential (TRP) family members, yet their role in the regulation of the vanilloid subfamily member 4 protein (TRPV4) remains controversial. TRPV4 is a calcium-permeable channel activated by numerous physical and chemical stimuli. Here we show that SFKs mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 in different cell lines. Using mass spectrometric analysis, we identified two novel phosphorylation sites in the cytosolic N- and C-terminal tails of TRPV4. Substitution of either tyrosine with phenylalanine led to a substantial reduction in the overall tyrosine phosphorylation level of TRPV4, suggesting that these two tyrosines constitute major phosphorylation sites. Both mutants efficiently localized to the plasma membrane, indicating that neither tyrosine is required for trafficking of TRPV4 in the secretory pathway. Analysis of the channel function demonstrated a crucial role of the N-terminal tyrosine residue in the activation of TRPV4 by heat, mechanical (shear) stress, hypotonic cell swelling, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not in the activation by synthetic ligand 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Furthermore, the response of TRPV4 to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was SFK-dependent. Because the SFK-mediated phosphorylation of the N-terminal tyrosine occurred before TRPV4 activation, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to sensitize rather than activate this channel. Reactive oxygen species, known to mediate inflammatory pain, strongly up-regulated TRPV4 phosphorylation in the presence of SFKs. Our findings indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 represents an important modulatory mechanism, which may underlie the recently described function of TRPV4 in inflammatory hyperalgesia.

Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 22664-22668Google Scholar). This distribution indicates that TRPV4 is well positioned to sense systemic and local environmental changes. The polymodal nature of the TRPV4 channel raises the question whether the activating stimuli converge on the same pathway or act independently. Recent studies demonstrate that opening of TRPV4 in response to hypotonic cell swelling involves phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated release of arachidonic acid, which is further metabolized by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase to 5′,6′-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (23Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 396-401Google Scholar). Although direct gating of TRPV4 by mechanical force has not been excluded (24Christensen A.P. Corey D.P. Nat. Rev... 2007; 8: 510-521Google Scholar), the TRPV4-mediated responses to shear stress and high viscous load appear to depend on PLA2 activity as well (19Hartmannsgruber V. Heyken W.T. Kacik M. Kaistha A. Grgic I. Harteneck C. Liedtke W. Hoyer J. Kohler R. PLoS ONE.. 2007; 2: e827Google Scholar, 25Andrade Y.N. Fernandes J. Vazquez E. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Arniges M. Sanchez T.M. Villalon M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 869-874Google Scholar). In contrast, 4αPDD stimulates TRPV4 directly by binding to its TM3 and TM4 segments (26Vriens J. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 12796-12803Google Scholar). Finally, activation by heat appears to share mechanistic requirements both with 4αPDD and cell swelling pathways (23Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 396-401Google Scholar, 27D'Hoedt D. Owsianik G. Prenen J. Cuajungco M.P. Grimm C. Heller S. Voets T. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 6272-6280Google Scholar). Thus, TRPV4 can be gated by at least two independent mechanisms. In addition to the stimuli described above, activity of TRPV4 can be also regulated by phosphorylation. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activates TRPV4 in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent way (9Gao X. Wu L. O'Neil R.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 27129-27137Google Scholar, 28Xu F. Satoh E. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol... 2003; 140: 413-421Google Scholar), which is reminiscent of the well studied PKC-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of TRPV1 channels (29Tominaga M. Tominaga T. Pflugers Arch.. 2005; 451: 143-150Google Scholar). Furthermore, Xu et al. (30Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 11520-11527Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of TRPV4 on tyrosine 253 by Src family kinases (SFKs) is required for channel activation upon treatment with hypotonic solution. In agreement with this finding, SFKs positively regulate several other TRP channels (31Hisatsune C. Kuroda Y. Nakamura K. Inoue T. Nakamura T. Michikawa T. Mizutani A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 18887-18894Google Scholar, 32Jiang X. Newell E.W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 42867-42876Google Scholar, 33Jin X. Morsy N. Winston J. Pasricha P.J. Garrett K.

However, both the involvement of SFKs and the role of tyrosine 253 in the activation of TRPV4 were subsequently contradicted by others (23Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 396-401Google Scholar). Prompted by this controversy, we further explored the function of the SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4. Using mass spectrometry, we unequivocally identified the phosphorylation sites of Src kinase in TRPV4 as tyrosines 110 and 805, and characterized the TRPV4 variants with point mutations at these sites. Our results demonstrate a major role of the Tyr110 residue in the stimulus-specific modulation of TRPV4 channel function, and contribute to the understanding of the polymodal nature of TRPV4 activation. Plasmids—TRPV4 with a C-terminal FLAG tag was generated from a pcDNA3-based plasmid containing the mouse Trpv4 cDNA (6Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett... 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar). We verified that the addition of the FLAG tag did not inhibit TRPV4 channel function (data not shown). The Trpv4 cDNA was re-cloned into pcDNA6-V5/His vector (Invitrogen) to obtain C-terminal V5/His-tagged constructs. For retrovirus production, Trpv4 cDNA was cloned into pLXSN vector (Clontech). For Ca2+ imaging with HeLa cells, TRPV4 was expressed from the pCAGGS/IRES-GFP vector (6Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett... 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar). Y110F and Y805F substitutions were generated by PCR, and short DNA fragments containing these mutations were used to replace corresponding wild-type fragments in target plasmids, to eliminate the possibility of introducing undesired nucleotide changes. The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing. The T7-tagged fragment of the N-terminal tail of TRPV4 (amino acids 1–321) containing Tyr110 as the only tyrosine (T7-N-TRPV4 110Y) was prepared by DNA synthesis and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). V-src was expressed from a plasmid containing Rous sarcoma virus DNA fragment (Schmidt-Ruppin A strain). Human SRC cDNA was cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of the pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector (Stratagene). Src kinase-dead (KD) mutant was constructed by introducing K297R substitution into the above construct. Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Retrovirus Production—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate method or FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Retroviruses were produced in HEK 293T cells co-transfected with appropriate pLXSN-based plasmid and helper plasmids. Transduction of MDCK cells was carried out in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). TRPV4-expressing cells were selected with 0.25 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen), and analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Reagents—PMA, 4αPDD, bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride (BIM I) (Sigma), and 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) (Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 2–5 mm. Ruthenium red (Latoxan) was dissolved in water at 10 mm. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma). The bound proteins were washed five times with the immunoprecipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with the following antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG, mouse anti-actin (clone AC-15), rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine (all Sigma), mouse anti-v-src (clone 327) (Calbiochem), mouse anti-V5 (Serotec), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) (Upstate), and rabbit anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) (Cell Signaling). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The assay was performed as previously described (38Wegierski T. Hill K. Schaefer M. Walz G. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 5659-5669Google Scholar). In short, HEK 293T cells transfected by the calcium phosphate method were split into poly-l-lysine-coated 48-well dishes. The cells were incubated with α-V5 antibody (1.33 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm HEPES at 4 °C for 45 min, washed three times, and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following incubation with alkaline phosphatase-coupled α-mouse antibodies (Sigma), the enzymatic reaction was performed using 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), and read at 405 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer. Cells split in parallel were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were scanned and the bands were quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Mass Spectrometry—Purified TRPV4-FLAG proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE using a 6 × 6-cm precast 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) under MOPS buffer conditions. After colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining (39Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Electrophoresis.. 1985; 6: 427-448Google Scholar) bands corresponding to TRPV4 were excised and processed for mass spectrometric detection as previously described (40Schindler J. Lewandrowski U. Sickmann A. Friauf E. J. Proteome Res... 2008; 7: 432-442Google Scholar). An in-gel proteolytic digest was performed with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel slices with 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a linear ion trap coupled online to a nanoLC system (Famos, Switchos, Ultimate, Dionex, Idstein, Germany) comprising a common precolumn concentration setup. For trapping and desalting of peptides from in-gel digests a custom-made 100-μm inner diameter × 2-cm length precolumn (Ace C18, 5 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size, HiChrom Ltd., Berkshire, UK) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as loading buffer was used. Reversed-phase separation was performed on custom-made 75-μm inner diameter × 150-mm length (Ace C18, 3 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size, HiChrom Ltd.) main columns. Separations were accomplished at a flow rate of 290 nl/min and gradient slopes of 1% B/min or 0.5% B/min up to 55% buffer B content, followed by a 5-min wash at 95% B. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B 0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile. Spectra of eluting peptides were detected using a Qtrap4000 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). To focus on the elucidation of phosphotyrosine residues, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used as primary scan event. MRM transitions were calculated using the precursor ion mass of respective in silico phosphorylated TRPV4 peptides as Q1 mass and m/z 216 as Q3 mass corresponding to the phosphotyrosine immonium ion. Q1/Q3 were set to low/unit and each transition had a dwell time of 25–30 ms with a declustering potential of 30. Spray voltage was set to 2300 V using the micro-ionspray 1 source setup (Applied Biosystems). Within each scan cycle the two most intense transitions from the MRM scan were selected for an enhanced resolution scan (250 atomic mass units/s, 2 scans summed) and charge determination. Subsequently, the same ions were fragmented by enhanced product ion scans (4000 atomic mass units/s, 2 scans summed, m/z range 115–1700). Raw files were processed using Analyst 1.4 software plug-ins (mascot.dll, Matrix Science/Applied Biosystems). All peaks with intensities below 0.1% of the base peak were omitted, whereas data were centroided in the process. The resulting spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot data base in an automated fashion. Mass deviance was set to 0.4 Da with trypsin specified as protease comprising one missed cleavage site. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as well as phosphorylation of tyrosine as variable modifications. Spectra with Mascot™ scores >39 (significance threshold p < 0.05) were considered for further manual evaluation regarding the range of ion series with a focus on the correct annotation of phosphorylation sites. Ca2+ Imaging—HeLa, HEK 293T (transfected with FuGENE 6), or MDCK cells were grown on 30-mm round coverslips. The cells were incubated with 2 μm fura-2 AM (Biotium) in the presence of pluronic F-127 for 30 min in the perfusion solution. Cells were mounted in a custom-made open chamber on a microscope stage (Zeiss Axiovert 200M with Fluar ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective) and perfused with isotonic solution (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 4–5 ml/min. To examine responses to hypotonic solution (HTS; Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S3), cells were first perfused with 15 ml of mannitol isotonic solution (containing 100 mm mannitol and [NaCl] reduced to 100 mm), and stimulated with hypotonic solution ([NaCl] reduced to 100 mm, without mannitol). Secondary responses to HTS, performed as controls in Figs. 6 and supplemental S4, were elicited with a hypotonic solution prepared by mixing isotonic solution and water at a 2:1 ratio. In Ca2+-free solutions, Ca2+ was replaced by 5 mm EGTA. To examine responses to shear stress, cells were mounted in a custom-made closed chamber and shear stress was applied by increasing flow rate according to the formula, τ=6×η×Q/(b×h2)(Eq. 1) where τ is shear stress (dyne/cm2); η is fluid viscosity (0.69 cP); Q, flow rate (ml/s); b, chamber width (0.2 cm); h, chamber height (0.02 cm).FIGURE 6Murine TRPV4 stably expressed in MDCK cells mediates responses to PMA in PKC- and SFK-dependent manner.

The inhibitors were also present during the incubation of cells with Fura-2 AM (RR was used at 100 nm during incubation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells were exposed to the light from a xenon lamp (Hamamatsu) passed through 340- and 380-nm filters. The emitted fluorescence was recorded and analyzed using Metafluor software (Molecular Devices). Background fluorescence was subtracted before calculation of 340/380 ratios. Typically several GFP-positive HeLa or HEK 293T cells and 20–30 MDCK cells were recorded in one measurement. Calibration of 340/380 ratios to intracellular resting calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in HEK 293T cells was performed as described in Ref. 41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar, using the following equation, [Ca2+]i=β×Kd×[(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)](Eq. 2) where β is the ratio of fluorescence emission intensity at 380 nm excitation in Ca2+-depleting and Ca2+-saturating conditions, R is 340/380 ratio at any time, Rmin is the minimum ratio in Ca2+-depleting conditions (5 mm EGTA, 2 μm ionomycin), Rmax is the maximum ratio in Ca2+-saturating conditions (5 mm Ca2+, 2 μm ionomycin), and Kd is the Ca2+ dissociation constant of fura-2 (220 nm). Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% horse serum, and incubated either with rabbit anti-TRPV4 antibody (38Wegierski T.

EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 5659-5669Google Scholar) followed by anti-rabbit Cy3-coupled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or with anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-mouse Cy3-coupled antibody. Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Images were taken with Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using C-Apochromat ×63/1.2 W (for Fig. 3B) or Plan-Neofluar ×100/1.3 oil (for Fig. 5B) objectives.FIGURE 5Steady state levels and localization of TRPV4-FLAG WT and Y110F proteins stably expressed in MDCK cells.

Src Phosphorylates TRPV4 on Tyrosines 110 and 805—To investigate Src-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV4, we generated MDCK cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged mouse TRPV4 by retroviral gene transfer. TRPV4-FLAG protein purified from these cells contained phosphorylated tyrosine residues, as evidenced by the immunostaining with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1A). The phosphotyrosine signal in TRPV4 purified from cells pre-treated with PP2, a specific inhibitor of SFKs, was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Src or related kinases are largely responsible for the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein (Fig. 1A). To confirm the involvement of SFKs in the phosphorylation of TRPV4, we transfected HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding v-src from Rous sarcoma virus together with either FLAG-tagged TRPV4 or CD2-associated protein (FLAG-CD2AP). Co-expression of v-src led to a clear increase in the phosphotyrosine level of TRPV4 but not of CD2AP (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, TRPV4 purified from HEK 293T cells expressing v-src was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to identify tyrosine phosphorylation sites in this protein. The employed MRM-scanning technique was sufficient to reduce sample complexity and to detect phosphorylation sites. Therefore, no further enrichment technique was required for phosphopeptide detection. This approach identified two phosphorylation sites within the peptide sequences KAPMDSLFDY*GTYR and SEIY*QYYGFSHTVGR, corresponding to Tyr110 and Tyr805 in the protein sequence of TRPV4 (Fig. 1C, upper spectra). The spectra allowed an unambiguous assignment of the respective phosphorylation sites by directly annotating sequence ions. Importantly, mass spectrometry analysis of TRPV4-FLAG purified from MDCK cells indicated the same phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1C, lower spectra). Thus, tyrosines 110 and 805 are phosphorylated by endogenous SFKs in TRPV4 at normal cell culture conditions. Applying the outlined experimental conditions, we did not detect phosphorylation at Tyr253, a previously reported target site of SKFs during hypotonic cell swelling (30Xu H. Zhao H. Tian W. Yoshida K. Roullet J.B. Cohen D.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 11520-11527Google Scholar). We next extended our analysis o"
https://openalex.org/W2049587780,"Although agonist-dependent endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a means to modulate receptor signaling has been widely studied, the constitutive endocytosis of GPCRs has received little attention. Here we show that two prototypical class I GPCRs, the β2 adrenergic and M3 muscarinic receptors, enter cells constitutively by clathrin-independent endocytosis and colocalize with markers of this endosomal pathway on recycling tubular endosomes, indicating that these receptors can subsequently recycle back to the plasma membrane (PM). This constitutive endocytosis of these receptors was not blocked by antagonists, indicating that receptor signaling was not required. Interestingly, the G proteins that these receptors couple to, Gαs and Gαq, localized together with their receptors at the plasma membrane and on tubular recycling endosomes. Upon agonist stimulation, Gαs and Gαq remained associated with the PM and these endosomal membranes, whereas β2 and M3 receptors now entered cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Deletion of the third intracellular loop (i3 loop), which is thought to play a role in agonist-dependent endocytosis of the M3 receptor, had no effect on the constitutive internalization of the receptor. Surprisingly, with agonist, the mutated M3 receptor still internalized and accumulated in cells but through clathrin-independent and not clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These findings demonstrate that GPCRs are versatile PM proteins that can utilize different mechanisms of internalization depending upon ligand activation. Although agonist-dependent endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a means to modulate receptor signaling has been widely studied, the constitutive endocytosis of GPCRs has received little attention. Here we show that two prototypical class I GPCRs, the β2 adrenergic and M3 muscarinic receptors, enter cells constitutively by clathrin-independent endocytosis and colocalize with markers of this endosomal pathway on recycling tubular endosomes, indicating that these receptors can subsequently recycle back to the plasma membrane (PM). This constitutive endocytosis of these receptors was not blocked by antagonists, indicating that receptor signaling was not required. Interestingly, the G proteins that these receptors couple to, Gαs and Gαq, localized together with their receptors at the plasma membrane and on tubular recycling endosomes. Upon agonist stimulation, Gαs and Gαq remained associated with the PM and these endosomal membranes, whereas β2 and M3 receptors now entered cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Deletion of the third intracellular loop (i3 loop), which is thought to play a role in agonist-dependent endocytosis of the M3 receptor, had no effect on the constitutive internalization of the receptor. Surprisingly, with agonist, the mutated M3 receptor still internalized and accumulated in cells but through clathrin-independent and not clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These findings demonstrate that GPCRs are versatile PM proteins that can utilize different mechanisms of internalization depending upon ligand activation.

Activation of GPCRs through the binding of specific agonists induces conformational changes that allow activation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) (5Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2008; 9: 60-71Google Scholar, 6Deupi X. Kobilka B. Adv. Protein Chem.. 2007; 74: 137-166Google Scholar). To ensure that the signals are controlled in magnitude and duration, activated GPCRs are rapidly desensitized through phosphorylation carried out by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (7Tobin A.B. Butcher A.J. Kong K.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci.. 2008; 29: 413-420Google Scholar). This facilitates β-arrestin binding and promotes receptor uncoupling from the G protein (8Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab.. 2006; 17: 159-165Google Scholar, 9Moore C.A. Milano S.K. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol.. 2007; 69: 451-482Google Scholar). In addition to its role in GPCRs desensitization, β-arrestins promote the translocation of the receptor to the endocytic machinery involving clathrin and adaptor protein-2 (AP-2), thereby facilitating receptor removal from the plasma membrane (10Tsao P.

Traffic.. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Google Scholar). Once internalized, some GPCRs may even continue to signal from endosomes (16Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T. Nelson C.D. Houtz D.A. Xiao K. Madabushi S. Reiter E. Premont R.T. Lichtarge O. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 1261-1273Google Scholar). Although GPCR internalization is generally considered to be an agonist-dependent phenomenon, some evidence suggests that GPCRs can be endocytosed even in the absence of agonist, a process known as constitutive internalization (17McDonald N.A. Henstridge C.M. Connolly C.N. Irving A.J. Mol. Pharmacol.. 2007; 71: 976-984Google Scholar, 18Mohammad S. Baldini G. Granell S. Narducci P. Martelli A.M. Baldini G. J. Biol.

Pharmacol.. 2008; 74: 562-573Google Scholar). The role of constitutive internalization of GPCRs is not clear. One interesting study on cannabinoid CB1 receptors in neurons has shown that constitutive internalization from the somatodendritic and not axonal membrane is responsible for the overall redistribution of receptors from the somatodentritic to the axonal membrane (17McDonald N.A. Henstridge C.M. Connolly C.N. Irving A.J. Mol. Pharmacol.. 2007; 71: 976-984Google Scholar). Another study on the melanocortin MC4 receptor raised the possibility that constitutive endocytosis could be a consequence of the basal activity of the receptor (18Mohammad S. Baldini G. Granell S. Narducci P. Martelli A.M. Baldini G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 4963-4974Google Scholar). Even less is known about the potential trafficking of the transducer of GPCR signaling, the G protein (21Marrari Y. Crouthamel M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 7665-7677Google Scholar). Generally, the binding of the agonist to the GPCR promotes the exchange of GDP on the Gα protein for GTP and allows the dissociation of the trimeric G protein into Gα-GTP and Gβγ dimer subunits (5Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2008; 9: 60-71Google Scholar, 22Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther.. 1998; 80: 231-264Google Scholar). Then, the activated G proteins target different effectors (23Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr. Rev.. 2003; 24: 765-781Google Scholar, 24Johnston C.A. Siderovski D.P. Mol. Pharmacol.. 2007; 72: 219-230Google Scholar). G proteins are localized primarily to the PM where they interact with GPCRs; however, it is not known whether G proteins always remain at the PM or whether they might move into cells along endocytic pathways. Previous work showed that Gαs does not colocalize with β2 receptor on internal compartments after agonist stimulation, but the cellular distribution of Gαs was not examined (25Allen J.A. Yu J.Z. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol.. 2005; 67: 1493-1504Google Scholar). In general, cargo proteins at the plasma membrane (PM) enter the cell through a variety of endocytic mechanisms that can be divided into two main groups: clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). CDE is used by PM proteins such as the transferrin receptor (TfR) that contain specific cytoplasmic sequences recognized by adaptor proteins allowing a rapid and efficient internalization through clathrin-coated vesicles (26Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature.. 2003; 422: 37-44Google Scholar, 27Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2005; 6: 112-126Google Scholar). In contrast, CIE is used by PM proteins that lack adaptor protein binding sequences including cargo proteins such as the major histocompatibility complex class I protein (MHCI), the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein CD59, and integrins (28Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol.. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 29Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2007; 8: 603-612Google Scholar, 30Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3542-3552Google Scholar). In HeLa cells CIE is independent of, and CDE dependent on, clathrin and dynamin and thus the two different endocytic pathways are distinct and well defined (31Donaldson J.G. Porat-Shliom N. Cohen L.A. Cell Signal.. 2009; 21: 1-6Google Scholar). After internalization in separate vesicles, MHCI-containing vesicles from CIE and transferrin receptor-containing vesicles from CDE subsequently fuse with the early endosomal compartment that is associated with Rab5 and the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (32Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 417-431Google Scholar). TfR is recycled back out to the PM in Rab4- and Rab11-dependent processes. In contrast, some MHCI is trafficked on to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation, and some is recycled back out to the PM along tubular endosomes that lack TfR and emanate from the juxtanuclear area. Recycling of MHCI back to the PM requires the activity of Arf6, Rab22, and Rab11 (33Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol.. 1997; 139: 49-61Google Scholar, 34Weigert R. Yeung A.C. Li J. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3758-3770Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the trafficking of GPCRs and their G proteins in the presence and absence of agonist in HeLa cells. We examined the trafficking of two prototypical class I GPCRs: the β2 adrenergic receptor (coupled to Gαs) and the M3 acetylcholine muscarinic receptor (coupled to Gαq). We find that β2 and M3 receptors traffic constitutively via CIE, and then, in the presence of agonist, they switch to the CDE pathway. We also examined the role of the third intracellular loop of the M3 receptor in this process. To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive analysis of constitutive trafficking of class I GPCRs and related Gα proteins. We demonstrate that GPCRs are versatile PM cargos that utilize different mechanisms of internalization depending upon ligand activation. Considering the high level of homology between class I GPCRs, this evidence could be applicable to the other members of this family. Materials and Antibodies—Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), isoproterenol hydrochloride, atropine sulfate, and propranolol hydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS, 79–83 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA). The mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 16b12 (IgG1) was from Covance (Berkeley, CA) and a rabbit anti-HA antibody from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody to human MHCI (W6/32) (IgG2a) (Naslavsky et al., Ref. 32Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 417-431Google Scholar) was described previously. The mouse anti-clathrin heavy chain was purchased from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). A mouse anti-Lamp1 antibody (H4A3) was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). The antibodies against the endogenous Gαs and Gαq subunits were kindly provided by Dr. A. Spiegel (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) and were previously described (54Goldsmith P. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Unson C.G. Vinitsky R. Malech H.L. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1987; 262: 14683-14688Google Scholar). Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) was the source for transferrin (Tfn) conjugated to Alexa-594 and Alexa-conjugated (488, 594, and 680) fluorescent secondary goat-anti-rabbit, goat-anti-mouse (GAM), and isotype-specific GAM-IgG1 and GAM-IgG2a antibodies. Cell Culture, DNA Constructs, and siRNA—HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were plated and transfected the next day by using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed 18–20 h after transfection. The 3HA-tagged receptor constructs, hβ2, hM3, and hM2 receptors (in the plasmid vector pcDNA 3.1 +) were purchased from UMR cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). The construct β2-GFP used in live cell imaging experiments was kindly provided by Dr. J. Benovic (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and was previously described (35Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 322-328Google Scholar). The 3HA-tagged hM3-short (where most of the i3 loop of M3 was deleted, from Ala-303 to Thr-499) plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J. Wess (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and it was previously described (36Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Google Scholar). To knockdown clathrin, we used the SMART pool siRNA (a mixture of 4 different siRNA) from Dharmacon. In particular, the four target sequences designed to knock down clathrin were GAGAAUGGCUGUACGUAAU, UGAGAAAUGUAAUGCGAAU, GCAGAAGAAUCAACGUUAU, and CGUAAGAAGGCUCGAGAGU. The final concentration of the pool siRNA in our experiment was 75 nm (18.7 nm for each single siRNA). For the siRNA clathrin knockdown experiments, we followed the double hit siRNA procedure of Motley et al. (55Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 162: 909-918Google Scholar). In brief, we seeded HeLa cells at a density of 500,000 cells per 10-cm dish and after 6 h the first siRNA transfection was performed, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen). Then, on Day 2, a second siRNA transfection was performed. On day 2, 6–8 h before the second treatment of siRNA, we transfected our constructs hβ2, hM3, and hM3-short receptors following our standard procedure with FuGENE. The cells were trypsinized on Day 3 and split in 2 dishes (one for immunofluorescence and one the Western blotting). On day 4, the experiment was performed. Immunofluorescence, Antibody Internalization, and Live Cell Imaging—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on to glass coverslips and transfected the following day. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the mouse anti-HA antibody (IgG1) to label the receptor on the plasma membrane. After washing, cells were incubated at 37 °C at different times in the presence of the mouse anti-MHCI antibody (IgG2a) or in the presence of transferrin (Alexa 594-transferrin), with or without the agonist, to allow internalization. For M3 and M2 muscarinic receptors Carbachol (1 mm) was used, while for β2 receptor isoprotenerol (1 mm) was used as agonists. The cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS containing 10% FBS (PBS/FBS) and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with ∼0.08 mg/ml of unlabeled goat anti-mouse (GAM) in the absence of saponin to block surface antibodies from secondary reagents. After washing, fluorescently-conjugated isotype-specific secondary antibodies (488 GAM-IgG1 and 594 GAM-IgG2a) were used in the presence of 0.2% saponin to detect the internalized receptor and MHCI, respectively. When 594-transferrin was present, we utilized only the secondary antibodies 488 GAM (IgG1). All images were obtained using a 510 LSM confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with 63× 1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. Unless indicated, the optical section was less than 1 μm. After acquisition, images were handled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). All experiments were confirmed at least three times, and a representative image is shown. For live cell imaging, HeLa cells were plated onto Lab-Tek coverglass chambers (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and transfected with β2-GFP constructs. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were imaged on a 37 °C stage in CO2-independent media. Images were acquired every 10 s for 15 min. After 3–5 min, Alexa 594-transferrin was added to the medium with or without isoprotenerol (1 mm). Quantification of the Internalized Receptor with the Single Cell-based Method—To determine and quantify the amount of internal cargo at different times of internalization, we used a single cell-based method. This method allows us to measure the percentage of the internal cargo compared with the total (surface and internalized) for each cell examined. After preincubation at 4 °C for 1 h with the mouse anti-HA antibody (IgG1) to label the receptor (M3 or β2) on the plasma membrane, cells were incubated at 37 °C at different times in the presence or absence of ligand. Then, the cells were fixed, washed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with isotype-specific secondary antibody 488 GAM-IgG1 without saponin just to label the receptor left on the PM after the internalization experiment. Next, we added ∼0.08 mg/ml of the unlabeled GAM blocking solution without saponin for 1 h to quench any remaining sites on the surface-bound mouse antibodies. Finally, we used the secondary antibody 594 GAM-IgG1 for 1 h in the presence of saponin to label the internalized receptor. In parallel to each quantification experiment, we performed a separate experiment to set up the acquisition parameters of the images so that the fluorescent signals of the two different secondary antibodies 594 GAM-IgG1 and 488 GAM-IgGI were similar. To do this, we used the two secondary antibodies, 594 GAM-IgG1 and 488 GAM-IgG1, together at the same concentration to label the primary antibody bound to the receptor in a control experiment. After this preliminary set up, all the images were taken with identical acquisition parameters and the fluorescent signals for each measurement was within the dynamic range. For these experiments, the 40× plan Apo objective was used with the pinhole completely open (optical section was about 12 μm) during image acquisition. For each treatment, we quantified the fluorescence of 50–100 cells using Metamorph 4.6. This method allowed us to measure the percentage of the internal cargo compared with the total (surface and internalized). Importantly, when we switched the secondary antibodies and used 594 GAM-IgG1 first to stain the surface receptor and then 488 GAM-IgG1 to label the internal receptor, the results obtained were similar (data not shown). In this analysis, cells expressing high levels of receptor (5-fold over that exhibited by an average cell) that gave a fluorescent signal above the dynamic range were not included (about 20–25% of the cells). Importantly, there was minimal overlap of “surface” and “internally” detected antibody when the cells were viewed by a thin confocal slice. Quantification of the Internalized Receptor with Radioligand Binding Studies—In the radioligand binding assays, 24 h after transfection with M3 receptor, the cells were split into 6-well plates. The next day, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with or without carbachol (1 mm) at different times (from 5 min to 60 min). After drug treatment, the cells were cooled on ice and washed three times with PBS (10-min incubation for each washing step). The loss of cell surface M3 receptor in the presence of carbachol compared with the control (without ligand) was detected by incubating the cells with the cell-impermeant muscarinic ligand [3H]NMS (2 nm) for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times (10-min incubation for each washing step) with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Then, the cells were scraped, and the extracts were transferred to a vial with scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was assessed as binding remaining in the presence of 10 mm atropine and was subtracted from all the samples. Receptor internalization was defined as the loss of binding of the cell-impermeant [3H]NMS after carbachol treatment compared with nontreated cells. Each experiment was done in triplicate and the experiment was repeated two additional times. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0b (GraphPad). GPCRs Display Constitutive and Agonist-dependent Internalization through CIE and CDE, Respectively—To study both constitutive and ligand-dependent GPCR endocytosis, we expressed and examined two GPCRs in HeLa cells, the β2-adrenergic receptor, and the M3 muscarinic receptor, which couple to Gs and Gq, respectively. These receptors were tagged at their extracellular, N termini with a triple HA tag allowing us to follow the internalization of the receptor into cells. Studies of GPCR trafficking and function typically employ expression of epitope-tagged receptors in a heterologous system due to the complexity of overlapping receptor subtypes in native systems (37Nathanson N.M. Pharmacol. Ther.. 2008; 119: 33-43Google Scholar). To determine and quantify the amount of internal cargo at different times of internalization, we used a single cell-based method. This method allows us to measure the percentage of the internalized receptor compared with the total receptor (surface and internalized) for each cell examined (we measured about 50–100 cells for each treatment; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). When we examined the trafficking of the β2 receptor using antibody internalization, β2 was internalized into cells in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1A). This constitutive internalization was apparent at 5 min and increased further at 30 min. Quantification of the internalized receptor revealed that about 10% of the initially bound material was inside the cell at 5 min and 20% at 30 min (Fig. 1C). The addition of agonist (1 mm Iso) increased the amount of β2 receptor internalized and this could be observed in fluorescence images (Fig. 1B). About 36% of surface β2 receptor was internalized in 5 min and 75% at 30 min (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar observations were made with the M3 receptor by imaging (not shown) and quantification of antibody internalization (see below). The amount of the GPCR internalized with ligand measured with the single cell-based method was more compared with the amount obtained using biochemical methods (supplemental Fig. S1 and see “Experimental Procedures” for details) or reported by other groups (38Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 3095-3104Google Scholar). One explanation for this is that biochemical assays measure total receptor internalization of all cells whereas our method of quantification excludes cells expressing very high levels of receptor. Thus biochemical methods could under estimate receptor internalization compared with the cell-based method we employed. To investigate if the constitutive internalization of the β2 and M3 receptors was a consequence of their basal activity or the presence of low concentration of ligand in the culture medium, we used the antagonists (inverse agonists) propranolol and atropine, respectively, to block this activity. Neither propranolol nor atropine affected the constitutive receptor internalization of β2 or M3 at 30 min (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine the pathway of constitutive internalization of β2 and M3 receptors, we compared the endocytosis of these receptors with two endogenous PM proteins, MHCI and TfR, that are internalized by CIE and CDE, respectively, using antibodies to MHCI and Alexa594-conjugated transferrin (Tf). At 5 min of internalization in the absence of agonist, β2 (Fig. 2A) and M3 (supplemental Fig. S3A) colocalized with MHCI but not with Tf on peripheral endosomal structures and on recycling tubular endosomes. The presence of M3 and β2 receptors on recycling tubular endosomes that colocalized with MHC I was especially pronounced in cells treated with inhibitors of actin polymerization (data not shown); such treatments block recycling of CIE cargo back to the PM (33Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol.. 1997; 139: 49-61Google Scholar, 34Weigert R. Yeung A.C. Li J. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3758-3770Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of agonist for 5 min, internalized β2 (Fig. 2B) and M3 (supplemental Fig. S3B) receptors colocalized with Tf and not with MHCI. Even at longer times with agonist (30 min), β2 and M3 did not localize to the recycling tubular endosomes (data not shown). We also found that constitutive internalization of β2 and M3 receptors was not inhibited by the inhibitory mutant of dynamin 2, K44A, whereas ligand-activated internalization was impaired (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that in the absence of ligand, both β2 and M3 internalized and colocalized with proteins that enter cells via a CIE pathway and then upon agonist stimulation, these receptors were found in compartments containing CDE cargo. Having observed a shift in endocytic pathways used by these receptors upon addition of ligand in fixed cells, we wished to examine this in living cells. β2R-GFP expressed in HeLa cells mostly localized to the PM, on internal vesicles and on endosomal recycling compartments of the CIE pathway (supplemental Fig. S4). To study the mechanism of internalization of this receptor, we imaged the internalization of Tf-594 in cells expressing a GFP-tagged version of the β2 receptor. Without agonist, β2R-GFP and Tf were not observed together during the 15-min incubation (Fig. 2C, and supplemental Movie S1). By contrast, in the presence of ligand, β2R-GFP, and endocytosed Tf were present together in the same endosome (Fig. 2D, and supplemental Movie S2). These results demonstrate that β2 and M3 traffic constitutively in the CIE pathway, and then, in the presence of agonist switch to the CDE pathway. Similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To confirm the differences between the constitutive and agonist-dependent GPCR endocytosis, we depleted clathrin from HeLa cells using siRNA. As shown by immunoblot and by immunofluorescence, clathrin was 85–90% depleted (supplemental Fig. S5) and we observed that endocytosis of Tf was blocked in cells depleted of clathrin (data not shown). Under these conditions, the constitutive internalization of β2 receptors was slightly inhibited by the depletion of clathrin (Fig. 3, A and C). By contrast, the agonist-dependent endocytosis of β2 was strongly affected by the knock-down of clathrin (Fig. 3, B and C). Endocytosis in the presence of the agonist was reduced in cells depleted of clathrin to the level observed for endocytosis in the absence of ligand. Similar to the β2 receptor, the constitutive internalization of the M3 receptor was largely unaffected by clathrin depletion whereas ligand stimulated internalization was inhibited (see below). These data show that GPCRs display constitutive and agonist-dependent internalization through clathrin-independent (CIE) and clathrin-dependent (CDE) endocytosis, respectively. Having demonstrated that β2 and M3 receptors constitutively internalize and recycle back to the PM along the CIE pathway, we decided to investigate if, over time, these receptors could reach late endosomal and lysosomal compartments for degradation. After 8 h of incubation in either the absence or presence of ligand at 37°, the β2 receptor localized to structures that labeled with Lamp1, a marker for lysosomes, indicating that this receptor could reach degradative compartments (supplemental Fig. S6). Similar observations were made for the M3 receptor (not shown). G Proteins (Gαs and Gαq) Associate with CIE Before and After Activation of the Cognate GPCR (β2R and M3R)—Most of the GPCR functions depend on the activation of specific heterotrimeric G proteins. Although GPCR ligand-dependent endocytosis has been studied extensively, much less is understood about the trafficking of G proteins. We analyzed the localization in HeLa cells of the endogenous G proteins Gαs and Gαq because they are activated by β2 and M3 receptors, respectively. It was shown previousl"
https://openalex.org/W2088240141,"The cell surfaces of microorganisms display distinct molecular patterns formed from lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, or β1,3-glucans. Binding of these surfaces by pattern recognition proteins such as β1,3-glucan recognition proteins (βGRPs) activates the immune response in arthropods. We identified a 40-kDa β1,3-glucan-binding protein with sequence similarity to previously characterized lepidopteran βGRPs from hemolymph, but unlike these it is secreted into the larval gut lumen and is an active β1,3-glucanase. This glucanase was not detected in hemolymph. Its mRNA is constitutively and predominantly expressed in the midgut and is induced there when larvae feed on a diet containing bacteria. Homologs of this predominantly midgut-expressed gene from many Lepidoptera possess key residues shown to be part of the active site of other glucanases, and form a cluster that is distinct from previously described βGRPs. In addition, this group includes proteins from insects such as the Anopheles gambiae GNBP subgroup B for which a catalytic role has not been previously suspected. The current domain classification does not distinguish between the catalytic and noncatalytic clades, and should be revised. The noncatalytic βGRPs may be evolutionarily derived from this newly described enzyme family that continues to function catalytically in digestion and/or pathogen defense. The cell surfaces of microorganisms display distinct molecular patterns formed from lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, or β1,3-glucans. Binding of these surfaces by pattern recognition proteins such as β1,3-glucan recognition proteins (βGRPs) activates the immune response in arthropods.

Recognition of invading organisms as non-self is a crucial pre-requisite for an immune response. In arthropods, immune response is triggered in the hemolymph by so-called pattern recognition proteins or receptors, which bind to classes of bacteria- and fungi-specific polysaccharides such as peptidoglycans, β1,3-glucans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), 3The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LTA, lipotechoic acid; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; proPO, prophenoloxidase; GNBP, Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein; βGRP, β1,3-glucan recognition protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcription. and lipotechoic acid (LTA) (1Kanost M.R.

Little detail is known for Lepidoptera but in Drosophila these binding interactions lead to activation of the innate immune response, largely regulated by two main pathways, the Toll and Imd pathways. The innate immune system contains of three main effector mechanisms: the cellular response, the humoral response, and melanization. The activation of the signaling pathways leads to a cascade of events that result in the induction of defensive genes in hemocytes and the fat body, including antimicrobial peptide genes (3Kim Y.S. Ryu J.H. Han S.J. Choi K.H. Nam K.B. Jang I.H. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 32721-32727Google Scholar), and also to the activation of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade. Phenoloxidase (PO) is an essential enzyme for the cellular immune responses (4Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev.. 2004; 198: 116-126Google Scholar) but is also involved in other developmental and defensive processes such as wound healing and sclerotization (1Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Yu X.Q. Immunol. Rev.. 2004; 198: 97-105Google Scholar). Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins (GNBPs) and β1,3-glucan recognition proteins (βGRPs) have been extensively studied as pattern recognition proteins in Lepidoptera (5Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2003; 33: 579-594Google Scholar, 6Jiang H. Ma C. Lu Z.Q. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 34: 89-100Google Scholar, 7Lee W.J. Lee J.D.

These proteins are produced in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph of the caterpillar. Some are constitutively present (5Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2003; 33: 579-594Google Scholar, 8Ma C. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 7505-7514Google Scholar), whereas others are induced upon microbial infection (6Jiang H. Ma C. Lu Z.Q. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 34: 89-100Google Scholar). Recognition of β1,3-glucans by these proteins appears to be due to two distinct β1,3-glucan-binding domains: a strongly binding N-terminal glucan recognition domain and a weakly binding C-terminal glucanase-like domain. Neither domain possesses β1,3-glucanase activity (11Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 26605-26611Google Scholar). The immune response has been extensively studied in Lepidoptera by introducing microbes into the hemocoel of laboratory-reared insects by mechanical wounding. However, because herbivorous lepidopteran larvae consume large amounts of plant material during their development, infection via food is very likely. The potential role of the midgut in triggering the immune response of herbivorous larvae has been poorly studied, but there is increasing evidence that it participates in this process. Freitak et al. (12Freitak D. Wheat C.W. Heckel D.G. Vogel H. BMC Biol.. 2007; 5: 56Google Scholar) showed that in larvae of Trichoplusia ni that were fed an artificial diet containing bacteria, several immune-related genes were up-regulated and immune-related proteins increased in concentration in the hemolymph. If the midgut were to play a role in sensing potentially invasive bacteria, one would expect to find pattern recognition proteins expressed in that tissue. Bacteria present in the Drosophila gut are thought to release peptidoglycan fragments that bind to specific PGRP (peptidoglycan recognition protein) receptors and induce the imd pathway (13Liehl P. Blight M. Vodovar N. Boccard F. Lemaitre B. PLoS Pathog.. 2006; 2: e56Google Scholar, 14Nehme N.T. Liegeois S. Kele B. Giammarinaro P. Pradel E. Hoffmann J.A. Ewbank J.J. Ferrandon D.

Yauk Y.K. Nain B. Wang Y.Y. Gleave A.P. Christeller J.T. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2007; 16: 675-690Google Scholar) described a sequence (EpGRP1) with similarity to β1,3-glucan-binding proteins from Anopheles gambiae and Bombyx mori in ESTs derived from the larval midgut of Epiphyas postvittana. In a proteomic study of the lumen contents of larval midgut of Helicoverpa armigera, we (17Pauchet Y. Muck A. Svatos A. Heckel D.G. Preiss S. J. Proteome Res.. 2008; 7: 1629-1639Google Scholar) discovered a similar protein that we named GH16betaGRP-1 (glycosyl hydrolase family 16, β-glucan recognition protein 1) secreted into the lumen. The full-length cDNA showed similarities to β1,3-glucan recognition proteins from the hemolymph of B. mori and Manduca sexta. Because β1,3-glucanase activity had not been previously reported from lepidopteran midguts, we suggested the possibility of an immune-related function. Here we describe the purification and characterization of GH16betaGRP-1 from the midgut lumen of H. armigera. The protein does indeed possess β1,3-glucanase activity and can account for the majority of such activity in the lumen. Thus we have renamed this protein as H. armigera β1,3-glucanase-1. The mRNA is predominantly expressed in the midgut, and the protein product is secreted into the lumen and persists stably there. Expression is increased when the insect feeds on a diet containing bacteria. We found similar sequences from a number of lepidopteran species derived from cDNAs generated from midgut tissue samples. These form a novel protein family that is characterized by a highly conserved signature sequence including two glutamate residues previously shown to be necessary for catalytic activity in other β1,3-glucanases (18Juncosa M. Pons J. Dot T. Querol E. Planas A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 14530-14535Google Scholar). This family is related to but distinct from a family of previously described βGRP/GNBP proteins primarily found in lepidopteran hemolymph, which do not possess this conserved site. Certain proteins from insects for which a catalytic role has not been suspected, including the A. gambiae GNBP subgroup B, belong to the catalytic clade and we suggest that the domain nomenclature be revised accordingly. These features suggest that lepidopteran larvae secrete an active β1,3-glucanase into the midgut lumen that may function in digestion of β1,3-glucans released by commensal or invading bacteria. Insects—The TWB strain of H. armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was collected from the vicinity of Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. Neonates were reared on a chemically defined diet containing only casein as the protein source and no plant-derived material, as described by Vanderzant (39Vanderzant E.S. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am.. 1968; 61: 120-125Google Scholar) at 26 °C with a 16:8 (light:dark) photoperiod. Sample Preparation—Gut lumen sample was prepared essentially as described by Pauchet et al. (17Pauchet Y. Muck A. Svatos A. Heckel D.G. Preiss S. J. Proteome Res.. 2008; 7: 1629-1639Google Scholar). Briefly, midguts were dissected from actively feeding second day fifth-instar larvae in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Peritrophic matrix containing the food bolus was pulled out of the midgut with forceps and gently homogenized by 10 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in PBS, pH 7.5, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) to release soluble proteins. After centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatant containing the gut lumen-soluble proteins was kept and protein concentration was determined using the Protein Dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Hemolymph was collected via lateral punctuation of abdominal part of larvae with micropipette. Collected hemolymph was immediately diluted with ice-cold N-phenylthiourea-saturated PBS containing protease inhibitors and hemocytes were removed by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Curdlan Pull-down Assay—Gut lumen and hemolymph samples (1 ml each) were incubated 30 min at 22 °C with 2.5 mg of curdlan (an insoluble β1,3-glucan isolated from Alcaligenes faecalis, Sigma). After centrifugation of the sample/curdlan mixture (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant corresponding to the unbound fraction was saved. The curdlan pellet was washed 5 times with PBS followed by 2 washes with PBS containing 1 m NaCl and finally 3 more times with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted from curdlan by boiling 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—This was done essentially as described by Pauchet et al. (17Pauchet Y. Muck A. Svatos A. Heckel D.G. Preiss S. J. Proteome Res.. 2008; 7: 1629-1639Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised manually from the SDS-PAGE gels and were destained, trypsinized, and extracted using an Ettan TA Digester running the Digester Version 1.10 software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB). Trypsin digestion was carried out overnight with 50 ng of porcine trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C. First step analysis of the tryptic peptides was done using a MALDImicro MX mass spectrometer (Waters) used in reflectron mode and was calibrated using a tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin (MPrep, Waters). The MALDI-TOF spectra searches were performed with the Protein Lynx Global Server software, version 2.2 (PLGS 2.2, Waters), against the NCBI_insecta data base (downloaded on 15 March 2008 from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/database, 372,057 entries). The search parameters were as follows: peptide tolerance of 80 ppm, one missed cleavage, carbamidomethyl modification of cysteines, and possible Met oxidation. An estimated calibration error of 0.05 D and a minimum of four peptide matches were the criteria for obtaining positive data base hits. The MALDI-TOF peptide signal intensities were used to estimate the volume of the remaining sample to be used for the subsequent nanoLC-MS/MS de novo sequence analysis. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed to acquire fragmentation data from selected peptides. Aliquots of tryptic peptides were injected on a CapLC XE 2D nanoLC system (Waters). After concentration and desalting, eluted peptides were transferred to the NanoElectroSpray source of a Q-TOF Ultima tandem mass spectrometer (Waters). MS/MS spectra were collected by MassLynx version 4.0 software (Waters). ProteinLynx Global Server Browser version 2.2 software (PLGS 2.2, Waters) was used for baseline subtraction and smoothing, deisotoping, and de novo peptide sequence identification. Using PLGS 2.2, CID spectra were interpreted de novo to yield peptide sequences. Sequences with a ladder score (percentage of expected y- and b-ions) exceeding 30 were then used in a homology-based search strategy using the MS BLAST program (19Shevchenko A. Sunyaev S. Loboda A. Bork P. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anal. Chem.. 2001; 73: 1917-1926Google Scholar). MS BLAST was developed to utilize redundant, degenerate, and partly inaccurate peptide sequences in similarity searches of protein databases that may be derived from organisms phylogenetically distant from the study species. The WU-BLAST2 BLASTP search engine is employed with parameter values that disallow gaps within a peptide, and that score only the most significant match in the case of several peptide candidates covering the same region in the target sequence. In addition, the PAM30MS matrix that accounts for the inability to distinguish Ile and Leu residues, and allows for unknown residues X, is used in the blastp similarity search (19Shevchenko A. Sunyaev S. Loboda A. Bork P. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anal. Chem.. 2001; 73: 1917-1926Google Scholar). Scoring of the significance of peptide matches is not based on E or p values of the individual HSPs (high-scoring segment pairs) but instead on pre-computed threshold scores conditional on the number of query peptides and HSP hits. The color-coded output produced by the MS BLAST script identifies in red those target sequences with scores exceeding 99% of queries utilizing randomized peptide sequences by chance. Computational studies have estimated a false positive rate of <3% (20Habermann B. Oegema J. Sunyaev S. Shevchenko A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics.. 2004; 3: 238-249Google Scholar). We installed an in-house MS BLAST server for searching NCBI_insecta and a locally generated EST data base from H. armigera midgut and fat body cDNA libraries (5,685 protein sequences). Additional information on MS BLAST statistics and scoring can be found in Shevchenko et al. (19Shevchenko A. Sunyaev S. Loboda A. Bork P. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anal. Chem.. 2001; 73: 1917-1926Google Scholar). β-Glucanase Activity Assays—Lichenan, barley β-glucan, and carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulose were from Sigma. CM-curdlan, endo-β1,3-glucanase from Trichoderma sp. and cellulase from Trichoderma sp. were both from Megazyme. Plate assays were performed on 1.5% agar Petri dishes containing 0.25% of each substrate in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Wells within plates were made by puncturing the agar with a plastic pipette and removing the agar plug by suction. Two and a half-micrograms of gut lumen proteins in 2.5 μl of PBS were tested together with 2.5 μl of PBS as negative control, and 1 μl of a 100 times diluted solution of each endo-β1,3-glucanase and cellulase as positive controls. After 16 h incubation at 37 °C, activity was revealed by staining with Congo Red (0.1% (w/v) in water) for 30 min and destaining with 1 m NaCl also for 30 min. Plates were scanned using a GS800 densitometer (Bio-Rad). For zymograms, samples were resolved by native PAGE using 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Ready Gels, Bio-Rad) and Tris glycine, pH 8.3, as running buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 60 min at 4 °C. After the run, gels were washed 3 times for 15 min in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, before being overlaid on a CM-curdlan plate prepared as described above. Incubation and Congo Red staining/destaining were performed as described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—The Ha_GH16betaGRP-1 cDNA was amplified from a H. armigera larval midgut cDNA library clone using primers GRP1-F (5′-GCCACCATGTGGTCGGTGTTAGCGGGCGTG-3′) and GRP1-R (5′-CAAAGCCCAAATGCGAACGTAGTC-3′) and was inserted in pIB/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) by TA cloning according to the supplier's instructions. Positive clones were selected and correct insertion was confirmed by sequencing. T. ni High Five cells (Invitrogen) were cultured at 27 °C in Express Five serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were transfected in 90-mm diameter Petri dishes with 12 μg of plasmid DNA using Insect Gene Juice (Novagen) as transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, culture medium was saved and the cells were detached from the plate and pelleted by centrifugation. After two washes with PBS, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Six cycles of freezing and thawing were performed to lyze the cells. Crude membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in cold PBS/Complete. Expression was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Invitrogen). Preparation of cDNA Libraries—TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from whole larvae or dissected tissues according to the manufacturer's protocol. After DNase treatment, total RNA were further purified by using the RNeasy MinElute Clean up Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ mRNA were purified by binding to an oligo(dT) column (RNA Purist, Ambion). The generation of T. ni whole larvae cDNA library has been described in Freitak et al. (12Freitak D. Wheat C.W. Heckel D.G. Vogel H. BMC Biol.. 2007; 5: 56Google Scholar). Generation of Plutella xylostella, Pieris rapae, Colias eurytheme, Anthoracharis cardamines, and Delias nigrina has been described in Fischer et al. (21Fischer H.M. Wheat C.W. Heckel D.G. Vogel H. Mol. Biol. Evol.. 2008; 25: 809-820Google Scholar). For H. armigera midgut and fat body and Spodoptera littoralis whole larvae, normalized, full-length enriched cDNA libraries were generated using a combination of the SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech) and the Trimmer-Direct cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen) generally following the manufacturer's protocol but with several important modifications. In brief, 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was used for each cDNA library generated. Reverse transcription was performed with a mixture of several reverse transcription enzymes for 1 h at 42 °C and 90 min at 50°C. cDNA size fractionation was performed with SizeSep 400 spun columns (GE Healthcare) that resulted in a cutoff at ∼200 bp. The full-length enriched cDNAs were cut with SfiI and ligated to pDNR-Lib plasmid (Clontech). Ligations were transformed into Escherichia coli ELECTROMAX DH5α-E electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen). Generation of EST Databases—Plasmid minipreparation from bacterial colonies grown in 96 deep-well plates was performed using the 96-robot plasmid isolation kit (Eppendorf) on a Tecan Evo Freedom 150 robotic platform (Tecan). Single-pass sequencing of the 5′ termini of cDNA libraries was carried out on an ABI 3730 xl automatic DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Vector clipping, quality trimming, and sequence assembly was done with the Lasergene software package (DNAStar Inc.). Blast searches were conducted on a local server using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) blastall program. Protein domains were determined by searching the NCBI Conserved Domain Data base (CDD). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW software (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res.. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar). BAC Library Screening and Sequencing—H. armigera BAC library nylon filters were washed, blocked, and hybridized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled DNA fragments containing part of the GH16betaGRP-1 gene. Labeling, hybridization, and probe detection were done according to specifications in the ECL DNA labeling and detection kit (GE Healthcare). Positive clones were isolated from glycerol stocks, grown in Terrific Broth, and BAC DNA was isolated with the Nucleobond Xtra Midi Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Macherey-Nagel). BAC Genomic DNA quantity was measured spectrophotometrically on a Nanodrop ND1000 and all of the positive clones were digested with EcoRI and HindIII to identify clone diversity and redundant inserts, blotted, and re-hybridized to verify positive inserts. The BAC DNA was sheared into two different size ranges (1–1.5 kb and 4–5 kb) with a Hydroshear device (Molecular Devices), blunted with the Quick Blunting Kit (New England Biolabs), isolated from an agarose gel, column purified, and ligated into the pUC19-SmaI vector (Fermentas). Ligations were transformed into E. coli ELECTROMAX DH5α-E electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid preparation, sequencing, and assembly were performed as mentioned above. Feeding Assays—Fifteen early fifth-instar H. armigera larvae were fed for 24 h on an artificial pinto bean-based diet soaked with overnight liquid culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Micrococcus luteus, or E. coli. Alternatively, larvae were fed on an artificial diet soaked in solutions containing either β-glucans (0.25% w/v) or bacterial cell wall polysaccharides (LTA or LPS, 0.05% w/v). Larvae fed on a sterile artificial diet were used as a control group. Three times 5 larvae per diet were used for detecting diet-induced changes in GH16betaGRP-1 expression in midgut tissue. Experiments were repeated 3 times with different patches of eggs. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from dissected insect midguts, salivary glands, fat bodies, and the remainder of bodies (except head capsules) according to the method described above. Five hundred nanograms of DNA-free total RNA was converted into single-stranded cDNA using a mixture of random and oligo(dT)20 primers according to the ABgene protocol (ABgene). As an endogenous control gene, large ribosomal protein 1 (Lrp1) was used (forward primer: 5′-CACATCAGCAAACACATCACC and reverse primer: 5′-AGAAGTGAGAGCCGTGTGAAA). Gene-specific primers were designed on the basis of sequence obtained for the GH16betaGRP-1 gene (forward primer: 5′-CTGGATCAGAAGGAACACTGC and reverse primer: 5′-TACACGTCCCAGTTCCAAGTC). Quantitative RT-PCR was done in optical 96-well plates on a MX3000P Real-time PCR Detection System (Stratagene) using the Absolute QPCR SYBR green Mix (ABgene) to monitor double-stranded DNA synthesis in combination with ROX as a passive reference dye included in the PCR master mix. Phylogenetic Analysis—Genes were aligned by their amino acid sequences using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program (23Katoh K. Misawa K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2002; 30: 3059-3066Google Scholar). The amino acid alignment was then used for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic reconstruction was done by Bayesian inference using Mr. Bayes 3.1 (24Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics.. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Google Scholar). The prior was set for the amino acid models to mix, thereby allowing model jumping between fixed-rate amino acid models. Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs were carried out for 1,000,000 generations after which log likelihood values showed that equilibrium had been reached after the first 400 generations in all cases, and those data were discarded from each run and considered as “burnin.” Two runs were conducted for the dataset showing agreement in topology and likelihood scores. Phylogenetic analysis was furthermore, performed using the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method (TREECON) based on the MAFFT alignments. Distance calculations were performed after Tajima & Nei and bootstrap analysis, running 1000 bootstrap samples. The Neighbor joining and the Bayesian tree topologies including their general subfamily relationships and node supports were in agreement. A β1,3-Glucan-binding Protein from H. armigera Larval Midgut—Midgut lumen contents of unchallenged H. armigera larvae were screened for glucan-binding proteins using curdlan, an insoluble β1,3-glucan isolated from the Gram-negative bacterium A. faecalis, as an affinity matrix in pull-down assays. The bound fraction was freed from the matrix by boiling and after SDS-PAGE, a single main protein band (apparent molecular mass 40 kDa) was detected along with trace amounts of other proteins (Fig. 1A). The peptide mass fingerprint of this main protein band by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis exactly matched the cDNA sequence of H. armigera GH16betaGRP-1 (ABU98621.1, supplementary Fig. S1) showing that this previously identified protein, which had been named on the basis of sequence similarity to other Lepidopteran proteins, was the main β1,3-glucan-binding protein in the larval midgut lumen. Expression patterns of this gene in different tissues were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). The expression level was very high in larval midgut; much lower but detectable in salivary glands, hemocytes, and the fat body; and undetectable in the rest of the larval body tissue. Glucan-binding protein has β1,3-Glucanase Activity—We screened for glucanase activity in H. armigera larval midgut lumen contents by plate assays on carbohydrate polymers followed by staining of any remaining polymer with Congo Red (Fig. 2A). The only tested substrate that was degraded by the lumen sample was CM-curdlan, which contains exclusively β1,3-glucan linkages. Neither cellulose (exclusively β1,4-linkages) nor lichenan and barley β-glucan (with mixed β1,3- and β1,4-linkages) were degraded by the lumen sample. The latter two substrates could be partially degraded by fungal enzymes specific for β1,3-glucans or β1,4-glucans. However, the lumen sample was incapable of degrading the β1,3-glucan linkages in the lichenan or barley β-glucan (Fig. 2A). To investigate the correlation between β1,3-glucan binding and glucanase activity, an untreated gut lumen sample was compared with the flow-through from the curdlan pull-down assay by native PAGE followed by an overlay with CM-curdlan and staining with Congo Red (Fig. 2B). Although the resolution of the zymogram was poor, a broad band indicating activity could be detected only in the untreated sample, whereas no activity was detected in the flow-through. The broad activity band is likely due to the major band seen in Fig. 1A after the curdlan pull-down, which is poorly resolved on the native gel; although a contribution of some of the fainter bands in Fig. 1A cannot be completely ruled out. To further test whether the glucan-binding protein itself could be responsible for this β1,3-glucanase activity, its coding sequence fused to a C-terminal V5/(His)6 tag was transiently expressed in High Five insect cells (Fig. 2C). Using the anti-V5 antibody in a Western blot, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa was detected in the culture medium of transfected High Five cells, and a lesser amount was associated with the crude membrane fraction. The increase in apparent molecular mass of about 4 kDa between the gut lumen form of the protein and its recombinant form expressed in insect cells is due to the V5/(His)6 tag. A zymogram using CM-curdlan as substrate revealed a single activity band in the culture medium of cells transfected with the protein construct but not with empty vector (Fig. 2D). These results show that the protein that we had named GH16betaGRP-1 is an active β1,3-glucanase and suggest that the activity detected in the gut lumen is mainly due to this protein. We thus rename this protein as β1,3-glucanase-1 from H. armigera. Induction"

Although PERK activity leads to cellular adaptation to ER stress, we now demonstrate that PERK activity also inhibits the ER stress-induced apoptotic program through the induction of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2) proteins. This induction of IAPs occurs through both transcriptional and translational responses that are PERK dependent. Reintroduction of cIAP1 or cIAP2 expression into PERK-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts during ER stress delays the early onset of ER stress-induced caspase activation and apoptosis observed in these cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway by ER stress is dependent on PERK, suggesting additional ways in which PERK activity protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2100090498,"Blood coagulation often accompanies bacterial infections and sepsis and is generally accepted as a consequence of immune responses. Though many bacterial species can directly activate individual coagulation factors, they have not been shown to directly initiate the coagulation cascade that precedes clot formation. Here we demonstrated, using microfluidics and surface patterning, that the spatial localization of bacteria substantially affects coagulation of human and mouse blood and plasma. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax-causing pathogen, directly initiated coagulation of blood in minutes when bacterial cells were clustered. Coagulation of human blood by B. anthracis required secreted zinc metalloprotease InhA1, which activated prothrombin and factor X directly (not via factor XII or tissue factor pathways). We refer to this mechanism as 'quorum acting' to distinguish it from quorum sensing--it does not require a change in gene expression, it can be rapid and it can be independent of bacterium-to-bacterium communication."
https://openalex.org/W2081467800,"Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase required for cell migration, proliferation and survival. FAK overexpression has been documented in diverse human cancers and is associated with a poor clinical outcome. Recently, a novel bis-anilino pyrimidine inhibitor, TAE226, was reported to efficiently inhibit FAK signaling, arrest tumor growth and invasion and prolong the life of mice with glioma or ovarian tumor implants. Here we describe the crystal structures of the FAK kinase bound to TAE226 and three related bis-anilino pyrimidine compounds. TAE226 induces a conformation of the N-terminal portion of the kinase activation loop that is only observed in FAK, but is distinct from the conformation in both the active and inactive states of the kinase. This conformation appears to require a glycine immediately N-terminal to the “DFG motif”, which adopts a helical conformation stabilized by interactions with TAE226. The presence of a glycine residue in this position contributes to the specificity of TAE226 and related compounds for FAK. Our work highlights the fact that kinases can access conformational space that is not necessarily utilized for their native catalytic regulation, and that such conformations can explain and be exploited for inhibitor specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2028478497,"NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) is a regulatory protein essential to the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, notably involved in immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and oncogenesis.

The classical NF-κB signaling pathway is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, TNF-α), 5The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; IKK, IκB kinase; WT, wild type; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; ZF, zinc finger; LZ, leucine zipper; UBZ, ubiquitin-binding ZF; UBD, ubiquitin-binding domain; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; polyUb, polyubiquitin; pol, polymerase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; CC, coiled-coil. antigens, and endotoxins. Although different receptors and downstream molecules are engaged depending on the stimulus, they all transduce signals through the IKK complex. These active complexes comprise two catalytic kinase subunits, IKKα and/or IKKβ, and a dimer of regulatory subunits termed NEMO, which is required for IKK complex activity and subsequent NF-κB activation (2Fontan E. Traincard F. Levy S.G. Yamaoka S. Veron M. Agou F. FEBS J.. 2007; 274: 2540-2551Google Scholar, 3Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 36320-36326Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of NEMO interacts with the IKK kinases, whereas the regulatory C-terminal half is involved in signal recognition (4Hacker H. Karin M. Science's STKE.. 2006; 2006: re13Google Scholar, 5Sebban H. Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Trends Cell Biol... 2006; 16: 569-577Google Scholar). The latter comprises the CC2-LZ domain, including a coiled-coil (CC2) and a leucine zipper (LZ) motif and a CCHC-type zinc finger (ZF) domain (Fig. 1). The CC2-LZ domain is required for NEMO oligomerization (6Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 27861-27869Google Scholar, 7Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell.

Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 22: 245-257Google Scholar, 9Wu C.J. Conze D.B. Li T. Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Cell Biol... 2006; 8: 398-406Google Scholar). Lys-63-polyUb binding through the CC2-LZ domain of NEMO is required for NF-κB signaling from several different receptors. In the case of TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1), the IKK complex seems to be recruited to the TNFR1 receptor via interaction with Lys-63-polyubiquitinated RIP1 protein (8Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G.

In addition to binding Lys-63-polyUb, a minor fraction of NEMO undergoes ubiquitination (post-translational modification via the covalent attachment of ubiquitin) within the regulatory portion of NEMO. Several monoubiquitination and Lys-63-polyubiquitination sites on NEMO have been identified, including a Lys-399 residue in the ZF domain (10Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature.. 2004; 427: 167-171Google Scholar), and the site of modification and its impact on IKK activity appear to be signal-dependent (11Abbott D.W. Wilkins A. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol... 2004; 14: 2217-2227Google Scholar, 12Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. Cell.. 2003; 115: 565-576Google Scholar, 13Tang E.D. Wang C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 37297-37305Google Scholar). Although the CC2-LZ domain of NEMO is required for a wide range of NF-κB-inducing signals, the role of the NEMO ZF domain remains controversial (14Temmerman S.T. Ma C.A. Borges L. Kubin M. Liu S. Derry J.M. Jain A. Blood.. 2006; 108: 2324-2331Google Scholar, 15Yang F. Yamashita J. Tang E. Wang H.L. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol... 2004; 172: 2446-2452Google Scholar) and appears to depend on the stimulus. Several studies reported that NEMO ZF is required for interleukin-1 and TNF-α but not lipopolysaccharide-induced signaling (16Huang T.T. Feinberg S.L. Suryanarayanan S. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 22: 5813-5825Google Scholar, 17Makris C. Roberts J.L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 22: 6573-6581Google Scholar). On the other hand, a clear requirement for ZF in the genotoxic stress response has been established (12Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. Cell.. 2003; 115: 565-576Google Scholar, 18Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. J. Mol. Med... 2007; 85: 1187-1202Google Scholar). This distinct pathway is activated by UV radiation and other DNA-damaging agents and involves import of NEMO into the nucleus, where it interacts with the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) checkpoint kinase. The importance of NEMO ZF is also emphasized by the fact that (i) several mutations in the ZF are linked to the human diseases, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency and incontinentia pigmenti (19Fusco F. Pescatore A. Bal E. Ghoul A. Paciolla M. Lioi M.B. D'Urso M. Rabia S.H. Bodemer C. Bonnefont J.P. Munnich A. Miano M.G. Smahi A. Ursini M.V. Hum. Mutat... 2008; 29: 595-604Google Scholar), and that (ii) mice lacking the NEMO ZF die during embryonic development (20Nenci A. Pasparakis M. Israel A. Baltimore D. Ben-Neriah Y.M. NF-κB: 20 Years on the Road from Biochemistry to Pathology. Keystone Symposia, Banff, Canada2006: 84Google Scholar). We recently determined the solution structure of NEMO ZF (21Cordier F. Vinolo E. Veron M. Delepierre M. Agou F. J. Mol. Biol... 2008; 377: 1419-1432Google Scholar), which highlighted the importance of a large hydrophobic cluster sharing similarities with the ubiquitin-interacting region of the ubiquitin-binding ZF (UBZ) of the human DNA Y-polymerase (pol) η (22Bomar M.G. Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Li S.S. Zhou P. EMBO Rep... 2007; 8: 247-251Google Scholar). Because UBDs are usually found in multiple copies in proteins, the question arises whether NEMO ZF could actually act as a second ubiquitin-binding site, in addition to the CC2-LZ domain. We show here, using NMR, fluorescence, mutagenesis, and in vivo pull-down experiments, that NEMO ZF is a bona fide UBD of the UBZ type. We have investigated the ZF-ubiquitin interaction, proposed a model of the complex, and further showed that ZF residues involved in ubiquitin binding are functionally important and required for NF-κB signaling in response to TNF-α. Sample Preparation—NEMO ZF synthetic peptides (>98% purity) termini-blocked by N-acetyl and C-amide groups were purchased from Biopeptide Co. (San Diego, CA). Five different peptides were used in this study; ZF corresponds to 2 Ser residues followed by residues 394–419 of human NEMO. In ZF(W), Phe-395 is replaced by a tryptophan. ZF(W)-M407V, ZF(W)-V414S, and ZF(W)-M415S are three point mutant peptides of ZF(W). The sequences are given in supplemental Fig. S1. For binding assays, each of the four ZF(W) peptides was solubilized in a buffer of 0.6 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a stock concentration of ∼0.2 mm. Recombinant human ubiquitin and the I44A ubiquitin mutant were purchased from Boston Biochem at >95% purity. Ubiquitin was further purified by cation exchange column, dialyzed in water, lyophilized, and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). For NMR, 1.7 mm of the ZF was prepared by dissolving 2.8 mg of peptide in 500 μl of 3.4 mm ZnCl2, 3.4 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 90% H2O, 10% D2O (pH 6.2). The U-15N-labeled human ubiquitin was purchased from VLI Research Inc. (Malvern, PA), and a 1 mm stock solution was prepared in exactly the same buffer as the ZF. Three NMR samples of ZF-ubiquitin complex were successively prepared at concentrations (ratio) of 1.45:0.15 mm (r = 9.7), 0.87:0.15 mm (r = 5.8), and 0.24:0.15 mm (r = 1.6). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra were recorded with 200 (90 ms) and 1024 (122 ms) complex points (acquisition times) in 15N and 1H, respectively. Average (1H, 15N) chemical shift changes upon binding were calculated as Δδav = [(ΔδH)2 + (ΔδN/5)2]½. The binding affinity (KD) was estimated by fitting the ZF titration data, assuming a simple complex formation model and using nonlinear regression. 15N relaxation data (T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE) were acquired by standard methods (23Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson... 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). Docking—The docking was performed with HADDOCK 1.3 (24Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2003; 125: 1731-1737Google Scholar), with initial coordinates of NEMO ZF and ubiquitin taken from their structure in free form (Protein Data Bank entries 2JVX and 1D3Z, respectively) and by using 16 ambiguous interaction restraints. The latter were defined on the basis of the NMR chemical shift mapping, surface accessibility data, and the homology with the pol η UBZ signature motif. Binding Affinity—Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were recorded on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorimeter (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) at 22 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm to minimize the contribution of the tyrosyl group. The fluorescence emission at 352 nm was measured using 20 μm peptide and 20–500 μm ubiquitin. The observed fluorescence (Fobs) was corrected for dilution and for fluorescence from ubiquitin alone. Data for the ZF(W) peptide were fitted by nonlinear regression using the equation (Fobs - F0) = (Fmax - F0) [L]/(KD + [L]) to solve the maximum fluorescence (Fmax) and the dissociation constant (KD), given [L] (ligand concentration), F0 (fluorescence in the absence of ligand), and Fobs. The KD for ZF(W) mutant peptides was estimated using the Fmax value obtained for ZF(W). For ZF peptide folding experiments, ZF peptide stocks, prepared in the presence or absence of ZnCl2, were diluted to 20 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The emission spectra (305–415 nm) for these peptides were recorded, the buffer contribution was subtracted, and the fluorescence quantum yields were determined using N-acetyl tryptophanamide (Sigma) as standard as described previously (25Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 14643-14650Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—A pcDNA3 vector encoding FLAG-tagged human NEMO protein (residues 2–419) was used to generate five NEMO mutant constructs, including point mutants M407V, Q411R, V414S, and M415S and a NEMO ZF deletion (ΔZF). Substitutions were chosen conservatively, so as not to perturb the overall structure of the ZF domain. The point mutations were generated using overlap PCR. The primer sequences used for PCR are available upon request. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. A NEMO construct lacking 25 C-terminal residues (ΔZF) was generated using PCR introducing a stop codon after residue 394. The PCR product was digested and cloned as described above. Functional Complementation Experiments—4 × 106 NEMO-/- Jurkat T cells (JM4.5.2) (26Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Google Scholar) were transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG (empty or with various NEMO constructs), 1 μg of Igκ-luciferase, and 300 ng of β-galactosidase plasmids using DEAE-dextran as described previously (27Vinolo E. Sebban H. Chaffotte A. Israel A. Courtois G. Veron M. Agou F. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 6334-6348Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 4 h and then harvested. Luciferase activity in soluble cell extracts was measured as described (27Vinolo E. Sebban H. Chaffotte A. Israel A. Courtois G. Veron M. Agou F. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 6334-6348Google Scholar). β-galactosidase activity was measured using the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit (Clontech) according to manufacturer's instructions. The level of luciferase, representing NF-κB activity, was normalized to the level of β-galactosidase, representing transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—293T cells, grown in 6-well dishes, were transfected with 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 3 μg of pcDNA-FLAG plasmid (empty or with various NEMO constructs) and harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol (for Western blot analysis) or in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 (for immunoprecipitation). FLAG-NEMO was immunoprecipitated using the FLAG immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FLAG-NEMO proteins were detected using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-NEMO (antibody B24, homemade) antibodies, and ubiquitin was detected using anti-ubiquitin (antibody 6C1, Sigma) antibody. NEMO ZF Binds Ubiquitin—The binding of a NEMO ZF synthetic peptide (see the sequence in supplemental Fig. S1) to ubiquitin was probed by NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. The 1H and 15N chemical shifts of several ubiquitin residues vary gradually from the free (Fig. 2A, black) to the bound state (red) upon the addition of ZF, as typically observed for a complex in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Significant average chemical shift changes (Δδav) or attenuations of peak intensities are observed for a number of residues (Fig. 2B), thus identifying the binding surface on ubiquitin. Most of these residues are spatially located around Leu-8, Ile-44, and Val-70, i.e. on the conserved hydrophobic region of the five-stranded β-sheet of ubiquitin typically recognized by UBDs (28Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 6: 610-621Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4C). Backbone dynamics from 15N relaxation measurements (T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE) were evaluated for the free and ZF-bound state of ubiquitin (Fig. 2C). Isotropic rotational correlation times, estimated from the T1/T2 ratios of nonflexible residues, are 4.3 and 6.3 ns for the free and bound ubiquitin, respectively. Despite the small difference, these values are in good agreement with theoretical values of ∼4.1 and ∼5.7 ns expected for globular molecules with respective molecular masses of 8.5 and 11.8 kDa, suggesting the formation of a 1:1 complex. Overall, the internal mobility of ubiquitin is not significantly affected by peptide binding, with rather uniform and unchanged T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE profiles. This denotes the formation of a stable complex, although slightly more conformational exchange can be detected on the microsecond to millisecond time scale, especially for residues Phe-4, Thr-7, Ile-13, Thr-14, Gln-41, Arg-42, Lys-48, Gln-49, His-68, Val-70, Leu-71, and Arg-72 in the five-stranded β-sheet, as seen from their relatively lower T2 values in the bound state.FIGURE 4Model of the NEMO ZF-ubiquitin complex.

The buried surface area is 1014 ± 55 Å2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding affinity (KD) of the ZF-ubiquitin complex was estimated to be ∼280 ± 90 μm by NMR. Because we observed the presence of peptide aggregates at high ZF concentration (21Cordier F. Vinolo E. Veron M. Delepierre M. Agou F. J. Mol. Biol... 2008; 377: 1419-1432Google Scholar), we confirmed this affinity by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, using a synthetic peptide containing the F395W substitution, denoted as ZF(W) (see the sequence in supplemental Fig. S1). This substitution does not affect the ability of ZF(W) to properly fold upon the addition of zinc (Fig. 3B). As seen in Fig. 3A, an increase in fluorescence signal is observed during ubiquitin titration (filled circles), corresponding to a KD of 253 ± 15 μm, which is within the range reported for other UBDs (10–500 μm) (28Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 6: 610-621Google Scholar). Note that the KD value from fluorescence data is in agreement with the one estimated by NMR, indicating that the F395W substitution does not markedly affect the interaction. Ubiquitin containing the I44A mutation does not bind ZF(W) (filled triangle), showing that the increase in fluorescence is due to the formation of a specific NEMO ZF-ubiquitin complex and that residue Ile-44 is crucial for binding to NEMO ZF. Structural Model of the NEMO ZF-Ubiquitin Complex—In the ββα structure of NEMO ZF, a large hydrophobic cluster encompassing the hydrophobic side of the α-helix was anticipated to be a potential protein-binding surface (21Cordier F. Vinolo E. Veron M. Delepierre M. Agou F. J. Mol. Biol... 2008; 377: 1419-1432Google Scholar). As seen on Fig. 4A, this region shares similarities with other ubiquitin-binding helices, notably with that of the pol η UBZ domain (22Bomar M.G. Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Li S.S. Zhou P. EMBO Rep... 2007; 8: 247-251Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, with the inverted ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) of Rabex-5 (29Lee S. Tsai Y.C. Mattera R. Smith W.J. Kostelansky M.S. Weissman A.M. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol... 2006; 13: 264-271Google Scholar, 30Penengo L. Mapelli M. Murachelli A.G. Confalonieri S. Magri L. Musacchio A. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Schneider T.R. Cell.. 2006; 124: 1183-1195Google Scholar). Key residues at positions -7, -4, -3, -1, and +3 that are important for binding are conserved in NEMO ZF, whereas the central invariant Ala (position 0) is replaced by a Met. The binding interfaces on NEMO ZF (Fig. 4B) and on ubiquitin (Fig. 4C) were therefore defined according to the sequence homology with the UBZ motif and to the NMR chemical shift perturbation data, respectively. On the basis of these two interfaces, we determined a docking model of the ZF-ubiquitin complex (Fig. 4D), using the HADDOCK program (24Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2003; 125: 1731-1737Google Scholar). We found that the hydrophobic side of the ZF α-helix interacts with the typically recognized hydrophobic region around Ile-44 of ubiquitin in a similar manner as the UBZ α-helix (see Fig. 3D of Ref. 22Bomar M.G. Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Li S.S. Zhou P. EMBO Rep... 2007; 8: 247-251Google Scholar). Differences are, however, evident in the overall binding mode of the zinc fingers. Notably, the 4-residue shift observed from the relative position of the last 2 zinc-chelating residues in the sequence alignment translates into a shift of the NEMO helix by more than one turn into the ubiquitin C terminus direction and leads to a slightly different orientation of the finger with respect to ubiquitin. These differences are in agreement with the fact that the α-helix in NEMO ZF is shorter than in the pol η UBZ by about one helical turn. The interaction between ubiquitin and NEMO ZF leads to a buried surface area of 1014 ± 55 Å2 and is largely driven by hydrophobic forces, involving all or part of the side chains of Gln-411, Ile-412, Val-414, Met-415, and Ile-418 of the ZF and notably the ubiquitin residues Leu-8, Ile-44, and Val-70. In the pol η UBZ, the mutation of the central invariant Ala into a Phe was shown to abolish binding. However, in NEMO ZF, the residue Met-415 at the equivalent position inserts perfectly into the hydrophobic cleft formed by Leu-8, Ile-44, His-68, and Val-70, suggesting local differences between the pol η UBZ and the NEMO ZF around this position. In addition to these numerous hydrophobic contacts, the side chains of Asp-408 and Gln-411 at positions -7 and -4, respectively, likely contribute to the binding by allowing the formation of hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide or carbonyl groups of the loop residues Ala-46 to Lys-48 of ubiquitin, in a similar way as the corresponding Glu and Asp residues in the pol η UBZ. To validate our model of the NEMO ZF-ubiquitin complex, we examined the ability of three modified ZF(W) peptides to interact with ubiquitin using fluorescence. In addition to the F395W substitution, these ZF(W) peptides contain the point mutation M407V (identified in a patient with the incontinentia pigmenti pathology (31Smahi A. Courtois G. Vabres P.

The ZF(W)-M407V and ZF(W)-M415S peptides show an ∼4-fold decrease in binding affinity, and ZF(W)-V414S displays the greatest defect, with a complete loss in ubiquitin binding (Fig. 3A). Note that the fluorescence quantum yields in the presence of zinc are similar for all peptides, indicating that the reduced binding affinity of these peptides is not due to a global perturbation of the NEMO ZF fold (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S1). These mutagenesis results are fully consistent with our model, attesting that residues Val-414 and Met-415, which lay on the central hydrophobic part of the interface, are crucial for ubiquitin binding. Furthermore, the reduced binding affinity observed for the pathogenic M407V mutant likely results from the loss of peripheral hydrophobic contacts between the long Met-407 side chain and Lys-48 (Fig. 4D). Biological Relevance of the NEMO ZF-Ubiquitin Interaction in Vivo—Next, we addressed the question whether the interaction between NEMO ZF and ubiquitin is important for NF-κB activation. Using the full-length protein, we investigated whether ZF mutations located at the binding interface (M407V, Q411R, V414S, and M415S) are able to restore NF-κB activation in NEMO-deficient T-lymphocytes using an NF-κB-inducible luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of NEMO-expressing plasmids does not lead to a significant increase in luciferase activity in the absence of TNF-α (data not shown). On the other hand, stimulation with TNF-α leads to a 60-fold increase in activity in NEMO WT-expressing cells (set at 100%) as compared with empty plasmid (mock) control (Fig. 5A). All NEMO mutant constructs display a defect in NF-κB signaling to varying extents, M407V being the least severe (50% activity as compared with WT). Most notably, NEMO point mutations V414S and M415S are just as inefficient in activating NF-κBas the ΔZF construct (∼5% residual activity). The inability to stimulate NF-κB signaling in these cells is not due to altered NEMO protein expression or solubility because all NEMO proteins are detected at similar levels upon transfection (Fig. 5B). Therefore, mutations of ZF residues that exhibit a defect in ubiquitin binding impair TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling in T lymphocytes, highlighting the importance of ubiquitin recognition by the ZF motif, mostly via crucial hydrophobic contacts. We finally examined whether the M415S mutation, which shows the most severe defect in NF-κB signaling, affects the ability of NEMO to bind ubiquitinated proteins in vivo. Pull-down of FLAG-tagged NEMO WT protein after transient transfection in 293T cells leads to co-elution of a pattern of ubiquitinated proteins, whereas less ubiquitinated proteins co-elute with NEMO M415S (Fig. 5C). Hence, such a mutation in the ubiquitin-binding surface of the ZF reduces the ability of NEMO to bind ubiquitinated proteins, indicating that NEMO ZF is involved in ubiquitin binding in vivo. Altogether, our results clearly reveal the role of the ZF as a novel ubiquitin-binding domain in NEMO, namely of the UBZ type, thereby providing new insights into the mechanism of ubiquitin recognition by NEMO to activate the NF-κB pathway. The moderate ZF affinity for ubiquitin, allowing transient complex formation, might be increased in the context of the full-length protein, which contains another UBD in the CC2-LZ domain. We propose that the ZF acts in a cooperative manner with the CC2-LZ domain to strengthen ubiquitin recognition and to preferentially bind polyubiquitin chains rather than monoubiquitin. Finally, our results suggest that, like other ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency and incontinentia pigmenti mutations located in the CC2-LZ UBD, pathological mutations in NEMO ZF likely impair NF-κB activation by disrupting the binding to ubiquitin.

https://openalex.org/W1966222081,"Metabolic phenotyping has become an important 'bird's-eye-view' technology which can be applied to higher organisms, such as model plant and animal systems in the post-genomics and proteomics era. Although genotyping technology has expanded greatly over the past decade, metabolic phenotyping has languished due to the difficulty of 'top-down' chemical analyses. Here, we describe a systematic NMR methodology for stable isotope-labeling and analysis of metabolite mixtures in plant and animal systems.The analysis method includes a stable isotope labeling technique for use in living organisms; a systematic method for simultaneously identifying a large number of metabolites by using a newly developed HSQC-based metabolite chemical shift database combined with heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy; Principal Components Analysis; and a visualization method using a coarse-grained overview of the metabolic system. The database contains more than 1000 (1)H and (13)C chemical shifts corresponding to 142 metabolites measured under identical physicochemical conditions. Using the stable isotope labeling technique in Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells and Bombyx mori, we systematically detected >450 HSQC peaks in each (13)C-HSQC spectrum derived from model plant, Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells and the invertebrate animal model Bombyx mori. Furthermore, for the first time, efficient (13)C labeling has allowed reliable signal assignment using analytical separation techniques such as 3D HCCH-COSY spectra in higher organism extracts.Overall physiological changes could be detected and categorized in relation to a critical developmental phase change in B. mori by coarse-grained representations in which the organization of metabolic pathways related to a specific developmental phase was visualized on the basis of constituent changes of 56 identified metabolites. Based on the observed intensities of (13)C atoms of given metabolites on development-dependent changes in the 56 identified (13)C-HSQC signals, we have determined the changes in metabolic networks that are associated with energy and nitrogen metabolism."

C1 tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase, encoded by Mthfd1, is an entry point of 1Cs into folate metabolism through its formyl-THF synthetase (FTHFS) activity that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formate and THF to 10-formyl-THF. Disruption of FTHFS activity by the insertion of a gene trap vector into the Mthfd1 gene results in embryonic lethality in mice. Mthfd1gt/+ mice demonstrated lower hepatic adenosylmethionine levels, which is consistent with formate serving as a source of 1Cs for cellular methylation reactions. Surprisingly, Mthfd1gt/+ mice exhibited decreased levels of uracil in nuclear DNA, indicating enhanced de novo thymidylate synthesis, and suggesting that serine hydroxymethyltransferase and FTHFS compete for a limiting pool of unsubstituted THF. This study demonstrates the essentiality of the Mthfd1 gene and indicates that formate-derived 1Cs are utilized for de novo purine synthesis and the remethylation of homocysteine in liver. Further, the depletion of cytoplasmic FTHFS activity enhances thymidylate synthesis, affirming the competition between thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation for THF cofactors.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, 1C metabolism functions to carry and chemically activate single carbons for the de novo synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (2Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62: S3-S12; discussion S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Methionine can be adenosylated to form S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major cellular methyl group donor required for the methylation of DNA, RNA, histones, small molecules, and lipids. Nuclear 1C metabolism functions to synthesize thymidylate from dUMP and serine during S phase through the small ubiquitin-like modifier-dependent translocation of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT), dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidylate synthase into the nucleus (3Woeller C.F. Anderson D.D. Szebenyi D.M. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17623-17631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Serine, through its conversion to glycine by SHMT, is a primary source of 1Cs for nucleotide and methionine synthesis (4Davis S.R. Stacpoole P.W. Williamson J. Kick L.S. Quinlivan E.P. Coats B.S. Shane B. Bailey L.B. Gregory J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E272-E279Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SHMT generates 1Cs in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus, although the generation of 1Cs through SHMT activity in the cytoplasm is not essential in mice, indicating the essentiality of mitochondria-derived 1Cs for cytoplasmic 1C metabolism (5MacFarlane A.J.

In mitochondria, the hydroxymethyl group of serine and the C2 carbon of glycine are transferred to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to generate 5,10-methylene-THF by the mitochondrial isozyme of SHMT and the glycine cleavage system, respectively (6Motokawa Y. Kikuchi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 1C carried by methylene-THF is oxidized and hydrolyzed to generate formate by the NAD-dependent methylene-THF dehydrogenase (MTHFD) and methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase (MTHFC) activities encoded by a single gene, Mthfd2 (7Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 10-formyl-THF synthetase (FTHFS) activity, encoded by Mthfd1L (8Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In the cytoplasm, the product of the Mthfd1 gene, C1THF synthase, is a trifunctional enzyme that contains NADP-dependent MTHFD and MTHFC activities on the N-terminal domain of the protein, and FTHFS activity on the C-terminal domain (9Hum D.W. Bell A.W. Rozen R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15946-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three activities collectively catalyze the interconversion of THF, 10-formyl-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF, and 5,10-methylene-THF (10Tan L.U. Drury E.J. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1117-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The ATP-dependent FTHFS activity of C1THF synthase condenses mitochondria-derived formate with THF to form 10-formyl-THF, which is required for the de novo synthesis of purines (9Hum D.W. Bell A.W. Rozen R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15946-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MTHFC and MTHFD activities convert 10-formyl-THF to methylene-THF (11Pelletier J.N. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12673-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Methylene-THF is utilized in the de novo synthesis of thymidylate or, alternatively, can be irreversibly reduced by methylene-THF reductase to 5-methyl-THF, which is used in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (12Vanoni M.A. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5272-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Impairments in 1C metabolism, due to insufficient folate cofactors and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that encode folate-dependent enzymes, are associated with numerous pathologies and developmental anomalies, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, and neural tube defects. The causal mechanisms underlying the folate-pathology relationship(s) remains to be established. However, a number of hypotheses have been proposed related to the role of 1C metabolism in genome stability and gene expression. Decreased thymidylate synthesis results in increased uracil misincorporation into DNA and decreased rates of cell division, causing double strand breaks in DNA and genomic instability (13Duthie S.J. Hawdon A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Decreased AdoMet synthesis alters methylation patterns in CpG islands in DNA and can result in histone hypomethylation, which can alter gene expression (2Stover P.J. Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62: S3-S12; discussion S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferating cells also require the de novo synthesis of purines to maintain rates of DNA synthesis (14Kondo M. Yamaoka T. Honda S. Miwa Y. Katashima R. Moritani M. Yoshimoto K. Hayashi Y. Itakura M. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the gene product of Mthfd2, mitochondrial MTHFC/MTHFD is essential in mice, and Mthfd2 deficiency results in embryonic lethality (15Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This protein is required for the generation of formate from serine in the mitochondria of embryonic cells. Here, we have investigated the essentiality of the Mthfd1 gene in mice and the effect of altered Mthfd1 gene expression on biomarkers of cytoplasmic 1C metabolism. Our data demonstrate that Mthfd1 is an essential gene in mice and that Mthfd1-deficient mice are a model for the study of folate-associated pathologies. Generation of Mthfd1gt/+ Mice—All study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cornell University and conform to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mouse embryonic stem cells (E14Tg2a.4) containing a gene trap vector insertion between exons 26 and 27 of one allele of the Mthfd1 gene (cell line XB175) were obtained from Bay-Genomics (San Francisco, CA). The gene trap vector pGT0pfs contains the engrailed 2 (En2) intron located 5′ to a promoterless βgeo cassette (16Skarnes W.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 592-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integration of the gene trap vector within the Mthfd1 gene was verified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR at BayGenomics. XB175 embryonic stem cells were expanded and injected into C57Bl/6 mouse blastocysts at the Cornell University Transgenic Mouse Core Facility (Ithaca, NY). Germ line transmission of the Mthfd1gt(pGT0pfs)Stov (Mthfd1gt/t) allele was confirmed by PCR using purified tail nuclear DNA. Mice were backcrossed onto the 129P2/OlaHsd (N>10) and the C57Bl/6 (N6) backgrounds. All mice were maintained under specific-pathogen free conditions. Genotyping of Mthfd1gt/+ Mice—Genotyping was carried out by PCR using nuclear DNA isolated from tail tissue using a DNeasy DNA purification kit (Qiagen). A duplex PCR reaction was used to detect the wild-type Mthfd1 and Mthfd1gt alleles. The primers were as follows: Mthfd1 forward, 5′-tttggcttgaagagggacatgagg-3′; Mthfd1 reverse, 5′-aggaccttagaggactagcagggt-3′; and En2 reverse, 5′-gtcctacaacacacactccaacct-3′ (priming sites indicated in Fig. 2A). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 20 s, 59 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. C1THF Synthase Purification from Liver—Freshly isolated liver from an Mthfd1gt/+ mouse was homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and the suspension was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g). Ammonium sulfate was added to 15%, and precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The protein extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column and eluted with a KCl gradient (0–300 mm and 100 ml). Fractions were collected and assayed for C1THF synthase-β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein (250 kDa) and C1THF synthase protein (105 kDa) by immunoblotting using rat anti-rabbit C1THF synthase antibodies generously provided by Dean Appling (University of Texas at Austin, see “Immunoblotting”). Fractions 20–25 contained the C1THF synthase-β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein without contaminating C1THF synthase protein; fractions 40–47 contained C1THF synthase protein without contaminating C1THF synthase-β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein. Enzyme Activity Assays—FTHFS and MTHFD activities were assayed as described by Cheek and Appling (17Cheek W.D. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Diets—Breeding mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet (Harlan Teklad LM-485). For the diet study, 3-week-old male mice were randomly weaned onto AIN-93G (control (C) diet, Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA), which contained 2 mg/kg folic acid and 2.5 g/kg choline bitartrate or modified AIN-93G, which lacked folic acid and choline bitartrate (FCD diet, Dyets, Inc.). Mice were maintained on the diet for 5 weeks. Diet Study Tissue Harvest—The animal feeding cycle was synchronized prior to tissue harvest to ensure AdoMet levels reflected homocysteine remethylation capacity with minimal contributions from dietary methionine. Food was removed 24 h prior to killing the animals. After 12 h, each animal was given one food pellet, and the animals were killed 12 h later. Blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes by cardiac puncture. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation. Plasma and tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Immunoblotting—Total protein was extracted and quantified from tissue (18Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (5MacFarlane A.J. Liu X. Perry C.A. Flodby P. Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25846-25853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two different antibodies were used to detect C1THF synthase protein. Sheep anti-mouse C1THF synthase antibody was generated from the peptide NYVPDDTKPNGRKVVG (amino acid residues 239–254) and affinity purified using the same biotin-conjugated peptide. This antibody was diluted 1:10,000, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) was diluted 1:20,000. Rat anti-rabbit C1THF synthase antibodies were the generous gift of Dean Appling (University of Texas at Austin); immunoblots generated with this antibody were performed as described elsewhere (17Cheek W.D. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection, mouse anti-human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Novus) was diluted 1:1,000,000 and the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was diluted 1:20,000. Determination of AdoMet and AdoHcy Concentrations—Frozen tissues were sonicated in 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6), and protein was precipitated by adding 312 μl of 10% perchloric acid to each sample. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. AdoMet and AdoHcy were determined as described previously (19Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). AdoMet and AdoHcy values were normalized to cellular protein content (18Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Plasma and Tissue Folate Concentration—Folate concentration of plasma and tissues was quantified using the Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay as described previously (20Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Uracil Content in Nuclear DNA—Nuclear DNA was extracted from 25–50 mg of tissue using DNeasy Tissue and Blood Kit (Qiagen), including an incubation with RNase A (Sigma) and RNase T1 (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. 10 μg of DNA was treated with 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase (Epicenter) for 1 h at 37 °C. Immediately following incubation, 10 pg of [15N2]Uracil (Cambridge Isotopes) was added to each sample as an internal standard, and the sample was dried completely in a speed vacuum. 50 μl of acetonitrile, 10 μl of triethylamine, and 1 μl of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide were added to each sample and incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with shaking at 500 rpm. 50 μl of water followed by 100 μl of isooctane were added to each sample. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged. Organic extraction of derived uracil was completed by the removal of the aqueous phase and analysis of the organic phase. Uracil content in nuclear DNA was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, as previously described (5MacFarlane A.J. Liu X. Perry C.A. Flodby P. Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25846-25853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Metabolite Profile from Plasma—Total homocysteine, cystathionine, total cysteine, methionine, glycine, serine, α-aminobutyric acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, and N-methylglycine were assayed in mouse plasma by stable isotope dilution capillary gas chromatography mass spectrometry as previously described (21Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Savage D.G. Allen R.H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Differences in genotype distribution were analyzed by the Chi square test. When comparing two groups, differences were determined by Student's t test analysis. Diet x genotype effects were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test. Groups were considered significantly different when p ≤ 0.05. Data were normalized by log transformation. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. All statistics were performed using JMP IN software, release 5.1.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). The Gene Trap Insertion in the Mthfd1 Gene Inactivates 10-Formyl-THF Synthetase Activity—The insertion of the gene trap vector into the Mthfd1 gene was identified by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends at BayGenomics. The gene trap vector insertion site is located within the FTHFS domain of the Mthfd1 gene. We confirmed the presence of the gene trap vector by designing forward and reverse PCR primers specific to intron 26–27 that flank the gene trap insertion site, as well as a reverse primer that was specific to the En2 intron of the gene trap vector (Fig. 2A). The Mthfd1gt allele generated a 320-bp PCR product, whereas the wild-type allele resulted in a 553-bp PCR product (Fig. 2B). The C1THF synthase-β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein and C1THF synthase protein were partially purified from the liver of an Mthfd1gt/+ mouse using DEAE-Sephacel and FTHFS and MTHFD activities were assayed. Fractions containing wild-type C1THF synthase, as determined by immunoblotting using rat anti-rabbit C1THF synthase antibodies (not shown), contained 0.8 μmol·min–1·mg–1 FTHFS activity and 0.40 μmol·min–1·mg–1 MTHFD activity. Fractions containing the C1THF synthase fusion protein exhibited comparable MTHFD activity (0.36 μmol·min–1·mg–1). These fractions contained essentially no FTHFS activity (0.001 μmol·min–1·mg–1). These data indicate that the gene trap insertion disrupted the FTHFS activity of C1THF synthase. Mthfd1 Is Essential in Mice—To determine the viability of Mthfd1gt/gt mice, heterozygous B6.129P2-Mthfd1gt(N6) mice were intercrossed and the genotype distribution was determined (Table 1). A total of 139 pups from 26 litters were examined. The average litter size was 5.3 pups. We found that the Mthfd1 genotypes were not distributed as expected for Mendelian inheritance of the Mthfd1gt allele (Chi square analysis, p = 2.7 × 10–11). The ratio of Mthfd1+/+ to Mthfd1gt/+ to Mthfd1gt/gt mice was 39:100:0, demonstrating that homozygosity for the Mthfd1gt allele is embryonic lethal. When it was assumed that Mthfd1gt/gt was lethal, the Mthfd1+/+ and Mthfd1gt/+ genotypes were observed in the expected distribution. Both sexes were found at the expected frequency. Mthfd1gt/+ mice appear healthy and breed normally. The data indicate that in dams fed a standard rodent chow diet, homozygosity for the Mthfd1gt allele is embryonic lethal.TABLE 1Mthfd1 null mice are not viableGenotypeObserved genotype distributionExpected genotype distributionMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalMthfd1+/+15243917.517.535Mthfd1gt/+465410034.534.569Mthfd1gt/-00017.517.535Total617813969.569.5139Number of litters observed26Mean litter size (mean ± S.E.)5.3 ± 0.4p value, observed versus expected genotype distribution (1:2:1)2.7 × 10-11p value, observed versus expected genotype distribution assuming homozygous lethality (1:2:0)nsans, not significant.p value, observed versus expected sex distributionnsa ns, not significant. Open table in a new tab C1THF Synthase Protein Levels in Mthfd1gt/+ Mice—Heterozygous 129P2-Mthfd1gt male mice were crossed to C57Bl/6 females to produce B6129P2F1 Mthfd1+/+ and Mthfd1gt/+ progeny. The mice were weaned onto either the control diet or the FCD diet and maintained for 5 weeks. The Mthfd1gt/+ mice consistently exhibited an approximate 50% decrease in wild-type C1THF synthase protein in kidney, liver, colon, and brain, as detected by immunoblotting using sheep anti-mouse C1THF synthase antibodies (Fig. 2C). C1THF synthase protein levels were not influenced by the folate/choline-deficient diet in these mice. Mthfd1gt/+ Mice Have a Larger Body Weight at Weaning—Mthfd1gt/+ mice had a significantly larger body weight independent of diet than their wild-type siblings at weaning and for the first 2 weeks of the study (Fig. 3A, Student's t test, p ≤ 0.01). Relative weight gain was significantly increased in wild-type mice in comparison with Mthfd1gt/+ mice for the first 3 weeks, which by week 3 had compensated for the initial differences in body weight (Fig. 3B, Student's t test, p ≤ 0.03). No difference in body weight was observed between wild-type and Mthfd1gt/+ mice from weeks 3–5. After 5 weeks, the folate/choline-deficient diet resulted in a significant decrease in plasma folate concentrations in comparison with the control diet (20.4 versus 40.4 ng/ml, Student's t test, p = 0.006, Table 2). The diet had no significant effect on body weight (Fig. 3A).

Open table in a new tab Mthfd1gt/+ Mice Are Less Susceptible to Folate-mediated Uracil Misincorporation in Colonic DNA—After 5 weeks, liver uracil tended to be increased in Mthfd1+/+ mice fed the FCD diet in comparison to those fed the control diet (0.4 versus 1.0 pg/μg DNA, Student's t test, p = 0.10). However, when considering both wild-type and Mthfd1gt/+ mice, it was found that the FCD diet did not significantly affect uracil incorporation into liver nuclear DNA (Table 3). The FCD diet was associated with a significant 1.5-fold increase in uracil content in DNA in the colon (Table 4, 0.3 versus 0.2 pg/μg of DNA, p < 0.0001). Overall, Mthfd1gt/+ mice had significantly less uracil content in nuclear DNA from colon in comparison with their wild-type counterparts independent of diet (0.2 versus 0.3 pg of uracil/μg of DNA, Student’s t test, p < 0.0001). Mthfd1- and Diet-mediated Changes in the Trans-sulfuration Pathway—The FCD diet was associated with changes in markers of homocysteine metabolism (Table 5).

Open table in a new tab While the Mthfd1 genotype alone did not affect markers of homocysteine metabolism, a significant diet x genotype effect was observed for plasma cystathionine and α-aminobutyric acid. Mthfd1gt/+ mice fed the control diet, but not those fed the FCD diet, had decreased cystathionine concentrations in comparison with wild-type mice fed the control diet (789 versus 1159 nm, two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test, p < 0.05). The FCD diet was associated with an increase in plasma α-aminobutyric acid in wild-type mice, but not in Mthfd1gt/+ mice (3.6 versus 5.9 μm). The Mthfd1gt/+ mice on both diets maintained an overall higher concentration of α-aminobutyric acid than wild-type mice. There are two major entry points of 1Cs into folate metabolism in the cytoplasm; the synthesis of 10-formyl-THF from formate catalyzed by FTHFS, and the formation of methylene-THF from serine catalyzed by cSHMT. Previously, we have demonstrated that cSHMT, encoded by the Shmt1 gene, is not essential in mice (5MacFarlane A.J. Liu X. Perry C.A. Flodby P. Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25846-25853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the Mthfd1 gene is essential in mice and affirms the fundamental role of mitochondria in the production of formate for 1C metabolism in the cytoplasm. Although the gene trap insertion targeted and impaired the activity of the FTHFS domain of the C1THF synthase enzyme, the fusion protein did not accumulate to a significant level in most tissues (<10% wild-type levels), as determined by Western blotting, indicating that the gene trap insertion reduced all three activities of C1THF synthase by reducing total protein levels. Primary mouse fibroblasts derived from cultured embryonic stem cells lacking Mthfd1 expression were shown to be purine auxotrophs (8Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), therefore, it is likely that the Mthfd1gt/gt mice are not viable due to inadequate purine synthesis to sustain growth and development. The mitochondrial NAD-dependent MTHFD/MTHFC (encoded by Mthfd2) has also been shown to be essential in mice (15Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of 10-formyl-THF in mitochondria (23Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14616-14620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial 10-formyl-THF can be used in the generation of formate through FTHFS activity encoded by Mthfd1L (8Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Prasannan P. Pike S. Peng K. Shane B. Appling D.R. J. Biol.

Changes in mitochondrial protein synthesis were not associated with in utero lethality in Mthfd2-deficient embryos (15Di Pietro E. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. MacKenzie R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rather, it was suggested that the decrease in 10-formyl-THF available for purine synthesis compromised embryonic development, which is what we propose occurs in Mthfd1-deficient embryos. Although the Mthfd1gt/+ mice appear healthy and breed well, the analysis of biomarkers indicates folate-mediated 1C metabolism is impaired. Mthfd1gt/+ mice fed the control diet had decreased levels of AdoMet in liver compared with wild-type mice, indicating that formate-derived 1Cs are utilized for the remethylation of homocysteine in liver, which is consistent with previous isotope tracer metabolic studies in cell cultures (19Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Liver AdoMet concentrations in wild-type Mthfd1 mice also tended to decrease in response to the FCD diet, whereas Mthfd1gt/+ mice were refractory to a further diet-mediated decrease in liver AdoMet. Other studies have demonstrated that AdoMet levels are tightly buffered and that compensatory mechanisms exist to spare AdoMet levels when methionine synthesis is inhibited (25Elmore C.L. Wu X. Leclerc D. Watson E.D. Bottiglieri T. Krupenko N.I. Krupenko S.A. Cross J.C. Rozen R. Gravel R.A. Matthews R.G. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 91: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unlike that observed in liver, the Mthfd1 genotype had no effect on AdoMet or AdoHcy in the colon. The differences in AdoMet and AdoHcy levels across tissues may be due to tissue-specific differences in gene expression, enzyme activity, or responses to altered 1C pools. Homocysteine metabolism was also altered in Mthfd1gt/+ mice. Mthfd1gt/+ mice demonstrated decreased plasma cystathionine and increased plasma α-aminobutyric acid, suggesting that homocysteine metabolism via the trans-sulfuration pathway was influenced by changes in the amount of 1Cs available for homocysteine remethylation. Uracil misincorporation into nuclear DNA was also influenced by Mthfd1 status, but only significantly in colon. The Mthfd1gt/+ mice exhibited lower uracil levels in colonic DNA compared with wild-type mice, and this effect was independent of diet, suggesting that the 1Cs utilized in thymidylate synthesis are not solely derived from formate. This supports previous studies that demonstrate cSHMT provides an independent pool of 1Cs for thymidylate biosynthesis through nuclear folate-mediated 1C metabolism (5MacFarlane A.J. Liu X.

The decrease in uracil content in DNA associated with FTHFS disruption indicates that FTHFS and SHMT compete for a limiting pool of THF; other studies have demonstrated that the concentration of folate-dependent enzymes exceeds the cellular concentration folate cofactors (19Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Depletion of FTHFS activity may make THF more available to cSHMT and the thymidylate synthesis cycle and prevent uracil misincorporation into DNA (3Woeller C.F. Anderson D.D. Szebenyi D.M.

Evidence from our laboratory and others has demonstrated links between activation of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) and atherosclerosis and also has demonstrated that activated protein kinase C (PKC) betaII is a critical upstream regulator of Egr-1 in response to vascular stress. We tested the role of PKCbeta in regulating key events linked to atherosclerosis and show that the aortas of apoE(-/-) mice display an age-dependent increase in PKCbetaII antigen in membranous fractions vs. C57BL/6 animals with a approximately 2-fold increase at age 6 wk and a approximately 4.5-fold increase at age 24 wk. Consistent with important roles for PKCbeta in atherosclerosis, a significant decrease in atherosclerotic lesion area was evident in PKCbeta(-/-)/apoE(-/-) vs. apoE(-/-) mice by approximately 5-fold, in parallel with significantly reduced vascular transcripts for Egr-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 antigen and activity vs. apoE(-/-) mice. Significant reduction in atherosclerosis of approximately 2-fold was observed in apoE(-/-) mice fed ruboxistaurin chow (PKCbeta inhibitor) vs. vehicle. In primary murine and human aortic endothelial cells, the PKCbeta-JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway importantly contributes to oxLDL-mediated induction of MMP2 expression. Blockade of PKCbeta may be beneficial in mitigating endothelial perturbation and atherosclerosis."

Here, we investigated its in vivo role by stably silencing PRC expression with two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA1 and shRNA4) that were lentivirally introduced into U2OS cells. shRNA1 transductants exhibited nearly complete knockdown of PRC protein, whereas shRNA4 transductants expressed PRC protein at ∼15% of the control level. Complete PRC silencing by shRNA1 resulted in a severe inhibition of respiratory growth; reduced expression of respiratory protein subunits from complexes I, II, III, and IV; markedly lower complex I and IV respiratory enzyme levels; and diminished mitochondrial ATP production. Surprisingly, shRNA1 transductants exhibited a striking proliferation of abnormal mitochondria that were devoid of organized cristae and displayed severe membrane abnormalities. Although shRNA4 transductants had normal respiratory subunit expression and a moderately diminished respiratory growth rate, both transductants showed markedly reduced growth on glucose accompanied by inhibition of G1/S cell cycle progression. Microarray analysis revealed striking overlaps in the genes affected by PRC silencing in the two transductants, and the functional identities of these overlapping genes were consistent with the observed mitochondrial and cell growth phenotypes. The consistency between phenotype and PRC expression levels in the two independent transductant lines argues that the defects result from PRC silencing and not from off target effects.

These results support a role for PRC in the integration of pathways directing mitochondrial respiratory function and cell growth. Mitochondria are semiautonomous organelles that function as important sites of biological oxidation and ATP production. Central to this function is the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation system, which is composed predominantly of five multisubunit protein complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Google Scholar, 2Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol.. 1990; 258: C377-C389Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain their own genetic system directed by a covalently closed circular DNA genome whose entire protein coding capacity is devoted to the production of 13 protein subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and V. Although essential, these subunits account for only a fraction of the protein composition with the majority of the respiratory subunits of nuclear origin (3Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet.. 2005; 39: 359-407Google Scholar, 4Scarpulla R.C. Physiol. Rev.. 2008; 88: 611-638Google Scholar). Its bigenomic expression makes the respiratory apparatus unique among mitochondrial oxidative functions and poses an important biological problem in understanding the coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression. A number of nucleus-encoded regulatory factors have been associated with the transcriptional control of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes that specify the respiratory apparatus in mammalian systems. Initial work identified nuclear respiratory factors, NRF-1 and NRF-2(GABP), as activators of nuclear cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase genes. These factors have subsequently been associated with the expression of the majority of nuclear genes specifying mitochondrial respiratory function. These include genes encoding the respiratory subunits themselves but also those specifying protein import and assembly factors, heme biosynthetic enzymes, ribosomal proteins and tRNA synthetases of the mitochondrial translation system, and components of the mtDNA transcription and replication machinery (4Scarpulla R.C. Physiol. Rev.. 2008; 88: 611-638Google Scholar, 5Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev.. 2004; 18: 357-368Google Scholar). The last group includes the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial transcription factors TFAM and the mtTFB isoforms, TFB1M and TFB2M, which act in conjunction with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase to maximize transcription from divergent heavy and light strand promoters (6Gaspari M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2004; 1659: 148-152Google Scholar, 7Bonawitz N.D. Clayton D.A. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 24: 813-825Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted disruption of Tfam (8Larsson N.G. Wang J.M. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat.

Biol.. 2001; 21: 644-654Google Scholar) have an embryonic lethal phenotype with loss of mtDNA, although lethality of the Nrf-1 embryos occurs at an earlier stage, suggesting that functions other than mitochondrial respiration are also disrupted (10Cam H. Balciunaite E. Blias A. Spektor A. Scarpulla R.C. Young R. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 16: 399-411Google Scholar). Recently, shRNA-mediated inhibition of both NRF-1 and NRF-2 has been linked to the down-regulation of all 10 nucleus-encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits, providing additional in vivo evidence for the importance of these factors in respiratory chain expression (11Ongwijitwat S.

Insight into how diverse transcription factors might be coordinated into a program of mitochondrial biogenesis came with the discovery of the PGC-1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1) family of inducible coactivators.

It is induced during adaptive thermogenesis in brown fat and can interact directly with NRF-1 in enhancing mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis (15Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell.. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar, 16Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell.. 1999; 98: 115-124Google Scholar). Ectopic overexpression of PGC-1α both in cultured cells and in mice results in dramatic increases in mitochondrial content and the expression of a number of genes important for mitochondrial respiratory function (16Wu Z.

Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest.. 2000; 106: 847-856Google Scholar). These properties are shared by PGC-1β, a close homologue of PGC-1α that also acts as a potent activator of NRF target genes (18Lin J. Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab.. 2005; 1: 361-370Google Scholar). However, targeted disruption of either Pgc-1 coactivator in mice does not result in a dramatic mitochondrial biogenesis defect (19Lin J. Wu P. Tarr P.T.

In both cases, the homozygous knockouts were viable and fertile with no gross abnormalities in mitochondrial number or morphology. This may be explained by compensatory interactions among the PGC-1 family members or other adaptive changes in the transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, mice doubly deficient in Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β exhibit fetal arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis in both heart and brown fat associated with reduced cardiac output and postnatal mortality, suggesting that proper mitochondrial maturation requires both coactivators (23Lai L. Leone T.C. Zechner C. Schaeffer P.J. Kelly S.M. Flanagan D.P. Medeiros D.M. Kovacs A. Kelly D.P. Genes Dev.. 2008; 22: 1948-1961Google Scholar). A third PGC-1 family coactivator, designated PRC (PGC-1-related coactivator), has limited overall sequence similarity with PGC-1α or -β but shares key structural features that define the family. These include a conserved amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a central proline-rich region, a functional binding site for host cell factor, and carboxyl-terminal R/S domain and RNA recognition motif (24Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Google Scholar). PRC binds NRF-1 and activates NRF-1 target genes but does not appear to be regulated significantly during adaptive thermogenesis. Rather, its expression is serum-induced in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and correlates with the cell proliferative cycle (25Vercauteren K. Pasko R.A. Gleyzer N. Marino V.M. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 7409-7419Google Scholar). Like the other PGC-1 coactivators, PRC binds HCF-1 (host cell factor-1), an abundant chromatin component that is required for cell cycle progression (26Vercauteren K. Gleyzer N. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 12102-12111Google Scholar). HCF-1 is a NRF-2(GABP) coactivator (27Vogel J.L. Kristie T.M. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 683-690Google Scholar) and exists in an in vivo complex with both PRC and NRF-2 (26Vercauteren K. Gleyzer N. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 12102-12111Google Scholar). These in vivo interactions probably account for the trans-activation of NRF-2 target genes by PRC despite the absence of a direct interaction between PRC and NRF-2 subunits in vitro. Here, the effects of shRNA-mediated PRC knockdown on respiratory function and mitochondrial biogenesis are investigated in stable lentiviral transductants of human U2OS cells. Loss of PRC results in a severe reduction in respiratory energy production associated with the reduced expression and assembly of respiratory complexes. Surprisingly, this respiratory defect is coincides with the proliferation of structurally defective mitochondria. In addition to the respiratory defect, PRC silencing was also implicated in the inhibition of cell cycle progression. Global changes in gene expression were consistent with both mitochondrial and growth phenotypes. Cell Culture—U2OS cells and HEK-293 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1 mm Eagle's minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Mediatech, Inc.) with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Generation of Lentiviral Transductants Expressing shRNA—Double-stranded oligonucleotides targeting the human PRC gene (PRCsh1S, CACCGCCATCAGGACATCACCATCACGAATGATGGTGATGTCCTGATGGC; PRCsh1AS, AAAAGCCATCAGGACATCACCATCATTCGTGATGGTGATGTCCTGATGGC; PRCsh4S, CACCGAGGCATTTGCAGCCATTGTTCAAGAGACAATGGCTGCAAATGCCTC; PRCsh4AS, AAAAGAGGCATTTGCAGCCATTGTCTCTTGAACAATGGCTGCAAATGCCTC) and a negative control sequence derived from the MISSION nontarget shRNA control vector (Sigma) (control shS, CACCCAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAACTCGAGTTGGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTG; control shAS, AAAACAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAACTCGAGTTGGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTG) were ligated into the pENTR/U6 vector using the BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi 2The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; TFB, mitochondrial transcription factor B; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ad, adenovirus. entry vector kit (Invitrogen). The BLOCK-iT™ RNAi designer from the Invitrogen Web site was used to design shRNA sequences targeting PRC. The control hairpin contains four base pair mismatches to any known human or mouse gene (28Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y. Kloepfer A.M. Hinkle G. Piqani B. Eisenhaure T.M. Luo B. Grenier J.K. Carpenter A.E. Foo S.Y. Stewart S.A. Stockwell B.R. Hacohen N. Hahn W.C. Lander E.S. Sabatini D.M. Root D.E. Cell.. 2006; 124: 1283-1298Google Scholar). The resulting entry vectors were designated pENTR/PRCshRNA1, pENTR/PRCshRNA4, and pENTR/control shRNA. The lentiviral expression vectors pLenti/PRCshRNA1, pLenti/PRCshRNA4, pLenti/control shRNA, and pLenti-GW/U6-LaminshRNA were generated by transferring the U6-PRC, U6-control, and U6-Lamin RNA-mediated interference cassettes into the pLenti6/BLOCK-iT DEST vector using the LR recombination reaction. Lentiviral particles of these constructs were generated in 293FT cells using the BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi expression system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). U2OS cells were transduced with each lentiviral construct at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and individual clones stably expressing each shRNA were selected with blasticidin. Adenoviral Methods—The recombinant adenoviral plasmids Ad-GFP and Ad-PGC-1α were a kind gift from Dr. D. P. Kelly (Burnham Institute for Medical Research, Orlando, FL) (17Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest.. 2000; 106: 847-856Google Scholar). The plasmid Ad-NmycPRC was constructed using the AdEasy® basic kit from ATCC. An NH2-terminal c-Myc tag was incorporated into PRC full-length cDNA by PCR using FL-Bam-PRC/pBSII (24Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Google Scholar) as a template, resulting in NmycPRC/pBSII. NmycPRC/pAdTrack-CMV was generated by cloning the XhoI/NotI fragment of NmycPRC/pBSII into SalI/Not-digested pAdTrack-CMV. NmycPRC/pAdTrack-CMV was then used in a recombination reaction with pAdEasy-1 to produce Ad-NmycPRC. The adenoviral plasmids were linearized and transfected into the packaging cell line HEK-293 with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the resulting viral stock was amplified to high titer. U2OS cells were infected, and the infection efficiency (95–100%) was determined by GFP expression 24 h after infection. Cells were harvested for preparation of RNA or protein extracts 72 h after infection. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in Non-idet P-40 lysis buffer as described previously (24Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Google Scholar). Extracts were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with high molecular weight transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol) in the Mini Trans-Blot Cell tank transfer system (Bio-Rad) for proteins of 70 kDa or larger or by using a Trans-Blot SD semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) with Towbin transfer buffer (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) for proteins under 70 kDa. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-PRC-(1047–1379) (25Vercauteren K. Pasko R.A. Gleyzer N. Marino V.M. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 7409-7419Google Scholar), rabbit anti-lamin A/C (a kind gift from Dr. R. D. Goldman, Northwestern University) (30Moir R.D. Montag-Lowy M. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 125: 1201-1212Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-PGC-1α (a kind gift from Dr. D. P. Kelly, Burnham institute for Medical Research, Orlando, FL) (17Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest.. 2000; 106: 847-856Google Scholar). The relative levels of the five human OXPHOS complexes were determined by using the MitoProfile Human Total OXPHOS Complexes detection kit (MitoSciences), containing antibodies against MT-ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6) of complex I, SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit) of complex II, UQCRC2 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein II) of complex III, MT-CO2 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit II) of complex IV, and ATP5A1 (subunit α of F1-ATPase) of complex V. The premixed mouse monoclonal antibody mixture was diluted to a working concentration of 7.2 μg/ml (MitoSciences). Human heart mitochondrial extract provided in the kit (0.5 μg/lane) was used as a positive control. All blots were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Flow Cytometry—For growth curves, 64000 U2OS cells were plated on day 0 in 6-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing either 5 mm glucose or 5 mm galactose (Sigma). Medium was changed daily, and on days 3, 4, and 5 cells were trypsinized, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in fresh medium. For absolute cell counting, 50 μl of AccuCount Blank particles, 5.0–5.9 μm (Spherotech), were mixed with 450 μl of the cell suspension, and samples were counted on a CyAn flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). On day 5, cells were labeled in fresh medium containing 50 nm MitoTracker Green FM (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C immediately after trypsinization. After labeling, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium, and AccuCount particles were added. The MitoTracker fluorescence of these cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using a CyAn flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed using Summit Software. For DNA content analysis, exponentially grown lentiviral transductants were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide solution containing RNase A (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml RNase A). Cell cycle analysis was done on a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Data were gated using pulse width and pulse area to exclude doublets, and the percentage of cells present in each phase of the cell cycle was calculated using Modfit software (Verity Software House). Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were DNase-treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Taq-Man reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Total genomic DNA was isolated using the GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma). Relative mRNA expression levels and relative mitochondrial DNA copy numbers were determined by Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) quantitative real time PCR using the primer sets shown in Table 1. mRNA quantities were normalized to 18 S rRNA. The amount of mtDNA (as measured by amplification of the mtDNA-encoded COXI (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) gene and of a D-loop fragment) was normalized to 18 S rDNA. Assays for both the gene of interest and the 18 S control were performed in triplicate using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system. Relative gene expression levels and relative mtDNA copy numbers were determined by the comparative Ct method using SDS version 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems).TABLE 1List of primers used for quantitative real time PCRGene namePrimerSequence (5′→3′)PRChPRC sybr SAGTGGTTGGGGAAGTCGAAGhPRC sybr ASCCTGCCGAGAGAGACTGACCREBhCREB sybr SCCAGCAGAGTGGAGATGCAGhCREB sybr ASGTTACGGTGGGAGCAGATGATTfamhTFAM sybr SCCGAGGTGGTTTTCATCTGTChTFAM sybr ASCAGGAAGTTCCCTCCAACGCTFB1MhTFB1 M sybr SCCTCCGTTGCCCACGATTChTFB1 M sybr ASGCCCACTTCGTAAACATAAGCATTFB2MhTFB2 M sybr SCGCCAAGGAAGGCGTCTAAGhTFB2 M sybr ASCTTTCGAGCGCAACCACTTTGCytochrome chcytc sybr S2TGGGCCAAATCTCCATGGTCTCTThcytc sybr AS2TGCCTTTGTTCTTATTGGCGGCTGCOXIVhCOX4 sybr STTTAGCCTAGTTGGCAAGCGAhCOX4 sybr ASCCGATCCATATAAGCTGGGAGCSDHBhSDHB sybr SCCACAGCTCCCCGTATCAAGhSDHB sybr ASTCGGAAGGTCAAAGTAGAGTCAAUQCRC2UQCRC2 sybr 2STTCAGCAATTTAGGAACCACCCUQCRC2 sybr 2ASGTCACACTTAATTTGCCACCAACATP5A1ATP synthase sybr 2STACATGGGCTGAGGAATGTTCAATP synthase sybr 2ASACCAACTGGAACGTCCACAATCOXIIhCOX2 sybr SACAGATGCAATTCCCGGACGTCTAhCOX2 sybr ASGGCATGAAACTGTGGTTTGCTCCAMT-ND6hMT-ND6 sybr 2SAGGATTGGTGCTGTGGGTGAAAGAhMT-ND6 sybr 2ASATAGGATCCTCCCGAATCAACCCTCytochrome bhCYTB sybr SAATTCTCCGATCCGTCCCTAhCYTB sybr ASGGAGGATGGGGATTATTGCTD-loophDloop-STTTCACGGAGGATGGTGGTCAAhDloop-ASACCAACAAACCTACCCACCCTTCOXIhCOXI-SAGGTTGAACAGTCTACCCTCCCTThCOXI-ASGGCGTTTGGTATTGGGTTATGGCA18 S rDNA18SrDNA-SACCAGAGCGAAAGCATTTGCCA18SrDNA-ASTCGGCATCGTTTATGGTCGGAA Open table in a new tab Dipstick Immunoassay—U2OS transductants expressing the control shRNA or PRC shRNA1 were assayed for human complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) using the respective MitoProfile dipstick assay kit (MitoSciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose for 3 days, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and collected using a cell scraper. Total cell extract was prepared based on the manufacturer's protocol (MitoSciences). Levels of human complexes I and IV were determined using 5 μg and 2 μg of cell extract per dipstick, respectively. The signal intensity on each dipstick was measured using the ImageJ Image Processing and Analysis program (National Institutes of Health). ATP Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/6-cm dish. Two days after plating, half the cells were treated with oligomycin at a final concentration of 20 μg/μl (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. Treated and untreated cells were trypsinized, counted, and diluted to 200,000 cells/ml. The cell suspension of 100 μl was used to measure steady-state ATP levels using an ATP bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions in duplicate. An ATP calibration curve was prepared with the provided ATP standard stock. The amount of light emitted was measured with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Transmission Electron Microscopy—U2OS cells were pelleted, embedded in 2% agar, and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) overnight at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), postfixed in 2% osmium in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 h, rinsed in distilled water, and prestained with uranyl acetate for 30 min. Cells were then washed in distilled water and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol. After three changes of propylene oxide, cells were infiltrated in a mixture of propylene oxide and Epon/Araldite (1:1 ratio) for 1 h, embedded in Epon/Araldite resin, and placed in a 60 °C oven overnight to polymerize. Thick sections (1 μm) were cut and stained with toluidine blue O for examination and selection of specific regions for further analysis. Thin sections (90 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM 1220 transmission electron microscope. Gatan DigitalMicrograph software was used for digital imaging. For morphometric analysis, a grid was placed over the digital image of 10 different cells/sample, and the mitochondrial content as a percentage of the cytoplasm was estimated (31Weibel E.R. Int. Rev. Cytol.. 1969; 26: 235-302Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from PRC shRNA1, PRC shRNA4, and control shRNA transductants using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and DNase-treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA samples were further purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. 500 ng of RNA was used to perform in vitro transcription in the presence of biotin UTP with the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit (Ambion). The amplified, labeled RNA (1.5 μg) was then hybridized in triplicate to an Illumina Whole-Genome Sentrix Human-6 v2 Expression BeadChip and detected according to the Illumina user manual. Data normalization was performed using the statistical modeling language R through the BioConductor Lumi package. Quality control of the hybridization was performed using intensity box plots and sample clustering. To identify differentially expressed genes, routines implemented in the Limma package were applied to fit linear models to the normalized expression values. The variance used in the t score calculation was corrected by an empirical Bayesian method for better estimation under small sample size (32Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Google Scholar). To control the effects of multiple testing, the false discovery rate was limited to 5% (false discovery rate-adjusted p value < 0.05) to identify probe sets that are statistically significant between control and PRC shRNA1 or -4 samples. Gene functional categories were assigned using the GO data base (available on the World Wide Web) and the NCBI Entrez Gene data base (available on the World Wide Web). Isolation of Lentiviral Transductants of U2OS Cells Exhibiting Partial or Complete PRC Silencing—The in vivo function of PRC was investigated by constructing lentiviruses designed to express two different shRNAs, shRNA1 and shRNA4, targeting different regions of the PRC mRNA. Human U2OS cells were infected with these viruses, and a number of stable transductants were selected in the presence of blasticidin. U2OS cells were chosen because they exhibit proper serum-regulated expression of PRC mRNA and protein, which are both down-regulated in serum-starved cells and rapidly up-regulated upon serum stimulation of quiescent cells (25Vercauteren K. Pasko R.A. Gleyzer N. Marino V.M. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 7409-7419Google Scholar). Approximately 20 individual shRNA1 and shRNA4 transductants were screened for PRC protein levels by immunoblotting. Two of these were chosen for further study. As shown in Fig. 1A (lane 4), one of the shRNA1 transductants had complete or nearly complete knockdown of PRC protein. Although none of the shRNA4 transductants showed complete PRC knockdown, one expressed ∼15% of control levels (Fig. 1A, lane 5), as estimated by densitometry. The inhibition of PRC expression was specific in that lamin A/C protein levels were not altered in either transductant (lanes 4 and 5). In addition, a negative control shRNA that lacks identity with any known mouse or human sequence failed to affect the expression of PRC or the lamin A/C control (lane 2), and a lentiviral transductant expressing a shRNA specific to lamin exhibited complete knockdown of lamin expression without affecting PRC (lane 3). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1B, PGC-1α is undetectable by immunoblotting in wild type U2OS cells (lane 3) and in the lentiviral transductants (lanes 4–6) under conditions where PGC-1α protein expressed from Ad-PGC-1α is easily detected (lane 2). Note that the intense antibody reactive band below PGC-1α is probably a nonspecific cross-reacting species, because it is expressed in the Ad-GFP control (lane 1). Thus, the effects of PRC in these cells can be studied in the absence of detectable PGC-1α protein expression. Additional confirmation that the shRNAs target PRC expression specifically was obtained from Ad-NmycPRC infected cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, PRC is abundantly overexpressed in Ad-NmycPRC-infected control transductants (lane 2) compared with those infected with Ad-GFP (lane 1). By contrast, PRC protein is undetectable in shRNA1 transductants infected with Ad-NmycPRC (lane 4) or the Ad-GFP control (lane 3). This result is not explained by a general defect in adenovirus expression in"
https://openalex.org/W1978375780,"Mitochondrial alterations are detected in most neurodegenerative disorders and may contribute to the dysfunction and demise of neuronal cells. Because glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is considered to be a critical factor in regulating neuronal cell survival and death, we studied the effects of modulating GSK-3 activity in cultured neurons treated with the mitochondrial inhibitor, rotenone. Interestingly, chronic inhibition of GSK-3 protects against rotenone-induced apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, we demonstrated that chronic inhibition of GSK-3 reprograms the metabolism of neuronal cells, leading to an enhancement of glycolysis. This effect was accompanied by the induction and accumulation of hexokinase II (HKII) in the mitochondria. Interfering with either the mitochondrial binding of HKII or HKII expression significantly diminished the neuroprotection evoked by GSK-3 inhibition, and importantly, HKII overexpression is sufficient to protect against rotenone-induced cell death. Thus, mitochondrial HKII is a promoter of neuronal survival under the regulation of GSK-3. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of HKII may be relevant to neurodegenerative diseases in which glucose hypometabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction are prominent features.

Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 2: 769-776Google Scholar, 16Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol... 2001; 65: 391-426Google Scholar). It is well known that inhibition of GSK-3 protects neuronal cells from distinct pro-apoptotic stimuli, such as trophic factor withdrawal, β-amyloid exposure, excitotoxicity, or prion peptide-induced cell death (17Alvarez G. Munoz-Montano J.R. Satrustegui J. Avila J. Bogonez E. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett... 1999; 453: 260-264Google Scholar, 18Facci L. Stevens D.A. Skaper S.D.

Med... 2002; 8: 126-132Google Scholar). In this study, we show that chronic inhibition of GSK-3 induces significant protection against rotenone-triggered neuronal cell death. We also demonstrate that this neuroprotection is accompanied by an increase in the translocation of hexokinase II (HKII) to mitochondria, as well as enhanced glycolysis. Furthermore, stripping the mitochondria of HKII partially abrogated the neuroprotection derived from GSK-3 inhibition, while silencing HKII expression with short interfering RNAs drastically impaired the neuroprotection provoked by GSK-3 inhibition. Finally, HKII overexpression was capable of mimicking the neuroprotective effect of GSK-3 inhibition, whereas knock down of the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), the presumed docking protein for HKII at mitochondria, completely blocked the effect derived from HKII overexpression. Altogether, our results emphasize the pivotal role of mitochondrial HKII in neuroprotection.

Cell Culture and Cell Treatments—Human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). The cells were differentiated into human neuron-like cells as described previously (23Gimenez-Cassina A. Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurosci. Res... 2006; 84: 755-767Google Scholar). Brainstem primary neurons were cultured as follows. Sixteen-day-old mouse embryos were removed from a pregnant female Swiss mouse and dissected in prechilled Hanks' balance salt solution. After removing the meninges, the intact brainstem was cut into small pieces and then incubated in a papain-DNase solution prepared according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Papain Dissociation System, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking every 3–4 min. The dissociated cells were then resuspended in Neurobasal:Neurobasal A (1:1) culture medium supplemented with B-27, 2 mm GlutaMaxI, and a mix of penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) as described previously (24Kivell B.M. McDonald F.J. Miller J.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res... 2000; 120: 199-210Google Scholar). The cells were then plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine-precoated surfaces, and one-third of the medium was replaced every 3 days. To avoid glial proliferation, 5 μm 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine was added 24 h after plating. All of the experiments on mice were approved by the relevant national and institutional bioethics committees and performed according to European Union guidelines (86/609/EEC). All the treatments in the presence of rotenone were performed in culture medium supplemented with B-27 Minus Anti-Oxidants. Myo-inositol (2 mm, Sigma, Madrid, Spain) was added to the culture medium when the cells were treated with lithium chloride, to minimize the effects of inositol monophosphatase inhibition. Vehicle-treated cells did not show any significant differences in cell viability. HSV-1-amplicon Vectors—Packaging and titration of HSV-1-amplicon vectors was performed by transfection of the vector plasmid into the 2–2 packaging cell line and the subsequent superinfection with 5dl1.2 disabled HSV-1 strain as described previously (25Lim F. Hartley D. Starr P. Lang P. Song S. Yu L. Wang Y. Geller A.I. BioTechniques.. 1996; 20: 460-469Google Scholar, 26Lim F. Hartley D. Starr P. Song S. Lang P. Yu L. Wang Y. Geller A.I. Methods Mol.

Science.. 1988; 241: 1667-1669Google Scholar). Plasmids pHVSGSK3WT and pHSVGSK3K85R, encoding the wild-type and K85R dead-kinase mutant of GSK-3β, respectively, have been described elsewhere (22Munoz-Montano J.R. Lim F. Moreno F.J. Avila J.

The placHK2 amplicon vector was generated by inserting the HK2 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter as an AhdI/XbaI fragment derived from pcDNA3-HK2 (a kind gift from Dr. John E. Wilson) into pHLC plasmid (30Lim F. Palomo G.M. Mauritz C. Gimenez-Cassina A. Illana B. Wandosell F. Diaz-Nido J. Mol. Ther... 2007; 15: 1072-1078Google Scholar). Multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was determined for each cell type known to transduce over 90% of the cells: 2.0 for SH-SY5Y (23Gimenez-Cassina A. Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurosci. Res... 2006; 84: 755-767Google Scholar) and 5.0 for brainstem primary neurons (data not shown). Lentiviral Vectors—Lentiviral vectors encoding scrambled short hairpin RNA (scrambled shRNA MISSION shRNA™ vector library) or short hairpin RNA against HKII (HK2 shRNA, MISSION shRNA™ vector library) and VDAC1 (VDAC1 shRNA MISSION shRNA™ vector library) were purchased from Sigma. Lentiviral stock production was accomplished by calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfection of three plasmids as described previously (the vector plasmid, the packaging plasmid pCMVΔR8.74, and the VSVG envelope protein-coding plasmid pMD2G (31Bovia F. Salmon P. Matthes T. Kvell K. Nguyen T.H. Werner-Favre C. Barnet M. Nagy M. Leuba F. Arrighi J.F. Piguet V. Trono D. Zubler R.H. Blood.. 2003; 101: 1727-1733Google Scholar, 32Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol... 1997; 15: 871-875Google Scholar)). The viral supernatant was subsequently collected, and the minimal volume of viral supernatant to achieve efficient knockdown of HKII and VDAC1 was determined experimentally. Cell Lysis and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), placed on ice and then homogenized in a buffer containing: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 100 mm sodium chloride (NaCl); 100 mm sodium fluoride (NaF); 1% Triton X-100; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4); 5 mm EDTA; and the Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After determining the protein content using the Bradford Assay, samples containing the same amount of protein were mixed with electrophoresis buffer containing SDS, boiled for 5 min, and separated by gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS on 8–15% acrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes following standard procedures, and the membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST). The blocked membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution at 4 °C, the filters were rinsed three times in PBST and then incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequent densitometric analysis was performed with an imaging densitometer (GS-710 model, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Subcellular Fractionation and Mitochondria Isolation—Mitochondria isolation was performed following a previously described procedure (33Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Methods Cell Biol... 2001; 65: 1-35Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS, and they were then collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of isolation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were homogenized in this solution with a glass-glass homogenizer with 20 strokes of the pestle. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and recentrifuged. Supernatants from both centrifugations were pooled and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The mitochondria-enriched pellet (crude mitochondrial fraction) was then resuspended in lysis buffer. Both the lysed crude mitochondrial fraction and the cytosolic supernatant were mixed with electrophoresis buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Lactate Determination—Lactate production and release into the extracellular culture medium was determined as a measure of glycolytic influx (34Merlo-Pich M. Deleonardi G. Biondi A. Lenaz G. Exp. Gerontol... 2004; 39: 277-281Google Scholar). This assay is based upon the reversibility of lactate dehydrogenase activity in Reaction 1. Pyruvate+NADH+H+↔lactate+NAD+(Eq. 1) NADH generation may be determined as the increase in optical density of the sample at 340 nm. To force the reaction to completion in the direction of lactate consumption-NADH generation, newly formed pyruvate was trapped with hydrazine. Accordingly, a 5-mg NAD vial was resuspended in 2 ml of Gly-0.6 m hydrazine buffer, 4 ml of milli-Q water, and 100 μl of bovine lactate dehydrogenase. 580 μl of reaction mix was combined with 20 μl of culture medium and left at 37 °C for 30 min. NADH generation was determined as an increase in optical density at 340 nm. Known concentrations of l-lactate were used to determine the final amount of lactate produced by the cells, and lactate production was normalized against the total amount of protein. Immunofluorescence—Cell cultures were fixed with PBS containing paraformaldehyde (4%) for 30 min. After several washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After a brief wash with PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking solution. Following extensive washes with PBS, the cultures were then incubated for 45 min with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-594. After washing the cells, they were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech Assoc. Inc., Birmingham, AL) and examined under either a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope or with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Image acquisition as well as the quantification of fluorescence intensity and co-localization was performed using MetaMorph v6.2r6 software as previously described (23Gimenez-Cassina A. Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurosci. Res... 2006; 84: 755-767Google Scholar). For these measurements, each complete set of samples was processed in parallel, and confocal images were taken in one single session. All images were captured fixing all detection settings (pinhole opening, laser intensity, gain, binning, and gamma). At least 10 cells per field, 15 fields per sample, were selected at random for analysis. In the case of HKI or HKII/Complex V double-staining, co-localization degree was determined by selecting a whole cell and processing both overlaying images through the co-localization analysis tool from MetaMorph software. All fluorescence intensity data were subjected to background normalization by selecting a blank area in each field and subtracting its intensity average from each single cell intensity. Determination of Cell Viability—Cell viability was assessed by calcein-propidium iodide uptake (35Mattson M.P. Barger S.W. Begley J.G. Mark R.J. Methods Cell Biol... 1995; 46: 187-216Google Scholar). Calcein/acetoxymethyl ester is taken up and cleaved by esterases present in living cells, yielding yellowish-green fluorescence. In contrast, propidium iodide is only taken up by dead cells, which then exhibit orange-red fluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μm propidium iodide (Sigma) and 1 μm calcein/acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cultures were then rinsed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, and then they were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope. Three randomly selected fields were analyzed per well (300–400 cells/field) in at least three independent experiments. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of calcein-positive cells with respect to the total number of cells. Detection of DNA Fragmentation: TUNEL Staining—Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed with the FragEL™ kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured on coverslips, and upon terminating the experiment, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were then permeabilized with proteinase K at room temperature for 5 min before incubating the cells for 10–30 min with equilibration buffer. The cells were nick-labeled for 1–1.5 h at 37 °C in the dark and finally, the coverslips were washed with Tris-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides with mounting media with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (supplied with the kit). Using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, the total cell population was visualized with a UV filter, and fluorescein-labeled cells were visualized with a fluorescein filter. To analyze cell survival, three fields per coverslip (300–400 cells/field) were selected at random from at least three independent experiments. Cell death was expressed as the percentage of fluorescein-labeled cells compared with the total number of cells. Statistical Analysis and Data Processing—The mean ± S.E. values from at least three independent experiments are represented in the graphs. Statistical comparison of the data sets was performed using two-tailed Student's t test. The differences are presented with their corresponding statistical significance or p value, the probability that the observation occurred merely by chance under the null hypothesis. Protection was estimated as follows: 100% protection was established as the proportion of cells surviving in the absence of treatment, whereas 0% protection was the survival rate when exposed to rotenone alone. The rest of the values were normalized within that scale. Consequently, negative protection values represent an increase in cell death over that achieved when exposed to rotenone. Chronic Inhibition of GSK-3 Protects Neuronal Cells from Rotenone-triggered Cell Death—Because rotenone-treated neurons undergo apoptosis (12Li J. Spletter M.L. Johnson D.A. Wright L.S. Svendsen C.N.

Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurosci. Res... 2006; 84: 755-767Google Scholar) and in primary brainstem neurons. Thus, GSK-3 activity was inhibited in these neuronal cells with either chemical inhibitors (2 mm LiCl (36Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 8455-8459Google Scholar); 5 μm SB-415286 (37Cross D.A. Culbert A.A. Chalmers K.A. Facci L. Skaper S.D. Reith A.D. J.

S2 and S3), which has previously been described to act as dominant negative mutant (19Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 19929-19932Google Scholar, 20Perez M. Rojo A.I. Wandosell F.

Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A) and primary brainstem neurons (Fig. 1D) were exposed to two distinct chemical inhibitors of GSK-3 (LiCl, 2 mm; SB-415286, 5 μm) for 5 days, and then challenged with rotenone (2 μm) for 24 h, and cell viability was determined. A clear protective effect of GSK-3 inhibitors against rotenone neurotoxicity is observed. We next set out to inhibit GSK-3 using a genetic approach. To that end, we employed a dead-kinase mutant of GSK-3, K85R, compared with the expression of the wild-type form of GSK-3 and the expression of E. coli β-galactosidase, with no biological effect (the characterization of the expression of these genes encoded in herpesviral amplicon constructs is detailed in supplemental Fig. S2). We expressed the above mentioned constructs in either differentiated SH-SY5Y cells or primary brainstem neurons for 5 days. After that, cells were exposed to rotenone (2 μm) for 24 h, and cell viability was determined (Fig. 1, B and E, for SH-SY5Y and primary neurons, respectively). Again, a significant protective effect of the dominant-negative dead-kinase mutant of GSK-3 against rotenone-triggered neuronal cell death was observed. Thus, chronic inhibition of GSK-3 before exposing cells to rotenone for 24 h significantly decreased cell death in both human neuron-like cells and cultured primary rodent brainstem neurons, achieving up to 50% protection (Fig. 1, C and F, for SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons, respectively). In fact, chronic inhibition of GSK-3 for 5 days prior to rotenone exposure provided maximal protection to these cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, overexpression of the wild-type form of GSK-3 for 5 days evoked a slight but significant increase in cell death with respect to non-transduced cells. Furthermore, rotenone-induced cell death was also significantly augmented in wild-type cells that overexpress GSK-3, consistent with previous evidence suggesting a pro-apoptotic role for GSK-3 (Fig. 1, B and E). Chronic Inhibition of GSK-3 Prevents the Transduction of the Cell Death Cascade Triggered by Rotenone—We have studied some of the events that take place during rotenone-induced apoptosis, and we have analyzed how modulating GSK-3 activity affects these events (Fig. 2). In particular, we focused on the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, the activation of caspase-3, and the fragmentation of nuclear DNA as canonical steps of mitochondrial dysfunction-driven cell death (40Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell.. 2004; 116: 205-219Google Scholar, 41Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell.. 2003; 112: 481-490Google Scholar). Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated with rotenone (2 μm) for 4 h were fractionated, and each cellular fraction was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). In this way, we found that the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria-enriched fractions following exposure to rotenone was partially attenuated by prior chronic inhibition of GSK-3. In these cells, the levels of Bax remained unaltered in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that up-regulation of Bax transcription and translation during apoptosis (42Zhan Q. Fan S. Bae I. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene.. 1994; 9: 3743-3751Google Scholar) may also be prevented by chronic inhibition of GSK-3. Cleavage and the subsequent activation of caspase-3 occurs during rotenone-elicited cell death in neuronal cells (12Li J. Spletter M.L. Johnson D.A. Wright L.S. Svendsen C.N. Johnson J.A. J. Neurochem... 2005; 92: 462-476Google Scholar). Thus, we exposed human neuron-like cells to rotenone (2 μm) for 24 h before examining the activation state of caspase-3 by Western blot with a specific antibody against the active 17- and 19-kDa fragments of caspase-3. Significant attenuation of caspase-3 activation was observed in cells subjected to chronic inhibition of GSK-3 prior to the rotenone challenge (Fig. 2B). Fragmentation of nuclear DNA is a late event in the cell death process, and because many 3′-OH ends become available, it can be readily assessed by TUNEL labeling (43Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol... 1992; 119: 493-501Google Scholar). TUNEL staining of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells after a 24-h challenge with rotenone (2 μm) demonstrated that nuclear DNA undergoes fragmentation upon rotenone treatment. In agreement with all our earlier data, this fragmentation was partially blocked in cells subjected to chronic inhibition of GSK-3 prior to rotenone exposure (Fig. 2, C and D). In summary, we conclude that chronic inhibition of GSK-3 by either specific chemical inhibitors or gene transfer of a dead-kinase mutant effectively blocks the apoptotic"

These critical factors have been implicated as both positive and negative regulators of transcription, varying by promoter and differentiation state of the cell. The Mediator complex, a ubiquitous conserved complex of ∼30 subunits, facilitates transcription by coordinating RNA polymerase II binding to target promoters via gene-specific activators and can be divided into several functional subcomplexes. Med12 is part of a subcomplex of four proteins associated with the core Mediator complex and has been found to function both in repressing and activating transcription when recruited to target promoters. We identified an interaction between Med12 and Nanog and present evidence of involvement of Med12 in regulation of Nanog function. Gene expression analysis of embryonic stem cells knocked down for Med12 showed a similarity to Nanog knockdown, with increased expression of Nanog-repressed targets and decreased expression of Nanog-activated targets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that Med12 and Nanog co-occupied Nanog target promoters in embryonic stem cells and that Med12 dissociated from target promoters upon differentiation with kinetics similar to Nanog. Our results indicate that Nanog and Med12 function in concert to regulate Nanog target genes and identify a novel role for Med12 in embryonic stem cell regulation.

Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A. Cell.. 2005; 122: 947-956Google Scholar). In addition to promoting their own expression, these factors are required for the transcriptional activation of a number of additional ES cell-specific factors (1Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat.

Young R.A. Cell.. 2005; 122: 947-956Google Scholar). Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 are also bound to the promoters of cell lineage-specific genes, which are maintained in a repressed state in ES cells until differentiation is induced and which become derepressed at carefully defined stages of embryonic development. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Nanog or Oct4 initiates expression from these repressed targets, suggesting that these core pluripotency factors actively participate in gene repression (1Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet.. 2006; 38: 431-440Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the observation that many developmentally repressed genes that are occupied by Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 are also occupied by PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2), which includes the histone methyltransferase Suz12 (3Lee T.I. Jenner R.G. Boyer L.A. Guenther M.G. Levine S.S. Kumar R.M. Chevalier B. Johnstone S.E. Cole M.F. Isono K. Koseki H. Fuchikami T. Abe K. Murray H.L. Zucker J.P. Yuan B. Bell G.W. Herbolsheimer E.

Maintenance of pluripotency by Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 is likely a bimodal mechanism, requiring both activation and repression of target genes. Similar dual mechanisms are seen in a number of developmental signaling pathways. Gli2, a downstream effector of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, contains both positive and negative transcriptional regulatory domains (4Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development (Camb.).. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Google Scholar). In addition, the transcriptional co-activator CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein)/p300 has been shown to both positively and negatively regulate the Wnt signaling pathway (5Li J. Sutter C. Parker D.S. Blauwkamp T. Fang M. Cadigan K.M. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2284-2294Google Scholar). Thus far, the means by which Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 exert their positive and negative influences on transcriptional programs remains unclear. Recently, it was shown that CBP/p300 is recruited to sequences bound by clusters of transcription factors that include Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 and resemble transcription enhanceosomes (6Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V. Govindarajan K.R. Leong B. Shahab A. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Sung W.K. Clarke N.D. Wei C.L. Ng H.H. Cell.. 2008; 133: 1106-1117Google Scholar). This finding may provide a clue to the mechanism by which Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 can function in an activator context. In an effort to further understand the mechanisms regulating ES cell pluripotency, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid screening method to identify interacting partners of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2. One intriguing hit from a screen using Nanog as bait was a subunit of the Mediator complex, Med12. The Mediator complex is a large multisubunit complex that links gene-specific transcriptional activators with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) general transcription machinery (for review, see Ref. 7Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 2005; 30: 256-263Google Scholar). It consists of a highly conserved core of 20–25 subunits and also associates with other distinct stable subcomplexes. One such subcomplex is composed of Med12 (TRAP230), Med13 (TRAP240), Cdk8 (SRB10), and CycC (SRB11) (for review, see Ref. 8Philibert R.A. Madan A. Pharmacogenomics.. 2007; 8: 909-916Google Scholar). This subcomplex is involved in regulating distinct gene expression programs during development. In Drosophila, the homologs of Med12 and Med13, Kohtalo and Blind Spot, play a critical role in eye development (9Loncle N. Boube M. Joulia L. Boschiero C. Werner M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 1045-1054Google Scholar). In addition, the homolog of Med12 acts as a co-activator for Sox9-dependent neural crest development in zebrafish (10Rau M.J. Fischer S. Neumann C.J. Dev. Biol.. 2006; 296: 83-93Google Scholar) and is required for asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Yoda A. Kouike H. Okano H. Sawa H. Development (Camb.).. 2005; 132: 1885-1893Google Scholar). Recent work has also identified a role for Med12 in endoderm development in zebrafish (12Shin C.H. Chung W.S. Hong S.K. Ober E.A. Verkade H. Field H.A. Huisken J. Stainier D.Y. Dev. Biol.. 2008; 317: 467-479Google Scholar). The involvement of Med12 in embryonic development suggests that Med12 could also play a role in ES cell regulation. Although the core Mediator complex is thought to be universally required at all RNAPII promoters, the subcomplexes that associate with it may confer distinct regulatory functions to a subset of promoters depending on their interaction with specific activators. In addition, there is evidence that the Med12-Med13-Cdk8-CycC subcomplex may be involved in both positive and negative transcriptional regulation of promoters to which this subcomplex is targeted (9Loncle N. Boube M. Joulia L. Boschiero C. Werner M. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 1045-1054Google Scholar, 13Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 1997; 13: 1-23Google Scholar, 14Zhu X. Wiren M.

The Med12 subcomplex has been thought to prohibit the recruitment of RNAPII by the Mediator complex (17Elmlund H. Baraznenok V. Lindahl M. Samuelsen C.O. Koeck P.J. Holmberg S. Hebert H. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 15788-15793Google Scholar); however, Med12 positively regulates Wnt-responsive genes via interaction with β-catenin (18Kim S. Xu X. Hecht A. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 14066-14075Google Scholar, 19Carrera I. Janody F. Leeds N. Duveau F. Treisman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2008; 105: 6644-6649Google Scholar). The proposed ability of the Med12 subcomplex to both positively and negatively regulate gene expression makes it a potential regulatory cofactor by which Nanog may exert its dual regulation. In addition to confirming the interaction between Med12 and Nanog, we sought to determine whether Med12 is essential for Nanog signaling and maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Med12 had a similar effect on Nanog target promoters as knockdown of Nanog, suggesting that Med12 may play a unique role within the Nanog transcription network. Moreover, we found that Med12 and Nanog co-occupied many Nanog target promoters in ES cells and that they dissociated from these promoters upon differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest that Med12 and Nanog function together to regulate Nanog target gene promoters. ES Cell Culture—Pluripotent murine ES cells (J1 or 129/B6) were maintained on gelatin-coated plates in Knockout™ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 1× l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1 × 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; ESGRO, Chemicon), and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and were routinely passaged at 75% confluency. Differentiation of ES cells was induced by removal of LIF and addition of 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) to the medium. 129/B6 cells expressing Nanog under a doxycycline-inducible system were grown in identical medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml doxycycline to maintain Nanog expression. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A mixed total cDNA library prepared from proliferating murine ES cells and ES cells cultured in the absence of LIF and presence of 5 μm RA for 5 days was used as prey against full-length murine Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 bait proteins and deletion mutants. Full-length Nanog and Sox2 self-activated in the screen, so the following protein fragments were used: C-terminal domain of Nanog (amino acids 94–305, including the homeodomain and C-terminal activation domain), N-terminal domain of Nanog (amino acids 1–157, including the homeodomain), C-terminal domain of Sox2 (amino acids 114–319, excluding the high mobility group (HMG) box), and N-terminal domain of Sox2 (amino acids 1–114, including the HMG box). The structure of the Med12 prey identified is not known. Hits were evaluated by direct sequencing and ranked for confidence using a proprietary algorithm (HyNet, Prolexys Pharmaceuticals) that is based on the number of times the specific interaction was seen, the number of unique interactors that have been identified by the bait, and the number of unique interactors identified using the prey hit as bait (reciprocal screen). The Nanog-Med12 and Sox2-Med12 hits identified in these screens were ranked as high confidence interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared from proliferating ES cells using NE-PER reagents (Pierce). The cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 2 mm and incubated on ice for 1 h to stabilize protein-protein interactions. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 1 m Tris to a final concentration of 20 mm. For 293T cells expressing full-length Nanog and Med12, whole cell lysates were prepared in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. No cross-linking agent was added to the 293T lysates. 150–200 μg of nuclear ES cell lysate or 293T lysate was incubated overnight with 8 μg of either anti-Med12 antibody (A300-774A, Bethyl Laboratories) or a rabbit IgG control antibody (R&D Systems) at 4 °C. Antibodies were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen), and proteins were eluted using 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) for analysis by Western blotting. Western Analysis—For Western analysis, antibodies to Stat3 (sc-7179, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Stat3 phospho-Tyr705 (ab30646, Abcam), and α-tubulin (CP06, Calbiochem) were used at 1:5000 dilution. Antibodies to Nanog (AB5731, Chemicon), Med12 (A300-774A, Bethyl Laboratories), Oct4 (ab19857, Abcam), and Sox2 (AB5603, Chemicon) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Antibodies to histone H3 (07-690, Upstate) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; sc-32233, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:16,000 dilution. RNA Interference—A mixture of four siRNA duplexes (SMARTpool, Dharmacon) targeting Med12, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, or single siRNA control duplexes targeting lamin or GL3 luciferase (Dharmacon) were diluted in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) to a working concentration of 600 nm. The transfection reagent DharmFECT 4 (Dharmacon) was separately diluted in Opti-MEM I to 7–14 μl/ml. Equal volumes of these working reagents were combined and added to gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (250 μl/well of a 12-well plate). Reagents were incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow siRNA-lipid complexes to form. During this time, cells were trypsinized and resuspended to 40,000 cells/ml in normal ES cell medium. 1.2 ml of this cell suspension was added to the transfection reagents. siRNAs were at a final concentration of 50 nm, and transfection reagents were at 0.59–1.17 μl/ml. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24–96 h, and cells were pelleted and lysed for RNA extraction or Western analysis. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total ES cell RNA was purified with the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.), DNase-treated (RQ1, Promega), and reverse-transcribed (iScript, Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were performed using 20 ng of cDNA, 1× TaqMan gene expression assay, and 1× TaqMan Fast Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI7500 fast real-time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan gene expression assays were purchased for Med12 (Mm00804032_m1), Oct4 (Mm00658129_gH), Sox2 (Mm00488369_s1), REST (Mm00803268_m1), Dkk1 (Mm00438422_m1), FoxH1 (Mm00514851_m1), Trp53 (Mm00441964_g1), Cdx2 (Mm00432449_m1), Cldn4 (Mm00515514_ s1), Bmp4 (Mm00432087_m1), Nefl (Mm01315666_m1), GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1), Pgk1 (Mm00435617_m1), and Stat3 (Mm00456961_m1). Upon initiation of these studies, a TaqMan assay for Nanog was unavailable, so a custom TaqMan assay was created: forward primer, 5′-TCCTCGCCCTTCCTCTGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGGACTTGAGAGCTTTTGTTTGG-3′; and reporter sequence, 5′-CAGCCCTGATTCTTCT-3′. Results were subsequently confirmed with Nanog TaqMan assay Mm02384862_g1. Average threshold values (CT) from two to three PCRs were determined for target genes, and these values were normalized to average GAPDH values (ΔCT). Changes in gene expression were calculated as -fold change compared with control samples using the comparative ΔΔCT method. To determine the significance of differences between cells treated with target siRNAs and lamin siRNA, GraphPad Prism was used to conduct a one-way analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc Tukey's test. The p value used for significance in Fig. 2 is <0.001, with n = 2; that for Fig. 3 is <0.001, with n = 2; and that for Fig. 4 is <0.05, with n = 3 except where not significant, which is noted in the figure.FIGURE 3Total Stat3 and phospho-Tyr705 Stat3 levels are not reduced by Med12 knockdown. A and B, Stat3 transcript levels were measured by qPCR from 129/B6 or J1 ES cells that were maintained in the absence and presence, respectively, of 125 nm RA following knockdown of the indicated target gene. Cells were maintained in the presence of LIF except where indicated. Gene expression is indicated relative to lamin (control) siRNA-treated cells. Graphs represent an average of duplicate reactions, with error bars indicating S.D. No significant decrease was seen between the lamin control siRNA and the other siRNA knockdowns (p > 0.05, n = 2). C, total Stat3 and activated Stat3 (phospho-Tyr705) protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting using the same cells as in A and B. Values in each blot were normalized to tubulin and are indicated relative to lamin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Med12 regulates Nanog target promoters but not Oct4/Sox2 target promoters.

Gene expression is indicated relative to lamin (control) siRNA-treated cells. Graphs represent the average of triplicate reactions, with error bars indicating S.D. All changes in gene expression were significant (p < 0.05) except where noted (NS).

Data analysis was done using Bioconductor Version 2.3. Data QC of the CEL files was performed through box plots, MA plots, RNA degradation plots, and visual inspection of the pseudo-image. Data normalization was done using the MAS5 algorithm, and one-way analysis of variance analysis was done on predefined sample groups, with n = 3. The heat map was generated using z-scores across all samples. For the heat maps, genes whose expression was changed ≥2.0-fold relative to lamin siRNA-treated cells were sorted in order of -fold change. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using 2 × 107 ES cells as described in the on-line protocol provided by Millipore. Purified DNA was amplified with primers spanning promoter regions as indicated using SYBR PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Relative enrichment was calculated as 2^(ΔCT(control ChIP) -ΔCT(experimental ChIP)), where ΔCT is equal to the CT(immunoprecipitated sample) - CT(input). For normalization to the Pgk1 promoter, the relative enrichment for each triplicate sample was divided by the relative enrichment for the Pgk1 promoter. Graphs represent the average of three triplicate reactions, with error bars marking S.D. Anti-Nanog antibody was from Cosmo Bio Co. (REC-RCAB0002P-F). We designed primers for qPCR based on genomic locations published as regions where Oct4, Nanog, or Sox2 was bound (1Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. Lipovich L. Kuznetsov V.A. Robson P. Stanton L.W. Wei C.L. Ruan Y. Lim B. Ng H.H. Nat. Genet.. 2006; 38: 431-440Google Scholar). The primers for the Pgk1 promoter (which does not contain any Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 consensus sequences) overlap the transcription start site and produce a 225-bp amplicon. The primers for the Bmp4 promoter overlap the Nanog-binding site at -5.5 kb from the transcription start site and produce a 250-bp amplicon. The primers for the Nefl promoter overlap the Nanog-binding site at -17 kb from the transcription start site and produce a 250-bp amplicon. The primers for the Nanog promoter overlap the Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 consensus site located at -0.2 kb from the transcription start site as well as 39 bp of the first exon and produce a 289-bp amplicon. The primers for the REST promoter overlap the Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 consensus site located at -3.1 kb from the transcription start site and produce a 250-bp amplicon. The primers for the Dkk1 promoter overlap the Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 consensus site at -4.4 kb from the transcription start site and produce a 250-bp amplicon. The primer sequences were as follows: Nanog primers, 5′-GGATGTCTTTAGATCAGAGGATGCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACAGAAAGAGCAAGACACCAACC-3′ (reverse); Bmp4 primers, 5′-ACAGCTGACCATGTTTGAAGAGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGGCCTGTGAAGAGAAAC-3′ (reverse); Nefl primers, 5′-AGTTCAGCCCTCCCTTTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCACTAACCCTGGCTGCAG-3′ (reverse); REST primers, 5′-GCATAAAGATCTGTGTAGGCAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTACTTGAAAGGCGTGAGCA-3′ (reverse); Dkk1 primers, 5′-AAATCAGCAAGTTCCCAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGCCCTGGAAGCTAAGGG-3′ (reverse); and Pgk1 primers, 5′-TTTCTGGGCTCAGAGGCTGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTCCAGCTTGTCCAAAGTCAGC-3′ (reverse). Med12 Interacts with Nanog—To identify proteins that interact with the core pluripotency factors, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens against a murine ES cell library using murine Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as bait in separate screens. As full-length Nanog and Sox2 self-activated, N- and C-terminal portions of the proteins were used for the screen. Among the interactors identified using Nanog and Sox2 as bait was Med12, a conserved component of the Mediator complex. Interaction of Med12 with Nanog and Sox2 mapped to the C-terminal domains of Nanog and Sox2, corresponding to previously mapped activation domains (20Kamachi Y. Cheah K.S. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 107-120Google Scholar, 21Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Cell Res.. 2003; 13: 499-502Google Scholar). We confirmed the interaction between Nanog and Med12 in ES cells by co-immunoprecipitation, with Nanog protein co-precipitating with anti-Med12 antibody (Fig. 1A). This interaction was detectable only after cross-linking with DSP, indicating that the interaction may be transient or too unstable to survive the immunoprecipitation procedure. The cross-linking did not seem to increase nonspecific interactions, as histone H3, which was present in the lysate at levels similar to Nanog, did not co-precipitate with anti-Med12 antibody. To further validate this interaction, we expressed full-length Nanog and Med12 by transient transfections in 293T cells. Nanog co-precipitated with anti-Med12 antibody, and DSP was not required to detect this interaction (Fig. 1B). This result also indicates that no additional ES cell proteins, such as Sox2 and Oct4, are required to mediate the interaction between Nanog and Med12. However, we were unable to confirm an interaction between Med12 and Sox2 in ES cells through co-immunoprecipitation. Med12 Is Required for Nanog Expression and ES Cell Pluripotency—Given the role of Med12 as part of a transcriptional cofactor subcomplex, we asked whether it functions in regulating the expression of Nanog or Nanog target genes. To do this, we first utilized siRNA-mediated knockdown to reduce levels of Med12 in murine ES cells. 24 h after siRNA treatment of 129/B6 or J1 ES cells, Med12 transcript levels were reduced by 80–90% relative to a lamin siRNA control (data not shown), and these levels were maintained through 96 h as determined by qPCR (Fig. 2A). Med12 protein was also reduced by at least 80% at 96 h (Fig. 2B). qPCR analysis of Nanog transcript levels in J1 and 129/B6 cells revealed that Med12 knockdown reduced Nanog transcripts by 55–65% at 96 h (Fig. 2A). Nanog protein levels were also similarly reduced upon knockdown of Med12 (Fig. 2B), indicating that Med12 is required for Nanog expression in ES cells. Knockdown of Med12 also caused the cells to undergo differentiation, as shown by the increase in markers of primitive ectoderm (Fgf5) and mesoderm (Hand1) (Fig. 2C). The expression patterns and levels of these lineage markers closely mimic those induced by Nanog siRNA and show less similarity to Sox2 siRNA knockdown, indicating that the major role for Med12 in ES cell pluripotency may be the maintenance of Nanog and/or Nanog target genes. To determine whether Med12 has a role in pluripotency outside of maintaining Nanog levels, we knocked down Med12 expression in cells that express Nanog from a doxycycline-inducible system. In the presence of doxycycline, the levels of Nanog protein were maintained in the absence of LIF (Fig. 2D), and this was sufficient to rescue the expression of the pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, and Rex1 from LIF withdrawal (Fig. 2E). Although the milder reduction of Nanog protein levels resulting from Med12 knockdown was also rescued by doxycycline, the corresponding reduction of pluripotency factors was unaffected. This suggests that Med12 has a role in addition to maintaining Nanog expression and may be required for Nanog activity at its target genes. Med12 Regulates nanog Independently of Stat3 Signaling—Although direct transcriptional regulation of Nanog expression by Med12 would be the most likely mechanism, we could not discount the possibility that Med12 functions through a more peripheral pathway. To gain further insight into the mechanism by which Med12 regulates Nanog, we sought to examine signaling pathways critical to Nanog expression. The LIF signaling pathway, known to play a critical role in maintaining ES cell pluripotency in murine ES cells, facilitates Stat3 phosphorylation upon interaction with the activated LIF receptor/gp130 heterodimer (22Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev.. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Google Scholar, 23Boiani M. Scholer H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2005; 6: 872-884Google Scholar). This leads to activated Stat3, which dimerizes and localizes to the nucleus (22Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev.. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Google Scholar), where it binds to the Nanog enhancer and critically regulates Nanog gene expression (24Suzuki A. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Morita M. Matsui T. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Google Scholar). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is also critical for Nanog expression and ES cell pluripotency, by cooperating with the LIF pathway to up-regulate Stat3 (25Hao J. Li T.G. Qi X. Zhao D.F.

The mechanism whereby endothelin-1 stimulates THAL NO is unknown. We hypothesized that endothelin-1 stimulates THAL NO production by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), stimulating Akt activity, and phosphorylating NOS3 at Ser1177. This enhances NO production and inhibits sodium transport. We measured 1) NO production by fluorescence microscopy using DAF2-DA, 2) Akt activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based Akt reporter, 3) phosphorylated NOS3 and Akt by Western blotting, and 4) NKCC2 activity by fluorescence microscopy. In isolated THAL, endothelin-1 (1 nmol/liter) increased NO production from 0.23 ± 0.24 to 2.81 ± 0.32 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.001; n = 5) but failed to stimulate NO production in THALs isolated from NOS3–/– mice. Wortmannin (150 nmol/liter), a PI3K inhibitor, reduced endothelin-1-stimulated NO by 83% (0.49 ± 0.13 versus 3.31 ± 0.49 fluorescence units/min for endothelin-1 alone; p < 0.006; n = 5). Endothelin-1 stimulated Akt activity by 0.16 ± 0.02 arbitrary units as measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (p < 0.001; n = 5) and increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 by 56 ± 11% (p < 0.002; n = 7). Dominant-negative Akt blocked endothelin-1-induced NO by 60 ± 8% (p < 0.001 versus control; n = 6), and an Akt inhibitor had a similar effect. Endothelin-1 increased phosphorylation of NOS3 at Ser1177 by 89 ± 24% (p < 0.01; n = 7) but had no effect on Ser633. Endothelin-1 inhibited NKCC2 activity, an effect that was blocked by dominant-negative Akt and NOS inhibition. We conclude that endothelin-1 stimulates THAL NO production by activating PI3K, stimulating Akt activity, and phosphorylating NOS3 at Ser1177.

NO produced by both NOS1 and NOS3 (neuronal and endothelial NOS 2The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; l-NAME, l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester.) contributes to this effect (7Nakano D.

Endothelin-1 appears to be one factor that stimulates NO production by both enzymes in the kidney (7Nakano D. Pollock J.S. Pollock D.M. Am. J.

Inhibition of endothelin-induced NOS activation can cause salt-sensitive hypertension (6Ahn D. Ge Y. Stricklett P.K. Gill P. Taylor D. Hughes A.K. Yanagisawa M. Miller L. Nelson R.D. Kohan D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The thick ascending limb reabsorbs ∼30% of the filtered NaCl, and improper regulation of sodium reabsorption by this segment has been implicated in salt-sensitive hypertension (11Zou A.P. Drummond H.A. Roman R.J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 631-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garcia N.H. Plato C.F. Stoos B.A. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, studying the effects of endothelin-1 on the thick ascending limb is physiologically significant. Endothelin-1 inhibits thick ascending limb NaCl reabsorption via stimulation of NO (9Plato C.F. Pollock D.M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F326-F333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NO has been shown to inhibit apical Na+-K+-2Cl– co-transport (NKCC2) (13Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F819-F825Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the main route for sodium entry in this segment and the first step in NaCl absorption (14Hebert S.C. Culpepper R.M. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F412-F431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hebert S.C. Culpepper R.M. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F432-F442PubMed Google Scholar). The thick ascending limb expresses all three NOS isoforms. The actions of endothelin-1 are likely due to NOS3 activation because 1) this isoform is responsible for regulating thick ascending limb NaCl reabsorption (8Plato C.F. Shesely E.G. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 319-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) endothelin-1 stimulates NOS3 expression in the thick ascending limb (16Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F231-F235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, whether endothelin-1 acutely stimulates NO production via NOS3 activation in the thick ascending limb is uncertain. NOS3 can be activated by several signaling pathways, including those that involve Ca2+/calmodulin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In endothelial cells, both pathways are important. However, in the thick ascending limb, only the latter has been shown to activate NOS3 (17Plato C.F. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F679-F686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling cascades that activate NOS3 in the thick ascending limb and endothelial cells likely differ (19Pollock J.S. Carmines P.K. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which endothelin-1 stimulates NOS3 and inhibits sodium transport in this segment are unknown. We hypothesized that endothelin-1 stimulates thick ascending limb NO production by activating PI3K, stimulating Akt activity, and phosphorylating NOS3 at Ser1177. This enhances NO production and inhibits sodium transport. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kalamazoo, MI) and C57BL/6J and NOS3 knock-out (–/–) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were fed a diet containing 0.22% sodium and 1.1% potassium (Purina, Richmond, IN) for at least 7 days. On the day of the experiment, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally) and xylazine (20 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally). Medullary Thick Ascending Limb Suspensions—Suspensions of thick ascending limbs were obtained from rats weighing 150–220 g as reported previously (20Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F58-F64Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A solution containing 130 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.5 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 6 mmol/liter alanine, 1 mmol/liter disodium citrate, 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, 2 mmol/liter calcium lactate, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4) was used (Solution A). This procedure yields a 92% pure suspension of thick ascending limbs (16Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F231-F235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and therefore, the contributions of other cell types in our preparation (if any) were minimal. Measurement of NO Production by Fluorescence Microscopy—One-tenth of the thick ascending limb suspension was seeded at 4 °C in a chamber designed for live cell imaging on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-U). After 5 min, the bath was started at 0.3 ml/min, and the chamber was warmed to 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. The bath was Solution A plus 50 μmol/liter l-arginine, the substrate for NOS. At this concentration, l-arginine supports NO production but does not alone stimulate NO production (21Ortiz P.A. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Tubules were loaded with the NO-selective fluorescent dye DAF2-DA (5 μmol/liter; EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ) for 15 min, followed by a 30-min wash. Tubules were imaged using a 100× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.3), and the dye was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm. The fluorescence emitted by NO-bound dye (>500 nm) was measured using a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with data acquisition and analysis software (VisiTech International). Measurements were recorded once every 30 s for a 5-min control period. Either endothelin-1 (1 nmol/liter; Bachem, Torrance, CA) or vehicle (0.005% acetic acid) was then added to the bath. Fluorescence was measured once every 30 s during a 15-min experimental period. NO production was calculated from the slope of the initial rate of increase in DAF2 fluorescence. In some experiments, wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor; 150 nmol/liter; Sigma) or Akt inhibitor IV (5 μmol/liter; EMD Biosciences) was added to the bath during the last 5 min of the washing period as indicated below. We did not use isolated and perfused thick ascending limbs because we have reported that flow stimulates NO production by this segment (18Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Measurement of NOS3 and Akt Phosphorylation by Western Blotting—Thick ascending limb suspensions obtained from the same rat were divided into four 2-ml centrifuge tubes and incubated for 15 min in 250 μl of Solution A at 37 °C. Then, 250 μl of Solution A were added to tubes 1 and 2, whereas 250 μl of Solution A plus wortmannin were added to tubes 3 and 4 (final concentration of 150 nmol/liter). All tubes were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, 500 μl of Solution A containing (final concentration) 1) 0.005% acetic acid (vehicle), 2) endothelin-1 (1 nmol/liter), 3) wortmannin (150 nmol/liter), and 4) endothelin-1 plus wortmannin were added to the tubes, respectively. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, suspensions were cooled by adding 1 ml of ice-cold Solution A to each tube. Tubules were centrifuged and lysed by vortexing in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 300 mmol/liter sucrose, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 μg/ml anti-pain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mmol/liter benzamidine, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.105 mol/liter 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). A 1:100 dilution of phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (EMD Biosciences) was added to the buffer prior to use. Samples were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant measured. For total and phosphorylated NOS3, 5 and 50 μg of total protein, respectively, were loaded into each lane of an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 mmol/liter Tris, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, 5% nonfat dried milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 60 min and then with a 1:1000 dilution of a NOS3-specific monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), a 1:1000 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against NOS3 phosphorylated at Ser1177 (BD Transduction Laboratories), or a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against NOS3 phosphorylated at Ser633 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with buffer containing 20 mmol/liter Tris, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a secondary antibody against the appropriate IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction products were detected with a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was detected by exposure to Fuji RX film and quantified by densitometry. For phosphorylated Akt, the process was similar except that 1) 5 μg of protein and 2) a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used to detect Akt phosphorylated at Ser473. Total NOS3 was used as control for loading. The data are expressed as percent change in the protein of interest/NOS3 at each time point. Akt Reporter—Akt activity was measured using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Akt reporter. The Akt reporter BKAR was generously provided by Drs. Alexandra C. Newton and Maya T. Kunkel (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California at San Diego) (22Kunkel M.T. Ni Q. Tsien R.Y. Zhang J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). An increase in cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) ratio indicates increased Akt activity. The probe was subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pVQ Ad5CMV K-NpA, which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter, and sent to ViraQuest (North Liberty, IA) for viral production. Dominant-negative Akt—Dominant-negative Akt plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Boston University School of Medicine). Dominant-negative Akt is a mutant form (T308A/S473A) that cannot be activated by phosphorylation (23Luo Z. Fujio Y. Kureishi Y. Rudic R.D. Daumerie G. Fulton D. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative Akt and a scrambled DNA (control) were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pVQ Ad5CMV K-NpA and sent to ViraQuest for viral production. In Vivo Gene Delivery of the FRET-based Akt Reporter and Dominant-negative Akt—Thick ascending limbs were transduced in vivo with adenoviruses expressing 1) an Akt reporter, 2) dominant-negative Akt, or 3) a scrambled DNA sequence (all driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter) as we reported previously (24Ortiz P.A.

Hypertension. 2003; 42: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the left kidney of a 95–105-g rat was exposed via a flank incision, and the renal artery and vein were clamped. Four 20-μl virus injections (1 × 1012 particles/ml) were performed along the longitudinal axis of the kidney at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The clamp on the renal vessels was then released, the kidney was returned to the abdominal cavity, the muscle incision was sutured, and the skin was clipped. Expression of the reporter and dominant-negative Akt in the thick ascending limb was investigated by Western blotting at 3, 5, and 7 days after gene transfer. We found that maximum expression occurred 3–5 days after injection. Thus, all experiments were performed within these time points. Measurement of Akt Activity by FRET—The day of the experiment, thick ascending limb suspensions were obtained from the transduced kidney as indicated above, and one-fifth of the suspension was seeded in a temperature-controlled chamber and warmed to 37 °C. The flow rate of the bath (Solution A plus 50 μmol/liter arginine) was 0.3 ml/min. During the 30-min equilibration period, images were acquired (100× oil objective, numerical aperture = 1.3) by alternately exciting CFP (442 nm) and YFP (514 nm) and monitoring YFP emission at 540 nm to determine expression of the FRET sensor and to draw regions of interest. During the control period, CFP/YFP emission ratios were measured by exciting CFP at 442 nm once/min for 5 min and simultaneously monitoring CFP and YFP emissions at 440–480 nm (CFP) and 540–545 nm (YFP). At the end of the control period, endothelin-1 was added to the bath, and the CFP/YFP ratio was monitored once/min for 15 min. The averages corresponding to the 5-min control period and the last 5 min of the experimental period were compared. When wortmannin (150 nmol/liter) was used, it was added to the bath during the equilibration period. To confirm that the YFP signal was due to FRET, control experiments were performed by photobleaching CFP and measuring the decrease in YFP emission. Images were acquired using the same settings (laser intensity, detector gain and offset, resolution, and exposure time). Measurement of Na+-K+-2Cl– Co-transporter (NKCC2) Activity—Tubules were isolated and perfused as routinely done in our laboratory at 37 °C (26Garvin J.L. Burg M.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F57-F65PubMed Google Scholar). Thick ascending limbs were bathed for 15 min in Solution A containing 1 μmol/liter sodium green (Invitrogen) and washed for 20 min with Solution A containing 50 μmol/liter l-arginine. Tubules were perfused with a solution designed to prevent Na+-K+-2Cl– co-transport activity that contained 2.5 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 6 mmol/liter l-alanine, 1 mmol/liter disodium citrate, 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, 2 mmol/liter calcium lactate, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 260 mmol/liter mannitol, and 100 μmol/liter dimethlyamiloride (to inhibit sodium/hydrogen exchange). During the control period, sodium green was excited at 488 nm every 5 s, and fluorescence greater than 515 nm was digitally imaged and recorded utilizing Metafluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Once a stable base line was obtained, the luminal perfusate was switched to one containing 140 mmol/liter sodium, 134 mmol/liter chloride, and 4 mmol/liter potassium. The initial increase in intracellular sodium caused by the switch is due to activation of Na+-K+-2Cl– co-transport and was used to calculate NKCC2 activity. The luminal solution was then switched back to one containing 4.5 mmol/liter sodium, 0 mmol/liter chloride, and 0 mmol/liter potassium. After 15 min, endothelin-1 (1 nmol/liter) was added to the bath. Ten min later, the luminal solution was switched again. In some experiments, the protocol was reversed. When 5 mmol/liter l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME) was used, it was present throughout the experiment. Statistics—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. All statistical analyses were performed by the Biostatistics Department at Henry Ford Hospital. Student’s t test was used to analyze data in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. In experiments in which the variance differed, Welch’s version of Student’s t test, which adjusts the degrees of freedom to account for the difference in variances, was used. A paired t test with Hochberg’s method for multiple comparisons was used to analyze data in Figs. 4 and 6. p < 0.05 was considered significant.FIGURE 2Effect of 150 nmol/liter wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, on endothelin-1-stimulated NO production by isolated thick ascending limbs.

In isolated thick ascending limbs from wild-type mice, 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 increased fluorescence by 3.81 ± 0.46 fluorescence units/min. In contrast, endothelin-1 failed to stimulate NO production by tubules from NOS3–/– mice (Δ= 0.38 ± 0.22 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice; n = 4) (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that endothelin-1 enhances NO production by thick ascending limbs via activation of NOS3 and that DAF2 is measuring NO. Because the remainder of our experiments were performed using rats, we repeated the above experiments in rat isolated thick ascending limbs. We found that 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 increased NO production by 2.81 ± 0.32 fluorescence units/min, whereas vehicle had no effect (0.23 ± 0.24 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.001; n = 5) (Fig. 1B). In the absence of endothelin-1, there was no change in NO, indicating that there was no photobleaching of the dye. We next studied the mechanism by which endothelin-1 stimulates NO production. Previously, we have shown that other factors that stimulate NO production in the thick ascending limb act via PI3K (17Plato C.F. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F679-F686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consequently, we first studied the effect of wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor. In isolated thick ascending limbs, 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 increased NO production by 3.31 ± 0.49 fluorescence units/min. In the presence of wortmannin (150 nmol/liter), endothelin-1 increased NO production by only 0.49 ± 0.13 fluorescence units/min (p < 0.004 versus endothelin-1 alone; n = 5) (Fig. 2), an inhibition of 83%. Wortmannin alone did not change basal fluorescence. These data suggest that endothelin-1 stimulates thick ascending limb NO production via PI3K activation. Akt mediates most of the actions of PI3K (27Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar, 28Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

To study how PI3K stimulates NO production, we first measured Akt activity and phosphorylation. In isolated transduced thick ascending limbs, 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 increased Akt activity by 0.16 ± 0.02 from the base line (p < 0.001; n = 5). The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (150 nmol/liter) completely blunted this effect (0.02 ± 0.02 from the base line; n = 5) (Fig. 3). Control experiments showed no effect of time or wortmannin alone. Control experiments also showed that fluorescence emission from YFP was due to FRET from CFP rather than direct excitation of the dye. We also measured Akt phosphorylation and found that endothelin-1 increased phosphorylation at Ser473 by 53 ± 10% (p < 0.002; n = 7). In the presence of wortmannin (150 nmol/liter), endothelin-1 did not increase Akt phosphorylation (Δ= 6 ± 5% versus wortmannin alone; n = 7) (Fig. 4). Wortmannin alone significantly reduced Akt phosphorylation by 76 ± 3% (p < 0.001; n = 7). These data suggest that endothelin-1 enhances Akt activity via phosphorylation. Moreover, PI3K appears to regulate the basal phosphorylation state of Akt. To study whether endothelin-1 stimulates NO production via Akt activation, we next investigated the effect of inhibiting Akt on endothelin-induced NO production using dominant-negative Akt and Akt inhibitor IV. In tubules expressing scrambled DNA, endothelin-1 stimulated NO production by 5.14 ± 0.58 fluorescence units/min. Endothelin-1-induced NO production was significantly reduced in tubules expressing dominant-negative Akt (1.87 ± 0.26 fluorescence units/min; p < 0.001 versus scrambled; n = 6) (Fig. 5A). The Akt inhibitor also blocked stimulation of NO by endothelin-1 (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that endothelin-1 stimulates thick ascending limb NO production via activation of Akt. Phosphorylation of NOS3 at Ser1177 and Ser633 increases NO production (31Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Kemp B.E. Harrison D.G. Sessa W.C. Jo H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Scotland R.S. Morales-Ruiz M. Chen Y. Yu J. Rudic R.D. Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. Circ.

Stroke. 2005; 36: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances NO production, we measured the effect of endothelin-1 on NOS3 phosphorylation in the presence and absence of wortmannin. Endothelin-1 (1 nmol/liter) increased NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 by 85 ± 24% (p < 0.01; n = 6) in thick ascending limb suspensions. In the presence of wortmannin (150 nmol/liter), the ability of endothelin-1 to phosphorylate NOS3 at Ser1177 was completely blocked (6 ± 7% versus wortmannin alone; n = 7) (Fig. 6). However, wortmannin alone significantly reduced NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 by 38 ± 10% (p < 0.001; n = 7). Endothelin-1 did not affect phosphorylation of Ser633. These data suggest that endothelin-1 stimulates NOS3 by phosphorylating Ser1177 via activation of the PI3K pathway. Moreover, PI3K appears to regulate the basal phosphorylation state of NOS3. To investigate the physiological significance of the endothelin-1/PI3K/Akt/NO pathway, we measured the effect of l-NAME and dominant-negative Akt on the ability of endothelin-1 to inhibit thick ascending limb transport (Fig. 7). In isolated perfused tubules, 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 inhibited NKCC2 activity by 41 ± 3% (p < 0.01; n = 4). l-NAME (5 mmol/liter) blocked the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity (Δ= 9 ± 9%; n = 4). Next, we investigated the ability of endothelin-1 to inhibit NKCC2 activity in tubules expressing dominant-negative Akt. In tubules expressing scrambled DNA, endothelin-1 inhibited NKCC2 activity by 57 ± 6% (p < 0.01; n = 5). In contrast, in tubules expressing dominant-negative Akt, endothelin-1 failed to inhibit NKCC2 activity (17 ± 11%; n = 5). These data indicate that endothelin-1 inhibits NKCC2 activity via activation of Akt and NO in thick ascending limbs. Our hypothesis was that endothelin-1 inhibits thick ascending limb sodium reabsorption by stimulating PI3K, activating Akt, and phosphorylating NOS3 at Ser1177, thus enhancing NO production. To test this hypothesis, we first directly measured the effect of endothelin-1 on NO production by the thick ascending limb. We found that endothelin-1 stimulated thick ascending limb NO production. To investigate whether NOS3 is the NOS isoform responsible for the stimulatory effect of endothelin-1 on NO production, we measured the effect of endothelin-1 on NO production in thick ascending limbs isolated from wild-type and NOS3–/– mice. We found that endothelin-1 did not stimulate NO production in tubules isolated from NOS3–/– mice. Thus, endothelin-1 directly stimulates thick ascending limb NOS3 to increase NO production. After showing that endothelin-1 stimulated NO production, we next addressed the mechanism by which this occurs. We found that the PI3K inhibitor blocked endothelin-1-induced NO production. We then directly measured the effects of endothelin-1 on Akt activity using a FRET-based Akt sensor. We found that endothelin-1 activated Akt in thick ascending limbs and that wortmannin inhibited this effect. Activation was correlated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation, which was also blocked by wortmannin. The above data indicate that endothelin-1 stimulates Akt via PI3K, but they do not demonstrate that this signaling pathway is responsible for NOS3 activation. To test whether endothelin-1 stimulates NO production via Akt activation, we studied 1) the ability of endothelin-1 to increase thick ascending limb NO production in tubules expressing dominant-negative Akt and 2) the ability of an Akt inhibitor to block the stimulatory effect of endothelin-1. We found that expression of dominant-negative Akt reduced the ability of endothelin-1 to stimulate NO production, whereas expression of a scrambled DNA sequence did not. The Akt inhibitor also blocked the endothelin-1-induced increase in NO production. Taken together, these data show that endothelin-1 stimulates NO production by NOS3 via the PI3K/Akt pathway. To address the mechanism by which Akt stimulates NOS3 activity, we measured NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 and Ser633, both positive regulatory sites. Treatment with endothelin-1 increased NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 but had no effect on NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser633. Furthermore, wortmannin prevented endothelin-1-induced phosphorylation of NOS3 at Ser1177. These data suggest that in the thick ascending limb, endothelin-1 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to phosphorylation of NOS3 at Ser1177 and thus increased NO generation. To study the physiological relevance of the endothelin-1-stimulated Akt pathway, we next investigated whether NO and Akt mediate the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity in the thick ascending limb. This is the first and rate-limiting step in NaCl reabsorption in this segment. We found that endothelin-1 inhibited NKCC2 activity by 41%. The inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 was completely blocked by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. Thus, NO production is required for endothelin-1 to inhibit NKCC2 activity. Dominant-negative Akt also blocked the effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity, indicating that Akt activation is necessary for endothelin-1 to inhibit NKCC2. These data indicate that endothelin-stimulated NO production via the PI3K/Akt pathway is physiologically important. Our finding that endothelin stimulates NO production by NOS3 in the thick ascending limb is novel. To our knowledge, there have been no direct studies on the effects of endothelin-1 on this NOS isoform prior to our study. However, these data are consistent with previous findings. We showed that endothelin-1 stimulates NOS3 expression and NO production in primary cultures of thick ascending limbs (16Herrera M. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F231-F235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nakano et al. (7Nakano D. Pollock J.S. Pollock D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: F1205-F1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that endothelin-1 enhances NO production in the renal inner medulla, and Notenboom et al. (34Notenboom S. Miller D.S. Smits P. Russel F.G. Masereeuw R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F458-F464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have shown that it stimulates NO production by isolated proximal tubules. More recently, Stricklett et al. (35Stricklett P.K. Hughes A.K. Kohan D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1315-F1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that endothelin-1 increases NO production in rat inner medullary collecting duct suspensions. The finding that endothelin-1 stimulates NO production via the PI3K/Akt pathway appears to be different from endothelial cells. In the latter cell type, NOS3 activation occurs primarily via an increase in intracellular calcium (36Schmidt H.H. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Forstermann U. Murad F. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our conclusion that the PI3K/Akt pathway is the primary mechanism by which endothelin-1 stimulates NO production in the thick ascending limb is supported by several studies. Jesus Ferreira and Bailly (37Jesus Ferreira M.C. Bailly C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 749-758Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported no change in intracellular calcium in thick ascending limbs challenged with 10 nmol/liter endothelin-1. We have reported that luminal flow activates NOS3 via a PI3K-dependent pathway that involves phosphorylation of NOS3 at Ser1177 (18Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F281-F288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 38Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F274-F280Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We also found that the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine stimulates thick ascending limb NO production without measurable changes in intracellular calcium (17Plato C.F. Garvin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F679-F686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but PI3K activation is required. The finding that endothelin-1 stimulated NOS3 activity by enhancing Ser1177 phosphorylation while having no effect on Ser633 is consistent with other data. Other humoral and mechanical factors have been reported to acutely activate NOS3 via phosphorylation at this residue (30Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F.

Silva G.B. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results show that wortmannin alone decreased both Akt and NOS3 phosphorylation. These data suggest that PI3K is an important regulator of Akt activity and possibly sodium transport in the thick ascending limb under basal conditions. The fact that dominant-negative Akt decreased endothelin-1-stimulated NO production by 60%, whereas pharmacological inhibition of Akt resulted in complete blockade, is not surprising. The most likely explanation of these results is incomplete inhibition of endogenous Akt activity by the dominant-negative mutant. Complete blockade of endothelin-1-stimulated NO by the Akt inhibitor is not likely due to cytotoxicity. We tested for such a possibility and found that at the concentration used in our study, Akt inhibitor IV does not affect viability. Although dominant-negative Akt reduced NO production by 60%, it completely blocked the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity. These data may indicate that the NO concentration required to inhibit transport is above the remaining levels after dominant-negative Akt treatment. However, it may simply be due to differences in expression of dominant-negative Akt in the two groups of rats. In summary, we found that 1) endothelin-1 acutely stimulates NO production by isolated thick ascending limbs from rats and wild-type mice but not NOS3–/– mice; 2) wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, blocks endothelin-1-stimulated NO production and NOS3 phosphorylation; 3) endothelin-1 increases Akt activity and phosphorylates Akt at Ser473, and wortmannin blocks these effects; 4) dominant-negative Akt reduces the effect of endothelin-1 on NO production; 5) Akt inhibition prevents the endothelin-1-induced increase in thick ascending limb NO production; 6) endothelin-1 acutely phosphorylates NOS3 at Ser1177, a positive regulatory site, and wortmannin blocks this effect; 7) l-NAME blocks the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity; and 8) dominant-negative Akt blocks the inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on NKCC2 activity. Therefore, we conclude that endothelin-1 activates PI3K, inducing phosphorylation and activation of Akt, which in turn phosphorylates NOS3, resulting in increased NO production and inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. Given the importance of NO in the regulation of thick ascending limb NaCl absorption (25Ortiz P.A. Hong N.J. Wang D. Garvin J.L. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this mechanism likely plays an important role in the regulation of thick ascending limb NO production and sodium homeostasis.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2003; 67: 593-656Google Scholar). The prototypical LPS molecule consists of three distinct regions: a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A, a core oligosaccharide (OS), and an O-polysaccharide (O-PS) (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2002; 71: 635-700Google Scholar). LPS molecules isolated from bacterial cultures form a complex mixture. Some comprise only the lipid A and core OS and are known as “rough” LPS, whereas others are “smooth” (S-LPS) and capped by O-PS. When separated by SDS-PAGE, most S-LPS profiles reveal a strain- or serotype-specific range of modal O-PS chain lengths that vary by repeat unit increments. Lipid A and the core OS are synthesized by a sequential assembly process, and the product is exported across the inner membrane by MsbA (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2002; 71: 635-700Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2007; 76: 295-329Google Scholar). Synthesis of the O-PS occurs separately by one of two principal pathways that involve fundamentally different processes: the ABC transporter-dependent pathway or the Wzy-dependent pathway (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2002; 71: 635-700Google Scholar, 4Valvano M.A. Front. Biosci... 2003; 8: s452-s471Google Scholar). In the ABC transporter-dependent pathway, polymerization of the O-PS occurs at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. Initiation of synthesis requires an undecaprenol pyrophosphate-linked (und-PP) N-acetamido sugar. In Escherichia coli, this lipid-linked residue is typically N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Und-PP-GlcNAc is formed by the action of WecA, the N-acetylglucosamine:undecaprenylphosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase first identified in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (5Meier-Dieter U.

Serotype-specific glycosyltransferases then extend the und-PP-GlcNAc acceptor by sequentially transferring sugar residues to the non-reducing terminus of the growing chain. After polymerization is complete, the O-PS is exported to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane by the action of an ABC transporter (10Zhang L. Al-Hendy A. Toivanen P. Skurnik M. Mol.

O antigen ABC transporters are comprised of two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) encoded by wzm and wzt, respectively.

A novel feature of the polymannose O antigens and some other O-PSs assembled by ABC transporter-dependent pathways is the presence of unique residues at the non-reducing termini of the glycan chains. The polymannose O chains terminate at the non-reducing end in a methyl group (E. coli O8) or both a phosphate and a methyl group (E. coli O9 and O9a) (24Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L.

In the E. coli O9a prototype, the wbdD gene product is a bifunctional kinase-methyltransferase with the kinase activity being a prerequisite for the addition of the methyl residues (23Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 35709-35718Google Scholar). The action of WbdD is central to the establishment of the unique modal chain length distribution of the O-PS, but chain termination also couples biosynthesis to export because wbdD mutants can synthesize the O9a polysaccharide but are unable to export it (23Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 35709-35718Google Scholar). This phenotype was explained by the finding that the NBD (Wzt) protein contains an extended C-terminal domain that binds and is specific for the chain-terminating residue (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar, 13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar). Specificity is imparted by an extended C-terminal region in the Wzt protein that folds to form a substrate-specific O-PS-binding domain (13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar). Some O-PSs that follow an ABC transporter-dependent assembly pathway lack a defined non-reducing terminal residue; the polygalactose O-PSs of K. pneumoniae provide one example (24Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.O. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 25070-25081Google Scholar). These O-PSs all contain a disaccharide repeat unit structure (d-galactan I) linked to the reducing terminal GlcNAc (26Whitfield C. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Yu S.H. J.

However, in other serotypes, d-galactan I may be capped by an additional serotype-specific domain that can define the structure of additional O antigens (e.g. O1 and O2c) (26Whitfield C. Perry M.B.

LPS isolated from cultures of these bacteria contains two types of S-LPS; one contains only d-galactan I, and the other contains short chains of d-galactan I capped by the additional antigen molecules (27Kol O.

Microbiol... 1993; 10: 615-625Google Scholar). When expressed in E. coli, the recombinant bacteria produce S-LPS containing only d-galactan I. The genes involved in the formation of the additional repeat unit structures are unknown, but their synthesis (and addition) is not required for d-galactan I O-PS export (30Kelly R.F. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol... 1996; 178: 5205-5214Google Scholar). The absence of a chain-terminating residue in some O-PSs suggests a different recognition process in coupling biosynthesis to export. Here we examine the assembly-export coupling system for the d-galactan I O-PS from K. pneumoniae and establish that this represents a second mechanism for ABC transporter-dependent O-PS assembly. The process is substantially different from the model established for the polymannose O-PSs. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in either Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or minimal medium containing M9 salts (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Minimal medium was supplemented where appropriate with histidine (22 μg/ml), tryptophan (20 μg/ml), and thiamine (1 μg/ml). Glucose (0.1–0.4%, w/v), mannose (0.1%, w/v), galactose (0.1%, w/v), or arabinose (0.002–0.4%, w/v) was added as required. The antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were added where appropriate.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmidsStrain/plasmidDescription or genotypeRef. or sourceE. coli CWG28Serotype O9a:K–, trp his lac rpsL cpsK30; Smr59Whtifield C.

DNA fragments were PCR-amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with custom oligonucleotide primers (Sigma). Where appropriate, the primers included restriction sites to facilitate cloning. Purification of DNA fragments from agarose gels was carried out using the Ultraclean15 DNA purification kit (MOBIO Laboratories). The Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used to purify DNA fragments directly from PCRs or restriction digestions. Plasmid DNA of pBAD24 (34Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol... 1995; 177: 4121-4130Google Scholar) or pACYC 184 (35Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol... 1978; 134: 1141-1156Google Scholar) was purified using either the GeneElute plasmid purification kit (Sigma) or the Qiagen HiSpeed Midi kits (Qiagen). Restriction digestions and DNA ligation reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph). The λ red recombinase system (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 6640-6645Google Scholar) was used to create a Δwzx mutation in E. coli CS1776 (37Schnaitman C.A. Austin E.A. J. Bacteriol... 1990; 172: 5511-5513Google Scholar). Conditional Expression of d-Galactan I Biosynthesis and ABC Transporter Genes—Cultures of E. coli CWG869 containing pWQ290 and pWQ289 were grown overnight in LB medium containing 0.4% glucose (to repress expression from the pBAD promoter and prevent O2a transporter expression from pWQ290) with the appropriate antibiotics. The cultures were then diluted 1:100 into 5-ml batches of fresh medium. To one culture, arabinose and galactose were added simultaneously once the cells reached an A600 of ∼0.4. For conditions involving induction of the O2a transporter prior to d-galactan I synthesis, cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼0.4, and arabinose (0–0.2%, w/v) was added to initiate O2a transporter expression. Incubation was continued for 10 min, and galactose (0.1%, w/v) was then added to initiate d-galactan I synthesis. The cells were allowed to grow to an A600 of ∼0.6. For induction of the O2a transporter after d-galactan I synthesis, the order of addition of arabinose and galactose was reversed. In an experiment designed to show whether synthesis of the polymer and export were coupled, a “pulse-chase” approach was used. Galactose (pulse) was added to the growth medium at an A600 of ∼0.4, and cells were grown for 10 min to allow for d-galactan I synthesis. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min and washed twice in prewarmed medium to prevent further de novo synthesis of polymer. The cells were then resuspended in medium supplemented with arabinose (chase). In all cases, incubation was continued for 10 min at which time cells were harvested for LPS analysis. Comparable experiments were performed using E. coli O9a except galactose was replaced by mannose, and the cells were grown in supplemented M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose or 0.2% glycerol where appropriate. To determine whether synthesis and export of the polymannose O-PS were coupled, cells were also washed in M9 minimal salts supplemented with glycerol prior to mannose addition to remove any residual glucose that would suppress mannose uptake. The cells were held in the M9 minimal medium supplemented with mannose for 2 min and then collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice in prewarmed medium supplemented with glycerol, then resuspended in M9 minimal medium with glycerol as the carbon source and supplemented with arabinose or glucose, and allowed to grow for 10 min before the cells were harvested. In the pulse-chase experiment the low copy number pBAD322-Cm derivative (38Cronan J.E. Plasmid.. 2006; 55: 152-157Google Scholar) pWQ346 was used. Complete repression of O9a transporter expression from the equivalent (high copy) pBAD24 construct was difficult to achieve. LPS Analysis—Proteinase K-digested whole-cell lysates were prepared to examine LPS by SDS-PAGE by the methods of Hitchcock and Brown (39Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol... 1983; 154: 269-277Google Scholar). LPS was visualized by silver staining (40Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem... 1982; 119: 115-119Google Scholar). Western immunoblots were prepared by transferring the samples to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primary antibody, d-galactan I-specific polyclonal antiserum, was raised in New Zealand White rabbits immunized with formalin-killed whole cells of K. pneumoniae CWK49. To prepare d-galactan I-specific antibodies, immune serum was adsorbed with whole cells of E. coli CWG869. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) was used for detection. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cultures were grown overnight in LB broth supplemented with 0.4% glucose. Bacteria were subcultured 1:50 into 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with either galactose or mannose (0.1% final concentration) and varying concentrations of arabinose as required. Cultures were then grown for ∼2.5 h. Immunofluorescence labeling of intact and permeabilized cells was performed as described previously (23Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 35709-35718Google Scholar) using either d-galactan I-specific or O9a-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Detection was performed using rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmnoResearch Laboratories). Visualization was carried out using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a 100× objective lens, and the images were processed using Openlab software (Improvision). In Vitro Galactosyltransferase Assays—Membranes were prepared from 500-ml cultures of CWK49 transformed with pWQ391. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.6 in M9 minimal medium containing 0.2% glycerol; where appropriate, O2a transporter expression was induced by adding 0.2% l-arabinose. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. The cells were then resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Ultrasonication was used to lyse cells. Unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were then collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Galactosyltransferase assays were performed at 30 °C in 0.6-ml reaction volumes containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 606 nm UDP-[14C]galactose (258 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the membrane equivalent of 0.6 mg of total protein. In one set of experiments, bacitracin (500 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the reactions. Samples of 0.1 ml were withdrawn at intervals over a 30-min period and added to 0.3 ml of cold 12% acetic acid to stop the reaction. Samples were filtered onto MicroSep 0.45-μm cellulose filters (Osmonics) and washed twice with 12% acetic acid to remove residual UDP-[14C]galactose. Filters were dried and placed into 5 ml of Ecolite scintillation fluid (ICN Biomedicals), and radioactivity incorporated into polymer was measured by scintillation counting. Comparison of ABC Transporter Sequences—The NBDs from E. coli serotypes O8 and O9a share a highly conserved N-terminal domain containing all of the essential motifs that define ABC proteins (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar). They diverge in the serotype-specific C-terminal O-PS-binding domain (13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar). WztEcO9a is 413 amino acids in length, whereas wzt from K. pneumoniae encodes a significantly shorter protein of 246 amino acids. WztKpO2a and the N-terminal domain of WztEcO9a are highly conserved (see Fig. 2). The absence of a comparable O-PS-binding domain in WztKpO2a raises questions concerning substrate recognition and specificity in the shorter Wzt proteins. The size and sequence of WztKpO2a are very similar to those of KpsT, the NBD protein involved in group 2 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) assembly systems in E. coli (14Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol... 1994; 14: 505-519Google Scholar, 41Bliss J.M. Garon C.F. Silver R.P. Glycobiology.. 1996; 6: 445-452Google Scholar). Interestingly the CPS transporters are conserved between different CPS serotypes and have no specificity for the repeat unit structure of their exported substrates. The transmembrane domains of ABC transporters are generally poorly conserved in primary sequence, but they have similar predicted secondary structures (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots illustrate the characteristic six transmembrane helices typical of the protein family. The distribution of these helices is similar in WzmKpO2a and WzmEcO9a (data not shown). The d-Galactan I Transporter Can Functionally Replace the ABC Transporter of E. coli O9a—The polymannose ABC transporters for the E. coli O8 and O9a O antigens are specific for their substrate (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar), a property imparted by a recognition domain of Wzt interacting with the terminating residues (13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar). The observation that d-galactan I in K. pneumoniae is often capped with additional repeat unit structures (Fig. 1) together with the absence of a C-terminal polymer recognition domain on the NBD (Fig. 2) suggested that the corresponding d-galactan I (O2a) ABC transporter may parallel the group 2 CPS ABC transporters in having relaxed specificity. To test this hypothesis, the ability of the K. pneumoniae O2a transporter to export the O9a polymannose O-PS was investigated. An E. coli CWG638 (O9a; manA,wzm-wzt::aphA-3) was transformed with pWQ290 containing the O2a transporter cloned behind an arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter. In this strain, polymannose biosynthesis is dependent on the addition of mannose to the growth medium. This is essential because in the absence of export synthesis of the O9a polymer is toxic and results in aberrant cell morphology (Fig. 3B) as reported previously (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar, 13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar). In the absence of transporter expression, only rough LPS is formed (Fig. 3A); however, expression of the O2a transporter resulted in the formation of S-LPS. Trace amounts of S-LPS (at the limits of detection in silver staining) were detectable after induction with 0.02% arabinose, and a clear ladder of S-LPS was evident with 0.2%. Notably the S-LPS exhibited the same O-PS chain length modality as the authentic product, indicating that normal synthesis and chain termination were unaffected by the heterologous transporter. Immunofluorescence completed on CWG638 harboring pWQ290 induced with 0.2% arabinose confirms that the O-PS is evident on the surface of the cells (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3The O2a ABC transporter shows relaxed substrate specificity. A, complementation studies were performed with CWG638 (Δwzm-wzt::aphA-3) transformed with pWQ290 (expressing the O2a ABC transporter). Shown is the silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels of LPS samples from whole-cell lysates of CWG638 (pWQ290) with arabinose titrated in to induce expression of the ABC transporter genes from the plasmid.

This suggests that specific interactions between the transmembrane domains and NBDs of the transporter are required for a functional transporter, an observation made previously with the E. coli O9a and O8 ABC transporters (12Cuthbertson L. Powers J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 30310-30319Google Scholar, 13Cuthbertson L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19529-19534Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2039721697,"RNA virus replication results in expression of double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA) molecules that trigger innate immune responses through interactions with both intracellular and extracellular receptors. We investigated the contributions of the extracellular and intracellular pathways to innate immunity in murine astrocyte primary cultures using polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic ds-RNA molecule designed to mimic RNA virus infection. Whereas extracellular poly I:C (naked poly I:C) mainly induced the expression of regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), intracellular delivery of poly I:C (complexed poly I:C) chiefly induced expression of IFN-beta and IL-6. Experiments with astrocytes from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) knockout mice indicated that naked poly I:C signals via a TLR-3-dependent NF-kappaB pathway. Complexed poly I:C induced the expression of the intracellular ds-RNA sensor proteins, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). However, transfection of astrocytes with dominant negative forms of the helicases implicated MDA-5, but not RIG-I, as the intracellular sensor of poly I:C. Complexed poly I:C-mediated MDA-5 stimulation transmitted ""downstream"" signals, resulting in activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3. Our results illustrate the intricacy of extracellular and intracellular ds-RNA recognition in viral infections of the central nervous system and indicate the importance of MDA-5 helicase as an intracellular ds-RNA sensor in astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2052700524,"gamma-Secretase is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease through production of amyloidogenic Abeta42 peptides. Early onset familial Alzheimer disease mutations in presenilin (PS), the catalytic core of gamma-secretase, invariably increase the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio. However, the mechanism by which these mutations affect gamma-secretase complex formation and cleavage specificity is poorly understood. We show that our in vitro assay system recapitulates the effect of PS1 mutations on the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio observed in cell and animal models. We have developed a series of small molecule affinity probes that allow us to characterize active gamma-secretase complexes. Furthermore we reveal that the equilibrium of PS1- and PS2-containing active complexes is dynamic and altered by overexpression of Pen2 or PS1 mutants and that formation of PS2 complexes is positively correlated with increased Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios. These data suggest that perturbations to gamma-secretase complex equilibrium can have a profound effect on enzyme activity and that increased PS2 complexes along with mutated PS1 complexes contribute to an increased Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1976669132,"The major lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1, a Link superfamily glycoprotein similar to the hyaluronan-binding/inflammatory leukocyte homing receptor CD44, was initially implicated in hyaluronan (HA)-mediated cell adhesion and lymph-borne hyaluronan metabolism. However, the apparently normal phenotype of Lyve-1 knock-out mice and the recent demonstration that the receptor undergoes cytokine-induced endocytosis independent of HA uptake have cast doubt on such functions. Here we present new data that reconcile these anomalies by showing that LYVE-1 is functionally ""silenced"" in a cell-specific fashion by autoinhibitory glycosylation. We demonstrate that LYVE-1 transfected in HEK 293T fibroblasts and Jurkat T cells is competent to bind HA, whereas the endogenous receptor in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells or the receptor transfected in Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells is not. Moreover, through a combination of mutagenesis and functional analysis in HEK 293T fibroblasts and glycosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, we reveal that the inhibitory mechanism is reversible and is exerted by terminal sialylation, most likely through alpha2-3 or alpha2-6 linkage to O-glycans. Finally, we provide evidence that the mechanism operates in vivo by showing that native LYVE-1 in primary lymphatic endothelial cells is extensively sialylated and that HA binding can be reactivated by neuraminidase treatment of the soluble ectodomain. These results reveal unexpected complexity in the regulation of LYVE-1 function and raise the possibility that this receptor, like CD44, may become active after appropriate unmasking in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2032383132,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of half of the human population, causing gastritis, ulcers, and cancer. H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation by exogenous DNA, and recombination during mixed infections of one stomach with multiple H. pylori strains generates extensive allelic diversity. We developed an in vitro transformation protocol to study genomic imports after natural transformation of H. pylori. The mean length of imported fragments was dependent on the combination of donor and recipient strain and varied between 1294 bp and 3853 bp. In about 10% of recombinant clones, the imported fragments of donor DNA were interrupted by short interspersed sequences of the recipient (ISR) with a mean length of 82 bp. 18 candidate genes were inactivated in order to identify genes involved in the control of import length and generation of ISR. Inactivation of the antimutator glycosylase MutY increased the length of imports, but did not have a significant effect on ISR frequency. Overexpression of mutY strongly increased the frequency of ISR, indicating that MutY, while not indispensable for ISR formation, is part of at least one ISR-generating pathway. The formation of ISR in H. pylori increases allelic diversity, and contributes to the uniquely low linkage disequilibrium characteristic of this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2011500745,"In the present study we address the question of whether the learning of task-irrelevant stimuli found in the paradigm of task-irrelevant learning (TIPL) [1]–[9] is truly task irrelevant. To test the hypothesis that associations that are beneficial to task-performance may develop between the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli, or the task-responses and the task-irrelevant stimuli, we designed a new procedure in which correlations between the presentation of task-irrelevant motion stimuli and the identity of task-targets or task-responses were manipulated. We found no evidence for associations developing between the learned (task-irrelevant) motion stimuli and the targets or responses to the letter identification task used during training. Furthermore, the conditions that had the greatest correlations between stimulus and response showed the least amount of TIPL. On the other hand, TIPL was found in conditions of greatest response uncertainty and with the greatest processing requirements for the task-relevant stimuli. This is in line with our previously published model that suggests that task-irrelevant stimuli benefit from the spill-over of learning signals that are released due to processing of task-relevant stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2069584042,"During development, all neurons have to decide on whether to cross the longitudinal midline to project on the contralateral side of the body. In vertebrates and invertebrates regulation of crossing is achieved by interfering with Robo signalling either through sorting and degradation of the receptor, in flies, or through silencing of its repulsive activity, in vertebrates. Here I show that in Drosophila a second mechanism of regulation exists that is independent from sorting. Using in vitro and in vivo assays I mapped the region of Robo that is sufficient and required for its interaction with Comm, its sorting receptor. By modifying that region, I generated new forms of Robo that are insensitive to Comm sorting in vitro and in vivo, yet still able to normally translate repulsive activity in vivo. Using gene targeting by homologous recombination I created new conditional alleles of robo that are sorting defective (robo(SD)). Surprisingly, expression of these modified proteins results in phenotypically normal flies, unveiling a sorting independent mechanism of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2145190228,"What kind of strategies subjects follow in various behavioral circumstances has been a central issue in decision making. In particular, which behavioral strategy, maximizing or matching, is more fundamental to animal's decision behavior has been a matter of debate. Here, we prove that any algorithm to achieve the stationary condition for maximizing the average reward should lead to matching when it ignores the dependence of the expected outcome on subject's past choices. We may term this strategy of partial reward maximization “matching strategy”. Then, this strategy is applied to the case where the subject's decision system updates the information for making a decision. Such information includes subject's past actions or sensory stimuli, and the internal storage of this information is often called “state variables”. We demonstrate that the matching strategy provides an easy way to maximize reward when combined with the exploration of the state variables that correctly represent the crucial information for reward maximization. Our results reveal for the first time how a strategy to achieve matching behavior is beneficial to reward maximization, achieving a novel insight into the relationship between maximizing and matching."
https://openalex.org/W2059455481,"Background von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by a spectrum of hypervascular tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, which occur with VHL genotype-specific differences in penetrance. VHL loss causes a failure to regulate the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α), resulting in accumulation of both factors to high levels. Although HIF dysregulation is critical to VHL disease-associated renal tumorigenesis, increasing evidence points toward gradations of HIF dysregulation contributing to the degree of predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other manifestations of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings This investigation examined the ability of disease-specific VHL missense mutations to support the assembly of the VBC complex and to promote the ubiquitylation of HIF. Our interaction analysis supported previous observations that VHL Type 2B mutations disrupt the interaction between pVHL and Elongin C but maintain partial regulation of HIF. We additionally demonstrated that Type 2B mutant pVHL forms a remnant VBC complex containing the active members ROC1 and Cullin-2 which retains the ability to ubiquitylate HIF-1α. Conclusions Our results suggest that subtypes of VHL mutations support an intermediate level of HIF regulation via a remnant VBC complex. These findings provide a mechanism for the graded HIF dysregulation and genetic predisposition for cancer development in VHL disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069233558,"Background Different presentations of treatment effects can affect decisions. However, previous studies have not evaluated which presentations best help people make decisions that are consistent with their own values. We undertook a pilot study to compare different methods for doing this. Methods and Findings We conducted an Internet-based randomized trial comparing summary statistics for communicating the effects of statins on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Participants rated the relative importance of treatment consequences using visual analogue scales (VAS) and category rating scales (CRS) with five response options. We randomized participants to either VAS or CRS first and to one of six summary statistics: relative risk reduction (RRR) and five absolute measures of effect: absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, event rates, tablets needed to take, and natural frequencies (whole numbers). We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' elicited values and treatment choices. 770 participants age 18 or over and literate in English completed the study. In all, 13% in the VAS-first group failed to complete their VAS rating, while 9% of the CRS-first group failed to complete their scoring (p = 0.03). Different ways of weighting the elicited values had little impact on the analyses comparing the different presentations. Most (51%) preferred the RRR compared to the other five summary statistics (1% to 25%, p = 0.074). However, decisions in the group presented the RRR deviated substantially from those made in the other five groups. The odds of participants in the RRR group deciding to take statins were 3.1 to 5.8 times that of those in the other groups across a wide range of values (p = 0.0007). Participants with a scientific background, who were more numerate or had more years of education were more likely to decide not to take statins. Conclusions Internet-based trials comparing different presentations of treatment effects are feasible, but recruiting participants is a major challenge. Despite a slightly higher response rate for CRS, VAS is preferable to avoid approximation of a continuous variable. Although most participants preferred the RRR, participants shown the RRR were more likely to decide to take statins regardless of their values compared with participants who were shown any of the five other summary statistics.

https://openalex.org/W2066521844,"Potassium channels are tetrameric proteins that mediate K(+)-selective transmembrane diffusion. For KcsA, tetramer stability depends on interactions between permeant ions and the channel pore. We have examined the role of pore blockers on the tetramer stability of KirBac1.1. In 150 mm KCl, purified KirBac1.1 protein migrates as a monomer (approximately 40 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. Addition of Ba(2+) (K(1/2) approximately 50 microm) prior to loading results in an additional tetramer band (approximately 160 kDa). Mutation A109C, at a residue located near the expected Ba(2+)-binding site, decreased tetramer stabilization by Ba(2+) (K(1/2) approximately 300 microm), whereas I131C, located nearby, stabilized tetramers in the absence of Ba(2+). Neither mutation affected Ba(2+) block of channel activity (using (86)Rb(+) flux assay). In contrast to Ba(2+), Mg(2+) had no effect on tetramer stability (even though Mg(2+) was a potent blocker). Many studies have shown Cd(2+) block of K(+) channels as a result of cysteine substitution of cavity-lining M2 (S6) residues, with the implicit interpretation that coordination of a single ion by cysteine side chains along the central axis effectively blocks the pore. We examined blocking and tetramer-stabilizing effects of Cd(2+) on KirBac1.1 with cysteine substitutions in M2. Cd(2+) block potency followed an alpha-helical pattern consistent with the crystal structure. Significantly, Cd(2+) strongly stabilized tetramers of I138C, located in the center of the inner cavity. This stabilization was additive with the effect of Ba(2+), consistent with both ions simultaneously occupying the channel: Ba(2+) at the selectivity filter entrance and Cd(2+) coordinated by I138C side chains in the inner cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2040206499,"Inter-α-inhibitor, TSG-6, and hyaluronan have important functions in fertility and inflammation. Two subunits of inter-α-inhibitor, the heavy chains, form covalent bonds with TSG-6 or hyaluronan in vitro. TSG-6-heavy chain complexes serve as intermediates in the transfer of heavy chains from inter-α-inhibitor to hyaluronan. In vivo, in addition to these complexes, stable ternary complexes of hyaluronan with both TSG-6 and heavy chains have been demonstrated in the ovulatory cumulus oophorus. In our ongoing efforts to characterize the multiple interactions between hyaluronan, TSG-6 and inter-α-inhibitor, we recently characterized the formation of highly stable complexes of TSG-6 with hyaluronan that had been tethered to a solid surface. Here we show that these hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes are functionally active and transfer heavy chain subunits from inter-α-inhibitor to either free or surface-bound hyaluronan. Transitional hyaluronan-TSG-6-heavy chain complexes do not accumulate in vitro. Our data show the capability for heavy chain transfer by both free TSG-6 and preformed hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes, suggesting that both might contribute to hyaluronan modification in vivo. Transfer of heavy chains to surface-tethered hyaluronan by either free TSG-6 or surface-tethered hyaluronan-TSG-6 complexes did not affect the CD 44-mediated binding of BW 5147 cells in vitro. We show how TSG-6 and hyaluronan together can deplete inter-α-inhibitor and generate bikunin, as has been observed in sepsis, and discuss the role of TSG-6 in the generation of hyaluronan-heavy chain complexes associated with ovulation, arthritis, and sepsis.

Lee G.W. Ziff E.B. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1990; 10: 1982-1988Google Scholar, 2Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol.. 1992; 116: 545-557Google Scholar, 3Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev.. 2004; 15: 129-146Google Scholar). Expression and function of TSG-6 have been associated with inflammation and fertility. TSG-6 protein consists of two domains, the N-terminal link module and the C-terminal CUB domain. The N-terminal domain of TSG-6, a so-called link module (4Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell.. 1996; 86: 767-775Google Scholar), identifies TSG-6 as a hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein. In addition to HA, TSG-6 also interacts with the plasma protein inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) in a HA-independent fashion (5Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Google Scholar). IαI is a protein-polysaccharide complex of unique structure consisting of three polypeptide chains linked by a glycosaminoglycan bridge (6Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thogersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 747-751Google Scholar, 7Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J.. 1996; 315: 1-9Google Scholar). The smallest of the three polypeptides, the serine protease inhibitor bikunin, carries a single chondroitin 4-sulfate chain attached via a classical proteoglycan linkage group, whereas the two closely homologous heavy chains (HC) 1 and 2 are linked to hydroxyl groups of the chondroitin sulfate via alkali-sensitive ester bonds formed by their C-terminal aspartic acid residues (6Enghild J.J.

TSG-6 interacts with IαI, resulting in the transfer of either one of the HCs from IαI to TSG-6, resulting in a covalent TSG-6·HC complex (5Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Google Scholar, 10Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fulop C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Google Scholar, 11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D.

Chem.. 2008; 283: 18530-18537Google Scholar). Although both HC1 and HC2 can be transferred, the presence of HC2 is essential for any HC transfer (14Sanggaard K.W. Sonne-Schmidt C.S. Krogager T.P. Lorentzen K.A. Wisniewski H.G. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 18530-18537Google Scholar). In the presence of HA the HC is further transferred from TSG-6·HC to HA, resulting in the formation of covalent HA·HC complexes and the release of free TSG-6 (11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar). HA·HC complexes in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been known for decades, although they were assumed to be complexes of HA and complete IαI (15Sandson J. Hamerman D. Schwick G. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians.. 1965; 78: 304-313Google Scholar). These complexes are also known as serum-derived HA-associated protein (SHAP) (16Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Google Scholar). As in IαI, the HCs are coupled to HA by an ester bond formed by its C-terminal aspartic acid residue (17Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Google Scholar). The currently accepted pathway of HC transfer from IαIto TSG-6 and subsequently to HA may not be the only pathway to occur in vivo. We have been interested in an alternate pathway that utilizes preformed HA·TSG-6 complexes. We have previously studied the interactions of TSG-6 with HA that had been covalently tethered to a surface by chemical cross-linking (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar). HA tethered to a surface can be considered a model for HA associated with cell surfaces before release from hyaluronan synthase or by binding to cellular receptors. We found that TSG-6, in a strictly temperature-dependent fashion, formed complexes with surface-tethered HA that were resistant to stringent dissociating and reducing agents (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar). However, neither we 3E. Colón, A. Shytuhina, M. K. Cowman, P. A. Band, and H.-G. Wisniewski, unpublished data. nor others (10Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fulop C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Google Scholar, 11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar) found evidence that such highly stable HA·TSG-6 complexes are formed with HA free in solution. In vivo, stable complexes consisting of HA, TSG-6, and one HC have been demonstrated in the HA-rich extracellular matrix of ovulatory cumulus cell-oocyte complexes (COCs) (19Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2001; 394: 173-181Google Scholar). These complexes formed in vivo are clearly different from all HA·HC complexes that have been generated in vitro in that they incorporate TSG-6 in a stable complex with HA. In contrast, when HA in solution was used as a substrate for HC transfer in vitro, free TSG-6 was released and recycled (11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar). In the current study we provide evidence that stable complexes formed between TSG-6 and tethered HA are useful models for the complexes observed in vivo and that these complexes themselves can function to catalyze the subsequent transfer of HCs to HA. The existence of stable complexes consisting of HA and both TSG-6 and HCs in ovulatory COCs points to a physiological role, most likely in the stabilization of the HA-rich extracellular matrix of COCs (19Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2001; 394: 173-181Google Scholar). The significance of the complex interactions between TSG-6, HA, and IαI is most clearly demonstrated by the infertility of female mice deficient in either TSG-6 (20Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Development.. 2003; 130: 2253-2261Google Scholar) or IαI (21Sato H. Kajikawa S. Kuroda S. Horisawa Y.

Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K. Suzuki T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 7693-7696Google Scholar), resulting from the instability of ovulatory COCs. Stable HA·TSG-6 complexes may also form in other hyaluronan-rich tissues, e.g. cartilage, where accumulation of TSG-6 has been shown in both arthritic humans and in mice (23Bayliss M.T. Howat S.L. Dudhia J. Murphy J.M. Barry F.P. Edwards J.C. Day A.J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage.. 2001; 9: 42-48Google Scholar, 24Glant T.T. Kamath R.V. Bardos T. Gal I. Szanto S. Murad Y.M. Sandy J.D. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum.. 2002; 46: 2207-2218Google Scholar). They may form a local reservoir of functional TSG-6, as has been suggested by the persistence of the anti-inflammatory effects of recombinant TSG-6 in experimental models of arthritis (25Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Mikecz K. Glant T.T. Am. J. Pathol.. 2001; 159: 1711-1721Google Scholar, 26Mindrescu C. Thorbecke G.J. Klein M.J. Vilcek J. Wisniewski H.G. Arthritis Rheum.. 2000; 43: 2668-2677Google Scholar) and even in the absence of detectable TSG-6 in plasma (26Mindrescu C. Thorbecke G.J. Klein M.J. Vilcek J. Wisniewski H.G. Arthritis Rheum.. 2000; 43: 2668-2677Google Scholar). The functional activity of stable HA·TSG-6 complexes formed in vitro (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar) has not yet been investigated but is the main subject of this study. We characterized simultaneous TSG-6 binding and HC transfer to surface-tethered HA and transfer of HCs by preformed HA·TSG-6 complexes. In vitro, intermediates of this transfer did not accumulate, resulting in HA·HC, but not HA·TSG-6·HC complexes, as the final products of this reaction. We suggest that HA·TSG-6 complexes like the ones generated here in vitro may be related to stable ternary complexes of HA, TSG-6, and HCs that have been described earlier in vivo (19Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2001; 394: 173-181Google Scholar). Reagents—Covalink NH(Cov-NH) plates were purchased from Nunc, sulfo-NHS was from Pierce, and EDC was purchased from Sigma. HA from rooster comb was purchased from Sigma, and bacterial HA was obtained from Lifecore Biomedical; both were used for coupling to Cov-NH. Equivalent results were obtained with Cov-HA prepared with rooster comb HA and bacterial HA. EAH-Sepharose was purchased from GE Healthcare. Hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus and biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP-bio) were purchased from Associates of Cape Cod. SelectHA™ 30 kDa was purchased from Hyalose L.L.C. Human plasma was obtained from the blood bank of the NYU Medical Center. Rabbit anti-human IαI was from Dako. Although this antibody was raised against IαI, it did not detect bikunin in immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and is, therefore, referred to as HC-specific. The rabbit anti-TSG-6 antibody was raised against native recombinant TSG-6 and has been described earlier (27Mindrescu C. Le J. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 330: 737-745Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-bikunin antibody has been described and characterized earlier (9Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Thogersen I.B. Valnickova Z. Pizzo S.V. Hefta S.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Google Scholar). Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ig was from Dako, and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Invitrogen. The alkaline phosphatase substrate was p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) for solution assays and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium from Bio-Rad for immunoblots. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting were from Millipore (Immobilon P). TSG-6 Protein—TSG-6 protein was expressed in BTI-TN-5B1-4 insect cells after infection with recombinant nuclear polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus) and purified as described (5Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Google Scholar, 28Wisniewski H.G. Sweet M.H. Stern R. Anal. Biochem.. 2005; 347: 42-48Google Scholar). Purified IαI—IαI was purified from human plasma as described previously (29Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol.. 1996; 156: 1609-1615Google Scholar). Coupling of HA to Covalink-NH Plates and EAH-Sepharose—HA was coupled to Covalink-NH plates as described (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar, 30Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem.. 1997; 251: 263-269Google Scholar). In brief, HA solution containing sulfo-NHS was added to the wells of Cov-NH plates. After the addition of EDC, the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the plates were washed extensively with 2 m NaCl and blocked with 0.2% casein in TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Coupling of HA to EAH-Sepharose was carried out similarly to the coupling of HA to Cov-NH. HA at 0.55 mg/ml in a 22.2% (v/v) suspension of EAH-Sepharose was incubated with 0.89 mm sulfo-NHS and 0.36 mm EDC in H2O for 2 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C under constant movement. Thereafter, the HA-Sepharose was washed with an at least 10-fold volume of 2 m NaCl and blocked with 0.2% casein in TTBS. TSG-6 Binding Assay and HC Transfer Assay Using HA Immobilized on Cov-HA—The assay for TSG-6 binding to Cov-HA was carried out as described (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar). To determine HC transfer by free TSG-6, TSG-6 at the indicated concentration was mixed with human plasma at the indicated dilution, usually 1:1000, in TTBS and co-incubated in wells of Cov-HA plates for 2 h at 37 °C (100 μl/well). After washing 3 times with 200 μl of TTBS, the wells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution (in TTBS) of a rabbit anti-IαI antiserum that is HC-specific, i.e. it does not detect bikunin, for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000 in TTBS, 1 h at 37 °C). After incubation with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 in TTBS, 1 h at 37 °C) and with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 2 mm MgCl2, ∼5–30 min at 37 °C), the amount of dephosphorylated substrate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm using 800 nm as a reference wavelength. Each set of experimental conditions included appropriate positive and negative controls, but absolute absorbance values were not standardized across different experiments. HC Transfer to HA-Sepharose—100 μl of HA-Sepharose (sediment) was incubated with 200 μl of 400 nm TSG-6 in TTBS for 2 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with TTBS (3 times 400 μl) the HA-Sepharose was incubated with a 1:100 dilution of human plasma in PBS (2 h at 37 °C). After extensive washing as above, the HA-Sepharose was treated with 100 μl of 10 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase (in PBS, 2 h at 50 °C). 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the digested HA-Sepharose, and after vortexing, the liquid phase was recovered by centrifugation in a Spin-X column (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). The recovered filtrate was analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of TSG-6, HCs, TSG-6·HC complexes etc. using HC- and TSG-6-specific antibodies. Controls were treated either only with TSG-6 or only with plasma or without TSG-6 and plasma. To discern between HC transfer by free TSG-6 versus HA·TSG-6 complexes, the incubation with plasma was also carried out in TTBS instead of PBS (see “Results” for the differential effects of these buffers). HC Transfer by Solid-phase HA·TSG-6 Complexes to HA in Solution—TSG-6 was bound to HA-Sepharose as described above. 100 μl of HA-Sepharose (sediment) was incubated with 200 μl of 100 nm TSG-6 in TTBS for 2 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with TTBS (3 times 400 μl) the HA-Sepharose was incubated with 100 μl of a 1:600 dilution of human plasma in PBS containing 100 μg/ml SelectHA™ of 30 kDa (2 h at 37 °C). 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the HA-Sepharose and, after vortexing, the liquid phase was recovered by centrifugation in a Spin-X tube (Costar). The recovered filtrate was analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of HA·HC complexes using HC-specific antibodies and a HA-specific HABP probe. Controls were treated either only with TSG-6 or only with plasma or without TSG-6 and plasma. To differentiate between HC transfer by free TSG-6 versus stable HA·TSG-6 complexes, the incubation with plasma was also carried out in TTBS instead of PBS (see “Results” for the differential effects of these buffers). Formation of HA·HC Complexes in Solution—20 nm TSG-6, 100 μg/ml SelectHA™, and human plasma diluted 1:600 were co-incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in PBS, and the reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of TSG-6, IαI, HCs, TSG-6·HC complexes, HA·HC complexes, and free bikunin using HC-, TSG-6-, or bikunin-specific antibodies or the HA-specific HABP probe. Controls contained either one or two of the three components (TSG-6, plasma, HA). Binding of BW 5147 Cells to Immobilized HA—This assay was carried out as previously described (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar) with minor modifications. BW 5147 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum. To evaluate their binding to immobilized HA, 3 × 105 BW 5147 cells were plated into wells of Cov-HA or Cov-NH plates after treatment of the plates with TSG-6 and/or plasma to facilitate either TSG-6 binding or HC transfer. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the medium of the wells was aspirated, and the wells were washed 3 times with 200 μl of PBS. Adherent cells were fixed for 15 min in 10% formalin (in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5) and stained for 30 min in 0.05% Naphtol Blue Black in the same buffer. Thereafter, the wells were washed 3 times with distilled water, and the dye was eluted from the stained cells with 150 μl of 50 mm NaOH. Finally, the concentration of the eluted dye was determined by measuring the absorbance at 615 nm. The wave length of 800 nm was used as a reference wave length. The concentration of the eluted dye provides a measure of the number of cells adhering to immobilized HA. TSG-6 Mediates Transfer of HCs from IαI to Immobilized HA—TSG-6-mediated transfer of HCs from IαI to HA in solution has been studied previously (10Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fulop C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Google Scholar, 31Jessen T.E. Odum L. Reproduction.. 2003; 125: 27-31Google Scholar). We reported earlier that the binding of TSG-6 to HA covalently tethered to a surface resulted in the formation of stable HA·TSG-6 complexes (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar), whereas there was no evidence for the formation of such complexes with HA in solution (11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar). Because of these differences between the binding of TSG-6 to HA free in solution and to HA tethered to a surface, we first characterized TSG-6-mediated HC transfer from IαI to HA that was covalently tethered to Covalink. We used purified IαI to test whether recombinant TSG-6 is necessary and sufficient for the transfer of HCs from IαI to Cov-HA. To minimize nonspecific binding, the reaction was carried out in TTBS buffer (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar). HCs transferred to Cov-HA were detected using a rabbit anti-HC antibody that reacts with IαI and HCs but did not detect bikunin. As shown in Fig. 1A, there was virtually no HC transfer from purified human IαI or binding of purified IαI to immobilized HA in the absence of TSG-6. HC binding to HA was readily detectable if purified TSG-6 was added along with purified IαI. This assay does not distinguish between bound HCs or complete IαI, and this issue will be addressed further below. To investigate whether the lack of HC transfer from purified IαI to Cov-HA is an artifact resulting from partial denaturation of this complex protein during its purification, we examined the transfer of HCs from IαI in plasma to immobilized HA. Fig. 1B shows that the transfer of HCs from IαI in 1:1000-diluted human plasma to Cov-HA is also completely dependent on the presence of added TSG-6 protein. As little as 16 pm TSG-6 is sufficient to mediate detectable transfer of HCs from IαIin human plasma to Cov-HA (Fig. 1B). The average concentration of IαI in human plasma is about 700 mg/liter (32Baek Y.W. Brokat S. Padbury J.F. Pinar H. Hixson D.C. Lim Y.P. J. Pediatr.. 2003; 143: 11-15Google Scholar). We tested how the plasma concentration affects the transfer of HCs to HA (Fig. 1C). With respect to HC transfer to Cov-HA in the presence of TSG-6, the IαI concentration in human plasma is saturating, and a 1:100 dilution of human plasma did not result in any decrease of HC transfer. Even at a 1:4000 dilution of plasma the transfer of HCs to HA was only decreased by about 50%, and HC transfer was still detectable at a plasma dilution of 1:16000. This means that concentrations of unpurified IαI of as little as 200 pm are sufficient for detectable HC transfer to HA. Interestingly, some HC transfer to Cov-HA could be detected in the absence of exogenous TSG-6 at high plasma concentrations (Fig. 1D). However, a plasma dilution of only 1:100 completely abolished any detectable transfer. Stability of the Bond between HCs and Immobilized HA—We reported earlier that TSG-6 forms a remarkably stable bond to immobilized HA in a strictly temperature-dependent fashion. Using the same assay system, we found that IαI HCs transferred to immobilized HA in the presence of 50 nm TSG-6 are also almost completely resistant to treatment with 6 m guanidine HCl, 6 m guanidine HCl containing 8% lauryl sulfobetain, or SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2A). However, they were sensitive to treatment with hyaluronidase from S. hyalurolyticus and, in contrast to HA·TSG-6 complexes, they were also sensitive to treatment with 50 mm NaOH, in agreement with the presence of an ester bond between HA and HC in HA·HC complexes (17Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). This provides evidence that the HC transfer we observed on Cov-HA yields HA·HC complexes similar to those observed with HA in solution. Simultaneous Versus Sequential TSG-6 Binding and HC Transfer to Cov-HA—Because TSG-6 itself binds to Cov-HA under the conditions used to evaluate HC transfer to Cov-HA, as shown previously (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar), we investigated if both TSG-6 binding and HC transfer to Cov-HA can occur simultaneously. Earlier experiments demonstrating TSG-6-dependent HC transfer to HA in solution indicated that TSG-6 did not form complexes with HA; instead, it was recycled (11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar). In contrast, we show here that after co-incubation of TSG-6 and diluted plasma in Cov-HA, both TSG-6 and HCs could be detected attached to the surface-bound HA (Fig. 3A). To exclude the possibility that the formation of stable HA·TSG-6 or HA·HC complexes is an artifact caused by the unlikely presence of residual active intermediates of the chemical coupling reaction used to tether HA, we showed that immunoglobulin, a protein that can be coupled efficiently by the EDC/sulfo-NHS coupling procedure, did not bind or couple to Cov-HA under the conditions of our binding experiments (supplemental Fig. S1) and that stable bond formation seems to be unique for TSG-6 among the proteins sharing homologues of the link module; HABP, consisting of isolated link modules of both aggrecan and link protein, did bind to Cov-HA but did not form a stable bond (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, the formation of the stable bond between TSG-6 and surface-bound HA is completely prevented at 4 °C (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar), whereas the EDC/sulfo-NHS-mediated coupling works well at this temperature. We also investigated if preformed HA·TSG-6 complexes are able to mediate the subsequent transfer of HCs from IαI to Cov-HA in a two-step reaction. Fig. 3B shows that TSG-6, after binding to Cov-HA under conditions that result in the formation of stable HA·TSG-6 complexes, is able to mediate the subsequent transfer of HCs to the Cov-HA substrate after all TSG-6 in solution has been removed by extensive washing. Because this binding assay cannot distinguish between HCs bound directly to HA, i.e. HA·HC complexes, and HCs bound to TSG-6, i.e. HA·TSG-6·HC complexes, we carried out additional experiments to address this question, described below. Transfer of IαI HCs To Immobilized HA Is Strictly Dependent on Metal Ions—It was established earlier that the transfer of HCs to HA is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions and could be prevented by the addition of EDTA (11Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Google Scholar, 33Jessen T.E. Odum L. Osteoarthritis Cartilage.. 2004; 12: 142-148Google Scholar, 34Odum L. Andersen C.Y. Jessen T.E. Reproduction.. 2002; 124: 249-257Google Scholar). Fig. 4A confirms that the TSG-6-dependent transfer of HCs to Cov-HA is also completely prevented by the presence of 10 mm EDTA, a treatment that does not prevent the binding of TSG-6 to immobilized HA (18Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Google Scholar). We also determined the role of metal ions on the individual steps of the 2-step reaction described above, i.e. the transfer of HCs to Cov-HA by preformed Cov-HA·TSG-6 complexes. Although the presence of EDTA during the binding of TSG-6 to Cov-HA has a modest effect on the transfer of HCs in the following step, the presence of EDTA during the second step, the interaction of preformed HA·TSG-6 complexes with IαI, completely prevented a"

The molecular mechanisms underlying their expansion in obesity and following body weight reduction are poorly defined.C57Bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 months developed low, medium, or high body weight as compared to normal chow fed mice. Mice from each groups were then treated with the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist rimonabant or vehicle for 24 days to normalize their body weight. Transcriptomic data for visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues from each group of mice were obtained and analyzed to identify: i) genes regulated by HFD irrespective of body weight, ii) genes whose expression correlated with body weight, iii) the biological processes activated in each tissue using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), iv) the transcriptional programs affected by rimonabant.In VAT, ""metabolic"" genes encoding enzymes for lipid and steroid biosynthesis and glucose catabolism were down-regulated irrespective of body weight whereas ""structure"" genes controlling cell architecture and tissue remodeling had expression levels correlated with body weight. In SCAT, the identified ""metabolic"" and ""structure"" genes were mostly different from those identified in VAT and were regulated irrespective of body weight. GSEA indicated active adipogenesis in both tissues but a more prominent involvement of tissue stroma in VAT than in SCAT. Rimonabant treatment normalized most gene expression but further reduced oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in SCAT but not in VAT.VAT and SCAT show strikingly different gene expression programs in response to high fat diet and rimonabant treatment. Our results may lead to identification of therapeutic targets acting on specific fat depots to control obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1982453441,"There is emerging evidence that the oncogenic potential of hdm2 (human and/or murine double minute-2 protein) stems not only from its ability to counteract tumor suppressor p53 but also from its less understood p53-independent functions. Surprisingly, little is known about the role and regulation of hdm2 in pancreatic tumors, a large proportion (50–75%) of which contain mutant p53. In this study, we determined that hdm2 was expressed in a Ras-signaling-dependent manner in various pancreatic cancer cell lines. As p53 was mutated and inactive in these cells, the expression of hdm2 was seemingly redundant. Indeed, the proliferation and survival of cell lines such as Panc-1 and Panc-28 could be inhibited by PRIMA-1 (mutant p53 activator) but not by Nutlin-3 (inhibitor of the hdm2–p53 interaction). Unexpectedly, however, the proliferation of both cell lines was strongly inhibited by hdm2-specific RNAi. Our data also revealed cyclin D1, c-Jun and c-Myc to be novel targets of hdm2 and suggested that they might mediate hdm2's role in cellular proliferation and/or survival. We conclude from our results that hdm2 is expressed in pancreatic cancer cells as a result of activated Ras signaling, and that it regulates cellular proliferation and the expression of three novel target genes by p53-independent mechanisms."

In the present study, we have analyzed the Y chromosome in 15 clinically diagnosed Turner Syndrome (TS) patients and detected high level of mosaicisms ranging from 45,XO:46,XY = 100:0% in 4; 45,XO:46,XY:46XX = 4:94:2 in 8; and 45,XO:46,XY:46XX = 50:30:20 cells in 3 TS patients, unlike previous reports showing 5–8% cells with Y- material. Also, no ring, marker or di-centric Y was observed in any of the cases. Of the two TS patients having intact Y chromosome in >85% cells, one was exceptionally tall. Both the patients were positive for SRY, DAZ, CDY1, DBY, UTY and AZFa, b and c specific STSs. Real Time PCR and FISH demonstrated tandem duplication/multiplication of the SRY and DAZ genes. At sequence level, the SRY was normal in 8 TS patients while the remaining 7 showed either absence of this gene or known and novel mutations within and outside of the HMG box. SNV/SFV analysis showed normal four copies of the DAZ genes in these 8 patients. All the TS patients showed aplastic uterus with no ovaries and no symptom of gonadoblastoma. Present study demonstrates new types of polymorphisms indicating that no two TS patients have identical genotype-phenotype. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of more number of samples is warranted to uncover consensus on the loci affected, to be able to use them as potential diagnostic markers."
https://openalex.org/W2024846557,"The T-box gene Eomesodermin (Eomes) is required for early embryonic mesoderm differentiation in mouse, frog (Xenopus laevis), and zebrafish, is important in late cardiac development in Xenopus, and for CD8+ T effector cell function in mouse. Eomes can ectopically activate many mesodermal genes. However, the mechanism by which Eomes activates transcription of these genes is poorly understood. We report that Eomes protein interacts with Smad2 and is capable of working in a non-cell autonomous manner via transfer of Eomes protein between adjacent embryonic cells. Blocking of Eomes protein transfer using a farnesylated red fluorescent protein (CherryF) also prevents Eomes nuclear accumulation. Transfer of Eomes protein between cells is mediated by the Eomes carboxyl terminus (456-692). A carbohydrate binding domain within the Eomes carboxyl-terminal region is sufficient for transfer and important for gene activation. We propose a novel mechanism by which Eomes helps effect a cellular response to a morphogen gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2077403816,"The essential mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) is required for the import of mitochondrial preproteins into the matrix compartment.

A major biochemical characteristic of Hsp70-type chaperones is their nucleotide-regulated affinity to polypeptide substrates.

Two of the mutants exhibited strong growth defects in vivo and were significantly impaired in the generation of an inward-directed, ATP-dependent import force on precursor proteins in transit. The biochemical properties of these two mutant proteins were consistent with defects in the transfer of conformational signals to the substrate-binding domain, resulting in a prolonged and enhanced interaction with imported substrate proteins. Furthermore, interference with the allosteric mechanism resulted in defects of translocation-specific partner protein interaction.

Chaperones of the 70-kDa family (Hsp70) are ubiquitous proteins that occur in all species (except archaea) and fulfill crucial cellular functions under normal and stress conditions (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 2005; 62: 670-684Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells contain several Hsp70 paralogs that are generally involved in all stages of protein biogenesis, ranging from biosynthesis at the ribosomes, intracellular transport, and eventually proteolysis (2Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell.. 2006; 125: 443-451Google Scholar, 3Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2001; 70: 603-647Google Scholar, 4Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Röttgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2002; 1592: 51-62Google Scholar). Ssc3 is expressed at very low levels under normal growth conditions and its cellular function is so far unknown. Ssq1 has been shown to assist the assembly of iron/sulfur cluster cofactors in mitochondria. The most abundant and functionally important mitochondrial Hsp70 is Ssc1, generally referred to as mtHsp70. It performs most of the typical chaperone functions in terms of protein folding and quality control for polypeptides localized in the mitochondrial matrix compartment (5Voos W. Röttgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2002; 1592: 51-62Google Scholar, 6Craig E.A. Gambill B.D. Nelson R.J. Microbiol. Rev... 1993; 57: 402-414Google Scholar, 7Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Adv.

In yeast cells, deletion of SSC1 results in a lethal phenotype, a property that has been directly attributed to its crucial role in the import process. Mitochondrial preprotein translocation comprises a series of consecutive steps (9Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev.

(translocase of the outer membrane) protein complex. Subsequent insertion of the presequence into the inner membrane translocase channel TIM23 (translocase of the inner membrane) is driven by the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the inner membrane. Next, the polypeptide chain interacts with mtHsp70, which forms the core of the translocation motor complex (9Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2007; 76: 723-749Google Scholar, 10Strub A. Lim J.H. Pfanner N. Voos W. Biol. Chem... 2000; 381: 943-949Google Scholar), also termed PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor). By coupling translocation with ATP hydrolysis, the motor complex drives unfolding of the polypeptide chain and its transport into the matrix. Finally, the import process is completed by MPP-mediated (mitochondrial processing peptidase) proteolytic removal of the targeting sequence and further folding and assembly reactions. Similar to its bacterial ortholog DnaK, mtHsp70 activity is closely regulated by the interaction with specific co-chaperones. Substrate interaction and ATP hydrolysis during protein folding is assisted by Mdj1, a co-chaperone belonging to the so-called J-domain protein family (11Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. EMBO Rep... 2004; 5: 567-571Google Scholar). In addition, Pam18, another J-domain protein and a PAM component, stimulates the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 in the immediate vicinity of the translocation channel (12D'Silva P. Schilke B. Walter W.

Furthermore, the peripheral membrane protein Tim44, a component of the TIM23 complex, is required for the translocation-specific activity of mtHsp70. By its specific and stable interaction with Tim44, the soluble chaperone is tethered to the exit site of the preprotein translocation channel at the inner face of the mitochondrial inner membrane (18D'Silva P. Liu Q. Walter W. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol... 2004; 11: 1084-1091Google Scholar, 19Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N.

This interaction is essential for the motor activity of mtHsp70, indicated by the lethal phenotype of a TIM44 gene deletion in yeast. The following aspects of the mtHsp70 reaction cycle have been shown to be essential for the mitochondrial protein import process (5Voos W. Röttgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2002; 1592: 51-62Google Scholar, 21Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 3: 555-565Google Scholar): (i) interaction with the translocation channel via Tim44, (ii) regulation of the ATPase activity by the cofactors Pam18 and Mge1 and, most importantly, (iii) nucleotide-regulated interactions with the substrate protein, in this case the precursor polypeptide in transit. However, the details of the molecular mechanism enabling mtHsp70 to drive polypeptide movement and unfolding are still not entirely established (22Tomkiewicz D. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.

A basic model for the mtHsp70-assisted import reaction has been proposed, in which ATP-regulated binding of mtHsp70 to the incoming polypeptide chain serves as a passive molecular ratchet, rendering the bidirectional movement of the preprotein inside the translocation channel vectorial (24Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science.. 2003; 300: 139-141Google Scholar, 25Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 3659-3671Google Scholar). However, detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies of the import process indicated a more active role of mtHsp70 during preprotein import. It was shown that the import motor conveys an inward-directed translocation force on the polypeptide in transit, not only contributing to its forward movement, but also to the active unfolding of C-terminal domains for passage through the translocation channel (26Matouschek A. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO Rep... 2000; 1: 404-410Google Scholar, 27Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO J.. 2001; 20: 941-950Google Scholar, 28De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O.

Generally, the activity of Hsp70-type chaperones is based on their binding affinity to hydrophobic and unfolded segments in polypeptide substrates (30Erbse A. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biochem. Soc. Trans... 2004; 32: 617-621Google Scholar). Although substrate proteins are bound by the C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) of Hsp70, the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) controls the conformation and substrate affinity of the SBD by an allosteric mechanism. In the ATP-bound state, the SBD is in an “open” conformation allowing rapid binding and release of substrate peptides, which results in an overall low substrate affinity. ATP hydrolysis in the NBD induces a “closed” conformation of the SBD, i.e. the peptide substrate is locked in the peptide-binding site with high affinity. The J-domain of DnaJ-like proteins has been shown to contribute significantly to this substrate docking process (31Kelley W.L. Fink A.L. Curr. Biol... 1999; 9: R305-R308Google Scholar, 32Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Cell Stress Chaperones.. 2003; 8: 309-316Google Scholar). Vice versa, peptide binding in the SBD enhances ATPase activity of the NBD. Although the allosteric interaction between NBD and SBD is crucial for Hsp70 function, details of its structural basis have emerged only recently. Previous studies had resulted in the separate determination of individual Hsp70 domain structures (33Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A.

However, recent experiments resulted in the identification of structural elements in both Hsp70 domains that are crucial for mutual allosteric control (37Revington M. Zhang Y. Yip G.N. Kurochkin A.V. Zuiderweg E.R. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 349: 163-183Google Scholar, 38Rist W. Graf C. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 16493-16501Google Scholar, 39Vogel M. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 359-367Google Scholar, 40Swain J.F. Dinler G. Sivendran R. Montgomery D.L. Stotz M. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell.. 2007; 26: 27-39Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a Hsp70 molecule comprising NBD and major parts of the SBD defined a domain interface region that contains several characteristic interaction sites between amino acid residues of the NBD and the SBD, respectively (41Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 20: 513-524Google Scholar). Based on the recent progress in the structural description of Hsp70-type chaperones, we were now able to directly address the importance of the allosteric mechanism in the course of the mitochondrial preprotein import reaction. As outlined above, the ATP-regulated substrate interaction is the key feature of mtHsp70 enabling it to drive translocation of a polypeptide chain into the mitochondrial matrix. We have introduced amino acid exchanges into the mtHsp70 NBD that are supposed to directly affect the allosteric regulation of substrate affinity. These mutations were analyzed with regard to their effects on the biochemical properties of mtHsp70 and its activity during mitochondrial preprotein import. Interference with the allosteric mechanism resulted in severe growth defects in vivo correlating with a strong reduction of preprotein import in organello. Hence, functional interdomain communication is strictly required for the essential role of the mtHsp70 chaperone machinery in driving mitochondrial preprotein import. Construction and Expression of mtHsp70 ATPase Domain Mutants—The wild-type SSC1 gene was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pRS314 vector that harbors the TRP1 marker gene (42Strub A. Röttgers K. Voos W. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2626-2635Google Scholar). The vector pRS314xSSC1 (pASC07) served as a template for site-directed mutagenesis via PCR, employing specific oligonucleotide primers that rendered the substitution of Tyr173, Asn175, Asp176, Glu240, and Val241 for alanines. For a complementation assay, the resulting plasmids pASC44 (Y173A), pASC47 (N175A/D176A), and pASC48 (E240A/V241A) were subsequently introduced into the yeast strain WVY37 (ssc1Δ::LEU2) containing the wild-type SSC1 gene on a centromeric plasmid together with the URA3 marker (42Strub A. Röttgers K. Voos W. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 2626-2635Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast cells was performed following standard yeast genetic protocols. Transformed cells were plated on solid YPG medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, to select for cells lacking the plasmid-borne wild-type SSC1 gene. For expression, the mutant genes were inserted into the 2μ vector pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen) containing the galactose-inducible GAL1-Promoter and the URA3 marker gene. Additionally, the plasmid encodes a C-terminal V5-epitope and a hexahistidine tag. The resulting plasmids pYLE02 (WT), pYLE03 (Y173A), pYLE04 (N175A/D176A), and pYLE05 (E240A/V241A) were introduced into the conditional mutant strain ssc1–3 (MATα ade2–101 lys2 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 Δtrp1 ssc1–3::LEU2) (43Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 123: 109-117Google Scholar). Mitochondria isolated from the resulting strains as described below were employed in all in organello assays. Isolation of Mitochondria and in Vitro Import—Yeast strains were grown in YPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 3% (v/v) glycerol) to mid-log phase. Expression of the mutant Hsp70s analyzed in this study was induced by addition of 2% galactose 2–3 h prior to harvesting. Mitochondria were isolated as described (44Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol... 2001; 65: 189-215Google Scholar), and stored in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) at -80 °C. To induce the temperature-sensitive ssc1–3 phenotype, isolated mitochondria were subjected to heat shock at 37 °C for 15 min immediately prior to all assays described in the following sections. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega). Import assays were performed by incubation of precursor proteins with isolated mitochondria in import buffer at 25 °C (250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm NADH, 10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, and 3% bovine serum albumin) at 25 °C. Import reactions were stopped by addition of valinomycin and cooling on ice. Non-imported protein material was removed by an incubation with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 10 min. All experiments using radiolabeled preproteins were analyzed by digital autoradiography and quantified with the help of the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). For the analysis of the inward-directed import activity, recombinant precursor proteins (b2(167)Δ-DHFR) were imported in saturating amounts (29Krayl M. Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Voos W. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 411-425Google Scholar) in the presence of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) ligand methotrexate (MTX) as described (45Bömer U. Maarse A.C. Martin F. Geissler A. Merlin A. Schönfisch B. Meijer M. Pfanner N. Rassow J. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 4226-4237Google Scholar). After terminating the import reaction by addition of valinomycin, mitochondria were re-isolated and resuspended in import buffer in the presence of ATP. Samples were taken at the indicated time points and treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 10 min. After re-isolation of mitochondria, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using an antibody against mouse DHFR (44Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol... 2001; 65: 189-215Google Scholar). Assessment of the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Potential (ΔΨ)—The electric membrane potential (ΔΨ) of isolated mitochondria was assessed by use of the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (diSC3(5); Molecular Probes). The fluorescence emission from mitochondria-associated diSC3(5) decreases with increasing ΔΨ (46Waggoner A. J. Membr. Biol... 1976; 27: 317-334Google Scholar). The measurements were performed with a fluorescence spectrometer (Aminco Bowman) at 25 °C (excitation at 622 nm, emission at 670 nm) in a buffer composed of 0.6 m sorbitol, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4. Co-immunoprecipitation of mtHsp70 with Imported Proteins—Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in import buffer. Import of 35S-labeled Su9(86)-DHFR for 5 min, subsequent lysis of mitochondria in 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and incubation with immobilized antibodies against mtHsp70 were performed as described (47Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell.. 1999; 97: 565-574Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by digital autoradiography. Nucleotide- and Substrate-binding Properties of mtHsp70—Binding of mtHsp70 to 5′-ATP-agarose 4B (Sigma) was performed in a buffer composed of 200 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.3% Triton X-100, as described (48Schmidt S. Strub A. Röttgers K. Zufall N. Voos W. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 313: 13-26Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 3 mm ATP. Samples of the mitochondrial extracts and the eluates were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antibody directed against the V5-tag. Coupling of the Hsp70 model substrate RCMLA (reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin; Sigma) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and binding of mtHsp70 to RCMLA-Sepharose was performed in 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100, as described (48Schmidt S. Strub A. Röttgers K. Zufall N. Voos W. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 313: 13-26Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 3 mm ATP or by SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C. Samples of the mitochondrial extracts and the eluates were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antibody directed against the V5-tag. Tryptic Digest of Hsp70—Endogenous ATP was depleted from isolated mitochondria by addition of apyrase (10 units/ml) and oligomycin (20 μm). Trypsin digestion was performed for 2, 5, 15, and 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analog AMP-PNP in import buffer, as described (19Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 2668-2677Google Scholar). After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Detection of mtHsp70 and its degradation fragments was done by use of an antibody against Escherichia coli DnaK. Interaction of mtHsp70 with Partner Proteins Mdj1, Mge1, and Tim44—Mitochondria were lysed in 0.3% Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. ATP was either depleted by incubation of intact mitochondria in the presence of apyrase (10 units/ml) and oligomycin (20 μm) prior to lysis, or maintained by addition of 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 in the lysis buffer. After a clarifying spin at 20,000 × g, the extracts were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads for 1 h with end-over-end shaking at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently washed three times in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 35 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 350 mm imidazole. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunodecoration. Chemical Cross-linking—Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Chemical cross-linking was performed on ice using disuccinimidyl suberate that was added from a 100-fold stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. Mitochondrial ATP was either depleted by incubation of mitochondria in the presence of apyrase (10 units/ml) and oligomycin (20 μm) prior to cross-linking, or kept high by addition of 2 mm ATP, 4 mm NADH, 0.2 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 20 mm creatine phosphate during the cross-linking reaction. In the control sample, dimethyl sulfoxide without cross-linker was added. After 30 min of incubation on ice, excess cross-linker was quenched by addition of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and subsequent incubation on ice for 15 min. For analysis of mtHsp70 cross-linking adducts, re-isolated mitochondria were solubilized with 1% SDS in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol for 15 min at 25 °C. Samples were diluted 20-fold in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After a clarifying spin at 20,000 × g, the extracts were added to Ni-NTA-agarose beads. After 90 min incubation at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking, beads were washed three times in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 35 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 350 mm imidazole. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot. Amino Acid Exchanges in the Nucleotide-binding Domain Surface Interfere with mtHsp70 Function in Vivo—Chaperones from the Hsp70 family generally exhibit similar biochemical reactivities and a high overall amino acid sequence conservation. In particular, the amino acid residues contributing to the putative domain interface between the NBD and the SBD are virtually identical in bovine Hsc70, in the mitochondrial Hsp70 Ssc1 from yeast as well as in the Hsp70 ortholog DnaK from E. coli (supplemental Fig. S1). We modeled the structure of yeast Ssc1 on the basis of the bovine Hsc70 crystal structure comprising both domains of the molecule (41Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 20: 513-524Google Scholar). Based on this model, we selected three regions of the mtHsp70 NBD located within or close to the proposed domain interface with the SBD. We hypothesized that the amino acid exchanges introduced into Ssc1 would specifically interfere with the allosteric signaling between NBD and SBD. The model structure, comprising both NBD and SBD of mtHsp70, its protein surface, and the mutated positions are indicated in Fig. 1A. According to the published crystal structure, the exchange of amino acids Asn175 (Asn151 in Hsc70) and Asp176 (Asp152) to alanine (mutant N175A/D176A) abolishes a salt bridge that is formed between Asp176 of the NBD and Lys544 (Lys524) of the SBD (Fig. 1B). Altering residues Glu240 (Glu218) and Val241 (Val219), resulting in mutant E240A/V241A, is supposed to affect both a cluster of charge interactions (with Lys546 and Arg437 of the mtHsp70 SBD) as well as hydrophobic interactions at the interface between the two Hsp70 domains (e.g. Ala542 within α-helix A of the SBD, see Fig. 1B). In addition, we chose to mutate residue Tyr173 (Tyr149) that is exposed on the molecular surface and located close to both the nucleotide-binding site and the putative domain interface (Fig. 1B), resulting in mutant Y173A. Yeast cells are not viable in the absence of a functional mtHsp70. To test their in vivo growth phenotypes we expressed the NBD mutants in a strain background lacking the wild-type SSC1 gene. Mutant cells with a deletion of the full-length SSC1 open reading frame (ssc1Δ), expressing wild-type SSC1 from a plasmid containing the URA3 marker gene, were transformed with single copy plasmids encoding the NBD mutants under their endogenous promotor. The plasmid harboring the wild-type copy was selectively removed by growing the cells on 5-fluoroorotic acid, which selects against cells containing the URA3 marker gene. Ura3 converts 5-fluoroorotic acid into the toxic compound 5-fluorouracil. The growth phenotypes of the resulting yeast strains exclusively expressing the mutant mtHsp70s were assayed at different temperatures (Fig. 1C). Cells containing mutant N175A/D176A were able to grow at low temperature (25 °C) but showed a pronounced growth defect already at physiological temperature (30 °C), indicating a temperature-sensitive phenotype. Cells expressing mutant E240A/V241A were unable to grow at all temperatures tested, exhibiting the lethality of these mutations. The Y173A mutant cells, by contrast, displayed normal growth that was indistinguishable from cells expressing wild-type Ssc1. Hence, with the exception of mutant Y173A, the NBD mutations exhibited severe functional defects in vivo and could not substitute for the wild-type protein. Import of Matrix-targeted Precursor Proteins Is Strongly Impaired in mtHsp70 NBD Mutants—MtHsp70 is strictly required for both membrane translocation and unfolding of preproteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix. We therefore analyzed the NBD mutants with regard to their efficiency of protein import into the mitochondrial matrix by in vitro import assays. However, due to the severe growth defects of mutants N175A/D176A and E240A/V241A we decided to coexpress the mutant proteins in the background of the conditional mutant ssc1–3 (43Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 123: 109-117Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive Ssc1–3 protein can be almost completely inactivated in isolated mitochondria by a short incubation at 37 °C for 15 min that abolishes nucleotide interactions and blocks subsequent preprotein import.

https://openalex.org/W1978156039,"GSH concentration is considerably lower in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm; however, it is significantly elevated during active cell proliferation. The main purpose of this study was to understand the mechanism underlying these variations in nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of GSH. The rate-limiting step in the de novo GSH biosynthesis pathway is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), a heterodimer, composed of a catalytic subunit (GCLc) and a modulatory subunit (GCLm). In Drosophila, GCLc, but not GCLm, contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Drosophila S2 cells, constitutively expressing regular GCLc protein or expressing GCLc protein with a mutated NLS motif, were generated by transfection. In quiescent S2 cells, GCLc is aggregated in the perinuclear cytosol and the nucleus, whereas GLCm resides solely in the cytosol. In actively proliferating S2 cells, expressing the normal NLS motif, GCLc migrates from the perinuclear cytoplasm into the nucleus, and the nuclear GSH level becomes elevated; in contrast, in proliferating cells, expressing the mutated NLS motif, neither does the GCLc migrate into the nucleus nor does the nuclear GSH amount rise. In S2 cells expressing wild type GCLc, perturbation of cellular redox state by exposure to cadmium resulted in the migration of GCLc into the nucleus but not in cells expressing GCLc with the mutated NLS motif. Overall, results indicated that GSH biosynthesis in the nucleus is associated with migration of only the GCLc subunit from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, and this migration requires the presence of an intact NLS."
https://openalex.org/W2014787467,"Background Ecosystem management requires organizing, synthesizing, and projecting information at a large scale while simultaneously addressing public interests, dynamic ecological properties, and a continuum of physicochemical conditions. We compared the impacts of seven water level management plans for Lake Ontario on a set of environmental attributes of public relevance. Methodology and Findings Our assessment method was developed with a set of established impact assessment tools (checklists, classifications, matrices, simulations, representative taxa, and performance relations) and the concept of archetypal geomorphic shoreline classes. We considered each environmental attribute and shoreline class in its typical and essential form and predicted how water level change would interact with defining properties. The analysis indicated that about half the shoreline of Lake Ontario is potentially sensitive to water level change with a small portion being highly sensitive. The current water management plan may be best for maintaining the environmental resources. In contrast, a natural water regime plan designed for greatest environmental benefits most often had adverse impacts, impacted most shoreline classes, and the largest portion of the lake coast. Plans that balanced multiple objectives and avoided hydrologic extremes were found to be similar relative to the environment, low on adverse impacts, and had many minor impacts across many shoreline classes. Significance The Lake Ontario ecosystem assessment provided information that can inform decisions about water management and the environment. No approach and set of methods will perfectly and unarguably accomplish integrated ecosystem assessment. For managing water levels in Lake Ontario, we found that there are no uniformly good and bad options for environmental conservation. The scientific challenge was selecting a set of tools and practices to present broad, relevant, unbiased, and accessible information to guide decision-making on a set of management options."
