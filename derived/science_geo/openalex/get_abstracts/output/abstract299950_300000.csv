https://openalex.org/W2077773456,"During October 1971, four cesium beam atomic clocks were flown on regularly scheduled commercial jet flights around the world twice, once eastward and once westward, to test Einstein's theory of relativity with macroscopic clocks. From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicts that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40 +/- 23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip, and should have gained 275 +/- 21 nanoseconds during the westward trip. The observed time differences are presented in the report that follows this one."
https://openalex.org/W2062719459,"The encapsulation of graphite-type carbon wires in the regular, 3-nanometer-wide hexagonal channels of the mesoporous host MCM-41 is reported. Acrylonitrile monomers are introduced through vapor or solution transfer and polymerized in the channels with external radical initiators. Pyrolysis of the intrachannel polyacrylonitrile results in filaments whose microwave conductivity is about 10 times that of bulk carbonized polyacrylonitrile. The MCM host plays a key role in ordering the carbon structure, most likely through the parallel alignment of the precursor polymer chains in the channels. The fabrication of stable carbon filaments in ordered, nanometer-sized channels represents an important step toward the development of nanometer electronics."
https://openalex.org/W1991559423,"Computer simulations and animations of the motion of atoms as a chemical reaction proceeds give a detailed picture of how the reaction occurs at a microscopic level. This information is particularly useful for testing the accuracy of statistical models, which are used to calculate various attributes of chemical reactions. Such simulations and animations, in concert with experimental and ab initio studies, have begun to provide a microscopic picture of the intimate details of a particular class of gas-phase ion-molecule bimolecular reactions known as S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution. In these reactions, a nucleophile is displaced from a molecule by another nucleophile. The dynamical model of S(N)2 reactions that emerges from the computer studies, and its relation to statistical theories, is discussed here."
https://openalex.org/W2093329327,"Four cesium beam clocks flown around the world on commercial jet flights during October 1971, once eastward and once westward, recorded directionally dependent time differences which are in good agreement with predictions of conventional relativity theory. Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59 +/- 10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273 +/- 7 nanoseconds during the westward trip, where the errors are the corresponding standard deviations. These results provide an unambiguous empirical resolution of the famous clock ""paradox"" with macroscopic clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2062706299,"Aluminum has had an essential part in aerospace history from its very inception: An aluminum copper alloy (with a copper composition of 8 percent by weight) was used in the engine that powered the historic first flight of the Wright brothers in 1903. Examination of this alloy shows that it is precipitation-hardened by Guinier-Preston zones in a bimodal distribution, with larger zones (10 to 22 nanometers) originating in the casting practice and finer ones (3 nanometers) resulting from ambient aging over the last 90 years. The precipitation hardening in the Wright Flyer crankcase occurred earlier than the experiments of Wilm in 1909, when such hardening was first discovered, and predates the accepted first aerospace application of precipitation-hardened aluminum in 1910."

https://openalex.org/W2038868086,Micrometer-size silicate flakes do not accrete during impacts in the velocity range 1.5 to 9.5 kilometers per second. Conventional accretionary theories for silicate bodies are applicable only to particles whose orbits are similar. Metal-silicate fractionation in the solar system may have been affected by differences in the accretionary behavior of the metal and silicate particles.
