To begin to understand the functions of miRNAs in retina, we compared miRNA expression profiles in adult mouse retina, brain, and heart by microarray analysis. Our results show that at least 78 miRNAs are expressed in adult mouse retina, 21 of which are potentially retina-specific. Among these, we identified a polycistronic, sensory organ-specific paralogous miRNA cluster that includes miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183 on mouse chromosome 6qA3 with conservation of synteny to human chromosome 7q32.2. In situ hybridization showed that members of this cluster are expressed in photoreceptors, retinal bipolar and amacrine cells. Consistent with their genomic organization, these miRNAs have a similar expression pattern during development with abundance increasing postnatally and peaking in adult retina. Target prediction and in vitro functional studies showed that MITF, a transcription factor required for the establishment and maintenance of retinal pigmented epithelium, is a direct target of miR-96 and miR-182. Additionally, to identify miRNAs potentially involved in circadian rhythm regulation of the retina, we performed miRNA expression profiling with retinal RNA harvested at noon (Zeitgeber time 5) and midnight (Zeitgeber time 17) and identified a subgroup of 12 miRNAs, including members of the miR-183/96/182 cluster with diurnal variation in expression pattern. Our results suggest that miR-96 and miR-182 are involved in circadian rhythm regulation, perhaps by modulating the expression of adenylyl cyclase VI (ADCY6).

Since their discovery in 1993, at least 100 different miRNA genes have been documented in the genomes of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans and more than 250 in vertebrate genomes (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26540) Google Scholar) with recent estimates as high as 800 (2Bentwich I. Avniel A. Karov Y. Aharonov R. Gilad S. Barad O.

By influencing translation and stability of mRNAs, miRNAs contribute a newly recognized level of regulation of gene expression affecting a variety of biological processes. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are capped, polyadenylated, and spliced (3Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). pri-miRNAs fold into hairpin structures that are cleaved by an RNase III endonuclease, the Drosha-DGCR8 complex, to form 60–70-nt stem loop intermediates known as pre-miRNA (1Bartel D.P.

In the cytoplasm they are cleaved by a second RNase III endonuclease, Dicer, to yield double-stranded miRNA: miRNA* duplexes that are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex where the miRNA* strand is degraded (6Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). Mature, single-stranded miRNAs in the context of RNA-induced silencing complex engage in base pairing with target sites, located typically in the 3′-UTR of their client miRNAs (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26540) Google Scholar, 7Sontheimer E.J. Carthew R.W. Cell. 2005; 122: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In plants, miRNAs base pair with target mRNAs by precise or nearly precise complementarity to specify cleavage of the target mRNAs by a mechanism that involves the RNA interference machinery (8Rhoades M.W. Reinhart B.J. Lim L.P. Burge C.B. Bartel B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2002; 110: 513-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Most animal miRNAs have imperfect complementary to their mRNA target sites. miRNA binding with less than perfect complementary inhibits translation of the targeted mRNA by an unknown mechanism (9Ambros V. Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8241) Google Scholar), whereas binding with perfect complementary leads to cleavage of the corresponding mRNAs (5Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. Proc.

Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). Some miRNAs are abundant with an estimated 10,000 molecules per cell, whereas others are barely detectable by hybridization to total cellular RNA (12Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Weinstein E.G. Abdelhakim A. Yekta S. Rhoades M.W. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 991-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). About 5,000 human genes (∼ 20% of the total) are estimated to be subjected to miRNA regulation (13Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M.

These target relationships are the basis for major regulatory effects of miRNAs. For example, introduction of an abundant brain miRNA, miR-124, into HeLa cells causes the expression profile of the recipient cells to shift toward that of brain, whereas introduction of a prominent muscle miRNA, miR-1, shifts the expression profile of the recipient cells toward that of muscle. In each case, about 100 mRNAs were down-regulated, suggesting that tissue-specific miRNAs help to define tissue-specific gene expression (10Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A.

Functional studies suggest that miRNAs play important roles in the control of development and function, including temporal pattern formation (17Wightman B. Ha I. Ruvkun G.

Microarrays have been used to profile normal miRNA expression in myoblast and preadipocyte differentiation (28Chen J.F. Mandel E.M. Thomson J.M. Wu Q. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z.

Abnormal patterns of miRNA expression have been described in certain disease states, most notably in human cancers (30Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Sevignani C. Ferracin M. Felli N. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Cimmino A. Zupo S. Dono M. Dell'Aquila M.L. Alder H. Rassenti L. Kipps T.J. Bullrich F. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. Downing J.R. Jacks T. Horvitz H.R. Golub T.R. Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7651) Google Scholar). Thus, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling is likely to become a powerful addition to the functional analysis of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and inherited and acquired disease states (27Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. Downing J.R. Jacks T. Horvitz H.R. Golub T.R.

Despite this progress in understanding miRNA functions and disease associations, little is known about the miRNA complement of mammalian retina. One recent report focused on miRNA expression of the anterior segment of the mouse eye but does list 10 miRNAs abundant in retina (35Ryan D.G. Oliveira-Fernandes M. Lavker R.M. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 1175-1184PubMed Google Scholar), another reports cloning of 9 miRNAs from the eye of the newt (36Makarev E. Spence J.R. Del Rio-Tsonis K. Tsonis P.A. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 1386-1391PubMed Google Scholar), and a third described the spatiotemporal expression of 7 miRNAs in embryonic and postnatal mouse eye (37Karali M. Peluso I. Marigo V. Banfi S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Retina is a derivative of the forebrain ectoderm, and regulation of gene expression through intrinsic and extrinsic factors ensures a tightly controlled temporal and spatial developmental sequence (38Cepko C.L. Austin C.P. Yang X. Alexiades M. Ezzeddine D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). It is likely that, as in other tissues, miRNAs play important roles in the normal development and function of the retina. To better understand these functions, we used microarray analysis to determine the expression pattern of miRNAs in mouse retina as compared with brain and heart. We find at least 78 miRNAs are expressed in adult mouse retina, 21 of which are expressed preferentially or specifically in retina, including a cluster of three paralogous miRNAs that are also expressed in other neurosensory tissues. We also present evidence for circadian cycling in the expression of certain of these miRNAs. Mouse RNA Samples—Wild type SVJ129 mice and retinal degeneration mice, rd1, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Mice were kept in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles with lights on at 7:00 a.m. (ZT0) and the lights off at 7:00 p.m. (ZT12). Total retinal RNA was prepared from adult SVJ129 mice (∼3 months old) at 12:00 p.m. (ZT5) or 12:00 a.m. (ZT17) using mirVana miRNA isolation system (Ambion). Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (75 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The eyes were enucleated, and the retina was quickly removed and submerged in 300 μl of lysis/binding buffer, homogenized with a plastic pestle homogenizer. Thereafter, the manufacturer's protocol for isolation of small RNA-enriched total RNA was followed (Ambion). Adult mouse total RNA samples from brain, heart, thymus, lung, liver, spleen, testicle, ovary, kidney, and embryonic day 10 embryos of Swiss Webster mice were purchased from Ambion. For the circadian rhythm study, total retinal RNA was isolated at ZT1, ZT5, ZT9, ZT13, ZT17, and ZT21. At each time point, three mice were sacrificed, and total retinal RNA from each mouse was prepared separately. Adult rd1 mouse (∼4 months old) retinal RNA was prepared as described above. Mouse olfactory epithelium total RNA was prepared as described previously (39Xu S. Wang Y. Zhao H. Zhang L. Xiong W. Yau K.W. Hiel H. Glowatzki E. Ryugo D.K. Valle D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9137-9151Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) except that we used the mirVana miRNA isolation system. For mouse tongue epithelium total RNA preparation, we removed adult SVJ129 mouse tongues and soaked them in enzyme mixture (1 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma), dispase (Invitrogen), and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) (40Huang Y.J. Maruyama Y. Lu K.S. Pereira E. Plonsky I. Baur J.E. Wu D. Roper S.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for 10 min. We also injected the mixture under the epithelium of the tongue. We peeled the epithelium off and soaked it in the lysis buffer of mirVana miRNA isolation system (Ambion) and prepared total RNA as described above. miRNA Labeling and Microarray Hybridization—We purified small RNA (<40 nt) from the total RNA samples using a FlashPAGE fractionator (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used the mirVana miRNA labeling kit (Ambion) and followed the Ambion protocol to label the miRNA with Cy3. We performed three independent microarray hybridizations with independent probes labeled from independent mouse retinal RNA preparations at ZT5 or ZT17. For the brain and heart profiling, we performed three independent microarray hybridizations with independently prepared probes from the total RNA purchased from Ambion. We used the mirVana miRNA bioarray (Ambion) for the miRNA profiling. This array contains 385 independent miRNAs each as a duplicate feature, representing a comprehensive panel of all human, mouse, and rat microRNAs in the miRNA Registry. We followed the manufacturers' protocol for hybridization. Microarray Scanning and Data Analysis—We used a Packard Biochip scanner at the Research Resource Center of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and ScanArray software to scan the arrays at 90–95% power and a photomultiplier of 75–80 and 5 μm resolution. The spot intensity was determined in QuantArray. The average intensity of the “empty” spots (negative controls) was calculated for each array as the background. We calculated the background-corrected signal intensity (BgCor Signal) according to the formula: BgCor Signal = spot intensity - (average of the empty spots). We reported values less than zero as zero. We normalized the BgCor Signal as a function of the average of the BgCor Signal of all noncontrol spots: normalized signal = BgCor Signal × 100/average of the BgCor Signal of all noncontrol spots. We calculated the average of the normalized intensity of the six spots for each miRNA gene (duplicate spots/array × three independent arrays) as the specific signal for each miRNA. We calculated significance of the specific signal as a two-tailed p value of Z-test (X = 0, σ = standard deviation of all noncontrol feature signals on array) for normalized signals. We identify a signal with p < 0.01 as a “positive” or as “expressed miRNA.” We removed the following features from analysis due to observation of apparent hybridization artifacts on the array images: BA10458, BA10440, BA10339, BA10333, BA10283, BA10442, BA10376, BA10245, BA10479, and BA10351. In the differential expression between day (ZT5) and night (ZT17) RNA samples, we calculated the fold of change for each miRNA as specific signal-ZT17/specific signal-ZT5. We evaluated the significance of differential expression using a two-tailed pairwise Student's t test between the specific signal intensity at ZT5 and the one at ZT17. The miRNA genes with p < 0.1 are identified as differentially expressed. RT-PCR—We purchased mirVana qRT-PCR primer sets of mmu-miR-7, mmu-miR-9, mmu-miR-31, mmu-miR-96, mmu-miR-181c, mmu-miR-182, mmu-miR-185, mmu-miR-194, mmu-miR-210, mmu-miR-219, mmu-miR-320, mmu-miR-335, mmu-miR-361, and mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit from Ambion and used 5 S rRNA as a normalizing control. For real time quantitative PCR (qPCR), we used 10 ng of total RNA and an Opticon 2 real time detector in a DNA engine 2 (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green I for detection. For end product PCR, we used a DNA Engine Dyad Peltier thermal cycler and separated the product on 3.5% high resolution agarose electro-phoresis gel. We used NCod SYBR Green miRNA first-strand synthesis and qRT-PCR system (Invitrogen) to amplify mmu-miR-9-AS, mmu-miR-25, mmu-miR-92, mmu-miR-106b, mmu-miR-183, mmu-miR-184, mmu-miR-211, mmu-miR-140-AS, and rno-miR151-AS with the forward primer (Sigma Genosys) sequences as the corresponding mature miRNA sequences. For the circadian rhythm studies on miR-182 and miR-96, we amplified 10 ng of total mouse retinal RNA prepared at ZT1, ZT5, ZT9, ZT13, ZT17, and ZT21. Three RNA samples from each of three mice were amplified at each time point. The relative quantity of the miR-182 and miR-96 was normalized to the 5 S RNA quantitation. We used a nonparametric one-way analysis of variance test to determine the significance of the differences. For the circadian rhythm study on Adcy6 expression, we employed a QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR system (Qiagen) with Mm_Adcy6_1_SG QuantiTect primer set (Qiagen, QT00136850) and used 18 S rRNA amplified with primer set (Qiagen, QT01036875) to normalize. We followed the manufacturer's protocol for the qRT-PCRs. In Situ Hybridization—We purchased 5′-digoxigenin-labeled miRCURY LNA detection probes for mmu-miR-182, mmu-miR-183, and mmu-miR-96 from Exiqon and used ∼6 pmol of probe on each section. We prepared fresh-frozen adult mouse retinal sections (10 μm) and followed the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. We prehybridized the sections in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 0.5 mg/ml baker yeast RNA) for 1 h at room temperature. We diluted ∼6 pmol of the probe in 300 μl of hybridization buffer for hybridization. The hybridizations were carried out at 52 °C overnight in a humidified chamber. Luciferase Reporter Assays of miRNA Targeting—We utilized RT-PCR to amplify and subclone fragments (SpeI/HindIII) of the 3′-UTR of ADCY6 (nt 4206–6520 of GenBank™ accession number NM_015270, containing four potential target sites for miR-96 and miR-182) or MITF (nt 3219–4654 of GenBank™ accession number NM_198159, containing four potential target sites for miR-96 and for miR-182) into the luciferase reporter vector, pMIR-REPORT (Ambion), 3′ to the firefly luciferase cassette. We plated HEK293 cells at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and transfected them with 150 ng of pMIR reporter construct (pMIR-REPORT-3′-UTR/Adcy6 or pMIR-REPORT-3′-UTR/Mitf), 15 ng of hpRL-SV40 (Promega), and 5–10 pmol of the specified miRNA mimics or control oligonucleotide with a scrambled sequence (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), we measured firefly luciferase activity 48 h later and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. We performed at least three independent experiments for each assay. The miRNA Transcriptomes of Mouse Retina, Brain, and Heart—Using a microarray (Ambion), we profiled the expression of miRNAs in small RNA-enriched total RNA from mouse retina, brain, and heart. We identified at least 78 miRNAs expressed in retina (Fig. 1) (supplemental Table 1). Of these, 40 (∼51%) are expressed in all three tissues (supplemental Table 8). These widely expressed miRNAs may represent a set of “housekeeping” miRNAs important for regulation of the basic cellular functions in all tissues. Of the remaining 38 retinal miRNAs, 12 were also expressed in brain but not in heart (supplemental Table 2A); five were expressed in heart but not brain (supplemental Table 2B); and 21 were detected only in retina making them candidate retina-specific miRNAs (Fig. 1 and Table 1). We also identified two miRNAs (miR-143 and Ambi_miR_7029) that were expressed in brain and heart but not retina (supplemental Table 7). Overall, the miRNA expression pattern of retina more closely resembled that of brain as compared with heart, in both the number of shared miRNAs and in the levels of their expression (Fig. 1, supplemental Tables 2 and 8–10).TABLE 1miRNAs expressed in retina but not in brain or heartNo.Namems chr locationhs chr locationAverage retina (ZT5)Average retina (ZT17)1hsa_miR_1826qA37q32.2693.9869.62hsa_miR_1836qA37q32.2491.7583.03hsa_miR_1849qE3.315q25.1401.5380.24mmu_miR_2117qC15q13.3391.4445.65hsa_miR_2107F511q15.5368.4443.06hsa_miR_966qA37q32.2368.3416.97hsa_miR_314qC49p21.3325.6303.58hsa_miR_181c8C319p13.12325.0233.69hsa_miR_3356qA37q32.2301.9181.010rno_miR_151_AS15qE1/10?8q24.3281.3254.611mmu_miR_140_AS8qD116q22.1273.2208.112hsa_miR_255qG17q22.1263.3116.013hsa_miR_361XqDXq21.2260.0255.814hsa_miR_32014qD18q21.3249.4305.515hsa_miR_21917qB2/2qA36p21.32/9q34.11193.2194.016hsa_miR_9214/XqA513q31.3/Xq26.2192.7188.317hsa_miR_1941qH4/19qA1q41/11q13.1189.1155.618hsa_miR_9_AS9qF1/13qC3/7qD21q23.1167.1109.319hsa_miR_713qB2/7qD2/17qD9q21.33140.9161.020hsa_miR_18516qB122q11.21119.0147.121hsa_miR_106b5qG17q22.157.4188.2 Open table in a new tab Confirmation of the Tissue Specificity of the Retinal miRNAs—We performed quantitative RT-PCR assays for all apparently retina-specific miRNAs in RNA isolated from retina, brain, and eight other tissues (heart, thymus, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, testis, and ovary) and embryonic day (E) 10 whole mouse embryos. We confirmed that all except miR-361 are expressed in retina (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). Interestingly, we found that miR-96, miR-182, miR-183, miR-184, miR-210, and miR-140-AS are all highly expressed in adult retina but are not detectable in RNA from brain or the other tissues. This high level of expression with apparent specificity suggests that these miRNAs may play important roles in the normal function of retina. One of the miRNAs, miR-210, is also expressed in E10 embryos (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1), but not in the other adult tissues and may have a role in early retinal development. We also found nine miRNAs (miR-7, miR-9, miR-9-AS, miR-31, miR-181c, miR-211, miR-219, miR-320, and miR-335) that are preferentially expressed in retina or retina/brain with low levels of expression in various other tissues (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). miR-25, miR-92, miR-194, and miR-151-AS are expressed in several other tissues in addition to retina. miR-106b and miR-185 are expressed at low level in most of the tissues. Developmental Patterns of Expression—To study the developmental time course of the 21 miRNAs shown to be specifically or preferentially expressed in retina, we isolated mouse total retinal RNA from eye cups of embryos at E10, and the developing retinas of embryos at E14 and E18, as well as from retinas of postnatal days 1 (P1) and 10 (P10) mice and performed qRT-PCR (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table 13). In the E10 samples, all of the assayed miRNAs have little or no expression. Most (17/21) showed a pattern of increasing expression with development peaking at P10 or adult (Fig. 3, A–C). Of these, 14 showed at least a 10-fold increase of expression at the peak time (adult or P10) (supplemental Table 13), compared with E10. Eight (miR-183, miR-182, mir-96, miR-9_AS, miR-184, miR-211, miR-151_AS, and miR-140_AS) of the 12 miRNAs with peak expression in adult retina showed at least a 10-fold increase from P1 to adult, suggesting that these miRNAs correspond to the time when the late retinal progenitor cells are differentiating into the mature retinal cell types and functioning as mature retinal neurons and/or Muller glia. Four of the miRNAs (miR-335, miR-219, miR-194, and miR-185) showed peak expression at E14 and E18.5 (Fig. 3D and supplemental Table 13), whereas other miRNAs (miR-151_AS, miR-211, miR-184, miR-25, and miR-140_AS) showed a moderate increase at E14 or E18 (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Table 13), suggesting that these miRNAs may have stage-specific functions. Identification of a Sensory Tissue-specific, Paralogous miRNA Cluster—The genes for three of the highly expressed retinal miRNAs, miR-183, miR-96, and miR-182, are clustered within 4 kb on mouse chr6qA3, transcribed in the same direction (telomere → centromere), and located in an ∼60-kb gap between the genes encoding nuclear respiratory factor-1 (Nrf1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2H (Ube2h). The orthologous region in humans is 7q32.2, where hsa-miR-183, miR-96, and miR-182 have similar arrangement (Fig. 4A). The sequences of these three miRNAs are similar to one another as follow: in mouse, miR-96 has 52 and 56% identity with miR-182 and miR-183, respectively; miR-182 and miR-183 are 78% identical (Fig. 4B). All three of these miRNAs have a similar developmental expression pattern (Fig. 4D). The sequence similarity, clustered location, common orientation, and shared developmental pattern suggest that these three miRNAs comprise a paralogous cluster transcr"

Here, we screened a kinase-specific siRNA library using an autophagy assay in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that measures lipidation of the marker protein GFP-LC3 following amino acid starvation. This screen identified ULK1 in addition to other novel candidates that could be confirmed with multiple siRNAs. Knockdown of ULK1, but not the related kinase ULK2, inhibited the autophagic response. Also, ULK1 knockdown inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy consistent with a role downstream of mTOR. Overexpression of ULK1 inhibited autophagy and this inhibition was independent of its kinase activity. Deletion of the PDZ domain-binding Val-Tyr-Ala motif at the ULK1 C terminus generated a more potent dominant-negative protein. Further deletions revealed that the minimal ULK1 dominant-negative region could be mapped to residues 1–351. Full-length ULK1 localized to cytoplasmic structures, some of which were GFP-LC3-positive, and this localization required the conserved C-terminal domain. In contrast, ULK1-(1–351) was diffuse in the cytoplasm. These experiments reveal at least two domains in ULK1 which likely function via unique sets of effectors to regulate autophagy.

During macroautophagy, a membrane cisterna wraps around cytoplasmic material to form a nascent autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with degradative endosomes. The targets of autophagy can include long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, ubiquitinated cellular substrates, and aberrant protein aggregates (1Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S.

Macroautophagy, which we refer to here as autophagy, is rapidly induced in response to amino acid deprivation and acts to recycle free molecular building blocks to the starving cell. Reflecting this cellular metabolic role, autophagy also appears to be critical in the maintenance of proper nutritional balance in the context of neonatal mice, developing Dictyostelium, and Caenorhabditis elegans undergoing development arrest (1Komatsu M.

Two yeast screens pioneered the identification of molecular components required for autophagy and a unified nomenclature has been devised for these genes (17Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M.

Although the function for many of these genes is unknown, a large proportion can be grouped into distinct biochemical pathways. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have established the stepwise progression of these pathways, which appear to be essential at an early stage of autophagy (20Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 21Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y.

For example, the gene products of Atg3, Atg4, Atg5, Atg7, Atg8, Atg10, Atg12, and Atg16 function coordinately in two interrelated ubiquitin-like conjugation systems (22Kirisako T. Ichimura Y.

Importantly, yeast Atg8p and its mammalian homologs become covalently linked to a phospholipid upon the induction of autophagy. This conversion of Atg8 proteins from their unlipidated species (also known as form-I) to the lipidated species (form-II) helps direct autophagosome formation by a poorly understood mechanism that appears to involve translocation of Atg8-II onto pre-autophagosomal membranes (24Ichimura Y.

Studies performed using Dictyostelium, Drosophila, and C. elegans have confirmed a role for their Atg1 homologs in autophagy (6Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B.

In mammals, two Atg1 homologs have been identified, uncoordinated 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and ULK2 (33Kuroyanagi H. Yan J. Seki N. Yamanouchi Y. Suzuki Y. Takano T. Muramatsu M. Shirasawa T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Yan J. Kuroyanagi H. Tomemori T. Okazaki N. Asato K. Matsuda Y. Suzuki Y. Ohshima Y. Mitani S. Masuho Y. Shirasawa T.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5850-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated an involvement of ULK1 in the subcellular re-distribution of mammalian Atg9 that takes place following nutrient starvation (35Young A.R. Chan E.Y. Hu X.W. Kochl R. Crawshaw S.G. High S. Hailey D.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Evidence from Drosophila and mammalian cells also indicate that Atg1 proteins have the ability to signal “upstream” to TOR via a feedback loop (32Scott R.C. Juhasz G. Neufeld T.P. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 36Lee S.B. Kim S. Lee J. Park J. Lee G. Kim Y. Kim J.M. Chung J. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was recently shown that ULK1 can be ubiquitinated and enter into a complex containing the polyubiquitin-binding protein p62 and TrkA NGF receptor, although the function of this pathway in autophagy is currently unknown (37Zhou X. Babu J.R. da Silva S. Shu Q. Graef I.A. Oliver T. Tomoda T. Tani T. Wooten M.W. Wang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here, we searched for autophagy regulators by performing siRNA-based functional genomics in a human cell line model for autophagy. To screen for signal transduction pathways, we used a 753-member “kinome” library designed to target all known and predicted human kinases and some associated subunits. Our screen utilized a biochemical immunoblotting assay for GFP-LC3 conversion and candidates were confirmed using multiple assays for autophagy. In addition to novel candidates, the screen also identified ULK1, but not ULK2, as an autophagy regulator. We used overexpression studies to define regions in ULK1 regulating autophagy and regions controlling the localization of ULK1 to autophagic structures. The analysis of these non-overlapping but complementary domains in ULK1 provide evidence for multiple functional modules in ULK1. Cell Culture—293A cells stably expressing EGFP-rat LC3 have been described before (27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were provided by E. L. Eskelinen (University of Helsinki, Finland). Both cell types were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS, and this also served as full nutrient medium in the analytical experiments. siRNA Transfections—The siRNA library contained SMART pools (Dharmacon) of 4 siRNA duplexes per gene targeting 753 protein kinases, lipid kinases, and regulatory subunits (see supplemental Table S2). SMART pool siRNA was also obtained for the human homologs of Atg5 (NM_004849), Atg7 (NM_006395), Atg12 (NM_004707), and ULK2 (NM_014683). Negative control siRNA was either the siControl non-targeting pool (that contains 4 duplexes) (Dharmacon), or (in the case of the library screen) a pool of 2 scrambled duplexes that have been routinely used in the laboratory (corresponding to sequences 5′-U ACC UUU AGC AUG AUG UGU-3′ and 5′-A UAA UGU GAC GAA UGA UCC). Sequences of the individual duplexes for chosen candidates are presented in supplemental Fig. S5. For the screen, 293/GFP-LC3 cells were seeded in 96-well dishes and transfected with 50 nm final siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen Life Sci) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Forty-eight hours after siRNA treatment, full nutrient medium was replenished. Then, following an additional 24 h, autophagy was initiated by incubating cells for 2 h in Earle's balanced saline solution (EBSS) (containing 0.5 mm leupeptin where indicated). Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% v/v Triton X-100 containing the Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), mixed with SDS-sample buffer and analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE. For control experiments (analyzing knockdown of Atg genes), and all other experimental tests, the format was scaled into 12- or 24-well dishes to minimize cell loss and reduce sample variability. Immunoblotting—To detect GFP-LC3, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with a mixture of anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody SG5 (from Dr. T. Hunt, Cancer Research UK, London) and anti-actin mouse monoclonal AC40 antibody (Sigma). Signals were quantified using secondary antibodies coupled to infrared chromophores and a 2-channel scanning method (Licor). Additionally, polyclonal antibody for phospho-S6 protein was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-β COP polyclonal and anti-MYC monoclonal 9E10 antibodies were obtained from Cancer Research UK. Confirmation of Knockdown by RT-PCR—Cell samples following 48 h of knockdown were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for isolation of total RNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT primer and Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen). PCR primers for each candidate gene or actin were designed off 3′-regions of the cDNA sequences (spanning multiple exons), and these primers were used in real time PCR reactions performed with SYBR green chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Fold decreases in mRNA levels were determined after calibration of the assay using standard curve methods. Overexpression of ULK1—Expression plasmids for wild-type and kinase-dead (K46R) murine ULK1 have been described (38Tomoda T. Bhatt R.S. Kuroyanagi H. Shirasawa T. Hatten M.E. Neuron. 1999; 24: 833-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Constructs used here containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag, and various deletions were derived from these. For biochemical analysis by GFP-LC3 conversion or protein degradation, cells were transfected with high efficiency and high expression levels using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For analysis of protein localization on glass coverslips, lower expression levels were achieved using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) transfection reagent. In all cases, 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for 2 h and then lysed or fixed for analysis. Microscopic Analysis of GFP-LC3 Translocation—293/GFP-LC3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and 24 h later transfected with 25 nm final siRNA. Forty-eight hours after siRNA treatment, full nutrient medium was replenished, and then, after an additional 24 h, autophagy was induced by starvation in EBSS/0.5 mm leupeptin. After 120 min of induction, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, briefly stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and then mounted onto glass slides. Cells were visualized using a 20×-0.75 N.A. air objective and a Hamamatsu 12-bit camera mounted on a Discovery-1 automated microscope (Molecular Devices). Multiple fields at random positions were collected for each condition. Automated quantification of GFP-LC3-labeled structures in the images was performed using the Granularity algorithm of the Metamorph 6.2 software package (Molecular Devices) using equivalent settings between the various conditions. Protein Degradation—293/GFP-LC3 or HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected with siRNA or expression plasmid as described above. Forty-eight hours after siRNA treatment, or 8 h after plasmid transfection, cells were exchanged into labeling medium (DMEM/10% dialyzed FBS containing [14C]valine (0.2 μCi/ml) in 65 μm unlabeled valine) and incubated overnight. The following day, cells were exchanged into chase medium (DMEM/10% FBS/2 mm unlabeled valine) and further incubated for 4 h to remove the contribution of short-lived proteins. After the chase period, cells were exchanged into EBSS/2 mm valine to initiate autophagy, and following 2 h of induction, the media were collected, and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was analyzed by scintillation counting. The cells were lysed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction of this was isolated, resolublized in 9 m urea, and then counted to obtain a measurement of total cellular labeling. Autophagy was quantified as percentage of protein degradation, which was calculated using ((medium trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts)/(medium trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts) + (cellular trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cellular counts)). We typically observed ∼4% degradation (over 2 h) in control starved cells, which is in agreement with previous studies (27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A.

Statistical Analysis—In the screen raw data, there is variability in the GFP-LC3 ratio (calculated as GFP-LC3-II/(GFP-LC3-I + GFP-LC3-II)) that can be attributed most likely to the immunoblotting technique. To compare library data from multiple blots, we used a normalization process whereby the GFP-LC3 ratios of each blot were adjusted by a constant value until the median GFP-LC3 ratios from each blot were equivalent. This process is described in greater detail in supplemental Fig. S2. To calculate p values for the adjusted pooled GFP-LC3 ratio data, we used an empirical Bayes t test, which compensates for the small replicate numbers by moving an individual gene variance toward a consensus (across all genes) variance (42Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9298) Google Scholar). For other analyses, we calculated p values between groups using the Student's t test for data sets with two-tailed distributions and equal variance. Screen of Human Kinome for Autophagy Modulators—To identify novel regulators of autophagy, we screened a siRNA library which targets 753 human kinases and regulatory subunits. As our model system, we used HEK 293 cells stably expressing the GFP-LC3 marker protein (293/GFP-LC3), which have previously been shown to rapidly respond to starvation induced autophagy by morphological and biochemical assays (27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We used 293 cells as they are targeted very efficiently by siRNAs. Even with siRNA concentrations as low as 5 nm in the final transfection mixture, total protein levels can be reduced as much as 90% (27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and >90% of cells are targeted (data not shown). Autophagy is induced through amino acid starvation of cells by incubation in Earle's buffered saline solution (EBSS) for 2 h, which therefore also results in serum starvation. We observed in 293 cells that the presence or absence of serum does not affect the activation of autophagy, at least as detected using GFP-LC3 (data not shown). For all GFP-LC3 conversion experiments, the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin was also included in the starvation medium to decrease autophagosomal degradation and enhance the accumulation of the lipidated GFP-LC3-II. To validate our model system, we analyzed siRNAs for various human Atg genes and we observed in 293/GFP-LC3 cells that knockdown of Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12 had the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP-LC3 conversion (Fig. 1A). Atg7 is the ubiquitination E1-like enzyme that catalyzes LC3 conversion. Atg7 also catalyzes the Atg5–Atg12 conjugation event that is prerequisite for LC3 conversion (21Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Each gene in our library was targeted by a pool of 4 different siRNA duplexes and for the screen, each gene was analyzed in duplicate to obtain quantitative scores for GFP-LC3 conversion. This duplicate analysis was contained within 40 separate immunoblotted SDS-PAGE gels and each gel included non-targeting and Atg7 siRNA internal controls. An example of primary data is presented in supplemental Fig. S1. Fig. 1B shows the general range and correlation between the replicate experimental data sets and their relation to the internal controls. Of the 753 genes initially included in the screen, 48 (6%) were lost during culturing or could not be analyzed in one of the replicates. To accurately compare the remaining 705 genes across the multiple immunoblots, GFP-LC3 conversion ratios were corrected so that the median value on each blot was equal among all blots (see supplemental Fig. S2). The average GFP-LC3 conversion ratios for each gene were ranked, and 96% of the scores fell within 2 standard deviations from the mean value over the entire library (Fig. 1C). Taking into account the duplicate data sets, p values were derived for each gene. As expected, the p values decreased for genes showing the greatest effects on GFP-LC3 conversion. For further confirmatory experiments, we focused on 12 representative candidates with p < 0.06, which also showed the most dramatic fold changes (supplemental Table S1). Other than ULK1, no other candidate had a described link with autophagy. A total list of genes included the library is provided in supplemental Table S2. Several genes were absent from our initial list of screen candidates including PI 3-kinases and components of the mTOR-p70S6 kinase signaling pathway that have been implicated in autophagy regulation (29Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 43Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In follow-up experiments, we observed that knockdown of the hVps34 class III PI 3-kinase did not strongly inhibit GFP-LC3 conversion in our cell model, despite the clear sensitivity of GFP-LC3 conversion to the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin (supplemental Fig. S3). Additionally, we re-confirmed our screen results that knockdown of mTOR or any single p70S6 kinase gene did not increase levels of GFP-LC3 conversion following starvation (or under full nutrient conditions) (supplemental Fig. S4) despite the sensitivity of the assay to rapamycin (see Fig. 4E). However, knockdown of both p70S6 kinase genes together decreased starvation-dependent GFP-LC3 conversion. Confirmation of Candidate Individual siRNAs—Because siRNA screens in mammalian cells can potentially be influenced by interfering off-target effects (45Moffat J. Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 149-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we re-confirmed the top candidates by studying the 4 individual duplexes of the SMART pools. Our criteria for specificity were that: 1) at least 2 of the individual siRNAs should confirm the modulatory effect on GFP-LC3 conversion as observed using siRNA pools, and 2) knockdown of the transcript by the individual siRNAs can be confirmed. 7 of 12 candidates re-screened fit these criteria (Fig. 2). All 4 duplex sequences for the candidate LOC340371 gave similar stimulatory effects on GFP-LC3 conversion; 3 duplexes were identified for MAP2K6 that produced inhibitory effects; and 2 duplexes were identified for the candidates ULK1, HUNK, ROCK1, CDK8, and SGK1 which produced internally consistent modulatory effects. Sequences corresponding to the siRNA duplexes that were confirmed are listed in supplemental Fig. S5. Modulation of Autophagic Protein Degradation—To characterize the candidates using an autophagy assay independent of GFP-LC3, we measured rates of starvation-induced long-lived protein degradation in [14C]valine-labeled cells (40Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 46Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Trugnan G. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Autophagic protein degradation could be inhibited to uninduced levels by the addition of either wortmannin or leupeptin to the EBSS starvation medium, while, in contrast, the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin did not show any inhibition (data not shown). ULK1 knockdown inhibited protein degradation, both in the basal state and more obviously, following amino acid starvation (Fig. 3A). This requirement of ULK1 for efficient protein degradation was also observed following knockdown in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). For the other candidates, we could confirm that knockdown of CDK8, ROCK1, or LOC340371 significantly increased levels of starvation-induced protein degradation. However, knockdown of CDK8, ROCK1, or LOC340371 did not significantly increase basal autophagy in the unstarved state as determined by GFP-LC3 conversion and knockdown of these genes did not inhibit the ability of nutrients to promote phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal S6 protein (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2014657344,"Self-renewal and differentiation by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is the foundation for continual spermatogenesis. SSC self-renewal is dependent on glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); however, intracellular mechanisms stimulated by GDNF in SSCs are unknown. To investigate these mechanisms we utilized a culture system that maintains a mouse undifferentiated germ cell population enriched for self-renewing SSCs. In these cultures mRNA for the transcription factors Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 are up-regulated by GDNF and decreased in its absence. The expression of all three molecules was further identified in undifferentiated spermatogonia in vivo. Using small interfering RNA to reduce expression and transplantation to quantify stem cell numbers, Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 were shown to be important for SSC maintenance in vitro. Next, GDNF was shown to activate both Akt and Src family kinase (SFK) signaling in SSCs, and culture of SSCs with inhibitors to Akt or SFKs followed by transplantation analysis showed significant impairment of SSC maintenance in vitro. Apoptosis analysis revealed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells when Akt, but not SFK, signaling was impaired, indicating that multiple signaling pathways are responsible for SSC self-renewal and survival. Biochemical and gene expression experiments revealed that GDNF up-regulated expression of Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 transcripts is dependent on SFK signaling. Overall, these data demonstrate that GDNF up-regulation of Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 expression through SFK signaling is a key component of the intracellular mechanism for SSC self-renewal."

https://openalex.org/W2144023491,"Visual input from the left and right visual fields is processed predominantly in the contralateral hemisphere. Here we investigated whether this preference for contralateral over ipsilateral stimuli is also found in high-level visual areas that are important for the recognition of objects and faces. Human subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed and attended faces, objects, scenes, and scrambled images in the left or right visual field. With our stimulation protocol, primary visual cortex responded only to contralateral stimuli. The contralateral preference was smaller in object- and face-selective regions, and it was smallest in the fusiform gyrus. Nevertheless, each region showed a significant preference for contralateral stimuli. These results indicate that sensitivity to stimulus position is present even in high-level ventral visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2154620292,"Caspase-3 is an essential executioner of apoptosis responsible for regulating many important cellular processes, among them the number of circulating monocytes, central players in the innate immune response. The activation of caspase-3 requires its processing from an inactive precursor. Here we show that the small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) associates with caspase-3 and protein-protein interaction experiments in vivo and with purified proteins demonstrate a direct interaction between Hsp27 and the amino-terminal prodomain of caspase-3. Using an in vitro caspase-3 activation assay, our results further establish that the interaction of Hsp27 with the caspase-3 prodomain inhibits the second proteolytic cleavage necessary for caspase-3 activation, revealing a novel mechanism for the regulation of this effector caspase. Hsp27 expression in monocytes is constitutive.

Highlighting the importance of cell partitioning in the regulation of apoptosis, immunofluorescence, and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that whereas both caspase-3 and Hsp27 are cytoplasmic in fresh monocytes (i.e. not undergoing apoptosis), Hsp27 moves to the nucleus during apoptosis, a relocalization that can be blocked by promoting the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages or by inhibiting cell death.

These results reveal a novel mechanism of caspase-3 regulation and underscore a novel and fundamental role of Hsp27 in the regulation of monocyte life span. Apoptosis is a central homeostatic process that regulates cell number in metazoans. Caspases are highly conserved cysteine proteases essential for apoptosis (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). They are constitutively expressed as inactive precursors that become activated by proteolytic cleavage (2Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 3Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 8: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is a central effector caspase involved in numerous apoptotic pathways. The first step for caspase-3 activation is mediated by initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and caspase-9 (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). The former binds to cytochrome c and, through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway, initiated the apoptotic cascade (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Monocytes, key components of the innate immune system, originate in the bone marrow daily and circulate in the blood-stream for 24–48 h (6Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the absence of survival stimuli, monocytes undergo spontaneous apoptosis (7Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). The monocyte apoptotic fate is halted by inflammatory stimuli, differentiation factors, or malignant transformation, all of which prolong monocyte survival by somehow inhibiting the activation of caspases (6Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J.

Macrophages are derived from monocytes, but unlike monocytes, they can live up to 3 months and are more resistant to apoptosis (10Thomas E.D. Ramberg R.E. sale G.E. Sparkes R.S. Golde D.W. Science. 1976; 192: 1016-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Macrophages are distributed throughout every organ where they recognize a wide range of antigens (11Ross J.A. Auger M.J. Burke B. Lewis 2nd, C.E. The Macrophage. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar). Monocytes and macrophages have distinct cell surface receptors like CD14 and mannose receptor, respectively, which allow these cells to respond to particular antigens and provide convenient markers to identifying both populations (12Mahoney J.A. Haworth R. Gordon S. Dallman M.J. Lamb J.R. Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2000: 120-146Google Scholar). Thus monocytes/macrophages constitute the main innate line of defense in the blood and organs. The activation of caspase-3 is central in the execution of spontaneous monocyte apoptosis, and prolonged monocyte survival is mediated by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation (7Fahy R.J.

Hsp represent a conserved family of proteins induced by stress conditions that have been mainly studied for their participation in protein folding (17Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). Hsps are classified based on their molecular weight into large and small (sHsp). Hsp70 and Hsp90 are members of the large Hsp group, whereas Hsp27 and αB-crystallin belong to the sHsp group and have recently emerged as regulators of apoptosis (18Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Jornot L.

In human monocytes heat shock-induced expression of Hsp70 has been correlated with monocyte survival (21Lang D. Hubrich A. Dohle F. Terstesse M. Saleh H. Schmidt M. Pauels H.G. Heidenreich S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of Hsp27 are a marker for increased malignancy in breast cancer (22Hansen R.K. Parra I. Lemieux P. Oesterreich S. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 56: 187-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hsp27 overexpression prevents apoptosis by associating with cytochrome c, resulting in the inhibition of caspase-9 (23Bruey J. Ducasse C.

In addition, αB-crystallin has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of apoptosis during skeletal muscle development by inhibiting caspase-3 activation (24Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Sam S.

We describe here that, unlike Hsp70, Hsp27 is higher and constitutively expressed in the monocyte lineage. In contrast, αB-crystallin is undetectable, even after heat shock stimulation. We found that Hsp27 relocalizes to the nucleus during spontaneous monocyte apoptosis. The relocalization of Hsp27 is blocked by caspase-3 inhibitors or by the differentiation factor macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Hsp27 expression increases during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. We show that Hsp27 associates with caspase-3 in non-apoptotic cells. We determined that the prodomain of caspase-3 is necessary for the association and that Hsp27 acts by inhibiting caspase-3 proteolytic processing. We demonstrate that the overexpression of Hsp27 in monocytic cells reduced apoptosis, whereas silencing of Hsp27 expression in macrophages with double-stranded RNA interference increased macrophage apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest an additional role of Hsp27 as an anti-apoptotic modulator of caspase-3, providing a novel checkpoint in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage life span. Monocyte Purification and Cell Culture—Human monocytes were purified by clumping or CD14+ selection, as previously described (25Doseff A.I. Baker J.H. Bourgeois T.A. Wewers M.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The population of monocytes was on average 85–90% pure as estimated by flow cytometry using an anti-CD14 marker (BD Biosciences). Monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) to a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. THP-1 monocytic cells and RAW264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640, 5% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For monocyte/macrophage differentiation (monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), purified human monocytes were cultured on plates up to 7 days in RPMI 1640, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin with 100 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). MDM differentiation was confirmed by changes in morphology and increased levels of macrophage mannose receptor, detected by flow cytometry (12Mahoney J.A. Haworth R. Gordon S. Dallman M.J. Lamb J.R. Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2000: 120-146Google Scholar). Heat shock was performed at 42 °C in 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min in monocytes and 2 h in THP-1 cells followed by a recovery at 37 °C for different times. Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Extracts were collected by centrifugation and washed with KPM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton-X, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA containing 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of protease inhibitors chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, antipain, and phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing, and extracts were then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants (soluble fractions in Fig. 1) were snap-frozen and stored at −70 °C for future use. The pellets (insoluble fractions in Fig. 1) were resuspended in buffer C (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris-HCl containing DTT, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min. Whole cell lysates (used in Fig. 1A) were prepared by sonication of extracts in the presence of buffer C. Lysates were boiled 5 min in Laemmli buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol before loading onto gels. Gels were stained overnight with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to determine equal loading. For immunoprecipitations, HeLa cells expressing different domains of caspase-3 (26Chen L. Smith L. Wang Z. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol containing DTT, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Hsp27, anti-caspase-9 (BD Pharmingen), and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) antibodies and G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with buffer A. Recombinant proteins were preincubated for 30 min on ice followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Hsp27 for 5 h at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was carried out with anti-Hsp27 (SPA-803), Hsp70 (SPA-810), αB-crystallin (SPA-223), and Hsp25 (SPA-801) antibodies obtained from Stressgen. β-Tubulin antibody was obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-caspase-3 (clone C-31720) antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories and anti-acetylated-H4 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Densitometry analyses were done using Quantity-One (Bio-Rad). In experiments performed to detect Hsp27 and Hsp70, an equal amount of protein was loaded in each lane. For the detection of αB-crystallin, 100 μg of total protein were loaded per well. Secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase and ECL were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blots—To obtain subcellular fractions, 2 × 107 primary human monocytes were collected for each time point. Nuclear and cytoplasm fractions were obtained using the Qproteome Cell Compartment Reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Equal amounts of protein for each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was conducted with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lamin B (Santa Cruz), markers of cytoplasm and nuclear fractions, respectively. The same membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Hsp27 and anti-caspase-3 active and inactive antibodies. Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in blocking buffer (cold PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml human total IgG) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After gentle mixing, the cells were divided into individual tubes containing 1 × 106 cells each, and 5 μl of allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD14 or isotype control was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. After 2 washes with blocking buffer, cells were resuspended in 250 μl of Cytofix/Cytoperm® and incubated for 20 min on ice with 20 μl of FITC-conjugated anti-active-caspase-3 (casp-3; BD Pharmingen). Cells were washed 2 times with Perm/Wash® buffer and finally resuspended with 200 μl of blocking buffer. Alternatively, cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and 7AAD using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit by following the manufacturer's specification (BD Pharmingen). Levels of mannose receptor were detected using anti-mannose-receptor-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated antibody or an isotype-PE-conjugated control (BD Pharmingen). Hsp27 expression levels were detected using an anti-Hsp27 and anti-Hsp25 (Stressgen, SPA-801) and Alexa-633 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) antibodies. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using BD Biosciences FACS ARIA using FCS Express V3 software. Transient Transfection, RNA Interference, and Immunofluorescence—Full-length cDNA of Hsp27 (accession number BC012768) was obtained from OpenBiosytems and cloned inframe into the green fluorescent vector pEGFP-C2 (GFP from Clontech, Mountain View, CA). THP-1 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in the specified electroporation buffer provided by kit V Amaxa (catalog no. VCA-1003, Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) to a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. One μg of vector alone (vector-GFP) and vector containing Hsp27 (Hsp27-GFP) was mixed with 0.1 ml of cell suspension and nucleofected using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ (Program V-01 as recommended by the manufacturer). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide for 12 h to induce apoptosis. HeLa cells were transfected with different domains of caspase-3 as previously described (27Voss O.H. Kim S. Wewers M.D. Doseff A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17371-17379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen). For silencing experiments, pre-validated siRNA for human Hsp27 was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). siRNA for Hsp25 used in mouse Raw cells was from Ambion (Austin, TX). MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 150 nm siRNA or a scramble control (Qiagen) for 72 or 24 h, respectively. Apoptosis was induced for 12 h with 10 μm etoposide in MDMs or 100 μm for RAW cells. For immunofluorescence studies, the cells were fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated in blocking solution (0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mg/ml human IgG) for 30 min at room temperature. Staining was conducted in blocking solution with anti-Hsp27 (SPA-803), anti-active caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or inactive caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC or phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively (Alexa 488 or Alexa 633, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclear staining with 50 ng/ml 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Sigma) was conducted as previously described (27Voss O.H. Kim S. Wewers M.D. Doseff A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17371-17379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and percentage of apoptosis was determined by nuclear fragmentation by counting at least 200 GFP-positive cells. Fluorescence was visualized on an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY), and digital images were captured using Optronics Imaging System (Goleta, CA) and ImageProPlus software (excitation at 300 nm; emission at 461 nm). Caspase Activity—Active caspases was determined by the AFC assay as previously described (27Voss O.H. Kim S. Wewers M.D. Doseff A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17371-17379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mixes were incubated with DEVD-AFC to determine the presence of active caspase-3 in a cyto-buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, containing 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm tetrapeptide substrate DEVD-AFC). To determine the presence of active caspase-9, we used the tetrapeptide LEHD-AFC in a cyto-buffer (0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 10% polyethylene glycol, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, and 500 μm LEHD-AFC). The tetrapeptides were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Release of free AFC was determined using a Cytofluor 4000 fluorometer (Perseptive Co., Framingham, MA.; excitation, 400 nm; emission, 508 nm). Recombinant Hsp27 and Hsp90 were obtained from Stressgen. Hsp27 was mixed at equal amounts (1:1) or double amounts with rcasp-3 (2:1) for 30 min on ice. Dilutions of Hsp27 were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Hsp90 was diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Caspase-9 obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) was then added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test comparisons or individual comparisons were made by using the contrast method. Statistical significance is stated in Figs. 4 and 5.FIGURE 5Hsp27 overexpression inhibits caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. THP-1 monocytic cells were transfected with Hsp27-GFP or an empty vector (Vector-GFP) and treated for 12 h with 10 μm etoposide to induce apoptosis or left untreated.

THP-1 cells originate from a monocytic leukemia, and unlike primary human monocytes, do not undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates from freshly isolated human monocytes (Fig. 1A, NT) or THP-1 cells (Fig. 1B, NT) reveal high constitutively expression of Hsp27. Similar levels of Hsp27 are found in whole-cell lysates from monocytes undergoing apoptosis when compared with freshly isolated monocytes lysates (Fig. 1A, A). In contrast, no significant increase of Hsp27 expression was observed in lysates from heat-shocked-treated monocytes and THP-1 cells (Fig. 1, A–C, HS). Unlike Hsp27, αB-crystallin was undetectable by immunoblotting in the primary human monocytes under all of the conditions tested (Fig. 1A). A low constitutive level of αB-crystallin expression that remained unaltered during heat shock was found in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1B, NT and HS). In contrast to Hsp27, Hsp70 expression was low in fresh monocytes apoptotic monocytes, and untreated THP-1 cells but increased with heat shock at least 3-folds and in THP-1 cells by ∼30-fold (Fig. 1, A and B, Hsp70), consistent with previous studies (21Lang D. Hubrich A. Dohle F. Terstesse M. Saleh H. Schmidt M. Pauels H.G. Heidenreich S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results show a differential pattern of expression of Hsp70, αB-crystallin, and Hsp27 in monocytes. The constitutively high levels of Hsp27 expression in primary human monocytes and THP-1 cells in the absence of detectable αB-crystallin are likely to suggest an important role of Hsp27 in the monocytic lineage. Localization of Hsp27 Changes during Spontaneous Monocyte Apoptosis—We have previously shown that human monocytes undergo spontaneous apoptosis, a process that requires activation of caspase-3 (7Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that purified CD14+ monocytes cultured for different lengths of time showed active caspase-3 as early as 4 h during monocyte life span and ∼40% of the cells have active caspase-3 at 8 h (Fig. 1D). Because Hsp27 was previously shown to relocalize upon heat shock (28Arrigo A.-P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we next determined the localization of Hsp27 during spontaneous monocyte apoptosis. Freshly isolated monocytes cultured for different lengths of time were separated into soluble (cytoplasm) and insoluble (nuclei and other organelles) fractions. Western blots performed with anti-Hsp27 antibodies showed that in fresh, non-apoptotic monocytes Hsp27 localized mostly to the soluble fraction, with significantly lower levels in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1E, 0 and 1 h). A significant increase of Hsp27 in the insoluble fraction was observed after 4 h of culturing (Fig. 1E, 4 h). In apoptotic monocytes most of the Hsp27 protein was present in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1E, 8–16 h). In sharp contrast, Hsp70 was localized in the soluble fraction throughout the life span of monocytes (Fig. 1E). To rule out that the relocalization of Hsp27 was due to nonspecific localization during apoptosis, the same membranes were reblotted with acetylated histone 4 (AcH4). AcH4 was found in the insoluble fraction consisting of nuclei and other cellular organelles at all the time points tested (Fig. 1E). Next, we determined the localization of endogenous Hsp27 by immunofluorescence during the life span of primary human monocytes. We found that Hsp27 localized to the cytoplasm of fresh monocytes, but at 8 h Hsp27 was found in the nucleus of monocytes undergoing spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 2A). The localization of endogenous caspase-3 was determined using two different antibodies. The inactive caspase-3, shown in red, and the active caspase-3 (in green) were found routinely in the cytoplasm in both fresh and apoptotic primary human monocytes (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the cytoplasm localization of Hsp27 was dependent on prolonged monocyte survival, we inhibited monocyte apoptosis by culturing monocytes for 8 h with the survival factor M-CSF, which blocks apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 activation (Ref. 9Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I. Pomerantz R.W. Lau S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Franke T.F. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26393-26398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We found that Hsp27 remained localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, see M-CSF). Next, we studied whether the relocalization of Hsp27 was dependent on caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Monocytes were cultured for 8 h with 75 μm caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-FMK (Fig. 2A, see DEVD). This inhibitor allows the first cleavage of caspase-3 but blocks the active site, preventing the autocatalytic processing of the prodomain of caspase-3 (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). We found that under these conditions, Hsp27 continued to be localized in the cytoplasm. Next, we obtained nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from freshly isolated primary human monocytes and monocytes cultured for 8 or 16 h, respectively. We found that Hsp27 localized in the cytoplasm in fresh monocytes. During monocyte spontaneous apoptosis at 8 h, Hsp27 was found mostly in nucleus, and by 16 h Hsp27 was found completely in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). In contrast, inactive full-length caspase-3 and the active cleaved caspase-3 were always found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that Hsp27 localizes with the inactive caspase-3 precursor in the cytoplasm of non-apoptotic cells. Although Hsp27 relocalized to the nucleus during apoptosis, active caspase-3 remained in the cytoplasm. Relocalization of Hsp27 appears to be dependent on the activation of caspase-3, since cells treated with the caspase-3 inhibito"
https://openalex.org/W2069299536,"The canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are a family of non-selective cation channels that are activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ and Gq/phospholipase C-coupled receptors. We used quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization, immunoblots and patch-clamp recording from several brain regions to examine the expression of the predominant TRPC channels in the rodent brain. Quantitative real-time PCR of the seven TRPC channels in the rodent brain revealed that TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels were the predominant TRPC subtypes in the adult rat brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunoblotting further resolved a dense corticolimbic expression of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Total protein expression of HIP TRPC4 and 5 proteins increased throughout development and peaked late in adulthood (6–9 weeks). In adults, TRPC4 expression was high throughout the frontal cortex, lateral septum (LS), pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus (HIP), dentate gyrus (DG), and ventral subiculum (vSUB). TRPC5 was highly expressed in the frontal cortex, pyramidal cell layer of the HIP, DG, and hypothalamus. Detailed examination of frontal cortical layer mRNA expression indicated TRPC4 mRNA is distributed throughout layers 2–6 of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), motor cortex (MCx), and somatosensory cortex (SCx). TRPC5 mRNA expression was concentrated specifically in the deep layers 5/6 and superficial layers 2/3 of the PFC and anterior cingulate. Patch-clamp recording indicated a strong metabotropic glutamate-activated cation current-mediated depolarization that was dependent on intracellular Ca2+and inhibited by protein kinase C in brain regions associated with dense TRPC4 or 5 expression and absent in regions lacking TRPC4 and 5 expression. Overall, the dense corticolimbic expression pattern suggests that these Gq/PLC coupled nonselective cation channels may be involved in learning, memory, and goal-directed behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2009000223,"Protein degradation plays an important role in modulating ethylene signal transduction in plants. Here we show that the ethylene receptor ETR2 is one such target for degradation and that its degradation is dependent upon perception of the signaling ligand ethylene. The ETR2 protein is initially induced by ethylene treatment, consistent with an increase in transcript levels. At ethylene concentrations above 1 μl/liter, however, ETR2 protein levels subsequently decrease in a post-transcriptional fashion. Genetic and chemical approaches indicate that ethylene perception by the receptors initiates the reduction in ETR2 protein levels. The ethylene-induced decrease in ETR2 levels is not affected by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, but is affected by proteasome inhibitors, indicating a role for the proteasome in ETR2 degradation. Ethylene-induced degradation still occurs in seedlings treated with brefeldin A, indicating that degradation of ETR2 does not require exit from its subcellular location at the endoplasmic reticulum. These data support a model in which ETR2 is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway in response to ethylene binding. Implications of this model for ethylene signaling are discussed.

Interactions between signaling ligands and membrane-bound receptors are essential for orchestrating the growth and development of multicellular eukaryotes. Ligand binding initiates signal transduction pathways that often culminate in the induction and repression of specific suites of genes. Studies of animal growth factor receptors have revealed that the release of bound ligands may not occur rapidly enough for physiologically relevant regulation of the pathways. Instead, the major method for regulating the amplitude and kinetics of signal transduction is via endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complexes (1Wiley H.S. Bittar E.E. Fundamentals of Medical Cell Biology. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1992Google Scholar, 2Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Following endocytosis, receptors are sorted such that they either undergo degradation in the lysosome or are recycled back to the cell surface. Whether ligand-induced degradation of membrane receptors also occurs in plants has not been possible to determine until the relatively recent identification of cognate receptors for some plant growth factors. In plants, the gaseous hormone ethylene regulates seed germination, seedling growth, leaf and petal abscission, organ senescence, ripening, stress responses, and pathogen responses (4Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992Google Scholar). Plant responses to ethylene have been found to occur over a range of ethylene concentrations from 0.2 nl/liter to 1000 μl/liter (4Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992Google Scholar, 5Binder B.M. Mortimore L.A. Stepanova A.N. Ecker J.R. Bleecker A.B.

In Arabidopsis, ethylene is perceived by a five-member receptor family that includes ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, and EIN4 (7Chang C. Stadler R. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Schaller G.E. Kieber J.J. Somerville C. Meyerowitz E. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002Google Scholar). The ethylene receptors have similar overall structures with transmembrane domains near their N termini and putative signaling motifs in their C-terminal halves. The transmembrane domains apparently serve two functions. First, they are responsible for membrane localization of the receptors, the receptor ETR1 having been demonstrated to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumACC1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylatePMplasma membrane 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumACC1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylatePMplasma membrane (9Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The ER is an unusual location for a hormone receptor but one compatible with the ready diffusion of ethylene in aqueous and lipid environments. Second, based on genetic and biochemical evidence, the transmembrane domains contain the ethylene-binding site (10Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal half of each receptor are domains with similarity to histidine kinases and in some cases the receiver domains of response regulators. Histidine kinases and receiver domains are signaling elements originally identified as components in bacterial phosphorelays and are now known to be present in plants, fungi, and slime molds (12Schaller G.E. Adv. Bot. Res. 2000; 32: 109-148Crossref Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate plasma membrane endoplasmic reticulum 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate plasma membrane The five-member family of Arabidopsis ethylene receptors contains two subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis and some shared structural features (8Schaller G.E. Kieber J.J. Somerville C. Meyerowitz E. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002Google Scholar). Members of subfamily 1 (ETR1 and ERS1) contain three transmembrane domains and histidine kinase domains with all of the conserved residues required for histidine kinase activity (13Gamble R.L. Coonfield M.L. Schaller G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7825-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Moussatche P. Klee H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48734-48741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Members of subfamily 2 (ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4) contain the three conserved transmembrane domains plus an additional N-terminal hydrophobic domain that is predicted to serve as a signal sequence. In addition, their histidine kinase domains lack residues essential for histidine kinase activity, and they have been proposed to act as Ser/Thr kinases (14Moussatche P. Klee H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48734-48741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Members from both subfamilies (ERS1, ETR2, and ERS2) are induced by ethylene at the transcriptional level (15Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), indicating that the same ligand detected by the receptors also affects expression levels of the receptors. In this paper, we report on the biochemical characterization of ETR2, a member of subfamily 2 that has not been characterized previously at the protein level. Our results are consistent with a model whereby binding of ethylene to ETR2 induces degradation of the receptor, similar to what has been observed following ligand binding to animal growth factor receptors. But in contrast to the paradigm established with animal growth factor receptors, turnover of ethylene receptors is mediated by the proteasome rather than the lysosome, a situation potentially arising due to localization of receptors to the endoplasmic reticulum rather than to the plasma membrane. Plant Materials—Wild-type Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype) and various ethylene response mutants were used, including ethylene-insensitive mutants (etr1-1, etr2-1, ein2-1) (16Chang C. Kwok S.F.

The etr2-1; ctr1-2 and the etr1-1; ctr1-2 double mutants were generated by crossing, with plants homozygous for ctr1-2 identified by the constitutive ethylene response phenotype and those homozygous for etr2-1 and etr1-1 identified by PCR-based genotyping (20Hua J. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Plant Growth Conditions—For growth of etiolated seedlings, sterile seeds were placed on Petri dishes with half-strength Murashige and Skoog basal medium with Gamborg's vitamins (pH 5.75; Sigma) and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Aminoethylvinyl-Gly (5 μm) was included in the growth medium to inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by the seedlings. After a 2-day cold treatment at 4 °C, plates were exposed to light at 22 °C for 0.5 days. Plates were then placed in sealed chambers, and seedlings were grown for 3.5 days in the dark at 24 °C in the presence of ethylene at the indicated concentration. To examine the growth of seedlings in the absence of ethylene, hydrocarbon-free air was passed through the chamber to remove trace amounts of ethylene synthesized by the seedlings. For short term treatments with inhibitors, seedlings were grown on filter paper placed on the solid plate medium and then moved to the same medium without agar containing the inhibitor and incubated for the indicated times. In cases where prolonged exposure to inhibitors in aqueous solution was required, plants were grown under constant light in liquid culture (21Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to allow for consistency between growth and treatment conditions. Sterile seeds were grown in full-strength Murashige and Skoog basal medium with Gamborg's vitamins supplied with 2% (w/v) sucrose for ∼2 weeks. Ethylene biosynthesis was induced in liquid culture seedlings by the addition of the biosynthetic precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) at 1 mm for 24 h. Growth in the light increases ACC oxidase activity (22Lee J.H. Deng X.W. Kim W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and therefore the levels of ethylene capable of being produced by the addition of ACC. The proteasome inhibitors and brefeldin A were added directly to the liquid growth medium at the times and concentrations indicated. Preparation of the ETR2 Antibody—Fusion proteins were made of ETR2 with either a His6 tag (ETR2-His6) or a GST tag (ETR2-GST). A portion of the ETR2 gene (17Sakai H. Hua J. Chen Q.G. Chang C.

A. 1998; 95: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) representing amino acids 390–570 was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer containing a BamHI site (GGATCCTCGATGATTCAGGACGAGA) and a 3′ primer containing a XhoI site (CTCGAGTTGTCCTAACCCATAGCC). The PCR product was cloned into the vector pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to make ETR2-His6 and into the vector pGEX-KG (23Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) to make ETR2-GST. The ETR2-His6 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and inclusion bodies were isolated according to the manufacturer by solubilizing with 6 m urea and affinity-purifying on His-Bind resin (Novagen). The ETR2-GST protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum was prepared from the ETR2-His6 recombinant protein by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The anti-ETR2 antibodies were affinity-purified with glutathione-agarose columns cross-linked with ETR2-GST (25Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and the pH was neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Membrane Fractionation and Immunoblot Analysis—Microsomal and soluble fractions were isolated from dark-grown seedlings or plants grown in liquid culture using a homogenization buffer containing 30 mm Tris (pH 8.2 at 22 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors as described (9Chen Y.F.

The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6 at 22 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as described (9Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol.

Specific membranes were identified by use of antibodies against the ER markers ETR1 and ACA2 (9Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol.

Thylakoid membranes were identified by spectrophotometric analysis of chlorophyll levels (21Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunodecorated proteins were visualized and quantified as described (26Zhao X.C. Qu X. Mathews D.E. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assay for ETR2 Degradation—Microsomes from seedlings grown in liquid culture were isolated using an homogenization buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.6 at 22 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and resuspended at 10 mg/ml in the same buffer but with 10% (v/v) glycerol. In vitro assays were performed in 50 μl of resuspension buffer, containing 25 μg of microsomal protein, 5 mm ATP, and inhibitors as indicated. Following 1 h of incubation at 22 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from etiolated seedlings by using the RNeasy plant kit followed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). RNA (1 μg) pooled from three biological replicates was used as template for firststrand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using a mix containing 10 μlof2× SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan), 0.8 μl of forward and reverse primer mix (0.2 μm final concentration), 0.4 μlof50× ROX Reference Dye II, 5 μl of cDNA, and 3.8 μl of deionized water. PCR was run on an ABI 7500 fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using a 10-min initial denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C (15 s) and 56 °C (1 min). Three experimental replicates of each reaction were performed using primer pairs specific for ETR2 (At3g23150) (5′-tggcgtttactgttttcaagatgttg-3′ and 5′-agagaaactcgggtgcgatgt-3′) and β-tubulin (At5g62700) (5′-cgtaagcttgctgtgaatctcatc-3′ and 5′-agaggttgacgagcaagatga-3′). Average Ct values were generated and analyzed by SDS software, version 1.4, which uses the comparative cycle threshold method (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). -Fold change compared with the untreated wild-type control was calculated after normalization to theβ-tubulin Ct values. All primer sets generated a single distinct peak during melting curve analysis. Biochemical Characterization of ETR2—Previous analysis has centered on ETR1, a member of subfamily I that appears to be constitutively expressed based on prior analysis of RNA and protein levels. ETR2 is a member of subfamily II and, based on Northern blot analysis, is induced at the transcriptional level by ethylene (15Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To study ETR2 at the protein level, we raised and affinity-purified a polyclonal antibody against ETR2. The anti-ETR2 antibody was used to probe membranes from wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis that had been treated with either air or ethylene (1 μl/liter for 24 h) (Fig. 1). The anti-ETR2 antibody recognizes a protein of 83 kDa in the membrane fraction of Arabidopsis, consistent with the calculated molecular mass of 86 kDa for ETR2. The ETR2 receptor is induced by ethylene in wild type and absent in the loss-of-function etr2-3 mutant. Ethylene induction of ETR2 is not affected by a loss-of-function mutant in another ethylene receptor (etr1-7). The ability of ethylene to induce ETR2 is curtailed in the ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-1, etr2-1, and ein2. In contrast, ETR2 is present without ethylene treatment in the constitutive ethylene response mutant ctr1-2. These data indicate that protein levels of the ethylene receptor ETR2 are tightly controlled by ethylene in plants and are consistent with transcriptional regulation previously reported (15Hua J. Sakai H. Nourizadeh S. Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Ecker J.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For comparison, protein levels of the subfamily-1 ethylene receptor ETR1 are shown, a receptor whose expression is not induced by ethylene. As previously found, the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 is present at increased levels relative to wild-type ETR1 (26Zhao X.C. Qu X. Mathews D.E. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We previously found that the ethylene receptor ETR1 is localized to the ER membrane (9Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To determine whether ETR2 is localized to the ER, we fractionated Arabidopsis membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2). For this purpose, we used the ctr1-2 mutant line in which ETR2 is constitutively expressed (Fig. 2A) as well as wild-type plants in which ETR2 was induced by treatment with the ethylene precursor ACC (Fig. 2B). ER vesicles migrate to different densities dependent on whether they are associated with ribosomes or not. Ribosomes can be stripped from the ER by removal of Mg2+ from the medium, resulting in a diagnostic shift of the ER from higher to lower density (32Lord J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting for ETR2 as well as for the membrane markers ETR1 and ACA2 (ER), H+-ATPase (PM), VM23 (vacuole), pM021 (mitochondrial inner membrane), and α-mannosidase (Golgi). Chlorophyll absorbance was used as a marker for the chloroplast thylakoid membranes. ETR2 showed a density shift similar to ETR1 and distinct from the other membrane markers examined, consistent with localization of ETR2 to the ER. Ethylene Regulates Turnover of ETR2—An ethylene dose response analysis of ETR2 protein in the wild-type background indicated that ETR2 is induced at low ethylene concentrations in a manner consistent with an increase in transcript levels (Fig. 3). But at ethylene concentrations above 1 μl/liter, the levels of ETR2 protein decreased in a manner independent of the message levels, which remained essentially unchanged. In addition, a time course revealed that dynamic changes in ETR2 expression occur in response to treatment with 100 μl/liter ethylene that cannot be explained by transcriptional changes (Fig. 3). Ethylene treatment resulted in an initial increase in ETR2 levels consistent with increased levels of mRNA expression. This was then followed by a rapid decrease in ETR2 protein levels that was independent of the mRNA expression levels. Both the dose-response and time course studies are thus consistent with post-transcriptional regulation of ETR2 expression. Under the same conditions, only a modest effect was noted on ETR1 expression at the protein and mRNA levels (data not shown). To separate out transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects upon expression, we examined the effects of ethylene upon expression of ETR2 in the ctr1-2 mutant background. This mutation results in constitutive activation of ethylene responses in the plant (19Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar), including constitutive expression of ETR2 (Fig. 1). Thus, one is able to examine changes in ETR2 expression that operate post-transcriptionally, without interfering changes in transcript levels of the gene. Ethylene dose-response analysis showed a reduction in ETR2 protein levels with increased levels of ethylene; a reduction was observed at ethylene concentrations of 0.1 μl/liter and is clearly apparent above 1 μl/liter (Fig. 3). In contrast, no significant differences in RNA levels were noted for the receptors, as predicted when using the ctr1 mutant background. Thus, the ethylene-induced decrease in ETR2 levels occurs post-transcriptionally. A time course analysis indicated that the ethylene effect upon ETR2 expression can be observed within 1 h of ethylene treatment (Fig. 3). Ethylene Perception by the Receptors Initiates Ligand-induced Turnover of ETR2—We used both chemical and genetic approaches to confirm that the ligand-induced turnover of ETR2 results from ethylene perception by the receptors. Silver replaces a copper cofactor required by the receptors for binding ethylene, resulting in ethylene insensitivity (11Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Hall A.E. Binder B.M. Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1999; 283: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The etr2-1 and the etr1-1 mutants are both missense mutations within the predicted ethylene-binding regions of the receptors that result in dominant ethylene insensitivity (17Sakai H. Hua J. Chen Q.G. Chang C. Medrano L.J. Bleecker A.B. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 33Chang C. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Treatment of ctr1 plants with silver or introduction of either the etr2-1 or the etr1-1 mutations into the ctr1 background abolished ethylene-induced turnover of ETR2 protein (Fig. 4). Thus, ethylene perception by the receptors initiates the ethylene-induced decrease in ETR2 protein levels. These data also indicate that even at the highest ethylene level tested (1000 μl/liter) that this is not a generic effect of ethylene upon protein expression but arises due to interaction between ethylene and the receptors. Furthermore, these data indicate that the turnover of one member of the receptor family can be modulated by the ability of another member of the family to perceive ethylene, a situation reminiscent of the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr2-1 requiring the presence of ETR1 for full effect (34Cancel J.D. Larsen P.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ethylene Induces Proteasome-dependent Degradation of ETR2—Post-transcriptional effects upon receptor levels could be due to regulation of translational rate and/or regulation of protein degradation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the effects of the protein biosynthetic inhibitor cycloheximide as well as proteasome inhibitors upon the ligand-induced decrease in ETR2 levels. Cycloheximide treatment allowed for the examination of turnover in the absence of translation, the prediction being that if the effect of ethylene was solely upon the translation rate then we should no longer observe an effect of ethylene upon ETR2 levels. We still observed the ethylene-induced decrease in ETR2 protein levels following in vivo treatment of seedlings with cycloheximide, indicating that the effect of ethylene was post-translational (Fig. 5A) (9Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Findell J.L. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19861-19866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Consistent with a post-translational effect, we found that in vivo treatment of seedlings with two proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and ALLN (35Shen Y. Feng S. Ma L. Lin R. Qu L.J. Chen Z. Wang H. Deng X.W. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), inhibited the ability of ethylene to down-regulate levels of ETR2 (Fig. 5B). These data support a model in which ETR2 is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway in response to ethylene binding. Two lines of evidence suggest that degradation of ETR2 takes place at its subcellular location on the ER membrane. First, we found that ETR2 could be degraded in vitro in isolated microsomes (Fig. 5C). This degradation is sensitive to ALLN (Fig. 5C) and MG132 (not shown), thereby implicating the proteasome and suggesting that ETR2 degradation may occur due to proteasomes associated with the ER membrane. Additional evidence that degradation occurs at the ER was obtained by in vivo treatment of ctr1-2 seedlings with the vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (36Geldner N. Friml J. Stierhof Y.D. Jurgens G. Palme K. Nature. 2001; 413: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced degradation of ETR2 was still observed following treatment with brefeldin A (Fig. 5D), suggesting that this process does not require export of ETR2 from the ER to other destinations of the secretory pathway, such as the PM or vacuole. Recent data indicate that protein degradation plays a major role in the regulation of ethylene production and signal transduction. Levels of ACC synthase, an enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis, are regulated by protein degradation (37Wang K.L. Yoshida H. Lurin C. Ecker J.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Levels of EIN3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, are also regulated by protein degradation, EIN3 levels increasing in the presence of ethylene (38Potuschak T. Lechner E. Parmentier Y. Yanagisawa S. Grava S. Koncz C. Genschik P. Cell. 2003; 115: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 39Guo H. Ecker J.R. Cell. 2003; 115: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 40Yanagisawa S. Yoo S.D. Sheen J. Nature. 2003; 425: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 41Gagne J.M. Smalle J. Gingerich D.J. Walker J.M. Yoo S.D. Yanagisawa S. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 17: 6803-6808Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In both cases, a proteasome-dependent pathway has been implicated in regulating the protein levels. Our results demonstrate that levels of the ethylene receptor ETR2 are also regulated by protein degradation, but in this case, unlike EIN3, ethylene induces degradation of the receptor. The post-transcriptional effect of ethylene on ETR2 levels is apparent at ethylene concentrations above 1 μl/liter, an ethylene concentration of physiological relevance, since ethylene responses occur from 0.2 nl/liter to 1000 μl/liter (4Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992Google Scholar, 5Binder B.M. Mortimore L.A. Stepanova A.N. Ecker J.R. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings show a developmental response to ethylene initiated at less than 0.1 μl/liter, transcriptional changes have been shown to occur in Arabidopsis over a wide range of ethylene concentrations from 0.1 to 1000 μl/liter (6Chen Q.G. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fruit ripening involves ethylene production that exceeds 100 μl/liter (4Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992Google Scholar), an ethylene concentration likely to result in substantial deceases in the levels of ligand-bound receptors if similar mechanisms occur across plant species. We only detected a decrease in ETR2 levels in wild type at ethylene concentrations above 1 μl/liter, but turnover may still occur at lower ethylene concentrations but not be as readily detected by our methods of analysis. For example, at the lower ethylene concentrations, turnover of ETR2 may be masked due to the smaller number of receptors turning over and/or offsetting effects of ethylene upon transcription and translation of ETR2. Our analysis of ETR2 in the ctr1 background suggests that turnover may occur at 0.1 μl/liter ethylene. Ligand-induced degradation could conceivably occur by either direct or indirect mechanisms. In a direct mechanism, the physical act of ethylene binding would induce a change in the receptor that causes the receptor to become susceptible to degradation. In an indirect mechanism, ethylene binding would activate the signal transduction pathway to induce downstream ethylene responses, one possible response being the induction of a factor that would cause receptor turnover. Our data support the first model, with the physical association of ethylene with ETR2 being part of the process by which degradation of the receptor is initiated, potentially by inducing a conformational change in the receptor. This is based on our analysis of the ctr1-2 mutant, which is capable of inducing ethylene responses in the absence of bound ligand. Degradation of ETR2 did not occur in the ctr1-2 background except when seedlings were treated with ethylene. Furthermore, degradation of ETR2 in the ctr1-2 background could be abolished by inhibiting ethylene perception through either chemical (silver) or genetic (ethylene-insensitive receptor mutations) methods. These methods lock the receptor into the conformation that it normally has in the absence of ethylene, such that ethylene can no longer induce a conformational change in the protein (7Chang C. Stadler R. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Schaller G.E. Kieber J.J. Somerville C. Meyerowitz E. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002Google Scholar). Thus, ethylene-induced changes in conformation/activity of the receptor may be critical for initiating degradation. Ligand-induced degradation of ethylene receptors is likely to play a significant role in the removal of receptor-ligand complexes, as has been found on binding of ligands to animal growth factor receptors (1Wiley H.S. Bittar E.E. Fundamentals of Medical Cell Biology. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1992Google Scholar, 2Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 3Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). All five ethylene receptors bind ethylene tightly, the half-life for dissociation of ethylene from ETR2 being 10 h based on its analysis in transgenic yeast (10Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 42O'Malley R.C. Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Binder B.M. O'Donnell P. Klee H.J. Bleecker A.B. Plant J. 2005; 41: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, without ligand-induced degradation, the plant could accumulate receptors with bound ethylene that are unable to sense changes in the ethylene concentration. These receptor-ligand complexes can be considered as largely “inactive” based on the current model for ethylene signaling. According to this model, upon binding ethylene, the receptors inactivate the Raf-like kinase CTR1 (43Huang Y. Li H. Hutchison C.E. Laskey J. Kieber J.J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 44Gao Z. Chen Y.F. Randlett M.D. Zhao X.C. Findell J.L. Kieber J.J. Schaller G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34725-34732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 45Clark K.L. Larsen P.B. Wang X. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5401-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because CTR1 functions as a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, its inactivation relieves repression of the pathway so that ethylene responses are induced. A receptor with bound ethylene is unable to stimulate CTR1 activity and thus no longer actively participates in the CTR1-dependent signaling pathway. Degradation of the ligand-receptor complex allows for its replacement by new unbound receptors that can stimulate CTR1 activity, thereby resensitizing the plant to ethylene. The decrease in ethylene receptor levels resulting from ligand-induced turnover may also have other consequences for the propagation of the ethylene signal. Because of the negative regulation in the ethylene pathway described above, a decrease in overall ethylene receptor levels can result in increased sensitization of plants to ethylene, such that a lower concentration of ethylene is necessary for stimulating a response (34Cancel J.D. Larsen P.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 46Tieman D.M. Taylor M.G. Ciardi J.A. Klee H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5663-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Indeed, if sufficient numbers of ethylene receptors are removed, the induction of ethylene responses can occur in the absence of ethylene (20Hua J. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the removal of a specific subtype of receptors may serve to modulate different downstream responses. A precedent for such a possibility comes from, first, the differing roles for subfamily I and II receptors in signaling (47Wang W. Hall A.E. O'Malley R. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and, second, the specific role for hybrid receptors (those with receiver domains) in seedling growth recovery after ethylene removal (48Binder B.M. O'Malley R.C. Wang W. Moore J.M. Parks B.M. Spalding E.P. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Degradation of ethylene receptors would result in release of the bound ethylene, so one would predict that the dissociation kinetics for ethylene from Arabidopsis would incorporate a more rapid ethylene dissociation component than the slow release kinetics observed when ethylene receptors are transgenically expressed in yeast (10Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 42O'Malley R.C. Rodriguez F.I. Esch J.J. Binder B.M. O'Donnell P. Klee H.J. Bleecker A.B. Plant J. 2005; 41: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Examination of the ethylene release kinetics in plants supports this hypothesis (49Sanders I.O. Harpham N.V.J. Raskin I. Smith A.R. Hall M.A. Ann. Botany. 1991; 68: 97-103Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Sisler E.C. Mattoo A.K. Suttle J.C. The Plant Hormone Ethylene. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). Both rapid (half-life of less than 30 min) and slow release kinetics (half-life of 12 h or more) for ethylene have been found in Arabidopsis as well as in other plants (49Sanders I.O. Harpham N.V.J. Raskin I. Smith A.R. Hall M.A. Ann. Botany. 1991; 68: 97-103Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Sisler E.C. Mattoo A.K. Suttle J.C. The Plant Hormone Ethylene. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). These differences in the release kinetics may relate to differences in the rate of turnover particular to individual subtypes of the ethylene receptor family. For example, based on their differing sensitivities to ligand-induced turnover, we would predict that the rapid release kinetics for ethylene found in Arabidopsis could be due to degradation of ETR2, whereas the slow release kinetics could be due to degradation of ETR1. Our results show that ETR2 is subject to ligand-mediated degradation like the animal growth factor receptors but with significant mechanistic differences. Ligand-mediated degradation of animal growth factor receptors typically involves endocytosis of the ligand-bound receptor and subsequent targeting to the lysosome (2Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 3Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This targeting step is apparently regulated by monoubiquitination of the receptor, which serves as a sorting signal for the lysosome. Degradation of ETR2, in contrast to the paradigm established for animal growth factor receptors, is mediated by the proteasome, a situation potentially arising due to localization of ETR2 to the ER rather than to the plasma membrane (i.e. the ethylene receptors do not have the correct subcellular localization for endocytosis). Degradation of ETR2 does not require export of ETR2 to other destinations in the secretory pathway, and thus ER-associated degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system is likely to mediate ETR2 degradation. ER-associated degradation is primarily known for its role in the degradation of misfolded soluble and membrane proteins of the secretory system (51Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), but it has also been found to regulate turnover of enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, which, like ETR2, is an integral membrane protein of the ER (51Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). We thus propose that ethylene binding to its receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum results in a conformational change, exposing sites for polyubiquitination on the cytosolic soluble domain of ETR2, followed by degradation at the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2040750799,"The prevalence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obese youth is rapidly increasing, especially in Hispanics and African Americans compared to Caucasians. Insulin resistance is known to be associated with increases in intramyocellular (IMCL) and hepatic fat content. We determined if there are ethnic differences in IMCL and hepatic fat content in a multiethnic cohort of 55 obese adolescents. We used 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify IMCL levels in the soleus muscle, oral glucose tolerance testing to estimate insulin sensitivity, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure abdominal fat distribution. Liver fat content was measured by fast–MRI. Despite similar age and % total body fat among the groups, IMCL was significantly higher in the Hispanics (1.71% [1.43%, 2.0%]) than in the African-Americans (1.04% [0.75%, 1.34%], p = 0.013) and the Caucasians (1.2% [0.94%, 1.5%], p = 0.04). Liver fat content was undetectable in the African Americans whereas it was two fold higher than normal in both Caucasians and Hispanics. Visceral fat was significantly lower in African Americans (41.5 cm2 [34.6, 49.6]) and was similar in Caucasians (65.2 cm2 [55.9, 76.0]) and Hispanics (70.5 cm2 [59.9, 83.1]). In a multiple regression analysis, we found that ethnicity independent of age, gender and % body fat accounts for 10% of the difference in IMCL. Our study indicates that obese Hispanic adolescents have a greater IMCL lipid content than both Caucasians and African Americans, of comparable weight, age and gender. Excessive accumulation of fat in the liver was found in both Caucasian and Hispanic groups as opposed to virtually undetectable levels in the African Americans. Thus, irrespective of obesity, there seem to be some clear ethnic differences in the amount of lipid accumulated in skeletal muscle, liver and abdominal cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2157563771,"Background The secretory pathway is a critical index of the capacity of cells to incorporate proteins into cellular membranes and secrete proteins into the extracellular space. Importantly it is disrupted in response to stress to the endoplasmic reticulum that can be induced by a variety of factors, including expression of mutant proteins and physiologic stress. Activation of the ER stress response is critical in the etiology of a number of diseases, such as diabetes and neurodegeneration, as well as cancer. We have developed a highly sensitive assay to monitor processing of proteins through the secretory pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in real-time based on the naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). Methodology/Principle Findings An expression cassette for Gluc was delivered to cells, and its secretion was monitored by measuring luciferase activity in the conditioned medium. Gluc secretion was decreased down to 90% when these cells were treated with drugs that interfere with the secretory pathway at different steps. Fusing Gluc to a fluorescent protein allowed quantitation and visualization of the secretory pathway in real-time. Expression of this reporter protein did not itself elicit an ER stress response in cells; however, Gluc proved very sensitive at sensing this type of stress, which is associated with a temporary decrease in processing of proteins through the secretory pathway. The Gluc secretion assay was over 20,000-fold more sensitive as compared to the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), a well established assay for monitoring of protein processing and ER stress in mammalian cells. Conclusions/Significance The Gluc assay provides a fast, quantitative and sensitive technique to monitor the secretory pathway and ER stress and its compatibility with high throughput screening will allow discovery of drugs for treatment of conditions in which the ER stress is generally induced."
https://openalex.org/W1972236015,"Background Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) use highly sulfated polysaccharide side-chains to interact with several key growth factors and morphogens, thereby regulating their accessibility and biological activity. Various sulfotransferases and sulfatases with differing specificities control the pattern of HSPG sulfation, which is functionally critical. Among these enzymes in the mouse are two secreted 6-O-endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2, which modify HSPGs in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface. The roles of Sulf1 and Sulf2 during normal development are not well understood. Methods/Results To investigate the importance of Sulf1 and Sulf2 for embryonic development, we generated mice genetically deficient in these genes and assessed the phenotypes of the resulting secreted sulfatase-deficient mice. Surprisingly, despite the established crucial role of HSPG interactions during development, neither Sulf1- nor Sulf2-deficient mice showed significant developmental flaws. In contrast, mice deficient in both Sulf1and Sulf2 exhibited highly penetrant neonatal lethality. Loss of viability was associated with multiple, although subtle, developmental defects, including skeletal and renal abnormalities. Conclusions These results show that Sulf1 and Sulf2 play overlapping yet critical roles in mouse development and are redundant and essential for neonatal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2076188917,"Activated T cells rapidly assemble filamentous (F-) actin networks in response to ligation of the T cell receptor or upon interaction with adhesive stimuli in order to facilitate cell migration and the formation of the immune synapse. Branched filament assembly is crucial for this process and is dependent upon activation of the Arp2/3 complex by the actin nucleation-promoting factor Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp). Genetic disruption of the <i>WAS</i> gene has been linked to hematopoietic malignancies and various cytopenias. Although the contributions of WASp and Arp2/3 to T cell responses are fairly well characterized, the role of the mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formins, which both nucleate and processively elongate non-branched F-actin, has not been demonstrated. Here, we report the effects on T cell development and function following the knock out of the murine <i>Drf1</i> gene encoding the canonical formin p140mDia1. <i>Drf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice develop lymphopenia characterized by diminished T cell populations in lymphoid tissues. Consistent with a role for p140mDia1 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, isolated <i>Drf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> splenic T cells adhered poorly to extracellular matrix proteins and migration in response to chemotactic stimuli was completely abrogated. Both integrin and chemokine receptor expression was unaffected by <i>Drf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> targeting. In response to proliferative stimuli, both thymic and splenic <i>Drf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells failed to proliferate; ERK1/2 activation was also diminished in activated <i>Drf1<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells. These data suggest a central role for p140mDia1 <i>in vivo</i> in dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling events driving normal T cell responses."

https://openalex.org/W2025334711,"The efflux pump ATP binding cassette superfamily member G2 (ABCG2)/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is highly expressed in human placenta. We have investigated the role of BCRP in the protection of the human placental trophoblasts from apoptosis and its expression in idiopathic fetal growth restriction, a condition associated with abnormal placental apoptosis. Inhibition of BCRP activity with the selective inhibitor Ko143 augmented cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interferon-gamma)-induced apoptosis and phosphatidylserine externalization in primary trophoblast and trophoblast-like BeWo cells. Silencing of BCRP expression in BeWo cells significantly increased their sensitivity to apoptotic injury in response to cytokines and exogenous C6 and C8 ceramides. BCRP silencing also increased intracellular ceramide levels after cytokine exposure but did not affect cellular protoporphyrin IX concentrations or sensitivity to activators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. BCRP expression in placentas from pregnancies complicated by idiopathic fetal growth restriction was decreased compared with controls, suggesting reduced transport of its substrates from the placenta. We conclude that BCRP may play a hitherto unrecognized survival role in the placenta, protecting the trophoblast against cytokine-induced apoptosis and possibly other extrinsic activators via modulation of ceramide signaling. Decreased placental BCRP expression may result in reduced viability and hence functional deficit, contributing to the fetal growth restriction phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2035135291,"Many emerging RNA viruses of public health concern have recently been detected in bats. However, the dynamics of these viruses in natural bat colonies is presently unknown. Consequently, prediction of the spread of these viruses and the establishment of appropriate control measures are hindered by a lack of information. To this aim, we collected epidemiological, virological and ecological data during a twelve-year longitudinal study in two colonies of insectivorous bats (Myotis myotis) located in Spain and infected by the most common bat lyssavirus found in Europe, the European bat lyssavirus subtype 1 (EBLV-1). This active survey demonstrates that cyclic lyssavirus infections occurred with periodic oscillations in the number of susceptible, immune and infected bats. Persistence of immunity for more than one year was detected in some individuals. These data were further used to feed models to analyze the temporal dynamics of EBLV-1 and the survival rate of bats. According to these models, the infection is characterized by a predicted low basic reproductive rate (R0 = 1.706) and a short infectious period (D = 5.1 days). In contrast to observations in most non-flying animals infected with rabies, the survival model shows no variation in mortality after EBLV-1 infection of M. myotis. These findings have considerable public health implications in terms of management of colonies where lyssavirus-positive bats have been recorded and confirm the potential risk of rabies transmission to humans. A greater understanding of the dynamics of lyssavirus in bat colonies also provides a model to study how bats contribute to the maintenance and transmission of other viruses of public health concern."
https://openalex.org/W2043466478,"Using C6-NBD-glucosylceramide (GlcCer) as a substrate, we detected the activity of a conduritol B epoxide-insensitive neutral glycosylceramidase in cytosolic fractions of zebrafish embryos, mouse and rat brains, and human fibroblasts. The candidates for the enzyme were assigned to the Klotho (KL), whose family members share a β-glucosidase-like domain but whose natural substrates are unknown. Among this family, only the KL-related protein (KLrP) is capable of degrading C6-NBD-GlcCer when expressed in CHOP cells, in which Myc-tagged KLrP was exclusively distributed in the cytosol. In addition, knockdown of the endogenous KLrP by small interfering RNA increased the cellular level of GlcCer. The purified recombinant KLrP hydrolyzed 4-methylumbelliferyl-glucose, C6-NBD-GlcCer, and authentic GlcCer at pH 6.0. The enzyme also hydrolyzed the corresponding galactosyl derivatives, but each kcat/Km was much lower than that for glucosyl derivatives. The x-ray structure of KLrP at 1.6Å resolution revealed that KLrP is a (β/α)8 TIM barrel, in which Glu165 and Glu373 at the carboxyl termini of β-strands 4 and 7 could function as an acid/base catalyst and nucleophile, respectively. The substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme was occupied with palmitic acid and oleic acid when the recombinant protein was crystallized in a complex with glucose. GlcCer was found to fit well the cleft of the crystal structure of KLrP. Collectively, KLrP was identified as a cytosolic neutral glycosylceramidase that could be involved in a novel nonlysosomal catabolic pathway of GlcCer.

Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcCer, glucosylceramide; Cer, ceramide; CBE, conduritol B epoxide; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GBA, β-glucosidase; GC, gas-liquid chromatography; GCase, glycosylceramidase; GH, glycohydrolase; GSL, glycosphingolipid; KL, Klotho; KLrP, Klotho-related protein; LacCer, lactosylceramide; LPH, lactase phlorizin hydrolase; NBD, 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; 4MU, 4-methylumbelliferyl; GlcSph, glucosylsphingosine; GalSph, galactosylsphingosine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is a precursor for ganglio-, lacto/neolacto-, and globo/isoglobo-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs). The synthesis of GlcCer is catalyzed by GlcCer synthase-1, mainly located on the cytosolic face of the Golgi apparatus (1Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2Ichikawa, S., and Hirabayashi, Y. (1998) Trends Cell Biol. 8, 198-202Google Scholar). The GlcCer generated is then translocated to the luminal surface of the Golgi membrane by an unknown mechanism, where it is converted to lactosylceramide (LacCer) by LacCer synthase. This is followed by a step-by-step extension of sugar chains by corresponding glycosyltransferases to generate complex GSLs. Finally, the GSLs are transported through the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, where the sugar moiety faces the extracellular space, and the Cer moiety is embedded in the upper layer of the membrane. Catabolism of GlcCer primarily takes place in the lysosomes where acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase, GBA1; EC 3.2.1.45) cleaves the β-glucosyl linkage between Cer and glucose with the assistance of a noncatalytic protein, saposin C, and negatively charged lipids (3O'Brien, J. S., and Kishimoto, Y. (1991) FASEB J. 5, 301-308Google Scholar, 4Kolter, T., and Sandhoff, K. (2005) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 21, 81-1035Google Scholar). The enzyme is specifically and irreversibly inhibited by conduritol B epoxide (CBE). An inherited deficiency of the enzyme causes Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, in which GlcCer is accumulated in lysosomes of laden tissue macrophages. However, the accumulation of GlcCer in other cell types is not obvious in patients with Gaucher disease despite the significant decrease of GBA1 activity, and thus the existence of an alternative catabolic pathway for GlcCer was speculated (5Barranger, J. A., and Ginns, E. I. (1989) in The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease, Vol. II (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, W.

Among the β-glucosidases reported, lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH, EC 3.2.1.62/108) was shown to hydrolyze GlcCer (7Kobayashi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7768-7773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme, sensitive to CBE, is exclusively present in the microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells and possibly functions as a kind of digestive enzyme. Very recently, two research groups reported an alternative pathway (8Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M.O. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin.

Boermans H. Lottspeich F. Matern S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37929-37933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme, relatively nonsensitive to CBE, seems to be a membrane-bound enzyme of the ER (8Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M.O. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or located at or close to the cell surface (9Boot R.G. Vierhoek M. Donker-Koopman W.

Unexpectedly, GBA2 knock-out mice exhibited a normal metabolism of bile acid. Alternatively, GlcCer was found to be accumulated in the testes, brain, and liver, causing male infertility possibly because of abnormal sperm (8Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C.

GBA2 was likely to be the same enzyme that was previously described as a nonlysosomal CBE-insensitive glucosylceramidase (11van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which was extremely sensitive to inhibition by hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues (12Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H.

During the course of the development of a sensitive assay for glycosyltransferases using fluorescent substrates and HPLC (13Hayashi Y. Horibata Y. Sakaguchi K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), activity for the hydrolysis of C6-NBD-GlcCer was detected in zebrafish embryos, mouse and rat brains, and human fibroblasts in the presence of CBE at neutral pH. The CBE-insensitive activity of rat brains was present in not only membrane-bound fractions (possibly GBA2) but also cytosolic fractions (this study). Using a bioinformative approach, the Klotho (KL) family emerged as a candidate for the novel GlcCer-degrading enzyme because they share a β-glucosidase-like domain, although their natural substrates remain unknown. It has been reported that mutation of the KL gene in mice leads to a syndrome resembling aging, and thus KL seems to be involved in the suppression of aging (14Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H.

A kinetic analysis uncovered that KLrP hydrolyzed C6-NBD-GlcCer and 4MU-Glc as well as C6-NBD-GalCer and 4MU-GalCer, although the kcat/Km for the former was relatively higher than that for the latter. This result indicated that KLrP should be defined as a “β-glycosylceramidase” (GCase) rather than a “β-glucosylceramidase” or “β-glucocerebrosidase.” We report here that KLrP is a novel cytosolic neutral GCase and present the results of kinetic, cellular, and x-ray crystal analyses of the enzyme. This is the first report describing the crystal structure of KLrP. Materials—Human primary fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. K. Ohno (Tottori University, Tottori, Japan). CHOP cells (Chinese hamster ovary-derived cells expressing polyoma LT antigen) were donated by Dr. J. W. Dennis (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mt.

Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody, C6-NBD-GlcCer, C6-NBD-GalCer, and C6-NBD-LacCer were obtained from Sigma. The anti-Myc antibody and C6-NBD-Cer were purchased from Invitrogen. Precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were purchased from Merck. [14C]GlcCer and [14C]GalCer, labeled at C1 of stearic acid, were synthesized as described (18Mitsutake S. Kita K. Nakagawa T. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Cloning of cDNA Encoding Proteins of the KL Family—The complete open reading frames for KL (NM_013823.1), KLβ (NM_031180.2), KL lactase phlorizin hydrolase (NM_145835.1), and KLrP (GBA3, NM_020973.2) were amplified from a cDNA library derived from human embryonic kidney-derived HEK293 cells and mouse liver using specific primers containing restriction sites and an extended Kozak sequence in front of the start codon. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) (Invitrogen) or pET23b(+) (Novagen). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHOP cells were grown at 37 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 60 μg/ml kanamycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. cDNA transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine™ Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assay of Neutral GCase Activity in Vitro—An aliquot of 100 pmol of C6-NBD-GlcCer or C6-NBD-GalCer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 20 μl of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.25% sodium cholate in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm CBE. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). The reaction mixture was then dried using a SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). The TLC plate was scanned with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation 470 nm, emission 530 nm). Alternatively, 100 pmol of [14C]GlcCer was used for the assay instead of the fluorescent substrates. After incubation at 37 °C for the periods indicated, reaction mixture was applied onto a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). [14C]Cer released and [14C]GlcCer unhydrolyzed on the TLC were quantified with FLA5000. Determination of Substrate Specificity of KLrP—Twenty nmol of various substrates (GlcCer, GalCer, α-GalCer, GlcSph, GalSph, sulfatides, LacCer, and GM1a) were incubated with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 20 μl of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1% sodium cholate. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). The reaction mixture was then dried using a SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.02% CaCl2 (6.5:4:1, v/v/v) except in experiments using GM1a and sulfatide as a substrate. For these substrates, chloroform, methanol, 0.02% CaCl2 (2:3:1, v/v/v) was used as a developing solvent. GSLs and sugars were visualized by spraying TLC plates with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent and scanning them with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm. Assay of Lactate Dehydrogenase Activity—An aliquot of 1 μmol of sodium pyruvate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an appropriate amount of enzyme in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm NADH. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then examined with an Ultraspec 3000 (Amersham Biosciences) with absorbance at 340 nm. Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells transfected with the cDNA were cultured on a coverglass and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After being rinsed with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After treatment with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBS) for 15 min, the samples were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (diluted 2000 times with blocking buffer) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were observed with a confocal laserscanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1; Nikon). Catabolism of Fluorescent GlcCer in Vivo—CHOP cells (0.5 × 105) were seeded in a 12-well microplate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to allow them to attach to the plate. Then cells were transformed with expression vector pcDNA3.1 containing KLrP (KLrP overexpressor) or empty vector (mock transfectant) and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in α-minimal essential medium containing 1 nmol of C6-NBD-GlcCer. After the incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min) and washed three times with PBS. Total lipids were extracted with 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol/hexane/water (55:35: 10, v/v/v) for 10 min with sonication. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the upper layer was dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and then applied to a TLC plate that was developed with chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). Fluorescent lipids on the TLC plate were visualized under a UV illuminator. RNA Interference—Gene silencing of the KLrP in HEK293 cells was performed using stealth RNA interference (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequence-specific DNA oligonucleotide was designed using the sequence of human KLrP cDNA as described below. Two sets of siRNA corresponding to the sequences of the 332-nucleotide (siRNA-332) GGGTTACTCCCATTGTGACCCTCTA and the 564-nucleotide (siRNA-564) TGGAGGTTATCAGGCAGCTCATAAT, from the initiation codon of KLrP cDNA, were used. BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen), a fluorescence-labeled, double-stranded RNA duplex with the same length, charge, and configuration as standard siRNA, was used as a control siRNA (19Kolachala V.L.

HEK293 cells were transfected with the siRNA using Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Metabolic Labeling and Extraction of GlcCer—HEK293 cells were incubated at 37 °C for the period indicated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum containing 0.2 μCi of [14C]Gal for 9 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min) and washed with PBS. Lipids were extracted with 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol/hexane/water (55:35:10, v/v/v) for 10 min with sonication. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the upper layer was dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and then applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v). Radioactive GlcCer on the TLC plate was detected with an imaging analyzer FLA5000 (Fuji Film). Expression and Purification of Recombinant KLrP—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with pET23b containing the KLrP cDNA and grown at 25 °C for 24 h with shaking in 200 ml of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 10 min) and suspended in extraction solution (0.15 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). After sonication for 1 min, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant obtained was applied to a Hi-Trap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences), which was chelated with Ni2+, and then the column was washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 30 mm imidazole. The enzyme was eluted from the column with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 100 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were pooled and then loaded onto a column of Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a BioCAD sprint system (PE Biosystems). The purified enzyme was dialyzed against deionized water before use. Crystallization of KLrP and Data Collection—The purified recombinant KLrP was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Initial screening for crystallization of KLrP was performed with the hanging drops by vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein (0.5 μl) and reservoir solution (0.5 μl), using crystallization screen kit Crystal Screens (Hampton Research). The best crystal for x-ray diffraction analysis was obtained within 1 week, using 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.2 m magnesium chloride, 27.5% PEG3350, 5% glycerol, 0.5 m glucose or 0.5 m galactose (Crystal Screens, number 85 modified). X-ray diffraction data were collected using the synchrotron radiation source at the BL38B1 station of Spring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). Data were processed using HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The crystal of KLrP in a complex with Glc (KLrP·Glc) diffracted up to 1.6 Å and belongs to the orthorhombic space group P21P21P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 66.04 Å, b = 83.98 Å, and c = 94.89 Å. The crystal of KLrP in a complex with Gal (KLrP/Gal) diffracted up to 1.8 Å and belongs to the orthorhombic space group P21P21P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 66.24 Å, b = 83.80 Å, and c = 93.60 Å.

Open table in a new tab Structural Determination and Model Refinement of KLrP—The crystal structure of KLrP·Glc or that in a complex with Gal (KLrP·Gal) was determined by molecular replacement using an aphid Brevicoryne brassicae myrosinase (Protein Data Bank code 1WCG) as a search model with the program molrep (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). Structure refinement was done using Refmac (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) with diffraction data from 21.4 to 1.6 Å. After the first step of refinement, the atomic model of the protein was rebuilt using the program ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding in Coot (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar) were carried out until the free R-factor converged. The stereochemical checks were carried out using PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GC) of Fatty Acids—Purified recombinant KLrP (3 mg) was freeze-dried and dissolved in 1 ml of 5% HCl-MeOH and then heated at 80 °C for 12 h in a sealed tube. After cooling, the solution was extracted three times with hexanes. The hexane extracts were dried under N2 gas, dissolved in 2 μl of hexane, and then injected into a Shimadzu GC-14 GC (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column (HR-SS-10, 30 m × 0.25 mm; Shinwa Chemical Industries Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The methyl esters detected by GC were identified by conventional methods using the retention time of a PUFA-3 standard mixture (Matrea, Inc.). Detection of Cytosolic Neutral GCase Activity—During the assay of the LacCer synthase activity of human primary fibroblasts using C6-NBD-GlcCer as an acceptor substrate and UDP-Gal as a donor substrate at pH 6.0, C6-NBD-Cer was detected on HPLC in addition to the expected product C6-NBD-LacCer (Fig. 1A). The generation of C6-NBD-Cer, which was prevented by boiling the lysate for 5 min, was significantly decreased but not completely eliminated by the addition of CBE, a potent inhibitor for acid glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the hydrolysis of C6-NBD-GlcCer to C6-NBD-Cer in the presence of CBE was observed when lysates of human fibroblasts, mouse (data not shown) and rat brains, zebrafish embryos, and puffer fish liver, but not slime mold, were used as an enzyme source (Fig. 1B). The neutral GCase activity of human fibroblasts reached a maximum at around pH 5 in the absence of CBE and at pH 6-7 in the presence of CBE (Fig. 1C). The CBE-insensitive GCase activity of rat brain was mainly recovered from the cytosolic fraction (lactate dehydrogenase-rich fraction) rather than the membrane fraction (acid glucocerebrosidase-rich fraction) (Fig. 1D). It is worth noting that a cytosolic protein capable of hydrolyzing GlcCer has yet to be reported. Candidates for a Novel Neutral GCase—We have isolated the gene encoding a neutral GCase from the bacterium Paenibacillus sp. TS12 (27Sumida T. Sueyoshi N. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); however, no homologous sequence has been found in the human gene data base. When CAZy (a data base describing the families of structurally related catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules or functional domains of enzymes that degrade, modify, or create glycosidic bonds) was searched using the key words “beta/glucosidase/human,” several candidate proteins were found in glycohydrolase (GH) family 1, 9, and 30. Notably, proteins assigned to the KL family in GH1 emerged as possible candidates for the neutral GCase, because they share the β-glucosidase-like domain (GH1 domain), although their natural substrates have yet to be clarified. Furthermore, its orthologues were found in data bases of rat, zebrafish, and puffer fish, but not slime mold, consistent with the detection of the activity (Fig. 1B). Thus, we attempted to examine the neutral GCase activity of KL family proteins, including KL (14Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T.

As a result, neutral GCase activity was found to increase in the cell lysates of the overexpressors of KLrP but not other KL family proteins (Fig. 2A), although each protein was expressed at almost the same level in CHOP cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the increase in the neutral GCase activity of KLrP-overexpressing cells was much greater in the pres"

We find the most common phospholipid oxidation product of oxidized low density lipoprotein, phosphatidylcholine with esterified sn-2-azelaic acid, induced apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations. The synthetic ether phospholipid hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine (HAzPC) was rapidly internalized, and overexpression of PLA2g7 (PAF acetylhydrolase) that specifically hydrolyzes such oxidized phospholipids suppressed apoptosis. Internalized HAzPC associated with mitochondria, and cytochrome c, and apoptosis-inducing factor escaped from mitochondria to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, in cells exposed to HAzPC. Isolated mitochondria exposed to HAzPC rapidly swelled and released cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Other phospholipid oxidation products induced swelling, but HAzPC was the most effective and was twice as effective as its diacyl homolog. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c completes the apoptosome, and activated caspase 9 and 3 were present in cells exposed to HAzPC. Irreversible inhibition of caspase 9 blocked downstream caspase 3 activation and prevented apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage initiated this apoptotic cascade, because overexpression of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein localized to mitochondria, blocked cytochrome c escape and apoptosis.

Conversely, inhibition of LDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase with an irreversible inhibitor increases the toxicity of oxidized LDL (11Carpenter K.L. Challis I.R. Arends M.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasma PAF acetylhydrolase hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids with sn-2 fragments up to nine carbon atoms long, including the common azelaoyl fragment, yet, unlike most phospholipases A2 cannot hydrolyze intact, long chain fatty acyl residues (12Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that oxidatively modified phospholipids are abundant cytotoxic agents of oxidized LDL and that neither unmodified phospholipids, the fragmented fatty acids themselves, nor the lysolipid backbone constitute the toxic lipids of oxidized lipoprotein particles. low density lipoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor cyclosporin A carboxyfluorescein-N-benzyloxycabonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin amide 1-hexadecyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine N-benzyloxycabonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone N-benzyloxycabonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylcholine Human umbilical vein endothelial cell 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole platelet-activating factor The majority of the fatty acyl fragments that remain esterified to the phosphatidylcholine backbone after oxidative fragmentation of LDL phospholipids are 9-carbon-long azelaoyl fragments (13Tokumura A. Toujima M. Yoshioka Y. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Azelaic acid, a 9-carbon di-acid, is formed by oxidative fragmentation of the 9,10-double bond (14Frankel E.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 197-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) of the most abundant unsaturated (oleoyl) and polyunsaturated (linoleoyl and linolenoyl) fatty acyl residues of LDL. Accordingly, these azelaoyl phosphatidylcholines (AzPCs) account for almost two-thirds of the oxidized phospholipid in oxidized LDL (13Tokumura A. Toujima M. Yoshioka Y. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, octadecyl-AzPC has long been identified as the cytotoxic oxidation product of oxidant-stressed erythrocytes (15Itabe H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but whether this phospholipid is toxic to nucleated cells is unknown. The identity of specific cytotoxic lipids is not well defined, but their cellular targets are even less apparent. Some phospholipid oxidation products activate the PAF receptor displayed on plasma membranes of inflammatory cells (16Smiley P.L. Stremler K.E. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11104-11110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to promote inflammation, whereas others interact with the scavenger receptor CD36 (17Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R.

A third class of phospholipid oxidation products interact with a phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein (18Walton K.A. Hsieh X. Gharavi N. Wang S. Wang G. Yeh M. Cole A.L. Berliner J.A. J.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cell death following exposure to oxidized phospholipids is also incompletely characterized. Cells may die by necrosis or by a regulated pathway of apoptosis. Mitochondria play a critical role in the intrinsic pathway to apoptotic death where release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm allows it to associate with the structural protein apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to form the apoptosome (20Kim H.E. Du F. Fang M. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17545-17550Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This apoptotic machine proteolytically activates caspase 9, which then cleaves and activates the executioner caspase 3 (20Kim H.E. Du F. Fang M. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17545-17550Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Other proteins released subsequent to the loss of mitochondrial compartmentalization include apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is then free to move to the nucleus to participate in the DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cell death (21Cregan S.P. Dawson V.L. Slack R.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2785-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Oxidant-induced cell death is suppressed by the mitochondria-targeted Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL (22Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that prevents mitochondrial permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic proteins (23Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction subsequent to oxidative stress plays a primary role in atherogenesis (24Madamanchi N.R. Runge M.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Here we used synthetic hexadecyl-AzPC (HAzPC), to understand how this abundant extracellular oxidized phospholipid initiates cell death. We find this lipid is toxic in a receptor-independent way: it is rapidly internalized, damages mitochondria, and initiates the intrinsic apoptotic caspase cascade. Reagents used were as follows: Annexin V-Alexa488 (Invitrogen); z-VAD-fmk, z-LEHD-fmk, and other reagents (Sigma); fluorogenic FAM-z-LEHD-fmk (Biocarta, San Diego, CA); and Ac-DEVD-AMC (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland); protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Indianapolis, IN); HAzPC (1-O-hexadecyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI); lyso-PAF, carbamoyl-PAF, PAF, C4PAF (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), other phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL); Mito-Tracker Red (Invitrogen); anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-AIF, anti-calnexin, and anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-adenine nucleotide translocase, (MitoSciences, Eugene, OR); secondary goat anti-mouse (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA); and VECTASHIELD plus DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). HL60 cells (2 × 106, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected (T-19 program) with 2 μg FLAG-tagged Bcl-XL (a kind gift of Clark W. Distelhorst, Case Western Reserve), FLAG-PLA2g7 or empty vector by nucleofection (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Complete RPMI with 500 μg/ml G418 was substituted 24 h later, and aliquots were transferred to microtiter dishes to isolate FLAG-positive clones. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, ATCC) were cultured in 8 well-chamber slides in F12K medium (ATCC) with 2 mm glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 0.03 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were cultured as described by the supplier. Minced liver from an adult Sprague-Dawley rat in a protocol approved by Cleveland Clinic IACUC was homogenized (0.1 g/ml) in EB buffer (200 mm d-mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EGTA). Homogenates were cleared twice (1000 × g, 5 min) before recovery of the mitochondria (9500 × g, 10 min). This pellet was washed once with an equal volume of bovine serum albumin-free media and then resuspended (35 mg/ml) in medium without bovine serum albumin. HL60 cells (3 × 108) stably transfected with Bcl-XL or its empty vector were washed 2× in phosphate-buffered saline and once in EB media before the cells were suspended in 10 ml of EB medium containing bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), and then mechanically homogenized and mitochondria purified as above. HL-60 cells were preincubated (1 h) with z-LEHD-fmk (20 μm), z-VAD-fmk (50 μm), or Me2SO before incubation (4 h) with 5 μm HAzPC or buffer. The cells were suspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitor mix, and then lysed by freeze/thaw. Caspase 3 activity in cleared supernatants (50 μg) was determined (emission 460 nm; excitation 380 nm) using 200 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC. HL-60 cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 were incubated with buffer or HAzPC for the stated times, or irradiated (1 milliwatt/cm2, IL1700 radiometer, SED240 UVB detector, International Light, Newburyport, MA) for 5 min. Apoptosis—Cells were treated for 6 h, washed, then stained with Annexin V-Alex488 and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide in 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 15 min. Caspase 9 Activation—Cells were treated (4 h) with HAzPC or buffer and then FAM-LEHD-fmk for 1 h before washing and single color flow cytometry. Cytochrome c Release—HL60 cells were incubated with 5 μm HAzPC or buffer, washed, and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose. The cells were homogenized (20×) by expression through a 1-cc, 28.5-gauge syringe, supernatants were cleared (1,000 × g), and organelles were separated from cytoplasm by centrifugation (20,000 × g). Apoptosis-inducing Factor—HUVECs or HepG2 were treated with HAzPC, washed, fixed, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before staining with anti-AIF, Alexa488 anti-mouse, and DAPI. MitoTracker Red—HUVEC medium was changed to a protein-free medium, and the cells were treated or not with 5 μm HAzPC for 30 min at 37 °C before 25 nm MitoTracker Red was added to the medium. After 30 min, the cells were washed thrice and then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline thrice and mounted with medium containing DAPI. Mitochondria were recovered after treatment (9500 × g) and fixed in 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 4% paraformaldehyde (4 °C, 16 h). Samples were washed in this buffer (3×), post-fixed with aqueous osmium tetroxide (1 h, 4 °C), washed in sodium cacodylate buffer and then in maleate buffer (pH 5.16), and then dehydrated with stepwise ethanol solutions from 30% to 100% followed by propylene oxide. Samples were embedded in LX-112 medium, polymerized (68 °C, 48 h), sectioned (70–90 nm), and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. HL60 cells were treated in suspension with 5 μm HAzPC for the stated times and recovered by centrifugation. The cells were washed once with RPMI containing 0.5% human serum albumin and once with RPMI. [2H]PAF was added as an internal standard, and the lipids were extracted (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry (Quattro Ultima, Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK). Lipids in methanol were separated with a Prodigy ODS C18 high-performance liquid chromatography column (150 × 2 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The solvent gradient started at 85% methanol (0.2 ml/min), then a linear gradient to 100% methanol over 5 min was applied and held for 20 min. The mobile phase was linearly changed back to 85% MeOH over 0.5 min and held for 4.5 min. Mobile phase solvents contained 0.2% formic acid. Source temperature was 120 °C, desolvation temperature was 250 °C, N2 flow was 735 liters/h, and the cone N2 flow was 71 liters/h. Argon was used for collision-induced dissociation. The multiplier was set at an absolute value of 500 V, total ion current was obtained over m/z 200–1000 using a cone energy of 50 V in the positive ion mode, and 5.0 kV was applied to the electrospray capillary. Multiple reaction monitoring used 22 eV of collision energy, and the transition used to identify HAzPC were the molecular cation [M+H+]of m/z 652 and the daughter ion of m/z 184. An Exogenous Oxidized Phospholipid Caused Apoptotic Cell Death—We treated the promyelocytic cell line HL60 with increasing concentrations of synthetic HAzPC for 6 h and then tested for an early marker of apoptotic cell death, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the exterior leaflet of the plasma membrane. HAzPC caused a concentration-dependent increase in annexin V staining of exposed phosphatidylserine, where 2.5 μm HAzPC increased by 5-fold the number of cells stained by annexin V (Fig. 1A). Doubling the amount of exogenous HAzPC to 5 μm produced a further increase in the number of cells displaying phosphatidylserine on their surface. HAzPC also increased the number of cells unable to exclude the nuclear dye propidium iodide, but at this early time few cells had progressed to become doubly positive (not shown). The liver cell line HepG2 (Fig. 1B) and human umbilical endothelial cells (not shown) also lost plasma membrane phosphatidylserine asymmetry when exposed to increasing concentrations of HAzPC, so the effect of HAzPC was not specific to HL60 cells. We determined whether HAzPC caused a lethal increase in intracellular free Ca2+ using the fluorescent dye FURA2. We found that, although the cells retained the dye, and therefore remained intact, there was only a small transient increase in Ca2+ (not shown), suggesting the cells did not die by lysis or necrosis. Exogenous HAzPC Is Internalized and Associates with Mitochondria as an Intact Phospholipid—We added HAzPC to the medium of HL60 cells, recovered the cells at varied times by centrifugation, and washed them once with albumin. HL60 cells rapidly internalized the added HAzPC, with maximal accumulation by ∼30 min (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis can be initiated through mitochondrial damage, so we determined whether mitochondria were exposed to the internalized oxidized phospholipid. We treated HL60 cells with HAzPC, washed them once with albumin and once with buffer, and then homogenized the cells and fractionated the homogenate by differential centrifugation. We found that the mitochondrial fraction was enriched with HAzPC compared with other cellular membranes and cytosol (Fig. 2B). At least a portion of the internalized HAzPC trafficked to mitochondria as the intact molecule, because the mass spectrometer monitored the molecular ion. We next determined whether internalized HAzPC was responsible for the cytotoxicity of the oxidized phospholipid. To do this, we stably expressed PAF acetylhydrolase (PLA2g7) in these cells, because this enzyme hydrolyzes PAF and oxidatively damaged phospholipids, including HAzPC, without attacking unmodified membrane phospholipids. Cells expressing PLA2g7 became almost fully resistant to the toxic effect of HAzPC (Fig. 2C). Intracellular Mitochondria Are Damaged by Exogenous HAzPC—We considered that the unusual structure of HAzPC potentially distorts membrane bilayer structure and that one form of apoptosis results from altered mitochondrial membrane barrier function that allows pro-apoptotic proteins to escape. To define mitochondrial integrity after exposure to HAzPC, we stained adherent HUVECs with MitoTracker Red. We found extensive accumulation of the cationic dye by mitochondria that produced a bright, localized staining pattern (Fig. 3). In contrast, MitoTracker RED was diffusely present in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to HAzPC, suggesting the mitochondrial transmembrane potential that drives the cationic dye into the matrix may have been dissipated by HAzPC exposure. AIF is an integral mitochondrial inner membrane protein, but proteolysis of the membrane anchor, coupled with outer membrane damage, allows the protein to escape this confine. A portion of this released AIF moves to the nucleus to participate in the DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cells (26Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We used adherent HepG2 (Fig. 4A) and HUVECs (Fig. 4B) to image AIF to find that AIF was localized in punctate, perinuclear structures in control cells, but that it had a diffuse distribution in cells exposed to HAzPC. Staining of the nuclei with DAPI showed that a portion of the AIF was now associated with the nucleus of HAzPC-treated cells. Structurally compromised mitochondria also allow cytochrome c to escape its association with the inner membrane, and we observed that immunoreactive cytochrome c had leaked from the mitochondrial compartment into the cytoplasm in HL60 (Fig. 4C) and HepG2 (Fig. 4D) cells exposed to HAzPC. Isolated Mitochondria Swell When Exposed to HAzPC—The inner mitochondrial membrane supports a chemiosmotic gradient and mitochondria swell when this permeability barrier is breached. Rat liver mitochondria maximally increased their volume when treated with a high concentration of Ca2+ and the poreforming peptide alamethicin (Fig. 5A). Isolated mitochondria swelled to 70% of this maximal change when treated with HAzPC. Depolarization of mitochondria alone was insufficient to cause swelling, because the protonophore carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone had little effect on mitochondrial volume. The homologous phospholipid palmitoylglutaroyl (a 5-carbon di-acid) PC, formed from oxidative fragmentation of palmitoylarachidonoyl-PC, caused mitochondria to increase their volume to 50% of that of the positive control. Other short chain phospholipids, and lysophosphatidic acid, were less effective in this regard and were about as effective as the underivitized lysophosphatidylcholine in changing mitochondrial volume. We found (Fig. 5B) that the acyl form of HAzPC, palmitoyl azelaoyl-PC, induced swelling, but was about half as effective as the ether phospholipid. A minor portion of this swelling was blocked by cyclosporin A, a small molecule that binds to cyclophilin D of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and keeps in it a closed position (Fig. 5C). We examined the effect of HAzPC on the physical structure of mitochondria by electron microscopy. The photomicrographs we obtained (Fig. 5D) show this normally compact and electron dense organelle was affected by lysophosphatidylcholine and to a greater extent by HAzPC. Mitochondria treated with lysophosphatidylcholine were enlarged and less opaque, whereas those treated with HAzPC were greatly enlarged with transparent domains. The positive control Ca2+ and alamethicin showed the complete disruption of the organelle. Cytochrome c and AIF Escape from Isolated Mitochondria Exposed to HAzPC—The two pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome c and AIF lost their exclusive mitochondrial localization in cells exposed to HAzPC, and a similar loss of mitochondrial retention occurred when isolated mitochondria were exposed to HAzPC (Fig. 6). We found by immunoblotting that HAzPC induced a concentration-dependent loss of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondrial to their supernatant and that cyclosporin A partially reduced the loss of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial pellet at lower HAzPC concentrations. Mitochondria exposed to HAzPC also lost AIF to their supernatant and again cyclosporin A partially suppressed this release. HL60 Cells Exposed to HAzPC Contain Activated Caspase 9 and Caspase 3—Cytoplasmic cytochrome c is free to associate with cytoplasmic apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to form an active pro-caspase 9 cleavage complex, the apoptosome. We tested whether the cytochrome c released to the cytoplasm of HL60 cells exposed to HAzPC promoted the formation of active caspase 9, an upstream initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We found by flow cytometry (Figs. 7, A and B) that few control cells contained active caspase 9 but that a significant portion of HAzPC-treated cells contained this active caspase and hydrolyzed its fluorogenic z-LEHD-fmk substrate to a greater extent than our positive control, UVB irradiation. Caspase 3 cleavage is catalyzed by activated caspase 9, which then allows caspase 3 to function as a downstream executioner caspase. We probed HL60 cells, treated or not with a range of HAzPC concentrations, for proteolytically activated caspase 3 by immunoblotting, and found a concentration-dependent increase in 17- and 19-kDa caspase 3 fragments (Fig. 7C). The specific caspase 9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk blocked formation of the 17- and 19-kDa caspase 3 fragments (not shown), and it prevented the formation of active caspase 3 in HAzPC-treated HL60 cells (Fig. 7D). Caspase 3 activation in response to HAzPC therefore depends on active caspase 9. Caspase Inhibition Suppresses HAzPC-induced Cell Death—The oxidized phospholipid HAzPC activated components of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, so we next determined whether these activated proteases were required for cell death. We first inhibited caspase function with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, and then with the specific caspase 9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk. We found that 46% of apoptotic cells with surface-exposed phosphatidylserine after HAzPC treatment was reduced to ∼16% by each caspase inhibitor (Fig. 8). We conclude that HAzPC is cytotoxic, because it activates proapoptotic caspases. Mitochondria Are Primary Targets of HAzPC-induced Apoptosis—HAzPC damages mitochondrial integrity in intact cells and initiates the intrinsic caspase cascade leading to apoptosis, but is this mitochondrial damage responsible for cell death? To investigate this relationship we used Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog that localizes to mitochondria where it interferes with pro-apoptotic family members and suppresses mitochondrial permeabilization (27Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). We stably overexpressed FLAG-tagged Bcl-XL in HL60 cells (Fig. 9A) and isolated mitochondria from these cells. Mitochondria from Bcl-XL-expressing cells were significantly less sensitive to HAzPC than control cells and allowed little cytochrome c to escape after HAzPC exposure (Fig. 9B). Bcl-XL overexpression was similarly efficacious in vivo where it blocked annexin V staining of HL-60 cells exposed to HAzPC (Fig. 9C). HAzPC therefore interacts with mitochondria to initiate an apoptotic cascade. We show that an exogenous oxidized phospholipid is cytotoxic, because it is readily internalized, migrates to mitochondria, and then damages mitochondria in a way that activates the intrinsic caspase cascade. The sequence of events subsequent to internalization of the oxidation product included association with mitochondria, loss of mitochondrial sequestration of pro-apoptotic proteins, formation of the apoptosome with caspase 9 activation, and then caspase 3 activation. Activation of these caspases was required for HAzPC-induced death, because irreversibly inhibiting caspase 9 suppressed cell death. Cellular mitochondria were the targets of the internalized HAzPC, because overexpression of Bcl-XL suppressed cell death. The phospholipid itself was the proapoptotic agent, because hydrolysis by PAF acetylhydrolase suppressed apoptosis. We tested several cell lines, and circulating human cells (not shown), and found that each was susceptible to HAzPC-induced cell death, although the concentration of HAzPC required to induce death of these cells varied severalfold, perhaps reflecting varied rates of internalization or hydrolysis. However, for each cell type HAzPC at low micromolar concentrations induced"
https://openalex.org/W1991240578,"Genetic and phenotypic variation in female response towards male mating attempts has been found in several laboratory studies, demonstrating sexually antagonistic co-evolution driven by mating costs on female fitness. Theoretical models suggest that the type and degree of genetic variation in female resistance could affect the evolutionary outcome of sexually antagonistic mating interactions, resulting in either rapid development of reproductive isolation and speciation or genetic clustering and female sexual polymorphisms. However, evidence for genetic variation of this kind in natural populations of non-model organisms is very limited. Likewise, we lack knowledge on female fecundity-consequences of matings and the degree of male mating harassment in natural settings. Here we present such data from natural populations of a colour polymorphic damselfly. Using a novel experimental technique of colour dusting males in the field, we show that heritable female colour morphs differ in their propensity to accept male mating attempts. These morphs also differ in their degree of resistance towards male mating attempts, the number of realized matings and in their fecundity-tolerance to matings and mating attempts. These results show that there may be genetic variation in both resistance and tolerance to male mating attempts (fitness consequences of matings) in natural populations, similar to the situation in plant-pathogen resistance systems. Male mating harassment could promote the maintenance of a sexual mating polymorphism in females, one of few empirical examples of sympatric genetic clusters maintained by sexual conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2041882533,"The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an essential protein found in all eukaryotes and is involved in an extensive range of cellular functions, including translation, mRNA metabolism, and mRNA export. Its C-terminal region contains a peptide-interacting PABC domain that recruits proteins containing a highly specific PAM-2 sequence motif to the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex. In humans, these proteins, including Paip1, Paip2, eRF3 (eukaryotic release factor 3), Ataxin-2, and Tob2, are all found to regulate translation through varying mechanisms. The following reports poly(A) nuclease (PAN) as a PABC-interacting partner in both yeast and humans. Their interaction is mediated by a PAM-2 motif identified within the PAN3 subunit. This site was identified in various fungal and animal species suggesting that the interaction is conserved throughout evolution. Our results indicate that PABP is directly involved in recruiting a deadenylase to the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex. This demonstrates a novel role for the PABC domain in mRNA metabolic processes and gives further insight into the function of PABP in mRNA maturation, export, and turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2044684763,"Searching for matches between large collections of short (14–30 nucleotides) words and sequence databases comprising full genomes or transcriptomes is a common task in biological sequence analysis.

Either strategy outperforms megablast for searches with more than 10,000 probes. FetchGWI is shown to be a versatile tool for rapidly searching multiple genomes, whose performance is limited in most cases by the speed of access to the filesystem. We have made publicly available a Web interface for searching the human, mouse, and several other genomes and transcriptomes with oligonucleotide queries."

Malaria infection is initiated with the bite of an infected anophelene mosquito, which injects Plasmodium sporozoites into the skin of the vertebrate host (Fig. 1A). Sporozoites migrate from the site of injection, enter the blood stream, and are carried to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes and develop into exoerythrocytic forms.

Less is known about the role of proteoglycans in the mosquito host, where the parasite encounters a variety of mosquito matrices as it develops (Fig. 1B). When the mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected vertebrate host, gametocytes present in the blood meal differentiate, and fertilization occurs. The zygote develops into an ookinete, which crosses the midgut wall, stops at the basal lamina of the midgut, and develops into an oocyst. There is evidence that ookinetes recognize and adhere to specific sugars on the luminal side of the midgut (12Zieler H. Nawrocki J.P. Shahabuddin M. J. Exp.

Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) show the presence of both the core protein syndecan and the appropriate heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes (22Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), suggesting that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present in mosquitoes. Anopheles stephensi was selected for the current study, because in addition to its being a vector of human malaria (23Reisen W.K. Boreham P.F. J. Med. Entomol. 1982; 19: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is widely used in the laboratory to study Plasmodium-vector interactions, since it can support the growth of both human and rodent malaria species. Here we determine the glycosaminoglycans present in this mosquito species using ultrasensitive disaccharide analysis (24Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 226-2775Google Scholar) and examine their similarity to mammalian liver heparan sulfate and their binding to CSP. Materials—Actinase E was obtained from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.

Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2002; 48: 153-160Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recombinant CSP was made in E. coli (DH5α) transfected with pCS27IVC. The plasmid contains the complete P. falciparum CSP sequence from the T4 isolate, except that the hydrophobic NH2and COOH-terminal amino acids 1–26 and 412–424 have been deleted, and 5 histidine residues were added to the COOH terminus to facilitate purification. The protein used in this study was kindly provided by Dr. Bela Takacs (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (25Takacs B.J. Girard M.F. J. Immunol.

Mr cut-off 3,000 dialysis tubing was purchased from Fisher. Bio-Gel P-10 polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. The Vivapure Q column was purchased from Viva Science (Edgewood, NJ). CM5 sensor chip and Hepes-buffered saline (HBS-N; 0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) were from Biacore. Senshu Pak Docosil (4.6 × 150 mm; particle size, 5 μm) was obtained from Senshu Scientific (Tokyo, Japan). Ultrafree-MC DEAE and Biomax-5 (5,000 normal Mr limit) were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). All other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. Apparatus—The chromatographic equipment included a gradient pump (L-7000), a chromato-integrator (D-7500) from Hitachi Instruments (Tokyo, Japan), a double plunger pump for the reagent solution and reaction heater (Shimamura Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), a sample injector with a 20-μl loop (model 7125; Reodyne, Rohnert Park, CA), and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FP-1580; JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 operated using BIAcore 3000 control and BIAevaluation software (version 4.1). 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C in D2O. Insects—Adult A. stephensi were raised as previously described (26Foster W.A. Julius P. Kreier Malaria. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 122-139Google Scholar). Our analysis was performed with 10–14-day-old adult female mosquitoes that had been allowed to feed for 10 min on an anesthetized rabbit 1 week prior to the analysis. Each mosquito imbibed, on average, between 1 and 2 μl of blood. As controls, we also used age-matched, naive, female A. stephensi mosquitoes that had never had a blood meal. For organ harvest, mosquitoes were placed on ice, rinsed briefly in 70% ethanol, and transferred to buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.8 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mm MgCl2,25mm Hepes, pH 7). Dissections were performed in buffered saline, and dissected organs were placed into glass tubes and kept on ice. After dissection, tubes were spun at 200 × g for 5 min to pellet the dissected organs, excess buffer was removed, and the organs were frozen at –80 °C until use. Whole mosquitoes were counted, washed in ethanol as above, rinsed in buffered saline, and then frozen at –80 °C. Weights of midguts and salivary glands were measured using a Cahn microbalance (model C-34; ATI). Organs were dissected dry and then transferred for weighing using siliconized capillary pipettes. Midguts were weighed in groups of two, and pairs of salivary glands were weighed in groups of five. Preparation of Crude Glycosaminoglycans for Microanalysis— Mosquito samples for disaccharide analysis were first lyophilized to dryness. Lyophilized sample (5 mg) was homogenized with acetone (1 ml), and the homogenate was washed with excess acetone and dried. The pellet was extracted with a solution containing SDS (1.0 ml, 0.5%), NaOH (0.1 m), NaBH4 (0.8%) with constant stirring for 16 h at room temperature. Sodium acetate (200 μl of 1 m solution) and HCl (300 μl of 1 m solution) were then added, the solution was filtered, and HCl (200 μl, 1 m) was added to the filtrate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ethanol (7 ml) was added to the supernatant and chilled for 2 h at 0 °C, and the crude glycosaminoglycan fraction was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in 250 μl of water, and the crude glycosaminoglycan solution was stored frozen (24Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 226-2775Google Scholar). Disaccharide Microanalysis—Crude glycosaminoglycan solution (20 μl) was diluted to 100 μl with water and used as the sample solution for chondroitin disaccharide microanalysis. Chondroitinase digestion was performed using Tris-acetate buffer (5 μl, 0.2 m, pH 8.0), and 10 μl of an aqueous solution containing chondroitinase ABC (50 mIU) and chondroitinase ACII (50 mIU) were added to a 20-μl portion of the sample solution and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. An 8-μl portion of this mixture was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. For heparan sulfate microanalysis, crude glycosaminoglycan sample (230 μl) and sodium phosphate buffer (50 μl, 0.3 m, pH 6.0) were added, and the solution was applied on an Ultrafree-MC DEAE membrane, which had been equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.15 m). The fractions eluted with NaCl (1 m) in the same buffer were collected, desalted with Biomax-5, evaporated, and resuspended in 12 μl of water in preparation of heparin lyase digestion. Next, sodium acetate buffer (5 μl, 0.1 m, pH 7.0) containing calcium acetate (10 mm) and 15 μl of an aqueous solution containing heparin lyase mixture (Seikagaku), heparin lyase I (1 mIU), heparin lyase II (1 mIU), and heparin lyase III (1 mIU) were added to a 5-μl portion of sample. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and an 8-μl aliquot was loaded onto the high performance liquid chromatograph (24Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 226-2775Google Scholar). Determination of Unsaturated Disaccharides from Heparan Sulfate and Chondroitin Sulfate—Unsaturated disaccharides produced enzymatically from heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were analyzed by a reversed-phase ion pair chromatography with sensitive and specific postcolumn detection. A gradient was applied at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min using a Senshu Pak Docosil column (4.6 × 150 mm) at 55 °C. The eluents used were as follows: A, H2O; B, 0.2 m sodium chloride; C, 10 mm tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate; D, 50% acetonitrile. The gradient program was as follows: 0–10 min, 70–67% eluent A, 1–4% eluent B; 10–11 min, 67–56% eluent A, 4–15% eluent B; 11–20 min, 56–46% eluent A, 15–25% eluent B; 20–22 min, 46–18% eluent A, 25–53% eluent B; 22–29 min, 18% eluent A, 53% eluent B; equilibration with 70% A and 1% B for 20 min. The proportions of eluent C and D were constant at 12 and 17%, respectively. A solution of 2-cyanoacetamide (aqueous, 0.5% (w/v)) and sodium hydroxide (0.25 m) was added at the same flow rate (0.35 ml/min) to the effluent using a double plunger pump. The mixture passed through a reaction coil (internal diameter, 0.5 mm; length, 10 m) set in a dry reaction temperature-controlled bath at 125 °C and a following cooling coil (internal diameter, 0.25 mm; length, 3 m). The effluent was monitored fluorometrically (excitation, 346 nm; emission, 410 nm) (24Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 226-2775Google Scholar). Large Scale Preparation and Purification of Heparan Sulfate from Whole Mosquitoes for Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Studies—Approximately 8000 mosquitoes were ground with dry ice, washed with acetone three times to remove lipids, and then dried in vacuo. Mosquito acetone powder was dissolved in 100 ml of water, and 20 ml of 0.05 m Tris-acetate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% actinase E was added and incubated at 45 °C overnight. After actinase E digestion, 2 ml of 100 mm acetic acid was added and boiled for 5 min in water bath and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against water in Mr cut-off 3,000 dialysis tubing overnight and freeze-dried. The resulting peptidoglycan (glycosaminoglycan linked to residual core peptide) from mosquitoes was dissolved in 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS buffer (pH 8.3) and loaded onto the Vivapure Q spin column and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. The column was then washed with 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS buffer and then washed five times with 50 mm NaCl. The bound peptidoglycan was released by washing the spin column three times with 2.7 m (16%) NaCl at 500 × g. Methanol (final concentration 80%) was added to the eluent, and the peptidoglycan component was allowed to precipitate overnight at 4 °C. The peptidoglycan fraction was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 20 min. Core peptide was removed by β-elimination, by dissolving the isolated peptidoglycan in 2 ml of 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH, 0.8% NaBH4, and incubated at room temperature for 16 h with constant stirring. Sodium acetate (400 μl of 1 m) and HCl (600 μl of 1 m) were then added, the solution was filtered, and HCl (400 μl of 1 m) was added to the filtrate. Finally, the solution was dialyzed against Mr cut-off 3,000 dialysis tubing overnight and lyophilized. To remove chondroitin sulfate, the resulting glycosaminoglycan sample was redissolved in 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer and incubated with a mixture of chondroitinase ABC and AC II overnight at 37 °C. After digestion, the sample was dialyzed against Mr cut-off 3,000 dialysis tubing overnight to remove the chondroitin disaccharide that had been formed and then freeze-dried. Residual DNA was removed by dissolving the sample in DNase I reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6), incubating with DNase I at 37 °C overnight. Chromatography on a P-10 column (1 × 50 cm) eluted with water removed DNase and nucleotides, and intact glycosaminoglycan was recovered and lyophilized. 1H NMR spectroscopy (not shown) suggested the presence of residual contaminating mannose-containing glycans. These contaminating glycans were removed by dissolving the sample in 250 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and incubating with endoglycosidase H at 37 °C for 48 h followed by α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase for 24 h at 25 °C. The sample was dialyzed against water in Mr cut-off 3,000 dialysis tubing overnight and lyophilized. All of the enzymes (proteins) that had been added were then removed by dissolving the sample in 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS buffer (pH 8.3) and passing through a Vivapure Q spin column at 500 × g for 15 min. The column was washed with 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS buffer, followed by washing five times with 50 mm NaCl. The heparan sulfate was released from the column with three washes of 2.7 m (16%) NaCl at 500 × g. The heparan sulfate was precipitated at 4 °C overnight by adding absolute methanol (final concentration 80%). The pure heparan sulfate was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 20 min. A carbazole assay (27Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar) showed that 532 μg of heparan sulfate was obtained. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—HBS-N buffer was used for immobilization and interaction studies. CM5 chips were activated with 50 mm N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt and 200 mm N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide mixture for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. CSP was immobilized at a concentration of ∼700 nm. The surfaces were deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. The final response units after ethanolamine was 8,000–10,000. The control surface was prepared the same way, except ∼6000 response units of bovine serum albumin was immobilized. At a flow rate of 5 μl/min and temperature of 25 °C, the interaction between CSP and various concentrations (1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μm) of heparan sulfate was studied, selecting an interaction with an association time of 3 min and dissociation time of 4 min. Between each injection, the surface was regenerated with 2 m NaCl. The interaction was monitored by plotting the increase in response over time (sensorgram), and the control flow cell was subtracted from the experimental flow cell. The curves were evaluated with BIAevaluation version 4.1. Preliminary studies on salivary glands, prepared from adult female A. stephensi mosquitoes, showed that they contained both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. The amount of chondroitin sulfate in the mosquito, however, appeared to be considerably lower than that reported in the whole body of D. melanogaster third stage larvae (24Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 226-2775Google Scholar). Based on these preliminary findings, hundreds of adult female A. stephensi mosquitoes and selected tissues from these mosquitoes were collected. Salivary glands, midguts, and malpighian tubules with ovaries were collected in buffered saline, centrifuged to remove excess buffer, frozen, and then ground into a fine powder for analysis. The total dry mass, prior to removing salts and lipids, of each sample is presented in Table 1. The dry mass of individual mosquitoes or organs was obtained by either dividing the total mass by the number of individuals or by obtaining wet weights on a Cahn microbalance and correcting for water content. Salivary glands (in pairs) and midguts corresponded to 0.6 and 1.2% of the total insect body mass, respectively.TABLE 1Samples prepared for analysisSampleTotal massNumberMass/insect or organPercentage of insect body massmgμg%Whole A. stephensi mosquito71150340aBased on the dry weight of 1,000 insects multiplied by 0.001.100Salivary glands4.34862.0bCalculated from six independent determinations of the wet weight of either two midguts or five pairs of salivary glands.

https://openalex.org/W2041555931,"Various diseases related to the overconsumption of sugar make a growing need for sugar substitutes. Because sucrose is an inexpensive and readily available d-glucose donor, the industrial potential for enzymatic synthesis of the sucrose isomers trehalulose and/or isomaltulose from sucrose is large. The product specificity of sucrose isomerases that catalyze this reaction depends essentially on the possibility for tautomerization of sucrose, which is required for trehalulose formation. For optimal use of the enzyme, targeting controlled synthesis of these functional isomers, it is necessary to minimize the side reactions. This requires an extensive analysis of substrate binding modes and of the specificity-determining sites in the structure. The 1.6-2.2-Å resolution three-dimensional structures of native and mutant complexes of a trehalulose synthase from Pseudomonas mesoacidophila MX-45 mimic successive states of the enzyme reaction. Combined with mutagenesis studies they give for the first time thorough insights into substrate recognition and processing and reaction specificities of these enzymes. Among the important outcomes of this study is the revelation of an aromatic clamp defined by Phe256 and Phe280 playing an essential role in substrate recognition and in controlling the reaction specificity, which is further supported by mutagenesis studies. Furthermore, this study highlights essential residues for binding the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties. The introduction of subtle changes informed by comparative three-dimensional structural data observed within our study can lead to fundamental modifications in the mode of action of sucrose isomerases and hence provide a template for industrial catalysts.

Furthermore, this study highlights essential residues for binding the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties. The introduction of subtle changes informed by comparative three-dimensional structural data observed within our study can lead to fundamental modifications in the mode of action of sucrose isomerases and hence provide a template for industrial catalysts. In 2003, a report commissioned by four United Nations agencies, the World Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization, stated that sugar should not account for more than 10% of a healthy diet aimed at reducing the growing burden of disorders related to cardiovascular pathologies, several forms of cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and dental infectious diseases. Thus, a number of synthetic sugar substitutes have been introduced on the market and still novel compounds emerge. They vary considerably in their degree of sweetness, volume, texture, and stability under various conditions, and no sweetener is a perfect replacement for sucrose, the main limitation being their taste profiles. Moreover, they are among the most controversial food additives because of allegations of adverse health effects including dermatological problems, headaches, mood variations, respiratory difficulties, seizures, and cancer. Trehalulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,1-d-fructofuranose) and isomaltulose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,6-d-fructofuranose) (Fig. 1, A and B) are structural isomers of sucrose (α-d-glucosylpyranosyl-1,2-β-d-fructofuranoside) that have a sweet taste and very similar physical and organoleptic properties to sucrose (Fig. 1C) (1Takazoe I. Progress in Sweeteners. Elsevier, Barking, UK1989: 143-167Google Scholar, 2Hamada S. Pure Appl. Chem. 2002; 74: 1293-1300Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are acariogenic (3Ooshima T. Izumitani A. Minami T. Fujiwara T. Nakajima Y. Hamada S. Caries Res. 1991; 25: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and their absorption reduces the rate with which monosaccharides and insulin are released into the bloodstream (4Yamada K. Shinhara H. Hosoya N. Nutr. Rep. Int. 1985; 32: 1211-1222Google Scholar) and can thus be applied in diabetic and sports foods and drinks. Considering also that no side effects have been yet reported, these compounds could be ideal sucrose substitutes. Furthermore, the reducing properties of isomaltulose make it attractive as industrial precursor for the manufacturing of biosurfactants and biocompatible polymers (5Lichtenthaler F.W. Peters S. C. R. Chimie. 2004; 7: 65-90Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Naturally present in honey in very small quantities, their chemical synthesis is very difficult, and their industrial production proceeds exclusively from sucrose using immobilized microorganisms. Several bacterial strains have been reported to convert sucrose into both isomaltulose and trehalulose, to act as a reserve material during periods of low carbon availability, because of the activity of a particular sucrose isomerase (sucrose mutase or α-glucosyltransferase, EC 5.4.99.11) (6Cheetham P.S.

Sucrose isomerases are monomeric enzymes widely identified also in whiteflies (16Salvucci M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 135: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which catalyze the isomerization of sucrose into trehalulose and isomaltulose as main products and produce glucose and fructose in residual amounts because of sucrose hydrolysis. The ratio of the enzyme products varies from mainly isomaltulose (75-85%) to predominantly trehalulose (∼90%) depending on the bacterial strain (6Cheetham P.S. Biochem.

Sucrose isomerases are classified into glycoside hydrolase family 13 of retaining enzymes (17Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar) (www.cazy.org), the largest of the 110 families existing to date. It contains a wide range of polysaccharide-metabolizing enzymes, including glycogen and starch branching enzymes. All family 13 enzymes have structurally similar active sites with highly conserved catalytic residues and proceed via a double-displacement mechanism with the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (18Koshland D.E.

What is still not understood is how these very divergent enzymes use the rest of their surface to confer both activity and specificity. For sucrose isomerases, the three-dimensional native structure of the isomaltulose synthase PalI from Klebsiella sp. LX3 (14Zhang D. Li X. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Zhang D. Li N. Lok S.M. Zhang L.H. Swaminathan K. J. Biol.

These authors suggested that a unique RLDRD motif located in a loop region is involved in the isomerization reaction and in the product specificity. To go beyond these first insights, more structural data especially on enzyme·substrate complexes are needed to characterize the enzyme specificity and the molecular mechanism controlling sucrose isomerization and consequently to deal with optimization of the catalytic properties of these enzymes to improve their industrial use. We have recently cloned, purified, and crystallized the trehalulose synthase MutB from Pseudomonas mesoacidophila MX-45, a sucrose isomerase that mainly produces trehalulose (26Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Haser R. Mattes R. Aghajari N. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and described preliminary data on the structure of MutB in complex with Tris (27Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Haser R. Aghajari N. Biologia Cell. Mol. Biol. Sect. 2005; 60: 99-105Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the catalytic mechanism and the specificities of MutB by combining mutagenesis and structural approaches and report the first three-dimensional structure of a trehalulose synthase and the first enzyme·substrate complex structures for a sucrose isomerase. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Enzymes—MutB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli JM109 cells harboring the plasmid pHWG315 and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) as described elsewhere (26Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Haser R. Mattes R. Aghajari N. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The active site MutB mutants D200A and E254Q were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The mutations were generated by using two synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed by the QuikChange® primer design program (Stratagene) (D200A, 5′-AGGCATGCGGTTCGCGACGGTGGCTACCT-3′ and 5′-AGGTAGCCACCGTCGCGAACCGCATGCCT-3′; E254Q, 5′-GTC ACG GCC GGC CAG ATC TTC GGC GCT CC-3′ and 5′-GGAGCGCCGAAGATCTGGCCGGCCGTGAC-3′; the mutations are indicated by bold letters, and silent mutations introducing a recognition site for the restriction enzyme BglII are indicated in italics), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cells of E. coli JM109 were transformed with mutant plasmid, i.e. pHWG678.6 (D200A) and pHWG679.9 (E254Q), and mutant enzymes were expressed and purified as described for the native protein (26Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Haser R. Mattes R. Aghajari N. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Site-directed saturation mutagenesis followed the guidelines of the QuikChange® protocol using single degenerate codon oligonucleotides (NNS) to produce a mutant clone collection for residues 256, 280, and 414. All of the plasmids coding for mutB gene variants are derivatives of the l-rhamnose-inducible expression vector pJOE2702. Randomly selected clones were expressed, as described for the native enzyme, DNA-sequenced, and analyzed for enzyme properties. Enzyme Assay and Product Analysis—Sucrose isomerase activity was determined as described previously (26Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Haser R. Mattes R. Aghajari N. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Enzyme mutants were analyzed by their ability to act on sucrose and the amount of released products. The product composition following 100 mm sucrose conversion was measured after ∼90% substrate consumption, and concentrations of the individual sugars were determined by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPLC) 3The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. with pulse amperometric detection. The samples were separated on a CarboPac® PA1 column (Dionex) with 0.22 m NaOH, 0.02 m NaAc at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Eluted sugars detected by pulsed amperometry with an analytical cell (5040, ESA Coulochem II, Bischoff) were identified by comparing retention times with those of standards. The relative percentage of each sugar was calculated from peak areas. Standard sugars, isomaltulose and trehalulose, were obtained from Südzucker. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Inhibition Studies—Inhibition studies were performed by measuring the enzyme activity at various concentrations of each inhibitor using sucrose as substrate. The amount of formed trehalulose was quantified by HPLC as described above and used for activity calculations. Lineweaver-Burk plots were performed for determination of the inhibition mode, and Dixon plots were used to calculate Ki for the inhibitors. Crystallization—Crystals were grown at 17 °C as described previously (Ref. 26Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Haser R. Mattes R. Aghajari N. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz.

Open table in a new tab MutB complexes with deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, respectively, were obtained by co-crystallization. 0.2 μl of a 100 mm inhibitor stock solution (Sigma) was mixed with 0.8 μl of protein stock and 1 μl of well solution, thus resulting in a final concentration of 10 mm inhibitor in the drops. Co-crystallization of D200A in complex with glucose was performed by mixing 0.2 μl of a 200 mm sucrose solution (Sigma) with 0.8 μl of mutant enzyme (4.0 mg/ml) and 1 μl of well solution. The complex between the inactive E254Q mutant and sucrose was obtained by soaking mutant crystals for 20 min in the crystallization solution containing 1 mm sucrose. Data Collection—Crystals used for the diffraction experiments typically measured 0.8×0.2×0.03 mm3 and were cryo-protected prior to data collection by rapid soaking (1 min) in mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and for MutB·deoxynojirimycin, MutB·castanospermine, D200A·glucose, and E254Q·sucrose, the corresponding ligand molecule at the concentration used for co-crystallization or soaking experiments. The diffraction data were collected at various beamlines (Table 1) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Diffracted intensities were integrated and scaled using programs from the XDS package (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar), except for MutB·Tris, which was integrated with the program MOSFLM (30Leslie A.G.W. Crystallography Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1991: 50-61Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 software package (31CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement—The 1.6-Å resolution MutB·Tris structure (27Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Haser R. Aghajari N. Biologia Cell. Mol. Biol. Sect. 2005; 60: 99-105Google Scholar) was used as starting model in a difference Fourier (water, Tris, and calcium ions were omitted) to solve the structures of native MutB and MutB·deoxynojirimycin. An initial rigid body refinement using data to 3 Å was performed, and in the subsequent refinement steps a simulated annealing protocol was used extending data to 2 and 1.8 Å, respectively. The structure of MutB·castanospermine was solved by the molecular replacement method using the refined P21 structure of MutB·Tris at 1.8 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank entry code 1ZJB) (27Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Haser R. Aghajari N. Biologia Cell. Mol. Biol. Sect. 2005; 60: 99-105Google Scholar) as a search model, employing the program AMoRe (32Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Diffraction data in the resolution range 15-3.5 Å were used in the molecular replacement search. A unique solution located the two molecules in the asymmetric unit with a correlation coefficient of 81.4% and an R factor of 31.3%. For D200A·glucose, the MutB·Tris structure (27Ravaud S. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Haser R. Aghajari N. Biologia Cell. Mol. Biol. Sect. 2005; 60: 99-105Google Scholar) was used as a search model in AMoRe, and a unique solution was found, using 15-3.5-Å data. Correlation coefficients and R factors were, respectively, 75.0% and 33.1%. The MutB·deoxynojirimycin structure was used for initial phasing of E254Q·sucrose data in a difference Fourier followed by a rigid body refinement, as described above. All of the models were refined using the simulated annealing protocol as implemented in the software CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Biographics, AFMB, Marseille, France1992Google Scholar). R and Rfree factors (35Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar) were monitored, and the latter was calculated from 10% of the reflections randomly selected from the MutB·Tris and MutB·castanospermine data: 8% for native MutB data and 5% in the case of MutB·deoxynojirimycin, D200A·glucose, and E254Q·sucrose data. Water molecules located at similar positions in the respective structures have the same numbering. Ligand models found in the HIC-Up data base (36Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) were manually inserted in the electron density maps. The quality of the three-dimensional structures was examined with PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (38Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Active sites in the enzyme complex structures were inspected, and hydrogen bonds with a maximum length of 3.35 Å showing suitable hydrogen bond geometries were monitored with the program HBPLUS (39McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). The definition of the catalytic pocket and the calculation of its volume were done using the VOIDOO software (40Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Alignment and Figure Rendering—MutB and PalI sequences were aligned using the program CLUSTALW (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar), and rendering of the alignment including superimposition of secondary structures and domains of the two enzymes was done with the program ESPript (42Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The drawings were generated with the programs GRASP (43Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar), DS Visualizer (Accelrys Inc., San Diego), ENDscript (42Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), and PyMOL (44DeLano W.L. PyMOL. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Inhibition Studies—The inhibitory effects of the known α-glucosidase inhibitors, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, and acarbose on MutB were tested. Among these castanospermine was a more potent inhibitor than deoxynojirimycin, with Ki values of 15 and 40 μm, respectively, whereas acarbose was completely noninhibitory. Tris, which inhibits some GH13 enzymes (45Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 46Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. De Montalk G.P. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25273-25278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was also tested and found to be more weakly bound (Ki = 300 μm). Lineweaver-Burk plots of these inhibitors showed that all can be considered as competitive (data not shown). Overall Structure—We determined the crystal structure of MutB in its native state and in complex with the competitive inhibitors Tris, deoxynojirimycin, and castanospermine (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Also, the structures of two MutB inactive mutants, D200A and E254Q, were solved in complex with d-glucose and with its natural substrate sucrose, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 1). All of the three-dimensional structures MutB·Tris, MutB·deoxynojirimycin, MutB·castanospermine, D200A·glucose, and E254Q·sucrose are highly similar to that of the free enzyme, as indicated by root mean square deviation values between Cαs in these five structures and the native form (0.24, 0.16, 0.32, 0.18, and 0.27 Å, respectively). Each MutB monomer (557 amino acids) forms an ellipsoid with dimensions of ∼78 × 51 × 44 Å3. The topology of MutB is similar to that observed in the vast majority of known GH13 enzyme structures and displays three domains (Figs. 3 and 4A), including a major central domain with a (β/α)8 barrel super secondary structure (N-terminal domain, also known as domain A in other GH13 proteins). As in PalI (24Zhang D. Li N. Lok S.M. Zhang L.H. Swaminathan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35428-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B), the N-terminal domain differs from the classical TIM barrel (47Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G.

A loop-rich structure of 69 residues (subdomain, also referred to as domain B in other GH13 enzyme structures), comprising an α-helix, a 310-helix, and three anti-parallel β-strands, protrudes from the (β/α)8 barrel between Nβ3 and Nα3. This subdomain strongly interacts with the N-terminal domain by forming 22 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge. Domain C, a 79-residue-long C-terminal domain, is made up of two antiparallel β-sheets. It is tightly connected to the N-terminal domain through a network of hydrogen bonds, clustered in three regions: between Nα6 and the segment including Cβ1 and Cβ2, between Nα7 and Cβ2/Cβ7, and between Nα8 and Cβ2. An interdomain salt bridge connects Arg303 Nη2 to Asp483 Oδ1. A calcium ion, Ca7001, identified in all MutB structures, is bound to the catalytic N-terminal domain in a loop easily accessible to the solvent. This calcium ion, which is hepta-coordinated, is l"

So we investigated the effects of polyphenols in vivo on postischemic neovascularization. Rats treated with low (0.2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or high (20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) doses of red wine polyphenolic compounds (RWPC) were submitted to femoral artery ligature on the left leg. Two wks after ligature, high doses of RWPC (i.e., 7 glasses of red wine) reduced arterial, arteriolar, and capillary densities and blood flow in association with an inhibition of a PI3 kinase-Akt-endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway, decreased VEGF expression, and lower metalloproteinase (MMP) activation. Low doses of RWPC (i.e., 1/10th glass of red wine) increased the left/right (L/R) leg ratio to control level in association with an increased blood flow and microvascular density. This angiogenic effect was associated with an overexpression of PI3 kinase-Akt-eNOS pathway and an increased VEGF production without effect on MMP activation. Thus, low and high doses RWPC have respectively pro- and anti-angiogenic properties on postischemic neovascularization in vivo. This unique dual effect of RWPC offers important perspectives for the treatment and prevention of ischemic diseases (low dose) or cancer growth (high dose)."
https://openalex.org/W2053307900,"The structural complexity of chromosome 1p centromeric region has been an obstacle for fine mapping of tumor suppressor genes in this area. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 1p is associated with the longer survival of oligodendroglioma (OD) patients. To test the clinical relevance of 1p loss in glioblastomas (GBM) patients and identifiy the underlying tumor suppressor locus, we constructed a somatic deletion map on chromosome 1p in 26 OG and 118 GBM. Deletion hotspots at 4 microsatellite markers located at 1p36.3, 1p36.1, 1p22 and 1p11 defined 10 distinct haplotypes that were related to patient survival. We found that loss of 1p centromeric marker D1S2696 within NOTCH2 intron 12 was associated with favorable prognosis in OD (P = 0.0007) as well as in GBM (P = 0.0175), while 19q loss, concomitant with 1p LOH in OD, had no influence on GBM survival (P = 0.918). Assessment of the intra-chromosomal ratio between NOTCH2 and its 1q21 pericentric duplication N2N (N2/N2N-test) allowed delineation of a consistent centromeric breakpoint in OD that also contained a minimally lost area in GBM. OD and GBM showed distinct deletion patterns that converged to the NOTCH2 gene in both glioma subtypes. Moreover, the N2/N2N-test disclosed homozygous deletions of NOTCH2 in primary OD. The N2/N2N test distinguished OD from GBM with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97%. Combined assessment of NOTCH2 genetic markers D1S2696 and N2/N2N predicted 24-month survival with an accuracy (0.925) that is equivalent to histological classification combined with the D1S2696 status (0.954) and higher than current genetic evaluation by 1p/19q LOH (0.762). Our data propose NOTCH2 as a powerful new molecular test to detect prognostically favorable gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2072173537,"VLA-4 (α4β1) is a key integrin in lymphocytes, interacting with endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on blood vessels and stroma. To dissect the contribution of the two cytoskeletal VLA-4 adaptor partners paxillin and talin to VLA-4 adhesiveness, we transiently knocked them down in Jurkat T cells and primary resting human T cells by small interfering RNA silencing. Paxillin was required for VLA-4 adhesiveness to low density VCAM-1 under shear stress conditions and was found to control mechanical stability of bonds mediated by the α4 subunit but did not affect the integrin affinity or avidity to VCAM-1 in shear-free conditions. Talin 1 maintained VLA-4 in a high affinity conformation, thereby promoting rapid VLA-4 adhesion strengthening to VCAM-1 under both shear stress and shear-free conditions. Talin 1, but not paxillin, was required for VLA-4 to undergo optimal stimulation by the prototypic chemokine, CXCL12, under shear stress conditions. Interestingly, talin 1 and paxillin played the same distinct roles in VLA-4 adhesions of primary T lymphocytes, although VLA-4 affinity to VCAM-1 was at least 200-fold lower in these cells than in Jurkat cells. Collectively, our results suggest that whereas paxillin is a mechanical regulator of VLA-4 bonds generated in the absence of chemokine signals and low VCAM-1 occupancy, talin 1 is a versatile VLA-4 affinity regulator implicated in both spontaneous and chemokine-triggered rapid adhesions to VCAM-1.

A remarkable feature of leukocyte integrins is their ability to modulate their adhesive activity within fractions of seconds through cytoplasmic associations with cytoskeletal partners (1Kinashi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Laudanna C. Alon R. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These associations may regulate both integrin conformation (affinity) and clustering prior to or immediately following ligand binding and thereby increase integrin avidity to surface-bound ligands. Leukocyte integrins like VLA-4 and LFA-1 must recognize their endothelial ligands and stabilize adhesion under constant shear forces. Recent evidence suggests that when the integrin headpiece is occupied by ligand, it can be instantaneously stabilized by application of external force (3Puklin-Faucher E. Gao M. Schulten K. Vogel V. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), so shear forces exerted on leukocytes at target sites on blood vessels may play both positive and negative roles in the adhesive outcome of integrin-ligand interactions. To load forces, integrins and ligands may need to be properly anchored to a rigid surface, such as the cortical cytoskeleton (4Alon R. Dustin M.L. Immunity. 2007; 26: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Specific cytoskeletal partners of integrins may therefore regulate not only the affinity and clustering states of their integrin targets but also the efficiency by which an integrin occupied with ligand can strengthen its bond under the influence of external forces. In support of this possibility, we recently showed that the adhesive activity under shear of the key immune cell integrin, VLA-4, is modulated by an α4 cytoplasmic association with paxillin, without any noticeable changes in its affinity, clustering, or binding avidity to VCAM-1 2The abbreviations used are:VCAMvascular cell adhesion moleculemAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingICAMintercellular adhesion moleculesiRNAsmall interfering RNAPBLperipheral blood leukocyte(s)PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. 2The abbreviations used are:VCAMvascular cell adhesion moleculemAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingICAMintercellular adhesion moleculesiRNAsmall interfering RNAPBLperipheral blood leukocyte(s)PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. measured in the absence of shear (5Alon R.

In that study, an α4 tail mutant, Y991A, with disrupted binding to paxillin and reduced recruitment of talin 1 to the β1 subunit of the integrin heterodimer, exhibited reduced VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 measured under shear stress conditions (5Alon R.

Since the adhesive defect of the integrin mutant could result from impairments in both paxillin and talin associations with the VLA-4 heterodimer, the specific contribution of each of these two key cytoskeletal integrin linkers to stabilization of VLA-4-VCAM-1 interactions under shear flow remained obscure. vascular cell adhesion molecule monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting intercellular adhesion molecule small interfering RNA peripheral blood leukocyte(s) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate extracellular signal-regulated kinase. vascular cell adhesion molecule monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting intercellular adhesion molecule small interfering RNA peripheral blood leukocyte(s) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Talin 1, the key talin member in immune cells, is an antiparallel actin-binding homodimer that serves as a major link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in the early steps of focal adhesion assembly (6Critchley D.R.

The binding of the talin head region to the β subunits of multiple β2 and β3 integrins breaks a suppressory clasp, enabling the conformational change of the integrin ectodomains from bent (inactive) states into extended states, with partially or fully active headpieces (8Tadokoro S.

Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). However, conformational modulation of β1 integrins by intact talin has not been demonstrated to date, although different inside-out signals can recruit talin to integrin sites via the Ras-related integrin-activating GTPase, Rap-1 (10Han J.

Paxillin is a 68-kDa multidomain adaptor protein that integrates signals from integrins and growth factor receptors to actin cytoskeletal remodeling effectors that coordinate cell motility and turnover of focal adhesions (11Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In lymphoid cells, although integrin-mediated focal adhesions are not generated, paxillin plays a key role in α4-mediated motility via high affinity binding to the α4 integrin tail (12Liu S.

The α4 integrin-paxillin complex regulates the activation of FAK and Pyk2, deactivates Rac in the leading edge of migrating cells (14Nishiya N. Kiosses W.B. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and can also trans-activate the LFA-1 integrin in T cells (15Rose D.M. Liu S. Woodside D.G. Han J. Schlaepfer D.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These and other functions are tightly regulated by multiple tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on paxillin (16Turner C.E. J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). So far, a role for paxillin in rapid integrin-mediated T cell adhesions has not been explored. In T cells, VLA-4 interactions with VCAM-1 can generate stable shear-resistant adhesive contacts within subseconds even without a requirement for prior rolling contacts (18Berlin C. Bargatze R.F. Campbell J.J. von Andrian U.H. Szabo M.C. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Berg E.L. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 19Alon R.

In an earlier study, we observed that suppression of paxillin and talin each reduced the adhesiveness of VLA-4 in cells settled for 1 min on VCAM-1 before being subjected to shear stress (5Alon R. Feigelson S.W. Rose D.M. Schmitz J. Manevich E. Overby D.R. Winter E. Grabovsky V. Shinder V. Matthews B.D. Sokolovsky-Eisenberg M. Ingber D.E. Benoit M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Physiological interactions between these counterreceptors at the vasculature takes place under continuous shear flow and must generate adhesion strengthening within seconds. Therefore, and in light of the key involvement of talin and paxillin in the much slower organization of integrin assemblies within static contacts (20Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar), the contribution of these adaptors to the earliest VLA-4 interactions with VCAM-1 under continuous shear could be masked by these later events. In this study, we identified distinct roles for paxillin and talin 1 in the control of VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 developed at adhesive contacts over a time frame of seconds and subjected to continuous shear stress. Using selective siRNA-targeted suppression of talin 1 and paxillin in a Jurkat T cell model, we found that paxillin, although not regulating VLA-4 affinity or avidity to VCAM-1 in shear-free systems, was essential for mechanical stabilization of individual VLA-4/VCAM-1 bonds at subsecond contacts subjected to shear flow. Talin 1, on the other hand, was implicated in direct modulation of VLA-4 affinity to VCAM-1 and consequently in VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesions as well as in LFA-1 adhesion. Talin 1, but not paxillin, also contributed to in situ chemokine induction of VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1. This study identifies talin 1 and paxillin as specialized modulators of distinct adhesive properties of VLA-4 essential for rapid VLA-4 adhesiveness developed under shear forces.

All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—Cells were washed once with cation-free H/H medium (HBSS containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), resuspended in binding medium (H/H medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2), and incubated with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and analyzed immediately on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). To probe the basal and agonist-stimulated expression of the activation reporter epitopes 15/7 and HUTS21, cells were incubated with the mAbs (10 μg/ml) in binding medium for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of agonist (CXCL12 (30 nm) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm)), followed by a 25-min incubation on ice to minimize integrin internalization. Cells were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. siRNA-mediated Silencing of Paxillin and Talin 1—Silencing of talin expression in Jurkat cells was achieved by a single talin 1-specific 21-nucleotide siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) corresponding to positions 6043–6063 (5′-AAUCGUGAGGGUACUGAAACU-3′) relative to the talin 1 mRNA start codon (26Shamri R. Grabovsky V. Gauguet J.M. Feigelson S. Manevich E. Kolanus W. Robinson M.K. Staunton D.E. von Andrian U.H. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) screened from several talin-specific oligonucleotides. Silencing of paxillin was performed using a single siRNA duplex sequence (5′-CCCUGACGAAAGAGAAGCCUAUU-3′ and 5′-UAGGCUUCUCUUUCGUCAGGGUU-3′), as described (14Nishiya N. Kiosses W.B. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Control transfections were performed with a fluorescein-labeled 21-nucleotide duplex directed to luciferase GL2. Transfection of both Jurkat T cells and primary PBLs was carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection® system (Amaxa). Transfected cells were maintained in culture medium. Talin and paxillin expression, monitored by immunoblotting, was maximally suppressed at 72 and 96 h post-transfection in Jurkat cells or human PBLs, respectively, the time points chosen for subsequent functional assays. Western Blot Analyses—For Western blot studies, 1 × 107 cells (treated or untreated) were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer (5Alon R. Feigelson S.W. Rose D.M. Schmitz J. Manevich E. Overby D.R. Winter E. Grabovsky V. Shinder V. Matthews B.D. Sokolovsky-Eisenberg M. Ingber D.E. Benoit M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and 20 μl of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in reducing buffer. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Sigma). VCAM-1 Microbead Binding Assay—Protein A-coated magnetic Dynabeads (M-280; Dynal Biotech Inc., Lake Success, NY) were coated at room temperature with various concentrations of VCAM-Fc in H/H binding medium, washed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored on ice. Cells and VCAM-1-coated beads were mixed at room temperature for 1 min in binding medium at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml at a ratio of 1 cell to 8 beads, followed by a 3-fold dilution in binding medium. The cellular side scatter, distinguishing between bead-bound and bead-free cells, was analyzed immediately in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Background binding determined with Protein A-coated beads was <5% of the maximal binding observed at VCAM-1 saturation and was subtracted from the total binding results. Soluble VCAM-1-Fc Binding Assay—Cells (0.5 × 106) were incubated with (VCAM-1)2-Ig (VCAM-1-Fc) for 30 min at room temperature in H/H binding medium. Cells were then washed twice by suspension in H/H binding medium and incubated with phycoerythrin-donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 20 min at room temperature (in binding medium) before washing with PBS and FACS analysis. For each cell population, the relative cell binding at a given concentration of soluble VCAM-1 was deduced by the fluorescence level of cell-bound VCAM-1 relative to the maximal cell-bound VCAM-1. For Scatchard analysis of the binding data, absolute values of maximal VCAM-1 binding (Bmax) to various siRNA-treated cells were derived by analysis of the maximal cell-bound VCAM-1-Fc content, present at saturation, which was removed by EDTA and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To assess the effect of transient chemokine stimulation on VLA-4 affinity to VCAM-1, cells were incubated at room temperature with increasing concentrations of VCAM-1-Fc for 25 min, and a fixed concentration of the chemokine of interest was added for an additional 5-min period. Cells were immediately fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for an additional 10 min and washed. The relative VCAM-1 binding was assessed by immunostaining as described above. Laminar Flow Adhesion Assays—Purified ligands or mAbs were coated alone or with CXCL12 on polystyrene plates as previously described (25Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G.

Site densities of coated sVCAM-1 were determined as described (25Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R.

Cells were washed with cation-free H/H medium, resuspended in binding medium (H/H medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2), and perfused through the flow chamber at the desired shear stress. All flow experiments were conducted at 37 °C. Tethers were defined as “transient” if cells attached briefly (<2s) to the substrate and as “arrests” if they immediately arrested and remained stationary during at least 3 s of continuous flow. Frequencies of adhesive categories within differently pretreated cells or rates of cell accumulation on adhesive substrates were determined as a percentage of cells flowing immediately over the substrates, as previously described (25Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Over 95% of cellular tethers to VCAM-1 were blocked by pretreating cells with the specific VLA-4 blocker, BIO-1211 (21Lin K. Ateeq H.S. Hsiung S.H. Chong L.T. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Lee W.C. Hammond C.E. Kalkunte S. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Leone D.R. Sprague A.G. Abraham W.M. Gill A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 920-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (1 μg/ml), and all tethers to ICAM-1 were blocked in the presence of EDTA. Paxillin Is Required for VLA-4 Tether Formation under Shear Stress but Not for Integrin Avidity to VCAM-1 under Shear-free Conditions—To examine the role of paxillin in T cell VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 in T cells in adhesive contacts under shear stress, we knocked down paxillin expression in Jurkat cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing. Suppressing paxillin expression by up to 80% using transient siRNA silencing (Fig. 1A) did not affect integrin α4 or β1 expression (Fig. 1B) but resulted in dramatically reduced VLA-4-mediated attachment of the T cells to both low and medium VCAM-1 densities under continuous shear flow (Fig. 1C). This paxillin-mediated suppression of VLA-4 tethers was also evident at higher shear stresses (data not shown). Identical paxillin suppression did not affect, however, the frequency or strength of VLA-4-mediated Jurkat attachments to high density VCAM-1 (Fig. 1C). These results were confirmed with multiple Jurkat clones expressing different levels of VLA-4. Consistent with the Jurkat data, paxillin suppression in PBLs (Fig. 1D) retained VLA-4 expression (not shown), partially inhibited VLA-4-mediated attachment to medium density VCAM-1, and had no effect on initial attachments or on their strength of interaction to high density VCAM-1 (Fig. 1E). Since PBLs express 3–5-fold lower levels of VLA-4 than Jurkat T cells, their attachments to low density VCAM-1 were undetectable even without paxillin suppression (not shown). The inhibitory effects of paxillin suppression on VLA-4-mediated attachments, adhesive events generated within subsecond contacts with the VCAM-1-coated surface, could result from a general modulation of the number and function of lymphocyte microvilli. We therefore next tested whether L-selectin adhesiveness, which strongly depends on microvilli and cytoskeletal integrity (29Finger E.B. Bruehl R.E. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5085-5096PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 31von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), was also inhibited by paxillin suppression in Jurkat cells. Since paxillin-suppressed cells retained L-selectin adhesiveness under various shear stress conditions (Fig. 1, F and G), we conclude that paxillin suppression in Jurkat T cells did not globally alter their shape, cytoskeletal integrity, or microvillar structure. Rather, paxillin affected VLA-4 adhesiveness by interfering with the ability of the integrin to form adhesive tethers at subsecond contacts, especially to low density VCAM-1. A failure of an integrin to form tethers could result from a reduced affinity to ligand, impaired clustering, and/or an inability of the tether to resist disruptive forces (5Alon R. Feigelson S.W. Rose D.M. Schmitz J. Manevich E. Overby D.R. Winter E. Grabovsky V. Shinder V. Matthews B.D. Sokolovsky-Eisenberg M. Ingber D.E. Benoit M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore next considered that paxillin suppression may directly reduce VLA-4 avidity to surface-bound VCAM-1 under shear free conditions. However, VLA-4-mediated Jurkat cell binding to VCAM-1-coated beads was not affected by paxillin suppression at any density of VCAM-1 tested (Fig. 2). Paxillin suppression also did not affect the binding of soluble VCAM-1 to VLA-4 on Jurkat cells (data not shown), further suggesting that neither affinity nor avidity of VLA-4 to surface-bound VCAM-1 are regulated by paxillin in Jurkat T cells. Thus, the adhesive defect of paxillin-suppressed cells reflected a mechanical rather than a direct binding defect of the VLA-4-VCAM-1 bond. Lck-dependent Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Paxillin Is Not Required for Its Contribution to VLA-4 Adhesiveness under Shear—Paxillin function is modulated by multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (11Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether paxillin requires tyrosine phosphorylation to mechanically stabilize VLA-4-VCAM-1 bonds, we used the Lck-deficient cell line, JCAM1.6, which expresses normal levels of VLA-4 but is defective in constitutive Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous target proteins, including paxillin (32Ostergaard H.L. Lou O. Arendt C.W. Berg N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5692-5696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed to be completely abrogated in the Lck-deficient cells (Fig. 3A), supporting an exclusive role for the Lck kinase in this phosphorylation. The adhesiveness of VLA-4 in these Lck-deficient cells, although lower than in WT cells (28Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Winter E. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Yednock T. Yablonski D. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13891-13901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was still highly sensitive to knockdown of paxillin (Fig. 3C), although the degree of paxillin silencing in these cells was lower than in normal Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B versus Fig. 1A). Thus, even in the absence of Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, paxillin is still essential for optimal VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 under shear stress. Talin 1 Contributes to VLA-4 Adhesiveness under Shear Stress Conditions by Stabilizing VLA-4 at a High Affinity State—To address how talin 1 contributes to VLA-4 adhesiveness to VCAM-1 under shear stress conditions, we next analyzed the effect of siRNA-mediated silencing of talin 1, the exclusive talin member on T cells, on VLA-4-mediated cell attachments to VCAM-1 under shear flow. Talin 1 suppression (80%) (Fig. 4A) did not alter α4 and β1 expression (Fig. 4A) but reduced VLA-4 tether formation to both low and high VCAM-1 densities, with only minimal effect on tether formation to medium density VCAM-1 (Fig. 4B).

CD98, a heterodimeric transmembrane protein, physically associates with certain integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains (tails) via its heavy chain, CD98hc (SLC3A2), and loss of CD98hc impairs integrin signaling. Here we have used the lack of CD98hc interaction with the Drosophila integrin βPS tail for a homology scanning analysis that implicated the C-terminal 8 residues of β3 (Thr755-Thr802) in CD98hc binding. We then identified point mutations in the β3 C terminus (T755K and T758M) that abolish CD98hc association and a double mutation in the corresponding residues in the βPS tail (K839T,M842T), which resulted in gain of CD98hc interaction. Furthermore, the loss of function β3(T755K) mutation or the gain of function β3/βPS(K839T,M842T) led to a loss or gain of integrin-mediated cell spreading, respectively. Thus, we have identified critical integrin residues required for CD98hc interaction and in doing so have shown that CD98c interaction with the integrin β tail is required for its ability to mediate integrin signaling. These studies also provide new insights into how CD98hc may cooperate with other cytoplasmic domain binding proteins to modulate integrin functions and into the evolution of integrin signaling.

Integrins mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion to support the development and functioning of multicellular organisms (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In addition to mediating adhesion, these receptors are bona fide signaling receptors that regulate cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, and cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. These effects are achieved via signaling pathways including Rho GTPases and kinases (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar); the actions of these signaling pathways result in the cell spreading that follows adhesion to integrin ligands. Integrins are composed of non-covalently associated α and β subunits, the N terminus of each subunit is extracellular, and a single transmembrane domain separates the ∼700-1200-residue extracellular domain from a usually short (5-65 residue) cytoplasmic domain or tail (8Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of integrins play an essential role in integrin signaling by interacting with cytoplasmic proteins (9Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a genetic complementation strategy identified an interaction between a transmembrane protein, CD98, and the integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain (10Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar), suggesting that this interaction might also participate in integrin signaling.CD98 heterodimers, comprised of a heavy chain, CD98hc (SLC3A2, 4F2hc), and one of several light chains (11Verrey F.

The CD98hc intracellular domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with integrins and promotion of integrin signaling (12Fenczik C.A. Zent R. Dellos M. Calderwood D.A. Satriano J. Kelly C.

These data suggest that the CD98hc-integrin interaction is required for its capacity to mediate integrin signaling. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by fine mapping of the integrin residues required for binding to CD98hc. Authentic CD98hc orthologues are not evident in invertebrates (17Uinuk-Ool T. Mayer W.E. Sato A. Dongak R. Cooper M.D. Klein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and we report that an invertebrate β integrin cytoplasmic domain, Drosophila βPS, fails to bind mammalian CD98hc. We use this species difference and a “homology scanning” strategy to identify two residues in the integrinβ tail that control the binding specificity for CD98hc but have no effect on talin binding. Using loss of function and gain of function mutants at these residues, we find that CD98hc binding to integrin β tails is required for efficient adhesion-dependent cell spreading. Thus, we show that the interaction of CD98hc with the integrin β subunit tail mediates adhesive signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—The hybridoma cell line 4F2(C13) (anti-CD98) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The CD98 antibody was purified from ascites produced in pristine-primed BALB/c mice by protein A affinity chromatography. Mouse CD98hc-specific antibody (M20) and anti-FAK 2The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. antibody (C20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and talin antibody (clone 8d4) was from Sigma. An antibody specific for phosphorylated FAK Tyr576 was obtained from BIOSOURCE. Monoclonal antibody against human αIIbβ3 (D-57) has been described previously (18Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F.

Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were derived from CD98hc conditional homozygote embryos as described previously. 3Feral, C. C., Zijlstra, A., Tkachenko, E., Prager, G., Gardel, M. L., Slepak, M., and Ginsberg, M. H. (2007) J. Cell. Biol., in press. Briefly, exon 1, encoding the transmembrane domain of CD98hc, and exon 2 were targeted and flanked with lox P sites. Two homologous ES cell recombinant clones were injected into host blastocysts. Germ line transmission was obtained, and heterozygote animals were bred to obtained homozygotes CD98hcfl/fl mice. The CD98hc-/- MEFs were generated by infecting CD98hcfl/fl MEFs with Adeno-CRE encoding CRE recombinase. 3Feral, C. C., Zijlstra, A., Tkachenko, E., Prager, G., Gardel, M. L., Slepak, M., and Ginsberg, M. H. (2007) J. Cell. Biol., in press. MEFs were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), 1% HEPES (Invitrogen), 0.2% mercaptoethanol. Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO) expressing the polyoma large T antigen were transiently transfected with CD98hc, αIIbβ3, or its mutant using Nucleofector II device (AMAXA Biosystems). Similar expression levels were checked by flow cytometry as described below.Flow Cytometry—Analytical two color flow cytometry was performed as described previously (19O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Expression levels of transiently transfected CHO cells were assessed by biotinylated D-57 binding and 488 Alexa Flour-labeled streptavidin (Molecular Probes). CD98hc expression levels in MEF cells were measured by anti-mouse CD98hc (clone H202-141, Pharmingen) binding. Goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG was obtained from BioSource International and was used as secondary antibody for anti-CD98hc detection.DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—cDNA encoding integrin cytoplasmic domains joined to four heptad repeats were cloned into the modified pET-15 vector as described previously (20Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and were biotinylated in vivo as described (21Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29699-29707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The repeats form parallel coiled-coil dimers so that the tails are dimerized and parallel, thus, mimicking clustered integrins. CD98hc also binds to a heterodimeric construct formed with αIIb and β3 tails that mimic the cytoplasmic face of a single integrin (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Point mutations in β3 tails were performed utilizing the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) or, for the swap mutations between β3 and βPS cytoplasmic tails, with megaprimer polymerase chain reaction techniques. Recombinant expression in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and biotinylation of the avidin tag as well as purification of the recombinant products were done in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction (Novagen), with an additional purification step on a reverse phase C18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (Vydac). Polypeptide masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry and varied by less than 0.1% from those predicted by the desired sequence. Synthetic peptides used in the competition assays were synthesized on an ABI 430 peptide synthesizer and were 95% homogeneous as judged by a reverse phase C18 HPLC column (Vydac).Construction of β3 Mutants or Chimera—Point mutations in β3 or βPS were performed utilizing the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To generate β3/βPS chimera, whereby the cytoplasmic domain of β3 was replaced by βPS, a SphI restriction enzyme site was created via a silent mutation at nucleotide 1899 (C to A) of β3 cDNA sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. β3βPS and β3βPS(K839T,M842T) chimeras were generated by ligation of PCR-generated β3 transmembrane domain and βPS cytoplasmic domain fusion sequences into the wild type β3 expressing vector, CDHYG3A.SphI (23Partridge A.W.

The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm before supernatant was used for affinity chromatography.Integrin Tail Affinity Chromatography (HPLC)—HPLC was performed as described (20Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 mg of each recombinant integrin cytoplasmic domain dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8 (PN buffer), plus 0.2 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate was bound to 150 μl of immobilized Neutravidin™ beads (Pierce), 50% slurry at 4 °C overnight. Neutravidin beads were then washed 3 times in PN Buffer and 2 times in buffer A (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.8). Equal loading of Immobilized Neutravidin beads with recombinant proteins was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE profiles of SDS eluted proteins. Beads were added to cell lysates diluted in buffer A and protease inhibitors and incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed 5 times with buffer A. 75 μl of 2× reducing SDS-sample buffer was added to the beads, and the mixture was heated 95 °C for 10 min. After 14,000 rpm centrifugation in a tabletop microcentrifuge (Beckman, GS15R), the supernatant was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Spreading Assays—Assays of cell spreading on fibrinogen or fibronectin were performed as described previously (24Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen or fibronectin in a coating buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, at 4 °C overnight) and blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were detached, washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in the same medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml. The cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were permitted to attach at 37 °C and incubated for the times indicated. Unattached cells were washed away with phosphate-buffered saline, attached cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 30 min at room temperature, washed with distilled water 3 times, and observed with bright field microscopy. Photographic images were acquired with FAST1394 CCD. Cells that exhibited flattening and the presence of lamellipodia under microscope examination were scored as spreading cells. Cell area was assessed by Image J 1.32 software (National Institutes of Health).RESULTSCD98hc Is Required for αIIbβ3 Integrin-mediated Cell Spreading—Previous studies with CD98hc-deficient embryonic stem cells suggested that CD98hc is important in β1 integrin signaling (16Feral C.C. Nishiya N. Fenczik C.A. Stuhlmann H. Slepak M. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 102: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As a further test of that idea, we used conditional null CD98fl/fl MEF and examined the effect of in vitro deletion of CD98hc by adenovirus-mediated infection of Cre recombinase (Fig. 1A). As expected, deletion of CD98hc blocked α5β1 integrin-mediated cell spreading on fibronectin, a consequence of β1 integrin signaling (Fig. 1, B and C). Having confirmed that acute deletion of CD98hc in MEFs had similar effects to those observed in ES cells, we next sought to establish a system to enable mapping of CD98hc binding sequences in integrin β cytoplasmic domains. Previous studies showed that CD98hc-expressing and CD98hc-deficient MEFs express no β3 integrins. 4G. W. Prager, C. C. Féral, C. Kim, J. Han, and M. H. Ginsberg, unpublished results. Because β3 but not β1 integrins mediate cell attachment to fibrinogen in most cell types, the platelet integrin can be used as a model to analyze structural requirements for integrin signaling in these cells (25Ylanne J. Chen Y-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We expressed recombinant integrin αIIbβ3 in these MEFs (Fig. 1D) and αIIbβ3-transfected cells, but not untransfected cells, adhered to fibrinogen (not shown). Because, CD98hc interacts with the β3 cytoplasmic domain (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Ginsberg, unpublished results. we next examined the role of CD98hc in αIIbβ3-mediated cell spreading. The CD98hc null MEFs attached to fibrinogen but failed to spread; in contrast, the floxed CD98hc parental cells spread extensively (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, we have established a system in which cell spreading is mediated by a recombinant integrin (αIIbβ3) and is CD98hc-dependent.Mapping Integrin Sequences Required for CD98hc Binding—Having established an assay for CD98hc-dependent integrin signaling in a cell in which we could manipulate integrin sequences, we next sought a CD98hc non-binding integrin for a homology scanning analysis similar to that used to map the filamin binding sequence in integrin β tails (26Calderwood D.A. Huttenlocher A. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 12: 1060-1068Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We first compared the β3 tail sequence to that of β7 and β1D, two β tails that fail to bind CD98hc (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and noted substantial divergence from β3 sequence. We also examined βPS from Drosophila melanogaster because the cytoplasmic tail of βPS is 68% identical with the human β3 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2A) and because Drosophila were reported to lack an authentic CD98hc orthologue (17Uinuk-Ool T. Mayer W.E. Sato A. Dongak R. Cooper M.D. Klein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because the complete genome of D. melanogaster is now available, we performed a BLAST search with the human CD98hc sequence and identified maltase H precursor (P07190), which is similar to a region of the CD98hc extracellular domain but does not appear to have a transmembrane domain and, thus, does not appear to be a true orthologue. Similarly, both UniProtKB/TrEMBL and Homologene databases list only vertebrate CD98hc orthologues. Consistent with a lack of a CD98hc orthologue in Drosophila, the βPS cytoplasmic domain failed to bind human CD98hc (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mammalian talin, a critical integrin cytoplasmic domain-binding protein in all species so far examined (27Brown N.H. Gregory S.L. Rickoll W.L. Fessler L.I. Prout M. White R.A.

Thus, CD98hc binds to β3 but not to the similar βPS cytoplasmic domain.FIGURE 2CD98hc binds to the β3 cytoplasmic tails but not to βPS cytoplasmic tail. A, alignment of the amino acid sequences of human β3 and D. melanogaster βPS integrin cytoplasmic tails. B, affinity chromatography. Immobilized Neutravidin beads were loaded with β3(HisAvi-B3), a β3 with randomized amino acid sequence(HisAvi-B3rand) or βPS (HisAviBPS) tail proteins. Bound proteins from CD98hc+/+ or CD98hc-deficient MEF cell lysates were separated on 4-20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted either with antibodies specific for CD98hc or talin. Lysates represents 10% of the starting cell lysate from each affinity purification experiment. Loading of each tail protein was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining (Loading). Depicted is a representative result from five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next studied the effect of exchanges between β3 and βPS on CD98hc binding. CD98hc binds to β1A but not to its splice variant, β1D (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The main differences between these two integrins are in the C-terminal amino acids. Therefore, we hypothesized that the β sequences important for CD98hc binding are located within the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain of β3. Swapping the C-terminal eight amino acids between β3 and βPS switched CD98hc binding phenotypes (Fig. 3A). βPS tail chimeras containing the last eight amino acids of β3 (βPS (839-846 β3)) bound CD98hc to a similar extent as full-length β3. Conversely, a β3 tail containing the C-terminal eight amino acids of βPS (β3 (755-762 βPS)) lost its capacity to bind CD98hc (Fig. 3B). Thus, these exchanges indicate that residues 755-762 of the β3 tail are critical for high affinity CD98hc binding.FIGURE 3CD98hc binding involves the C terminus of β3. A, amino acid sequences of C-terminal swapmutations of β3 with the βPS cytoplasmic domain. B, affinity chromatography using lysate of MEFs was performed as described in Fig. 2, and bound CD98hc was detected by immunoblotting. Equivalent loading of the recombinant β tails was verified by Coomassie Blue staining. CD98hc binds to β3 and to βPS chimeras containing the C-terminal eight amino acids of β3(βPS (839-846 β3)). C, MEF lysates were added to immobilized Neutravidin beads loaded with β3-cytoplasmic tail proteins in the absence or presence of β3 tail synthetic peptides. Bound CD98hc was detected by SDS-PAGE separation and immunoblotting. Bound CD98hc was quantified by densitometry, and these values were used to calculate percentage inhibition = 100 × (I0 -I)/I0, where I0 = intensity in the absence of a competitor, and I = intensity in the presence of competitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next employed a competitive inhibition approach to test the importance of the C terminus of the integrin β subunit in CD98hc binding. Synthetic peptides that spanned either the C-terminal or the N-terminal region of the β3 cytoplasmic domain were used to compete for CD98hc binding to the full-length β3 tail. The C-terminal peptide (β3 (748-762)) competed for CD98hc binding with a calculated IC50 of ∼300 μm (Fig. 3C). In sharp contrast, the N-terminal peptide, β3 (721-738), had no effect at concentrations up to 10 mm. The difference in activity of these two peptides is not likely to be due to charge effects since they have similar calculated (ExPASy ProtParam) isoelectric points (β3 (748-762) pI = 8.59; β3 (721-738) pI = 8.50). Thus, these data together with the data obtained from the homology exchange mutants suggest that the C-terminal region of the β3 cytoplasmic domain binds to CD98hc.Amino Acid Residues Essential for CD98hc Interaction—To assess the role of individual amino acid residues within the β3 cytoplasmic domain that are important for CD98hc binding, we generated point-mutated β-tail proteins. Because swapping the C-terminal eight amino acids between β3 and βPS led to a reversal in CD98hc binding, we studied differences in the sequence of the C-terminal end. Truncation of the three C-terminal amino acids of β1A does not influence CD98hc binding, whereas deleting the last seven residues abolishes it (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that β3 Arg760-Thr762 is dispensable for CD98hc binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, CD98hc bound to a three-residue truncation of β3 (β3(760X)) (Fig. 4A). A comparison of the C-terminal sequences of CD98hc binding integrins (β3 or β1A) with non-CD98hc binding β integrins (β1D or βPS) (Fig. 4B) suggested that Thr755 and Thr758 might be important in CD98hc binding and led us to examine the effect of substituting βPS residues into these positions in β3. Mutation of Thr755 to Lys755 or Thr758 to Met758 in β3 each reduced CD98hc binding to near background levels. In contrast, talin binding to the mutated cytoplasmic tails was not reduced (Fig. 4A), confirming their functionality. Thus, Thr755 and Thr758 are important for CD98hc binding to the β3 cytoplasmic domain.FIGURE 4Point mutations in the β3 and β1A cytoplasmic tails that inhibit CD98hc association. A, β3(T755K) or β3(T758K) mutations disrupt CD98hc interaction. Affinity chromatography was performed as described in Fig. 2. Lysate represents 10% of the starting lysate. B, a single amino acid mutation in β1A (V796K), which corresponds to β3 Thr755, disrupts CD98hc interaction with β1A cytoplasmic tail. As reported previously (22Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), CD98hc interacts with β1A but not with β1D. Talin binding to β tails is not disrupted by any of these mutations. Loading of each tail was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining (Loading).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The foregoing experiments showed that substitution of β3 Thr755 to Lys755 resulted in a loss of CD98hc binding to the β3 tail. This residue is a Val in β1A, an integrin that interacts with CD98hc, suggesting that a Thr is not absolutely required in this position for CD98 binding. Furthermore, these data suggest a Lys is not permitted in this position for retention of CD98 binding; indeed, a Lys substitution for Val796 in β1A, which corresponds to the Thr755 position in β3, led to a decrease in CD98hc binding with no effect on talin binding (Fig. 4B).Two Threonine Substitutions in βPS Results in CD98hc Binding—The experiments described above identify two amino acids within the C-terminal region of β3 involved in CD98hc binding (Thr755 and Thr758). The corresponding residues in βPS are a Lys839 and Met842. Changing both of these residues in βPS cytoplasmic domain to Thr resulted in a dramatic gain of CD98hc binding function in βPS (K839T,M842T) (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the loss of CD98hc when either Thr755 or Thr758 in integrin β3 tail was mutated (see Fig. 4), single Thr substitutions at either at Lys839 or at Met842 resulted in no increase of CD98hc binding (Fig. 5A). Thus, introducing Thr at position 839 and 842 into βPS resulted in a gain of CD98hc binding function.FIGURE 5βPS(K83"

We compared the signal transduction capabilities of CB1 with those of an L7.60F mutation and an L7.60I mutation that mimics the CB2 sequence. The two mutant receptors differed from wild type (WT) in their ability to regulate G-proteins in the [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay. The L7.60F receptor exhibited attenuated stimulation by agonists WIN-55,212-2 and CP-55,940 but not HU-210, whereas the L7.60I receptor exhibited impaired stimulation by all agonists tested as well as by the inverse agonist rimonabant. The mutants internalized more rapidly than WT receptors but could equally sequester G-proteins from the somatostatin receptor. Both the time course and maximal N-type Ca2+ current inhibition by WIN-55,212-2 were reduced in the mutants. Reconstitution experiments with pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins revealed loss of coupling to Gαi3 but not Gα0A in the L7.60I mutant, whereas the reduction in the time course for the L7.60F mutant was governed by Gαi3. Furthermore, Gαi3 but not Gα0A enhanced basal facilitation ratio, suggesting that Gαi3 is responsible for CB1 tonic activity.

Photoactivation of rhodopsin has been associated with movement of H8 as detected in cysteine cross-linking studies and in nitroxide spin label studies (11Altenbach C. Klein-Seetharaman J. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15493-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The highly conserved NPXXY(X)5,6F motif of rhodopsin has been proposed to provide structural constraints via the aromatic interaction of Y7.53(306) in the NPXXY motif of TMH7 to F7.60(313) in H8, which rearrange in response to photo-isomerization (12Fritze O.

This same interaction has been shown to be important for the switching of the 5HT-2C receptor among multiple active and inactive conformations (13Prioleau C. Visiers I. Ebersole B.J. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36577-36584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that the H8 domain plays a role in docking specific G-protein subunits and in the transition between conformational states. The CB1 receptor possesses a defined intracellular helical segment (H8 D7.59(403) to P7.69(413)), as predicted by Fourier transform analysis of the primary sequence of the CB1 receptor (14Bramblett R.D. Panu A.M. Ballesteros J.A. Reggio P.H. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Significant helicity was demonstrated when the CB1 401–417 peptide was present in an anionic micelle environment (SDS or phosphatidic acid) but not in aqueous media (15Mukhopadhyay S. Cowsik S. Lynn A. Welsh W. Howlett A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3447-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent NMR and circular dichroism studies also revealed significant α-helical structure of synthetic peptides in dodecyl phosphocholine micelles (16Choi G. Guo J. Makriyannis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1668: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Xie X.Q. Chen J.Z. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CB1 receptor differs from the NPXXY(X)5,6F motif, as amino acid residue 7.60(404) is a Leu in CB1. We explored the ramifications of this deviation from the highly conserved NPXXY(X)5,6F motif, by comparing the signal transduction capabilities of the CB1 wild-type with those of an L7.60F mutation which mimics the rhodopsin motif, and an L7.60I mutation which mimics the homologous CB2 receptor sequence. We report here that the CB1 receptor signal transduction profiles are considerably altered by substitution of the amino acid residue at position 7.60 of H8. Activation of G-proteins by agonists was attenuated in both mutants stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Only the L7.60I mutant showed a loss of response to the inverse agonist rimonabant. Furthermore, L7.60 plays a crucial role in modulating the rate of agonist-induced receptor internalization. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that the CB1 receptor association with Gαi3 was abrogated in both mutant receptors, whereas the association with Gαi1 and Gαi2 remained intact. In superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, N-type Ca2+ current inhibition by WIN-55,212-2 and the time to reach 90% of this inhibition was significantly reduced by both mutants. In addition, reconstitution experiments with pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins indicate that Gαi3 is responsible for CB1 tonic activity. Multiple nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of WT CB1, and the L7.60F and L7.60I mutants, in a fully hydrated POPC phospholipid bilayer environment, suggest that the packing of H8 is different in each. Hence, the differential coupling to G-proteins and the alterations in the rate of internalization seen with these mutants may result from these variations in the H8 structure.

Binding was initiated by the addition of 10 μg (for agonist experiments) or 20 μg (for antagonist experiments) of membrane protein into glass tubes containing 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, 10 μm GDP in GTPγS binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled GTPγS. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells expressing WT, L7.60F, or L7.60I receptors were homogenized in a glass homogenizer in ice-cold buffer composed of 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1.04 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin). After sedimentation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclear debris, the supernatant was collected and sedimented at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet (P2 membrane fraction) was then solubilized using CHAPS hydrate detergent according to the method described by Houston and Howlett (2Houston D.B. Howlett A.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of the CB1 receptor and associated proteins from the detergent-solubilized extract was performed as described previously (4Mukhopadhyay S. McIntosh H. Houston D. Howlett A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 162-170PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mukhopadhyay S. Howlett A.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to PAGE on 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide, 6 m urea gels. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from the gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was carried out in 10 mm CAPS buffer with 0.01% SDS (pH 11), for 12 h (0–4 °C) at 20 V using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell. Blots were incubated with affinity-purified anti-CB1-1–14) combined with the indicated anti-Gαi antibody in blocking buffer for 3 h at room temperature (4Mukhopadhyay S. McIntosh H. Houston D. Howlett A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 162-170PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mukhopadhyay S. Howlett A.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Neuron Preparation and Electrophysiological Recording of Ca2+ Currents—Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons were isolated from adult male Wistar rats as described previously (21Nie J. Lewis D.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8758-8764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, isolated superior cervical ganglia were enzymatically digested and plated onto poly-l-lysine precoated 35-mm dishes in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After 3–4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 plasmid cDNA (100 ng/μl) encoding hCB1, hCB1-L7.60I or hCB1-L7.60F was microinjected directly into the nucleus of single SCG neurons. The pEGFP-N1 plasmid (10 ng/μl) encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein was used as a co-injection marker (21Nie J. Lewis D.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8758-8764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For G-protein reconstitution experiments, pertussis toxin-insensitive GαoA(C351G) and Gαi3(C351G) subunits were each microinjected with β1 and γ2 at a ratio (mass) of 0.5:1.25:1.25. Neurons were treated overnight with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX). Ca2+ currents were recorded from neurons at room temperature 16–20 h after injection using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (21Nie J. Lewis D.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8758-8764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ currents were elicited by voltage steps from −80 mV to +5 mV. A double-pulse protocol consisting of two 25-ms steps to +5 mV was used to elicit Ca2+ currents. The second voltage step to +5 mV was preceded by a 50-ms voltage step to +80 mV in order to remove the voltage-dependent, G-protein-mediated inhibition of the Ca2+ channels. Current amplitudes were measured isochronally as the average current between 10 and 11.8 ms after the voltage step to +5 mV. To isolate Ca2+ currents for whole-cell recording, cells were bathed in external and internal solutions as described previously (21Nie J. Lewis D.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8758-8764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were superfused with external solution or with external solution containing d-Trp8 somatosatin-14 or WIN-55,212-2 using the SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step device (Warner Instruments). Data and Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E. Data from radioligand binding and GTPγS assays were analyzed, and curves were generated through nonlinear regression analyses (or nonlinear analysis, when appropriate) with Prism software (Prism GraphPad, San Diego). Kd, Bmax, Emax, and EC50 values were calculated. Statistical analysis of variance (one-way analysis of variance) and the Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc tests were performed for Bmax and Emax with GraphPad Prism. Two-tailed Student's t tests were performed on the log Kd values, log EC50 values ±95% confidence limits and for analyses of Ca2+ currents. p values <0.05 were defined as statistically significant. Amino Acid Numbering System—The amino acid numbering scheme proposed by Ballesteros and co-workers (14Bramblett R.D. Panu A.M. Ballesteros J.A. Reggio P.H. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used. Sequence numbers used are human CB1 sequence numbers unless otherwise noted (14Bramblett R.D. Panu A.M. Ballesteros J.A. Reggio P.H. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Residues in the intracellular extension of TMH7 (H8) are numbered here as if they are part of TMH7 following the literature precedent set by Prioleau et al. (13Prioleau C. Visiers I. Ebersole B.J. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36577-36584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). WT CB1 Receptor Model Construction—Using the Loopy program within the protein structure modeling suite, Jackal 1.5 (J. Z. Xiang and B. Honig, Columbia University), extracellular (EC-1 His181–Ser185, EC-2 Cys257–Glu273, and EC-3 Gly369–Lys376) and intracellular loops (IC-1 Ser146–Arg150, IC-2 Pro221–Val228, and IC-3 Ala301–Pro332) as well as portions of the N and C termini were added to our previously built transmembrane helix (TMH) bundle model of the CB1 receptor (65Hurst D. Umijiego U. Lynch D. Seltzman H. Hyatt H. Roche M. McAllister S.D. Fleischer D. Kapur A. Abood M.E. Shi S. Jones J. Lewis D. Reggio P.H. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 5969-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Modeler program was then used to refine loop structures (22Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). The chosen loop configurations for the final bundle model were those that produced a low value of the modeler objective function. Moreover, because of their close spatial proximity, the EC1 and EC3 loops were run concurrently. EC-2 Loop—One of the significant sequence divergences between rhodopsin and CB1 is in the second extracellular (EC-2) loop region. This loop in CB1 is shorter than in rhodopsin and is missing the conserved disulfide bridge between the cysteine in EC-2 and C3.25 in TMH 3 of rhodopsin. Instead, there is a Cys residue at the extracellular end of TMH4 in CB1 and a Cys near the middle of the EC-2 loop that experiments suggest may form a disulfide bridge (24Fay J.F. Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8757-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, the position of the EC-2 loop with respect to the binding site crevice in CB1 around TMHs 3–4–5 is likely to be quite different from that in rhodopsin. For this reason, the refined EC-2 loop (Cys257–Glu273) structure built by Modeler was removed, and the conformation of this loop was calculated using the Biased Scaled Collective Variable in Monte Carlo method (25Barnett-Norris J.

Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Gan H.H. Computational Methods for Macromolecules: Challenges and Applications. 24. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar). The aqueous environment of the EC-2 loop was modeled during these calculations with a recently developed implicit solvent model that is based on a screened Coulomb potential formulation (the SCP-ISM) (27Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6490-6498Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The EC-2 loop was modeled with an internal C4.66(257)-Cys264 disulfide bridge based upon mutation results from the Farrens laboratory (see Ref. 24Fay J.F. Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8757-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which show that these two cysteines are required for high level expression and receptor function. IC-3 Loop—The CB1 IC-3 loop is much longer than the corresponding sequence in rhodopsin. NMR experiments have been performed on a peptide fragment comprised of the CB1 sequence span from the intracellular end of TMH5 to the intracellular end of TMH6 in micelles (29Ulfers A.L. McMurry J.L. Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. Mierke D.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2526-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This study suggested that part of the IC-3 loop is α-helical. This region occurs after the intracellular end of TMH5 (K5.64(300)) and consists of a short α-helical segment from Ala301 to Arg307, followed by an elbow region (Arg307–Ile309) and an α-helical segment (Gln310–Ser316) up to a Ile–Ile–Ile (Ile317–Ile319) in IC-3. Based on these results, we replaced the initial Modeler-built IC-3 loop with this α-helix-elbow-α-helix region, and then the rest of IC-3 loop (Ile317–Pro332) was re-built and optimized using Modeler. N and C Termini—The N and C termini were added last to the model. The N terminus of CB1 is 111 residues in length. A shorter portion of this terminus from Asn95 to Asn112 (NIQC-GENFMDIECFMVLN) was added to the CB1 model using Modeler. A C-terminal fragment Ser414–Gly427 (SCEGTAQ-PLDNS-MG), which contains a putative palmitoylation site at Cys415 (24Fay J.F. Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8757-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was also added using Modeler, and Cys415 was palmitoylated. Embedding the CB1 Receptor Model in a Lipid Bilayer—To build a receptor plus phospholipid bilayer system, we used a snapshot from a previous simulation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC). In these previous calculations, a patch of hydrated POPC was equilibrated for 3 ns at 310 K. The system was constructed using the VMD membrane and solvate plug-ins. The constant area/pressure NPAT ensemble was employed using a value of 68.0 Å2 as set via the VMD plug-in. This compares to earlier calculated values of 65.5 Å2 (30Shepherd C.M. Vogel H.J. Tieleman D.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to 72.2 Å2 (31Huber T. Rajamoorthi K. Kurze V.F. Beyer K. Brown M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) at 300 K. Experimental values ranged from 63–66 Å2 and depended on the temperature (32Hyslop P.A. Morel B. Sauerheber R.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1025-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Konig B. Dietrich U. Klose G. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 525-532Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Smaby J.M. Momsen M.M.

The CB1 receptor model (including all extracellular and intracellular loops) was positioned in the bilayer such that TMH4 was perpendicular to the bilayer surface, and the ends of the helices were placed approximately at the water-lipid interface. Water and POPC molecules that overlapped with the protein were removed. The remaining system contained 240 POPC molecules, 19,737 water molecules, the CB1 receptor, and 11 chloride ions, the latter of which were added to achieve charge neutrality for this system, for a total of 96,074 atoms.

https://openalex.org/W1994230928,"Polo-like kinases control multiple events during cell division, including mitotic entry, centrosome organization, spindle formation, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Their roles during cytokinesis, however, are not well understood because the requirement of these kinases during early stages of mitosis complicates the study of their functions after anaphase onset.We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamics of Polo::GFP in Drosophila tissue culture cells during mitosis. After anaphase onset, Polo::GFP concentrated at the spindle midzone, but also diffused along the entire length of the central spindle. Using RNA interference we demonstrate that the microtubule-associated proteins Feo and Klp3A are required for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone, but not the kinesin Pavarotti as previously thought. Moreover, we show that Feo and Klp3A form a complex and that Polo co-localizes with both proteins during cytokinesis.Our results reveal that the Feo/Klp3A complex is necessary for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone. A similar finding has also been recently reported in mammalian cells [1], suggesting that this basic mechanism has been conserved during evolution, albeit with some differences. Finally, since cleavage furrow formation and ingression are unaffected following feo RNAi, our data imply that Polo recruitment to the central spindle is not required for furrowing, but some other aspect of cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2126268158,"In fission yeast, orthologs of mammalian SREBP and Scap, called Sre1 and Scp1, monitor oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis as a measure of cellular oxygen supply. Under low oxygen conditions, sterol synthesis is inhibited, and Sre1 cleavage is activated. However, the sterol signal for Sre1 activation is unknown. In this study, we characterized the sterol signal for Sre1 activation using a combination of Sre1 cleavage assays and gas chromatography sterol analysis. We find that Sre1 activation is regulated by levels of the 4-methyl sterols 24-methylene lanosterol and 4,4-dimethylfecosterol under conditions of low oxygen and cell stress. Both increases and decreases in the level of these ergosterol pathway intermediates induce Sre1 proteolysis in a Scp1-dependent manner. The SREBP ortholog in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is also activated by high levels of 4-methyl sterols, suggesting that this signal for SREBP activation is conserved among unicellular eukaryotes. Finally, we provide evidence that the sterol-sensing domain of Scp1 is important for regulating Sre1 proteolysis. The conserved mutations Y247C, L264F, and D392N in Scp1 that render Scap insensitive to sterols cause constitutive Sre1 activation. These findings indicate that unlike Scap, fission yeast Scp1 responds to 4-methyl sterols and thus shares properties with mammalian HMG-CoA reductase, a sterol-sensing domain protein whose degradation is regulated by the 4-methyl sterol lanosterol.

Lipid homeostasis in mammals is regulated at the transcriptional level by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), 4The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; Scap, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; Insig, insulin-induced gene; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; bHLH-zip, basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper; SSD, sterol-sensing domain; EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium; HA, hemagglutinin; FID, flame ionization detector; YES, yeast extract plus supplements; Hif-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; NPC1, Niemann-Pick type C1; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. a family of ER membrane-bound transcription factors (1Goldstein J.L.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). SREBPs control expression of over 30 genes required for low density lipoprotein uptake and synthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol (3Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). SREBP contains two transmembrane segments and is inserted into the ER membrane in a hairpin fashion such that the N and C termini are in the cytosol. The N terminus of SREBP is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-zip) transcription factor. The C terminus of SREBP binds SREBP cleavage activating protein (Scap), an ER membrane protein required for the function of SREBP. SREBP transcriptional activity is controlled by cellular cholesterol concentration through a negative feedback system. In cells with high levels of cholesterol, the SREBP-Scap complex is retained in the ER in an inactive state. ER retention is mediated by an interaction of Scap with the ER resident protein Insig (4Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). A drop in cholesterol levels disrupts the binding of Scap and Insig, facilitating ER exit of SREBP-Scap and transport to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, SREBP is activated by two proteolytic cleavage events mediated by the Site-1 and Site-2 proteases (5Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage, the N-terminal bHLH-zip domain of SREBP is released from the membrane and enters the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes required for lipid homeostasis. The sterol-sensing ability of the SREBP pathway is mediated by Scap, a polytopic ER membrane protein. Scap consists of 8 transmembrane segments and a C-terminal cytosolic domain that binds to SREBP (1Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Transmembrane segments 2-6 of Scap comprise the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that regulates SREBP activation in response to sterol levels (6Hua X.X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified three mutations in the SSD (Y298C, L315F, and D443N) that each render Scap insensitive to sterol levels and abolish Insig binding, causing constitutive ER exit and proteolytic activation of SREBP (7Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although these residues are important for Scap function, the exact mechanism by which Scap measures cellular sterol content is unclear. Recent studies suggest that cholesterol binds directly to the SSD of Scap and induces a conformational change in the protein that enhances Insig binding and ER retention of SREBP-Scap (8Brown A.J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory has characterized orthologs of SREBP and Scap, named Sre1 and Scp1, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that Sre1 and Scp1 function in an oxygen sensing pathway that monitors sterol synthesis as an indirect measure of cellular oxygen availability. Under oxygen-replete conditions, oxygen-dependent synthesis of the fungal sterol ergosterol is high, and Sre1 is inactive. When oxygen becomes limiting, ergosterol synthesis is inhibited, leading to rapid proteolytic activation of Sre1 in a Scp1-dependent manner (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Following proteolysis, the soluble N-terminal bHLH-zip domain of Sre1 enters the nucleus and directly activates transcription of genes required for oxygen consumptive pathways including ergosterol, heme, sphin-golipid, and ubiquinone biosynthesis (12Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Activation of genes in these pathways ensures cellular survival under low oxygen conditions as both sre1+ and scp1+ are required for low oxygen growth. Our previous data suggest that like mammalian Scap, Scp1 is required for sterol sensing in fission yeast (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Sre1 is unstable in the absence of Scp1, and the activation of Sre1 under low oxygen requires Scp1. Additionally, the three residues required for Scap sterol sensing, Tyr298, Leu315, and Asp443, are all conserved in Scp1 (Tyr247, Leu264, and Asp392). Although Scp1 is likely the sterol sensor in fission yeast, the identity of the molecular signal for Sre1 activation is unknown. In this study, we characterize the sterol signal for Sre1 activation using a combination of Sre1 cleavage assays and gas chromatography sterol analysis. We find that Scp1-dependent activation of Sre1 is regulated by both an increase and decrease of 4-methyl sterol intermediates in the ergosterol synthetic pathway under conditions of low oxygen and cell stress. C. neoformans SREBP is also activated by increased 4-methyl sterols, suggesting that this signal for SREBP activation is conserved across phyla in fungal eukaryotes. Finally, we provide evidence that the SSD of Scp1 is important for sensing 4-methyl sterols as single mutations Y247C, L264F, and D392N all result in constitutive Sre1 activation. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of Scap-mediated sterol sensing and the regulation of lipid metabolism in eukaryotes.

Briefly, exponentially growing yeast (5 × 107 cells) were harvested by centrifugation, transferred to glass tubes, and subjected to methanolic saponification with 9 ml of methanol and 4.5 ml of 60% (w/v) KOH for 2 h at 75 °C after addition of 5 μg of cholesterol as a recovery standard. Non-saponifiable sterols were extracted with 4 ml of petroleum ether, evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended in 250 μl of heptane. 3 μl of each sample was injected in splitless mode using an automatic sampler onto an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-1 column and FID detector. Peak areas for each sterol were normalized to cholesterol peak area to correct for recovery. Spheroplasting—To spheroplast yeast for A23187 Sre1 cleavage assay, logarithmically growing yeast (7.5 × 107 cells) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer SP1 (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 40 mm EDTA, and 28.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 5.6) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer SP2 (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, and 5 mg/ml lysing enzymes, pH 5.6) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed again by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with buffer SP3 (1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and then resuspended in 7.5 ml of rich medium (YES) plus 1.2 m sorbitol prior to addition of Me2SO or A23187 for a Sre1 cleavage assay. Low Oxygen Increases 4-Methyl Sterols and Activates Sre1—Our previous studies indicated that Sre1 monitors oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis as a measure of cellular oxygen supply (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The ergosterol synthesis pathway requires 12 molecules of dioxygen for the production of each ergosterol molecule (Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Rosenfeld E. Beauvoit B. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1115-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Under low oxygen conditions, ergosterol synthesis decreases and Sre1 cleavage is activated. However, addition of ergosterol to cells grown under low oxygen does not suppress Sre1 activation (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that low oxygen Sre1 activation may be mediated by changes in ergosterol synthesis intermediates. To investigate this possibility, wild-type and sre1Δ cells were grown at 0.5% oxygen for increasing time, and samples were harvested for immunoblot and sterol analysis to determine if Sre1 activation correlated with changes in sterol intermediates. Antibody to the N terminus of Sre1 detected an accumulation of cleaved nuclear Sre1 by 1 h (Fig. 2, A, lane 2). Sre1 activation was maximal 4 h after shifting to low oxygen and then declined at 6 h.FIGURE 2Low oxygen causes 4-methyl sterol accumulation, ergosterol depletion, and Sre1 activation. Wild-type and sre1Δ yeast were grown in rich medium for the indicated time at 0.5% oxygen.

P and N denote the membrane-bound precursor and cleaved nuclear forms of Sre1, respectively. B-D, sterols extracted from 5 × 107 cells were analyzed by gas chromatography.

E, wild-type yeast containing either empty vector or plasmids expressing Myc-erg11 and HA-erg25 from the nmt promoter were grown in EMM for 20 h prior to growth in rich medium at 21% oxygen (atmospheric) or 0.5% oxygen for 2 h. Upper panel, total cell extracts (10 μg) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Sre1 IgG after treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Lower panels, total cell extracts (40 μg) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc IgG 9E10 or anti-HA-HRP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the same samples, we measured the relative quantities of squalene and downstream sterol species by gas chromatography (Fig. 1). This analysis revealed significant changes in only 3 sterol intermediates. Squalene levels were unchanged at 0.5% oxygen. Ergosterol levels in a wild-type strain decreased to a minimum at 2 h and then returned to normal t = 0 levels at 6 h (Fig. 2B). Paralleling Sre1 activation, the amount of 24-methylene lanosterol increased up to 4 h after a shift to low oxygen and returned to normal at 6 h, suggesting that the oxygen-dependent enzyme Erg11 is rate-limiting under these conditions (Fig. 2C). Low oxygen also decreased the levels of the downstream sterol intermediate 4,4-dimethylfecosterol, possibly due to Erg11 inhibition (Fig. 2D). Restoration of normal sterol composition at 6 h required Sre1 as sre1Δ cells had lower ergosterol and elevated 24-methylene lanosterol at each time point compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with a potential signaling role for 24-methylene lanosterol, overexpression of Myc-tagged Erg11 and HA-tagged Erg25, two oxygen-dependent enzymes required for the metabolism of 4-methyl sterols, suppressed Sre1 activation under low oxygen conditions (Fig. 2E). Thus, Sre1 activation in response to 0.5% oxygen correlated with increased levels of the 4-methyl sterol 24-methylene lanosterol and decreased ergosterol. Exogenous Lanosterol Activates Sre1—To test whether elevated levels of 4-methyl sterols are sufficient to activate Sre1, wild-type cells were incubated in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of lanosterol for 2 h. Immunoblot analysis revealed that lanosterol addition activated Sre1 cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition, activation of Sre1 by lanosterol required the sterol-sensing domain-containing protein Scp1 (data not shown). To determine the kinetics of Sre1 activation by lanosterol, wild-type cells were cultured in the presence of 60 μg/ml lanosterol for increasing amounts of time. As shown in Fig. 3B, Sre1 cleavage is maximally induced 30 min after addition of lanosterol, and activation is maintained over the length of the time course. Other sterols tested had no effect on Sre1 activation, including zymosterol, ergosterol, cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 19-hydroxycholesterol (data not shown). Importantly, sterol analysis revealed that ergosterol levels were unchanged 30 min after lanosterol addition (data not shown). These data suggest that an increase in 4-methyl sterols is sufficient to activate Sre1. Cell Stress Increases 4-Methyl Sterols and Activates Sre1—In addition to being activated by direct sterol depletion, mammalian SREBP is cleaved in response to cell stress-inducing agents such as thapsigargin, hypotonicity, and bacterial pore forming toxins (18Gurcel L. Abrami L. Girardin S. Tschopp J. van der Goot F.G. Cell. 2006; 126: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 19Lee J.N. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45257-45265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To test if Sre1 is activated in response to cell stress in fission yeast, wild-type cells containing an empty vector were cultured in the presence of 500 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for increasing amounts of time. Immunoblot analysis indicated that Sre1 was rapidly cleaved in response to H2O2, with activation occurring 10 min after H2O2 addition (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 1-4). Interestingly, sterol analysis under these conditions showed that H2O2 treatment caused an accumulation of 24-methylene lanosterol and 4,4-dimethylfecosterol, substrates for Erg11 and Erg25, respectively, and a minor decrease in ergosterol (Fig. 4, B-D, closed symbols). These data suggest that H2O2 treatment may inhibit the sterol synthesis enzymes Erg11 and Erg25, leading to an increase in 4-methyl sterols and Sre1 activation. To determine if H2O2-induced Sre1 activation requires 4-methyl sterol accumulation, we attempted to reduce the levels of these intermediates by overexpressing erg11+ and erg25+. We examined Sre1 cleavage after H2O2 treatment in a wild-type strain overexpressing Myc-tagged erg11+ and HA-tagged erg25+ from the strong nmt promoter. Immunoblot analysis showed that both enzymes were expressed at a constant level during the experiment (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Overexpression of erg11+ and erg25+ suppressed Sre1 activation in response to H2O2, indicating that Sre1 induction by H2O2 is sterol-dependent (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 4-8). Contrary to our expectation, sterol analysis revealed that cells overexpressing erg11+ and erg25+ had increased levels of ergosterol, 24-methylene lanosterol, and 4,4-dimethylfecosterol compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4, B-D, t = 0). However, the 4-methyl sterol to ergosterol ratio in this overexpression strain under untreated conditions was equal to that of the wild-type strain, suggesting that overall sterol synthesis was increased in this strain by an unknown mechanism (Fig. 4E). Upon addition of H2O2, the 4-methyl sterol to ergosterol ratio increased 3-fold in wild-type cells and was largely unchanged in the erg11+-erg25+ overexpressing cells (Fig. 4E). A small increase in this ratio was observed at 30 min in the erg11+-erg25+ overexpression strain, and this correlated with a slight increase in Sre1 cleavage at this time point (Fig. 4A, lane 8). Collectively, these data show that H2O2 activation of Sre1 is sterol-dependent and suggest that Sre1 responds to changes in the ratio of 4-methyl sterol to ergosterol in the cell. To examine Sre1 activation by other cell stresses, we analyzed Sre1 cleavage in wild-type cells after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. In mammalian cells, A23187 depletes ER calcium stores and has been shown to increase HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase transcript levels, known transcriptional targets of mammalian SREBP (20Wilkin D.J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2831-2836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate A23187 delivery, we removed the yeast cell wall by spheroplasting prior to treatment with the ionophore. Sre1 activation in response to inhibition of sterol synthesis was normal in yeast spheroplasts (data not shown). Treatment of wild-type cells for 4 h with 1 μm A23187 caused an accumulation of cleaved nuclear Sre1 compared with untreated and vehicle-treated (Me2SO) cells (Fig. 5A). A23187 addition appeared to inhibit Erg25, causing an accumulation of 4,4-dimethylfecosterol and a decrease in ergosterol (Fig. 5B). No significant change in 24-methylene lanosterol was observed. These data suggest that perturbing ER calcium homeostasis may disrupt the function of Erg25, leading to 4,4-dimethylfecosterol accumulation and activation of Sre1. 4-Methyl Sterol Activation of Sre1 Is Conserved in C. neoformans—Recent studies have identified orthologs of SREBP and Scap in the pathogenic basidiomycete C. neoformans, named Sre1p and Scp1p, respectively (13Chang Y.C. Bien C.M. Lee H. Espenshade P.J. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As in the ascomycete S. pombe, C. neoformans Sre1p is cleaved and activated by inhibition of sterol synthesis in a Scp1p-dependent manner. To determine if an increase in 4-methyl sterols is sufficient for Sre1p activation in this organism, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of lanosterol for 2 h. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody directed toward to the N terminus of Sre1p showed that lanosterol induced Sre1p cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Kinetic analysis of Sre1p activation with 10 μg/ml lanosterol showed Sre1p cleavage as early as 15 min after lanosterol addition with maximal activation by 90 min (Fig. 6B). No changes in ergosterol levels were observed at the time of Sre1 induction (data not shown). These results indicate that the sterol signal is conserved between fungal phyla and suggest that S. pombe Sre1-Scp1 and C. neoformans Sre1p-Scp1p respond to an alteration in 4-methyl sterol levels. Sre1 Responds to Both Increases and Decreases in 4-Methyl Sterols—Thusfar, we have provided evidence that an increase in 4-methyl sterols regulates Sre1 in fission yeast. Yet, in a previous study we demonstrated activation of Sre1 by compactin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 200 μm compactin for 8-h induced Sre1 activation (Fig. 7A, lane 2), but did not increase 4-methyl sterol levels (Fig. 7B). As expected, compactin treatment lowered the levels of all sterols, including ergosterol and 4-methyl sterols. Treatment of cells with 100 μm itraconazole, an Erg11 inhibitor, also activated Sre1 and decreased ergosterol levels, but resulted in the accumulation of 24-methylene lanosterol as expected. Taken together, these inhibitor results suggested that Sre1-Scp1 may respond to (1Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) either an increase or decrease in 4-methyl sterol levels or (2Espenshade P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) a decrease in ergosterol. To differentiate between these possibilities, we treated wild-type cells with a combination of 200 μm compactin and 100 μm itraconazole. This treatment inhibited sterol synthesis at two steps (HMG-CoA reductase and Erg11) and caused a depletion of ergosterol equal to that observed in cells treated with either compactin or itraconazole alone (Fig. 7B). However, because we inhibited HMG-CoA reductase and Erg11 simultaneously, the level of 24-methylene lanosterol in these cells was almost unchanged. Despite a decrease in ergosterol equal to that in cells treated with either compactin or itraconazole alone, Sre1 activation was suppressed by the combination treatment as evidenced by a decrease in the nuclear form of Sre1 and an increase in the Sre1 precursor (Fig. 7A). This result indicates that depletion of ergosterol is not sufficient for full Sre1 activation. Instead, these data suggest that Sre1 responds to either an increase (low oxygen, H2O2, A23187, itraconazole treatments) or a decrease (compactin treatment) in 4-methyl sterols. Scp1 Sterol-sensing Domain Is Required for Regulation of Sre1—SREBP activation in both mammals and yeast requires the sterol-sensing domain protein Scap/Scp1. Three single amino acid mutations in the SSD of Scap render the protein insensitive to sterols, abolish Insig binding and cause constitutive ER exit of Scap: Y298C, L315F, and D443N (7Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An alignment of the sterol-sensing domains of human Scap and S. pombe Scp1 is shown in Fig. 8A. Although the S. pombe Insig homolog Ins1 does not play a role in Sre1 regulation (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these three residues are all conserved in Scp1: Tyr247, Leu264, and Asp392.To investigate the function of these residues in Scp1 sterol sensing, we compared Sre1 cleavage levels in wild-type cells carrying an empty vector, overexpressing wild-type scp1+, scp1 Y247C, scp1 L264F, or scp1 D392N. All strains had equivalent sterol profiles (data not shown). High expression of wild-type Scp1 stabilized the Sre1 precursor, but did not increase Sre1 cleavage (Fig. 8B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, overexpression of Scp1 Y247C, Scp1 L264F, or Scp1 D392N stimulated Sre1 activation (Fig. 8B, lanes 3-5). The level of Scp1 in these strains was slightly variable but the differences in expression did not correlate with Sre1 activation (Fig. 8B, lower panel). These results suggest that as in mammalian Scap, each of these residues is required for the ability of Scp1 to sense sterols. In our previous studies, we characterized fission yeast SREBP and showed that it functions in an oxygen-sensing pathway that monitors sterol synthesis as an indirect measure of cellular oxygen availability (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although Sre1 responded to inhibition of sterol synthesis, the nature of the sterol signal for Sre1 activation was unclear. In this study, we show that the Sre1-Scp1 complex responds to levels of 4-methyl sterol intermediates in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence: 1) low oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and depletion of ER calcium increased 4-methyl sterol concentrations and activated Sre1 cleavage; 2) removal of 4-methyl sterol intermediates by overexpression of erg11+ and erg25+ suppressed Sre1 activation in cells grown under low oxygen or treated with H2O2 (Figs. 2E and 4A); 3) exogenous 4-methyl sterol activated Sre1 cleavage (Fig. 3); and 4) depletion of ergosterol alone was not sufficient for full Sre1 activation (Fig. 7). Our results suggest that the C-4 methyl group is responsible for Sre1 activation as addition of exogenous sterols lacking a C-4 methyl group, such as zymosterol, did not activate Sre1 (data not shown). It is possible that the C-14 methyl group of 24-methylene lanosterol also contributes to Sre1 activation. However, we consider this unlikely because 4,4-dimethylfecosterol lacks the C-14 methyl group and both 24-methylene lanosterol (Fig. 1, low oxygen treatment) and 4,4-dimethylfecosterol (Fig. 5, A23187 treatment) activated Sre1. Further evidence that Sre1-Scp1 responds to 4-methyl sterols comes from experiments in the distantly related basidiomycete C. neoformans. Similar to S. pombe, low oxygen and lanosterol addition activated C. neoformans Sre1p (Fig. 6) (13Chang Y.C. Bien C.M. Lee H. Espenshade P.J. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The conservation of this sterol signal in these organisms and the presence of SREBP homologs in other fungi suggest that 4-methyl sterols may be a conserved signal for SREBP activation among unicellular eukaryotes. Although our data suggest that 4-methyl sterols are a signal for Sre1 activation, further studies are required to understand the molecular mechanism of this activation. Sre1 activation is Scp1-dependent but we do not yet fully understand how Scp1 senses sterols. In mammals, it is thought that Scap monitors sterol levels through direct binding of cholesterol (10Radhakrishnan A. Sun L.P. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It is possible that like Scap, Scp1 binds directly to 4-methyl sterols. Alternatively, 4-methyl sterols may regulate the ability of another sterol, perhaps ergosterol, to bind to Scp1. A third possibility is that Scp1 may bind to two different sterols, allowing Scp1 to sense the 4-methyl sterol to ergosterol ratio in the cell. These latter models could help explain the apparent results from Fig. 7 in which both an increase and decrease in 4-methyl sterols activate Sre1. Future studies are required to distinguish among these possibilities. 4-Methyl sterols represent a new class of signal for oxygen-sensing. In mammals, one way oxygen levels are monitored is through the regulation of the hypoxic transcription factor Hif-1α by oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (21Masson N. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, heme levels are monitored as an indirect measure of oxygen availability by the transcriptional activator Hap1p and repressor Rox1p (22Kwast K.E. Lai L.C. Menda N. James D.T. II I Aref S. Burke P.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). While similar systems such as these may exist in fission yeast, our previous studies indicate that Sre1 is a principal regulator of low oxygen transcription and thus, 4-methyl sterols represent a new class of signal for oxygen sensing in eukaryotes (12Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Whether these sterols play an unrecognized role in oxygen sensing in other organisms is unknown. Indeed, 4-methyl sterols are ideally positioned to function as a signal for low oxygen. The 4-methyl sterols 24-methylene lanosterol and 4,4-dimethylfecosterol are substrates for the oxygen requiring enzymes Erg11 and Erg25 (Fig. 1), and removal of the 4-methyl groups in 24-methylene lanosterol requires 9 molecules of dioxygen. Under low oxygen, these reactions will be inhibited, leading to rapid accumulation of 4-methyl sterols. Erg11 and Erg25 are broadly conserved in eukaryotes, further supporting the idea that 4-methyl sterols may play an unrecognized role in oxygen sensing in other organisms. In addition to serving as a signal for low oxygen, our data suggest that 4-methyl sterols may function as a signal for cell stress. Treatment of fission yeast cells with H2O2 or the calcium ionophore A23187 caused an increase in 4-methyl sterols and Scp1-dependent activation of Sre1 (Figs. 4 and 5). Sre1 up-regulates erg11+ and erg25+ transcription, and Sre1 may serve to reduce the levels of these intermediates during cell stress. However, we cannot rule out additional functions for Sre1 or actions of 4-methyl sterols during cell stress. These results highlight an important link between sterol synthesis and cell stress that has been observed by others. A recent study demonstrated that accumulation of the 4-methyl sterol, lanosterol in mammalian cells activated the integrated stress response, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α, a critical regulator of translation initiation (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Khersonsky S. Marciniak S. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Javitt N. Chang Y.T. Ron D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian SREBP is activated by cell stress inducing agents, such as hypotonicity and thapsigargin which disrupts ER calcium homeostasis (19Lee J.N. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45257-45265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, the authors attributed the activation of SREBP to a stress-dependent decrease in Insig protein. However, in light of our current data, it is possible that thapsigargin and hypotonicity may inhibit cholesterol synthesis. If so, cell stress may activate SREBP in part by decreasing cellular cholesterol under these conditions. Collectively, these data highlight the interdependence between sterol synthesis and the cell stress response. Future studies are required to understand the cross talk between these two important physiological pathways. Our results have implications for the function of sterol sensing domains in both fission yeast and mammals. ER retention of the SREBP-Scap complex is regulated by the sterol-dependent binding of Scap to the ER resident protein Insig (1Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Three single amino acid mutations in the SSD render Scap unresponsive to sterols and block binding to Insig, resulting in constitutive ER exit and activation of SREBP (7Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these amino acids are required for sterol sensing, binding to Insig, or both activities. We examined the function of these three amino acids in Scp1. As in mammalian cells, single mutation of any of these conserved amino acids in Scp1 (Y247C, L264F, or D392N) also activated Sre1 in cells with normal sterol levels (Fig. 8). Interestingly, fission yeast Insig, named Ins1, is not required for sterol regulation of Sre1 (11Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that these three SSD residues play a conserved role in sterol sensing by Scap and are not only required for Insig binding. Identification of the sterol signal for Scp1 in fission yeast also allows us to draw comparisons between Scp1 and other SSD-containing proteins, such as HMG-CoA reductase, NPC1, and Patched (24Loewen C.J. Levine T.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12 (-R781): R779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of these, the function of the SSD in HMG-CoA reductase is the best understood. Recent studies have shown that HMG-CoA reductase is regulated by sterols through a negative feedback system that requires Insig (1Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). However, unlike Scap, Insig-mediated regulation of HMG-CoA reductase leads to its ubiquitinylation and degradation in the presence of sterols, not its retention. Recent studies have identified the 4-methyl sterol lanosterol as the physiological signal for Insig-mediated HMG-CoA reductase degradation (25Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, yeast Scp1 appears to possess properties of both Scap and HMG-CoA reductase. Scp1 binds to Sre1 and regulates Sre1 proteolysis in response to sterol levels. Indeed, conserved amino acids in Scp1 and Scap function to sense sterols in both proteins. However, like HMG-CoA reductase, Scp1 responds to 4-methyl sterols, suggesting that the SSD of mammalian HMG-CoA reductase and fission yeast Scp1 are functionally similar. In our study, we have shown that 4-methyl sterols activate Sre1 in response to low oxygen and cell stress. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that low oxygen and cell stress may be physiological regulators of mammalian HMG-CoA reductase in vivo. Future studies will focus on a more detailed analysis of fission yeast SSD proteins with the goal of advancing our understanding of sterol sensing and lipid homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2092024651,"Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus oncoprotein vFLIP K13 is a potent activator of NF-κB and plays a key role in viral pathogenesis. K13 contains a putative TRAF-interacting motif, which is reportedly required for its interaction with TRAF2. The K13-TRAF2 interaction is believed to be essential for the recruitment of K13 to the I-κB kinase (IKK) complex and for K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation. In addition, TRAF3 has been reported to be required for K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation. We have re-examined the role of the TRAFs in K13 signaling and report that mutations in the putative TRAF-interacting motif of K13 have no deleterious effect on its ability to interact with the IKK complex or activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, endogenously expressed TRAF2 and TRAF3 do not interact with K13 and play no role in K13-induced NF-κB activation or its interaction with the IKK complex. Finally, K13 does not activate the JNK pathway. Our results support a model in which K13 bypasses the upstream components of the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway and directly interacts with the IKK complex to selectively activate the NF-κB pathway without affecting the JNK pathway. Selective NF-κB activation by K13 might represent a novel strategy employed by the virus to promote latency.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is believed to play a major role in viral oncogenesis. The K13 protein contains two homologous copies of a Death Effector Domain (DED) that is also present in the prodomain of caspase 8 (also known as FLICE). Proteins with two DEDs have been discovered in other viruses as well and include MC159L and MC160L from the Molluscum contagiousum virus and E8 from the equine herpesvirus 2. These viral DED-containing proteins were originally believed to protect virally infected cells from death receptor-induced apoptosis by blocking the recruitment and/or activation of caspase 8/FLICE and, as such, were collectively referred to as viral FLICE inhibitory proteins or vFLIPs (3Thome M.

However, subsequent studies demonstrated that K13 is unique among the vFLIPs in possessing the ability to activate the NF-κB pathway (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L.

Interaction between vFLIPs K13, MC159L, and E8 and the proteins involved in NF-κB signaling pathway was initially characterized by us using transient transfection-based overexpression of various epitope-tagged proteins (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we reported that while all three vFLIPs could interact with TRAF1, TRAF2, RIP (receptor-interacting protein 1), and NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), only K13 interacted with the IKKs (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that the interaction of K13 with the IKK complex, which consists of IKK1, IKK2, and Nemo/IKKγ, may play a critical role in its ability to activate the NF-κB pathway (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed in a follow-up study, which utilized cells with near physiological levels of K13 and endogenously expressed IKK proteins, and demonstrated that K13 gets recruited to a 700-kDa IKK signalsome complex consisting of IKK1, IKK2, and Nemo, which possesses the ability to phosphorylate IκBα and activate the NF-κB pathway (5Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The functional involvement of IKK1, IKK2 and Nemo in K13-induced NF-κB activation was subsequently confirmed by genetic studies with mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient in these kinases (14Matta H. Sun Q. Moses G. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that the upstream kinases of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as RIP-1 and NIK, are dispensable for this process (14Matta H. Sun Q. Moses G. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The above results were independently confirmed by Field et al. (7Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) who isolated Nemo as a K13-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and further demonstrated an interaction between K13 and Nemo in in vitro using the GST pull-down assay and in vivo using mass spectroscopy. Taken together, these studies supported a model according to which K13 activates the NF-κB pathway by directly interacting with and activating the IKK complex, thereby bypassing the upstream components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as TRAFs, RIP, and NIK. This model was further supported by results showing that, unlike TRAFs, K13 does not activate the JNK pathway in 293 cells (10Sun Q. Matta H. Lu G. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Hood L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19211-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adaptor proteins have been shown to play an important role in the activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways by different members of the TNF receptor family and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) (16Dempsey P.W. Doyle S.E. He J.Q. Cheng G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The involvement of TRAFs in K13 signaling was examined in detail in a recent study, which reported the presence of a TRAF-interacting motif, PYQLT, in the second DED of K13 (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). K13 mutants with point substitutions of two conserved residues in this motif not only failed to interact with TRAF2 and Nemo but also showed a near complete loss of NF-κB reporter activity (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of TRAF2, but not other TRAF family members, disrupted the interaction between K13 and Nemo and significantly inhibited the endogenous NF-κB activity in a PEL cell line (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally TRAF3 was also found to play a key role in K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation, although it was not needed for mediating the interaction between K13 and Nemo (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, the above studies led to a new model of K13 signaling according to which K13 requires TRAF2 for its interaction with the IKK complex, and both TRAF2 and TRAF3 are required for K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Jarviluoma A. Ojala P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 140-158PubMed Google Scholar). Because the NF-κB and JNK pathways play opposing roles in the natural history of KSHV infection (19Brown H.J. Song M.J. Deng H. Wu T.-T. Cheng G. Sun R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Wang S.E. Wu F.Y. Chen H. Shamay M. Zheng Q. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4248-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the effects of K13 on these pathways and the underlying molecular interactions have important implications for our understanding of viral life cycle and for the development of targeted therapies against KSHV-associated malignancies. As such, in this study, we have carried out a detailed analysis of K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation and re-examined the role of TRAFs in these processes. Plasmids, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—Plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged K13 and HA-tagged TRAF2 have been described previously (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). K13-P93L, -Q95R, and -T97L mutant constructs were generated using the QuickSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the sequence confirmed by automated sequencing. Retroviral constructs containing C-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type K13 and mutants were generated in MSCV neo-based retroviral vector and used for infection as previously described (5Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines (BC-1, BC-3 and BCBL-1), and Namalwa (B-cell lymphoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Wild type and TRAF2–/– murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) were provided by Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh (21Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B.

Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) followed by selection with G418. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IKKα, IKKβ, Nemo/IKKγ, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and p65 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against FLAG and tubulin, control mouse IgG beads and FLAG beads were obtained from Sigma. Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells were transfected in a 24-well plate with various test plasmids along with an NF-κB luciferase reporter construction (75 ng/well) and a pRSV/LacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter construct (75 ng/well) as described previously (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 24–36 h later, and extracts were used for the measurement of firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to the β-galactosidase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. Transfection of MEF cells and measurement of luciferase activity was performed essentially as described previously (14Matta H. Sun Q. Moses G. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RNA Interference (RNAi)—siRNA oligos against TRAF2 and TRAF3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p65 and a control siRNAs have been described previously (22Sun Q. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides (80 nm) were transfected using calcium phosphate, as described previously (23Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton-X 100, and 1 EDTA-free mini-protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of FLAG (Sigma) or control mouse IgG beads precoated with a supersaturated casein solution. Beads were washed twice with buffer A, once with a high salt wash buffer (buffer A with 500 mm NaCl) and again with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by Western blot. For transient transfection based co-immunoprecipitation studies, 2 × 106 293T cells were plated in a 100-mm plate and co-transfected 18–24 h later with 1 μg/plate of each epitope-tagged construct along with 1 μg of a GFP-encoding plasmid (pEGFP) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed, and the co-immunoprecipitation assay was carried out as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To determine NF-κB activation, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (24Liu C. Okruzhnov Y. Li H. Nicholas J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10933-10940Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The bands obtained were quantified using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Structural and Functional Analyses of the TRAF2-interacting Motif—Guasparri et al. (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) recently used a computer model of the second DED of K13 and reported that the Pro93 and Gln95 residues in the putative TRAF2-binding motif (PYQLT) are exposed on the surface of the molecule and available for interaction with TRAFs. To confirm these results, we used comparative modeling to generate a three-dimensional model of the complete K13 molecule (i.e. containing both DED1 and DED2) based on the recently resolved structure of vFLIP MC159L from the M. contagiousum virus as a template (25Li F.Y. Jeffrey P.D. Yu J.W. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2960-2968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Yang J.K. Wang L. Zheng L. Wan F. Ahmed M. Lenardo M.J. Wu H. Mol Cell. 2005; 20: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the two tandem DEDs in the complete K13 form a dumbbell-shaped structure with each DED forming the weight at either end. We next mapped the location of the putative TRAF2-interacting motif onto our K13 model. Contrary to the expected surface location for a motif involved in intermolecular interactions, we discovered that the putative TRAF2-interacting motif of K13 is buried in the interface between its DED1 and DED2, and is not readily accessible for interaction with TRAF2 or other signaling proteins (Fig. 1, B–D). Although the structural analysis argued against a major role for the PYQLT motif in K13 interactions, a functional role of this motif in K13 signaling has been supported by previous mutagenesis studies (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, two K13 mutants, P93L and Q95R, which contain mutations of two conserved residues in the PYQLT motif, were reported to be severely impaired in their ability to activate an NF-κB reporter construct when expressed in the Namalwa cells, while the mutant T97L was found to retain this activity (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To resolve the discrepancy between our structural analysis and the previously reported functional studies, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate the P93L, Q95R, and T97L mutants and tested their ability to activate the NF-κB pathway using a luciferase-based reporter assay. Remarkably, we discovered that all three K13 mutants were comparable to the wild-type protein in their ability to activate an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct when transfected into 293T cells (Fig. 2A). Equivalent expression of the transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the FLAG epitope tag, which was present in the K13 constructs (Fig. 2B). It is conceivable that K13 utilizes different signaling intermediates to activate NF-κB in different cell types and, therefore, the role of TRAF2-interacting motif in K13 signaling is cell type-dependent. To rule out this possibility, we used retroviral-mediated gene transfer to stably express K13 in three B cell lymphoma-derived cell lines: Namalwa, BC-3, and BCBL-1. The latter two cell lines are derived from KSHV-infected PEL and represent physiologically relevant models to study K13 signaling. Retroviral-mediated expression of K13 led to constitutive NF-κB activation in all three cell lines as measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 2C). More importantly, the three K13 mutants, P93L, Q95R, and T97L, activated the NF-κB pathway to a similar extent as the wild-type protein in the three tested cell lines (Fig. 2C). Taken together with the studies using 293T cells, these results demonstrate that the mutations in the putative TRAF-interacting motif have no major impact on the ability of K13 to activate the NF-κB pathway. The impaired NF-κB activation by the P93L and Q95R mutants has been attributed to their reduced ability to interact with the IKK complex (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we re-examined the interaction of the wild-type and the mutant K13 proteins with the components of IKK complex using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Consistent with the published results (5Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we readily detected an interaction between stably expressed wild-type K13 and endogenously expressed IKK1/IKKα, IKK2/IKKβ, and Nemo/IKKγ in both Namalwa and BCBL-1 cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B). More importantly, the P93L and Q95R K13 mutant proteins interacted equally well with the different IKK subunits in the above assay (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together with the NF-κB luciferase reporter and gel-shift assays, these results demonstrate that the putative TRAF-interacting motif is not required for the interaction between K13 and the IKK complex, and is not functionally involved in K13-induced NF-κB activation. Interaction between K13 and TRAF2, −3, and −5—The studies in the preceding section ruled out the involvement of the putative TRAF-interacting motif in K13-induced NF-κB activation. However, it was still conceivable that K13 interacts with TRAF2 through a different motif and that this interaction is functionally important in NF-κB activation. To examine this possibility, we examined the K13 immunoprecipitates for the presence of TRAF2, −3, and −5 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, we failed to detect an interaction between wild-type K13 (and its mutants) and endogenously expressed TRAF2, −3, or −5 under the experimental conditions in which interaction between K13 and endogenously expressed IKK complex subunits (i.e. IKK1/2 and Nemo/IKKγ) was readily detectable. Similarly, no interaction between K13 and endogenously expressed TRAF2 or 3 was observed in the BC-3 cell line under conditions where interaction between K13 and Nemo was readily detected (Fig. 3C). It was conceivable that the lack of interaction between K13 and TRAF2 in the above studies was due to low-level expression of endogenous TRAF2 or due to stringent conditions used for cell lysis or co-immunoprecipitation or both. To rule out these possibilities we studied the interaction between transiently transfected FLAG-tagged K13 and HA-tagged TRAF2 in 293T cells. The transient transfection-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, however, are prone to the artifact of nonspecific aggregation of overexpressed proteins (27Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As such, in preliminary experiments we optimized the conditions of transfection and used the least amounts (1 μg/2 × 106 cells) of the two plasmids for transfection that yielded easily detectable amounts of the two epitope-tagged proteins for interaction studies. Additionally, because TRAF2 is known to interact with cFLIPL in both co-immunoprecipitation and yeast-two hybrid assays (28Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we carried out a parallel experiment examining the interaction between FLAG-tagged cFLIPL and TRAF2-HA as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 3D, while we readily detected an interaction between overexpressed cFLIPL and TRAF2, under similar experimental conditions no such interaction was observed between overexpressed K13 and TRAF2. Taken together with the studies involving endogenously expressed TRAF2, these results demonstrate that K13 does not interact with TRAF2. TRAF2 Does Not Mediate the Recruitment of K13 to the IKK Complex—There is a controversy in the published literature regarding the requirement for TRAF2 in mediating the interaction between K13 and the IKK complex. Thus, Field et al. (7Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) observed a direct interaction between K13 and Nemo/IKKγ using GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. In contrast, Guasparri et al. (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that TRAF2 is required for mediating the interaction between K13 and Nemo/IKKγ. To resolve this apparent discrepancy between the two studies, we generated stable clones of wild-type and TRAF2–/– MEFs expressing an empty vector and FLAG-tagged K13 (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, we used a co-immunoprecipitation assay to study the interaction between K13 and Nemo/IKKγ in the absence and presence of TRAF2. Consistent with our previous studies with PEL cells, we readily detected an interaction between K13 and Nemo/IKKγ in the wild-type MEFs, whereas no interaction was observed between K13 and TRAF2 under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 4B). More importantly, lack of TRAF2 in TRAF2–/– MEFs had no detrimental effect on the ability of K13 to interact with Nemo/IKKγ (Fig. 4B), thereby arguing against a role for TRAF2 in facilitating the recruitment of K13 to the IKK complex. TRAF2 and TRAF3 Are Not Involved in K13-induced NF-κB Activation—While the preceding studies ruled out the involvement of TRAF2 in mediating the interaction between K13 and IKK complex, it was still conceivable that TRAF2 plays a functional role in K13-induced NF-κB activation without physically interacting with it. Consistent with the above model, K13-induced NF-κB activation in 293T and PEL cell lines could be blocked by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 (4Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the above studies can be criticized for the experimental artifacts introduced due to nonspecific binding and titering away of critical components of the NF-κB signaling pathway by the overexpressed TRAF2 mutant, a role for TRAFs in K13 signaling was also suggested by inhibition of constitutive NF-κB and JNK activities in KSHV-infected BC-3 cell line upon siRNA-mediated knock-down of TRAF2 and TRAF3 (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To definitely address the involvement of TRAF2 in K13-induced NF-κB activation, we compared the ability of K13 to induce NF-κB activation in the wild-type and TRAF2–/– MEFs. As shown in Fig. 5A, transient transfection of K13 led to equivalent increase in NF-κB activity in the wild-type and TRAF2–/– MEFs as measured by a luciferase-based reporter assay. Similarly, stable expression of K13 in the wild-type and TRAF2–/– MEFs led to a similar increase in the NF-κB binding activity over vector-expressing cells, as measured by EMSA (Fig. 5B). It was conceivable that rather than influencing the absolute amounts of NF-κB complexes, TRAF2 affects the subunit composition of NF-κB complexes induced by K13. To rule out this possibility, we examined the subunit composition of NF-κB complexes induced by K13 in the wild-type and TRAF2–/– cells using a gel super-shift assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, this assay revealed that the NF-κB complex induced by K13 consisted of p50, p65, and RelB subunits in both the wild-type and TRAF2–/– MEFs. To confirm the above results and to provide an independent proof of the lack of involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF3 in K13-induced NF-κB activation, we used 293NF-κB-Luc-K13-ERTAM cells, which express stably integrated copies of an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct and a K13-ERTAM fusion construct (12Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mutated estrogen receptor (ERTAM) in the K13-ERTAM fusion construct does not bind to the physiological ligand estrogen but binds with very high affinity to the synthetic ligand 4-OHT (4-hydroxytamoxifen) and regulates the activity of K13 in a 4-OHT-dependent fashion (12Matta H. Surabhi R.M. Zhao J. Punj V. Sun Q. Schamus S. Mazzacurati L. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5D, treatment of 293NF-κB-K13-ERTAM cells with 4-OHT led to a ∼5-fold induction in the NF-κB luciferase activity, which was effectively blocked by siRNA against the p65 subunit of NF-κB. However, under similar experimental conditions, siRNAs targeting TRAF2 or TRAF3 had no significant effect on K13-induced NF-κB luciferase activity (Fig. 5D). Equivalent and specific knock-down of p65, TRAF2 and TRAF3 by their respective siRNAs was confirmed by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies (Fig. 5E). Taken together with the studies using TRAF2–/– MEFs, the above results confirm the lack of involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF3 in K13-induced NF-κB activation. K13 Fails to Activate the JNK Pathway in PEL Cells—Although NF-κB activation is known to promote KSHV latency, JNK/AP1 activation has been reported to stimulate lytic replication (19Brown H.J. Song M.J. Deng H. Wu T.-T. Cheng G. Sun R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Wang S.E. Wu F.Y. Chen H. Shamay M. Zheng Q. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4248-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The role of K13 in JNK/AP1 activation has been controversial. K13 has been shown to lack the ability to activate the JNK pathway in two studies (10Sun Q. Matta H. Lu G. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Hood L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19211-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which is consistent with its role as a latent protein that promotes viral latency through NF-κB activation. However, K13 has been also reported to activate the JNK pathway and this activity has been attributed to its interaction with the TRAFs (11An J. Sun Y. Sun R. Rettig M.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results showing a lack of involvement of TRAF2 and 3 in K13-induced NF-κB pathway prompted us to re-examine the role of K13 in JNK activation. For this purpose, we generated stable clones of BCBL-1 cells expressing the K13-ERTAM fusion protein (Fig. 6A) and compared the effect of 4-OHT treatment on K13-induced NF-κB and JNK pathways, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment of BCBL-1 K13-ERTAM cells with 4-OHT led to robust activation of the NF-κB pathway as measured by p65/RelA DNA binding activity. In contrast, under similar experimental conditions, induction of K13 activity by 4-OHT failed to increase the DNA binding of transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun, Jun-D, and ATF2 (Fig. 6, C–F), which are known downstream targets of the JNK pathway. Similarly, 4-OHT treatment failed to induce c-Jun phosphorylation as measured by a c-Jun “pull-down” kinase assay (not shown). Thus, consistent with its lack of interaction with the TRAFs, K13 lacks the ability to activate the JNK pathway in PEL cells. Constitutive NF-κB activation is seen in several viral-induced lymphoproliferative disorders and has been attributed to the activity of viral-encoded proteins that target different steps of the NF-κB signaling pathway (29Hiscott J. Nguyen T.L. Arguello M. Nakhaei P. Paz S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6844-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The EBV-encoded LMP-1 behaves as a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor that activates the NF-κB and JNK pathways via the recruitment of different TRAF family members (30Izumi K.M. Kieff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV1)-encoded Tax protein activates the NF-κB pathway at a distal step by directly interacting with the IKK complex via its Nemo subunit (31Sun S.C. Xiao G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that the putative TRAF interaction motif has no functional role in K13-induced NF-κB and TRAF2 neither interacts with K13 nor is required for localizing it to the IKK complex. Similarly, TRAF3 is not needed for K13-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, our results suggest that, similar to HTLV-1 Tax, K13 bypasses the upstream components of the NF-κB signaling pathway to directly interact with the IKK complex, resulting in selective NF-κB activation. This model is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a direct interaction between K13 and Nemo/IKKγ in GST-pull down and yeast two-hybrid assays (7Field N. Low W. Daniels M. Howell S. Daviet L. Boshoff C. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and by the lack of involvement of the upstream kinases of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as RIP-1 and NIK, in K13-induced NF-κB activation (5Liu L. Eby M.T. Rathore N. Sinha S.K. Kumar A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 6Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52406-52411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results are at variance with the recent study by Guasparri et al. (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) which identified a TRAF-interacting motif in K13 and reported that both TRAF2 and TRAF3 are required for K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation. Although we have no simple explanation for the discrepancy between the two studies, the following points are worth consideration. First, while our computer model indicated that the putative TRAF-interacting motif in K13 is buried in the interface between DED1 and DED2 and is not available for surface-interactions, Guasparri et al. (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that this motif is exposed on the surface and is available for interaction with the TRAFs. It is important to point out that the computer model used by Guasparri et al. (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was based only on the second DED of K13. Because the putative TRAF-interacting motif of K13 is buried in the interface between the two DEDs, it is conceivable that exclusion of DED1 from their model contributed to the erroneous impression that the putative TRAF-interacting motif is surface-exposed. Second, we were unable to confirm one of the major conclusions of Guasparri et al. that TRAF2 and TRAF3 are required for K13-induced NF-κB and JNK activation. Guasparri et al. based this conclusion on an experiment in which siRNA-mediated silencing of TRAF2 and TRAF3 resulted in the inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activity and JNK phosphorylation in the BC-3 cells. However, it is possible that the observed inhibitory effect of TRAF2 and TRAF3 siRNAs on NF-κB and JNK activities in the BC-3 cells reflected inhibition of signaling pathways other than those activated by K13, a notion supported by our results showing that K13 does not activate the JNK pathway. Finally, another key finding of the study by Guasparri et al. was that the P93L and Q95R mutants of K13 have lost the ability to activate the NF-κB pathway, which provided one of the strongest arguments supporting a functional role of the putative TRAF-interacting motif in K13-induced NF-κB. This conclusion was based on a transient transfection-based luciferase reporter assay in the Namalwa cells (17Guasparri I. Wu H. Cesarman E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to confirm the lack of NF-κB activation by the P93L and Q95R mutants using a similar luciferase-based reporter assay. Although, we have no clear explanation for the loss of NF-κB ability by the P93L and Q95R mutants in the study by Guasparri et al., it is conceivable that the known variability in the level of expression of the transfected constructs following transient-transfection might have played a role. To avoid such an experimental artifact in our study, we confirmed the results of our transient transfection-based luciferase reporter assay with EMSA on nuclear extracts derived from three different lymphoma cell lines stably expressing the wild-type and mutant K13 constructs. Remarkably, we observed that in all three cell lines the mutant proteins were as effective as the wild-type K13 in activating the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, in contrast to the report by Guasparri et al., we found no decrease in the ability of the mutant proteins to interact with Nemo. Taken collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that mutations in the putative TRAF-interacting motif have no detrimental effect on the ability of K13 to activate NF-κB or interact with Nemo, and underscore the importance of using independent assays and multiple cell lines for confirming key research findings. Our results have important implications for a better understanding of the regulation of KSHV life-cycle. The NF-κB and JNK/AP1 pathways are known to result in opposing outcomes in cellular physiology as well as in the natural history of KSHV infection (32Papa S. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Kuntzen C. Knabb J.R. Dean K. Franzoso G. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, while NF-κB activation has been reported to support viral latency (19Brown H.J. Song M.J. Deng H. Wu T.-T. Cheng G. Sun R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), JNK/AP1 activation is known to promote lytic replication (20Wang S.E. Wu F.Y. Chen H. Shamay M. Zheng Q. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4248-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As such, bypassing TRAFs to selectively activate the NF-κB pathway through direct interaction with the IKK complex might be a clever strategy employed by KSHV to promote latency. Finally, K13-induced NF-κB activation is believed to play a key role in the survival, proliferation, and transformation of KSHV-infected cells (8Chugh P. Matta H. Schamus S. Zachariah S. Kumar A.

https://openalex.org/W1987647818,"In Arabidopsis thaliana and other crucifers, the glucosinolate-myrosinase system contributes to resistance against herbivory by generalist insects. As yet, it is unclear how crucifers defend themselves against crucifer-specialist insect herbivores.We analyzed natural variation for resistance against two crucifer specialist lepidopteran herbivores, Pieris brassicae and Plutella xylostella, among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and in a new Arabidopsis recombinant inbred line (RIL) population generated from the parental accessions Da(1)-12 and Ei-2. This RIL population consists of 201 individual F(8) lines genotyped with 84 PCR-based markers. We identified six QTL for resistance against Pieris herbivory, but found only one weak QTL for Plutella resistance. To elucidate potential factors causing these resistance QTL, we investigated leaf hair (trichome) density, glucosinolates and myrosinase activity, traits known to influence herbivory by generalist insects. We identified several previously unknown QTL for these traits, some of which display a complex pattern of epistatic interactions.Although some trichome, glucosinolate or myrosinase QTL co-localize with Pieris QTL, none of these traits explained the resistance QTL convincingly, indicating that resistance against specialist insect herbivores is influenced by other traits than resistance against generalists."

CK2 has been shown to act as a positive modulator of the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway, suppressing β-catenin degradation and β-catenin binding to adenomatous polyposis coli (22Song D.H. Dominguez I.

Overexpression of CK2 in ventral blastomeres of Xenopus embryos stimulates dorsal axis formation, whereas expression of a kinase-dead CK2 mutant blocks ectopic axis formation in response to Xwnt8 (24Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Imbrie G.A. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 274,: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that CK2 is activated by Wnt3a, operating downstream of Dvl and upstream of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription (23Gao Y. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 18394-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although earlier reported to act solely as “constitutively active” in cells, CK2 has been shown to be activated by Wnt3a (23Gao Y. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 18394-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Overexpression or inhibition of CK2 affects early development via the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf-sensitive gene expression (24Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Wu H. Imbrie G.A. Symes K. Seldin D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 274,: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CK2 enhanced β-catenin stabilization by phosphorylating β-catenin at Thr393 in the armadillo repeat region of β-catenin in vitro (22Song D.H. Dominguez I. Mizuno J. Kaut M. Mohr S.C. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278,: 24018-24025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although CK2 clearly mediates an essential aspect of Wnt3a signaling, the nature of this regulation of CK2 is unknown. CK2 activity has been shown in vitro to be sensitive to inositol polyphosphates (25Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consequently we hypothesized that Wnt may regulate CK2 (and thereby the Wnt/β-catenin or canonical pathway) by influencing phosphatidylinositol signaling. In the current report, we investigate the validity of this hypothesis and probe the generation of water-soluble inositol polyphosphates in Wnt action. Our results show that Wnt3a stimulates phosphatidylinositol breakdown and the accumulation of inositol polyphosphates, particularly IP5.IP5 generation in response to Wnt3a is shown to be operating downstream of Frizzled-1, heterotrimeric G proteins (especially Gq), and PLCβ in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway of mammalian cells. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (IP3K) and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) are shown to be key mediators of the production of IP5. Inhibiting the action of either enzyme blocks the ability of Wnt3a to accumulate β-catenin, to activate Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcription, and to promote formation of primitive endoderm (PE). Materials—Adriamycin, ammonium aurintricarboxylate (ATA), chlorogenic acid (CGA), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5), and anti-β-catenin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) were obtained from Calbiochem International (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (anti-IP3K-B, G-20) and Gα11 (anti-Gα11) as well as protein A/G Plus-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other antibodies were purchase from following companies: anti-Gαo was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); anti-Gαq and anti-GSK3β were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); anti-Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody was from Covance (Richmond, CA); and antibody TROMA-1 was from University of Iowa, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Recombinant mouse Wnt3a and Wnt5a were provided by R&D System (Minneapolis, MN). Peptides (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ(pS)EDEEE as GSK3β substrate and HRRRDDDSDDD as CK2 substrate) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). myo-[3H]Inositol, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemical (St. Louis, MO) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The synthesis of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was made from [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 by using human inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK or IPK2) as described (26Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98,: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). [32P]IP6 was synthesized from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled mung bean as described (26Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98,: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The mouse F9 teratocarcinoma (F9) cells (from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2 and 95% air. F9 and HEK293 cells were co-transfected with an expression vector harboring rat Frizzled1 (Fz1) and a luciferase reporter construct, Super8X TOP-flash by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were selected in the presence of 400 ng/ml G418, and maintained in the media containing 100 ng/ml G418 as previously described. For Wnt stimulation, cells were grown to monolayer and incubated in the absence of serum for 8 h prior to the treatment by either Wnt3a (15 ng/ml) or Wnt5a (60 ng/ml). Analysis of Soluble Inositol Phosphates—Cells expressing Fz1 were plated on a 35-mm culture dish and incubated in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Chemicon) containing myo-[3H]inositol (15 μCi/well) and 15% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum) for an additional 8 h before Wnt stimulation. Soluble inositol phosphates were extracted according to the method previously described (27Verbsky J. Lavine K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102,: 8448-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 500 μl of methanol and 0.5 n HCl mixture (methanol, 0.5 n HCl = 2:1) and inositol phosphates were extracted with 335 μl of chloroform. The aqueous phase containing inositol phosphates was neutralized by addition of 80 μl of saturated NaHCO3. Equal counts of soluble inositol phosphates were applied to a strong anion-exchange, Partisil 10-SAX HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and eluted first with a linear gradient of 0.01-1.7 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.5) over 30 min and followed by a 35-min step of 1.7 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml/fraction) were collected and 5 ml of scintillation fluid were added into each tube. Radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter. All data were normalized with respect to the total radioactivity measured in the lipid fraction. The elution times of internal standards, ADP and ATP, were monitored by a spectrophotometer at 260 nm. The identity of individual inositol phosphates was assigned on the basis of elution with known standards under the same condition. Construction of Plasmids—pTrcHisA-hIPMK was a gift from Dr. Solomon Snyder (Johns Hopkins Medical School). To subclone the hIPMK into a mammalian expression vector, PCR was used to amplify inserted hIPMK in pTrcHisA-hIPMK by using the 5′-primer with EcoRI site (5′-GGAATTCGGATGGCCGCCGAGCCCCCAGC-3′) and 3′-primer with BglII site (5′-ACAAGATCTTCAACTGTCCAAGATACTCCGAAG-3′). The PCR product encoding hIPMK was digested by EcoRI and BglII and subsequently subcloned into mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-HA and pCMV-MYC (BD Biosciences). The identity of the amplified sequences was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Knock-down Target Proteins by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—F9 cells expressing Fz1 were grown to ∼60% confluency on 12-well plates. siRNA (100 nm, final concentration) was introduced into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in the presence of siRNA for an additional 48-72 h according to manufacturer's recommendation. Sources of siRNA used in the study are listed as follows. siRNAs targeting Gαq, Gαo, Gα11, and PLCβ4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). siRNAs targeting PLCβ1 and PLCβ3 were synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the sequence published by Kim et al. (28Kim Y.H. Song M. Oh Y.S. Heo K. Choi J.W. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lim S. Kwon H.M. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207,: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All following siRNAs were obtained from Ambion: siRNA to IPMK (ID code 203326), siRNA to IP3K-A (ID code 170266), siRNA to IP3K-B (ID code 203096), siRNA to IP3K-C(ID code 171717), and siRNA to Dvl2 (ID code 61090). We used either immunoblotting or semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis to determine the efficiency of knockdown on targeted molecules. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA were collected from F9 control cells as well as siRNA-treated cells using STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by using a random hexamer primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was subjected to PCR (94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 30 s; for 20 cycles) using specific primer pairs to targeted genes and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers used to target IPMK were 5′-GATTGGGCGGAAGAGCTACGA-3′ and 5′-CTACCTTCTGAATACTGGCGGC-3′; the primers to target PLCβ1 were 5′-CTTCTCTGGCCTGTTTGAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCATACGTGTCTGGGACAT-3′; the primers to target PLCβ2 were 5′-GACAAGCCTGAGAGGTCCT-3′ and 5′-AAATGTCGAAGCGAGATGCT-3′; the primers to target PLCβ3 were 5′-CAGGCCAGCACAGAGACATA-3′ and 5′-GGTGTAGGGGTCACCTCAGA-3′; the primers to target PLCβ4 were 5′-AGGTGCTACCACGAACATCC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTTCAAGTAGCCAAGG-3′. Cyclophylin A was amplified as a control. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and the mixture were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193,: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins from samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blots electrophoretically. The blots were incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin for 0.5 h, rinsed with water, and then probed with antibody against targeted proteins. To determine cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and cell lysate was incubated with ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The suspension was applied by centrifugation to remove membrane-associated β-catenin. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin antibody. Immune complexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—F9 cells stably transfected with Fz1 were grown in 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 4 μg of pCMV-HA-IPMK. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with Wnt3a and then lysed at the indicated time with 3 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Whole cell lysates (2 mg) were incubated with anti-HA high affinity antibody (Roche Applied Science) immobilized on protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C for 4 h. Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation (10,000 × g) and dissolved in Laemmli's solution. Protein mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrotransblotting. HA-tagged IPMK were analyzed by immunoblotting as described. Lef/Tcf Reporter Assay—F9 clones stably transfected with Fz1 and Super8X TOPflash were cultured in 12-well plates and stimulated with Wnt3a for 5 h. Cell lysates were collected in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates (10 μl) were incubated for 10 s with 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.67 mm luciferin, 0.27 mm Coenzyme A, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm MgCO3, 4 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8). The intensity of luminescence was immediately measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). To study the effect of ATA, CGA, and adriamycin on Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription, inhibitors were added into culture media for 30 min prior to Wnt3a stimulation. Samples were assayed in triplicate and the luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentration. In Vitro CK2 Kinase Activity Assay—CK2 activity was analyzed, as previously described (30Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82,: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated CK2α from whole cell lysates were washed with kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm okadaic acid) and then incubated with 120 μm substrate peptide (HRRRDDDSDDD) in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, 160 μm GTP, 25 mm MgCl2 and with or without inositol phosphates at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were spotted onto a P81 Whatman filter membrane. Air-dried membranes were washed with 0.75% H3PO4 three times and incorporated γ-32Pinsubstrates on the membrane was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In Vitro GSK3β Kinase Activity Assay—GSK3β activity was analyzed, as previously described (31Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208,: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates followed by washing the pellet with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitated GSK3β was incubated with 10 μm substrate peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ(pS)EDEEE) in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 160 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, and with or without inositol phosphates at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were spotted onto a P81 Whatman filter membrane. Air-dried membranes were washed with 0.75% H3PO4 three times and incorporated γ-32Pin substrates on the membrane was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Analysis of Primitive Endoderm Formation—F9 clones expressing Fz1 were propagated on 12-well plates. Cells were treated with control siRNA, or siRNA targeting IPMK in combination with siRNA targeting IP3K-B for 48 h and then challenged without or with Wnt3a. At the end of 4 days, clones were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, stained with the mouse endoderm-specific marker, cytokeratin endo A, by the monoclonal antibody TROMA-1 (32Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272,: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fixed cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope for both phase-contrast and fluorescence images. Inositol Metabolism in Wnt3a-treated Cells—Mouse F9 embryonic totipotent, teratocarcinoma cells stably transfected with the rat Fz1 display activation of the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef/Tcf canonical pathway in response to treatment with Wnt3a, but not Wnt5a (9Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292,: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that Wnt3a activates CK2 and that this activation is obligate for Wnt3a stimulation of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription (23Gao Y. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281,: 18394-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based upon the report that inositol phosphates (e.g. IP4, IP5, and IP6) may regulate the activity of CK2 in vitro (25Solyakov L. Cain K. Tracey B.M. Jukes R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 43403-43410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we investigated the nature of water-soluble inositol polyphosphates accumulated in cells treated with Wnt3a for up to 60 min (Fig. 1A). F9 clones stably expressing either rat Fz1 or rat Frizzled-2 (Fz2) were labeled with [3H]inositol for 48 h and then treated with purified Wnt ligands for 0 to 60 min. F9 cells stably transfected with empty expressing vector (EV) were used as control cells. Anion exchange HPLC of either standard IP markers or water-soluble extracts from F9 cells expressing Fz1 and treated with Wnt3a (15 ng/ml) enabled analysis of the metabolism of inositol phosphates (Fig. 1A). The HPLC retention times, profiles, and the amplitude of the changes was highly reproducible under these conditions (not shown). Separation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphophate (IP6) by anion exchange was excellent (Fig. 1, standards); IP3 and IP5 were readily identified in the cell extracts. In the absence of Wnt3a stimulation (+Wnt3a, at “0” min), the HPLC was able to detect IP5. A slight elevation of IP5 is present in the control (empty vector-transfected as well as wild-type) cells (data not shown). Thus, the baseline levels of IP5 are not associated per se with expression of Fz1 in these cells. Within 10 min of Wnt3a treatment, the inositol phosphate profiles revealed increased IP3 and IP5 accumulation. Wnt3a stimulates an accumulation of IP5 that reaches peak values within 15 min and declines thereafter. Quantification of intracellular IP3, IP4, and IP5 in response to Wnt3a stimulation from multiple, separate preparations of [3H]inositol-labeled cells was performed to ascertain if the IP3 response to Wnt3a was significant (Fig. 1B). The increase in IP3 that peaks within 5 min was not significant, unlike the sharp increase in IP5 accumulation that peaks within 15 min. The non-canonical Wnt/cyclic GMP, Ca2+/NF-AT-sensitive transcription pathway has been shown to regulate phosphatidylinositol signaling (33Liu X. Liu T. Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Malbon C.C.

Science. 2002; 298,: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), so we explored if the activation of the non-canonical as well as the canonical pathways both regulate accumulation of inositol polyphosphates (Fig. 1C). Cells transfected with EV, or expression vector harboring either Fz1 or Fz2 were labeled with [3H]inositol. Treating the EV-transfected cells with Wnt3a or the Fz2-expressing cells with Wnt5a (60 ng/ml) stimulates no accumulation of IP5 over 60 min. IP5 accumulation was robust for the Fz1-expressing cells treated with Wnt3a (Fig. 1C), but not for those treated with Wnt5a (not shown). The complementary study of IP3 accumulation in response to Wnt stimulation was performed (Fig. 1D). IP3 accumulation is prominent in the Fz2 expressing cells stimulated with Wnt5a (Fig. 1D), but not in those same cells treated with Wnt3a (not shown). Furthermore, we treated F9 cells with LiCl in an effort to block the IP3 catabolic cascade (see supplemental data Fig. S1). Treatment with LiCl abolishes the appearance of the IP5 peak in cells expressing Fz1 and treated with Wnt3a; a corresponding increase in the accumulation of IP3 was not observed. LiCl treatment enhances IP3 accumulation in"
https://openalex.org/W2002457698,"Background While families of polymorphic membrane protein (pmp) genes have been identified in several Chlamydia species, their function remains mostly unknown. These proteins are of great interest, however, because of their location in the outer membrane and possible role in chlamydial virulence. Methodology/Principal Finding We analyzed the relative transcription of the pmpD gene, a member of the pmp gene family in C. trachomatis serovar L2, and its protein product translation and processing during the chlamydial developmental cycle. By real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the pmpD gene was found to be upregulated at 16 to 24 four hours after infection. Using polyclonal antibodies generated against the predicted passenger domain of PmpD, we demonstrated that it is initially localized on the surface of reticulate bodies, followed by its secretion outside Chlamydia starting at 24 hours after infection. In elementary bodies, we found a ≈157 kDa PmpD only inside the cell. Both events, the upregulation of pmpD gene transcription and PmpD protein processing and secretion, are coincidental with the period of replication and differentiation of RBs into EBs. We also demonstrated that, in the presence of penicillin, the cleavage and secretion of the putative passenger domain was suppressed. Conclusion/Significance Our results are in agreement with the general concept that PmpD is an autotransporter protein which is post-translationally processed and secreted in the form of the putative passenger domain outside Chlamydia at mid- to- late point after infection, coinciding with the development of RBs into EBs."
https://openalex.org/W2076444911,"Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is an important lung innate immune protein that kills microbial pathogens by opsonization and membrane permeabilization. We investigated the basis of SP-A-mediated pulmonary clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using genetically-engineered SP-A mice and a library of signature-tagged P. aeruginosa mutants. A mutant with an insertion into flgE, the gene that encodes flagellar hook protein, was preferentially cleared by the SP-A(+/+) mice, but survived in the SP-A(-/-) mice. Opsonization by SP-A did not play a role in flgE clearance. However, exposure to SP-A directly permeabilized and killed the flgE mutant, but not the wild-type parental strain. P. aeruginosa strains with mutation in other flagellar genes, as well as mucoid, nonmotile isolates from cystic fibrosis patients, were also permeabilized by SP-A. Provision of the wild-type fliC gene restored the resistance to SP-A-mediated membrane permeabilization in the fliC-deficient bacteria. In addition, non-mucoid, motile revertants of CF isolates reacquired resistance to SP-A-mediated membrane permeability. Resistance to SP-A was dependent on the presence of an intact flagellar structure, and independent of flagellar-dependent motility. We provide evidence that flagellar-deficient mutants harbor inadequate amounts of LPS required to resist membrane permeabilization by SP-A and cellular lysis by detergent targeting bacterial outer membranes. Thus, the flagellum of P. aeruginosa plays an indirect but important role resisting SP-A-mediated clearance and membrane permeabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2055549720,"Covalent modification by Nedd8 (neddylation) stimulates the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activities of Cullins. DCN-1, an evolutionarily conserved protein, promotes neddylation of Cullins in vivo, binds directly to Nedd8, and associates with Cdc53 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 1.9Å resolution structure of yeast DCN-1 shows that the region encompassing residues 66–269 has a rectangular parallelepiped-like all α-helical structures, consisting of an EF-hand motif N-terminal domain and a closely juxtaposed C-terminal domain with six α-helices. The EF-hand motif structure is highly similar to that of the c-Cbl ubiquitin E3 ligase. We also demonstrate that DCN-1 directly binds to Rbx-1, a factor important for protein neddylation.

The structural and biochemical results are consistent with the role of DCN-1 as a scaffold protein in a multisubunit neddylation E3 ligase complex. Ubiquitin-like proteins, such as Nedd8/Rub1, can be covalently attached to substrate proteins in a manner similar to ubiquitination. Modification by Nedd8, a process known as neddylation, has been found in Cullins and several other cellular proteins (1Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P.

During neddylation, the Nedd8 E1 heterodimer activates Nedd8 in an ATP-dependent process, and the enzyme and Nedd8 form a reaction intermediate through a thioester bond. The activated Nedd8 is then transferred to the conjugating enzyme E2, which also covalently links Nedd8 through a thioester bond. Next, the E2 interacts with an E3 to transfer Nedd8 through an isopeptide bond to a lysine residue of the substrate. The Nedd8 acceptor lysine is located in the C-terminal region of the Cullin family of ubiquitin E3 proteins (2Pan Z.Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cullins and p53 are the only neddylation substrates known to date (1Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T.

At present, Rbx-1 is the only protein known to have a Nedd8 E3 function (7Morimoto M. Nishida T. Nagayama Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Rbx-1 contains a single RING motif, and it is an inefficient ubiquitin E3 on its own. This is reminiscent of many E3 ubiquitin ligases; a single RING domain is either incapable of promoting or inefficient to promote ubiquitin transfer. Recently, Kurz et al. (9Kurz T. Ozlu N. Rudolf F.

DCN-1 is a conserved protein found in organisms ranging from fungi to mammals. Interestingly, a human DCN-1 homolog protein (see HUMA1 in Fig. 1A), also known as SCCRO (squamous cell carcinomas-related oncogene), is an oncogene (10Sarkaria I. P O.C. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and possibly functions in the hedgehog signaling pathway by activating Gli1 expression. DCN-1 contains a predicted N-terminal UBA3 motif and a conserved C-terminal DUF298 domain of unknown function. Studies from yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans showed that DCN-1 directly binds Nedd8 (yeast ortholog is Rub1) and associate with Cdc53. The level of Cdc53 neddylation is greatly reduced in yeast cells lacking DCN-1. Our structural and biochemical analyses reveal that DCN-1 is likely to serve as a scaffold protein mediating protein-protein interactions in a neddylation E3 ligase complex that includes Rbx-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Crystallization—Recombinant full-length yeast DCN-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein using a pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-DCN-1 was first purified on a GSH-agarose affinity column followed by the removal of the GST tag with thrombin digestion. Briefly, cell lysate in 1× PBS (pH 7.4) buffer was centrifuged with 20,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto GST affinity column. After intensive washing with PBS buffer, the GST fusion protein was eluted with GST elution buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl(pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. Further purification of DCN-1 was carried out using successive chromatography steps on ion exchange Q and Superdex-200 columns (Amersham Biosciences) by standard purification methods. Mutations in DCN-1 were introduced by PCR, and mutant proteins were expressed and purified similar to that described for the wild-type protein. GST-fused yeast Rbx-1 (GST-Rbx1) was expressed in E. coli and purified using a GSH column.Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. Best diffracting crystals were obtained in a condition containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 30% ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGMME)-5000, and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. A platinum derivative was obtained by soaking the crystal in the presence of 0.1 mm K2PtCl4. Native and derivative data sets were collected using a home source FR-E SuperBright rotating anode x-ray source equipped with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate detector (Rigaku). Data were collected at 100 K and processed using the HKL2000 program suite (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the I41 space group with cell dimensions of a = b = 81.40 Å and c = 106.06 Å, and there is one molecule per asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of DCN-1 was solved by the method of single isomorphous replacement with anomalous signal (SIRAS) using the platinum derivative data (12Lu X.

The SIRAS phase was extended to 1.92 Å and improved with solvent flattening and histogram matching using DM and SOLOMON (15Project Collaborative Computational Four Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The final model contains 205 residues and has an R-factor of 20.3% and an Rfree of 24.8% (see Table 1 for detailed statistics). The atomic coordinates and diffraction data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2IS9. Structural figures were prepared using PyMOL.Protein Interaction Assay—Purified GST-Rbx1 was first immobilized on GSH resins followed by the addition of ∼10-fold molar excess of purified wild-type DCN-1 or DCN-1 (141–269). Extensive wash of the GSH resins with PBS (pH 7.4) removes unbound proteins, and the bound protein was eluted from the GSH resins with GST elution buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted sample was then analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-yDCN-1 polyclonal antibody. The antibody was raised in rabbit with purified yeast DCN-1 following a standard protocol, and the quality of the antibodies was monitored by standard Western blots.RESULTSWe have solved a 1.92 Å crystal structure of yeast DCN-1. The full-length protein has 269 amino acids, and structure revealed an ordered core domain encompassing residues 66–269 (Fig. 1A). The disordered N-terminal region contains an ubiquitin-binding UBA3 motif. The refined model has an R-factor of 20.3% and an R-free of 24.8% and also has high stereochemical quality, with 95% of the residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, calculated using PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A section of the SIRAS-phased electron density map and detailed refinement statistics can be found in Fig. 1B.Overall Structure—The all α-helical structure comprises 11 helices in total and can be further divided into two domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 66–158) encompassing helices α1–α5 and a C-terminal domain (residues 159–269) containing helices α6–α11 (Fig. 2A). The two domains are in close juxtaposition and rigidly held together with extensive hydrophobic and polar interactions. The rectangular parallelepiped-like structure has approximate dimensions of 64 Å × 27 Å × 24 Å.FIGURE 2Structure of DCN-1. A, a stereo ribbon diagram showing the overall structure of DCN-1. The structure is colored from the N to the C termini with blue to red. B, a surface representation of the DCN-1 structure. B1 (side 1) and B3 (side 2) show the distribution of conserved residues on the two sides of the protein surface. Absolutely conserved residues are indicated in blue, and highly conserved residues are shown in green, using the convention defined in the legend for Fig. 1. The arrow points to the position of Glu-260, which is colored in red. Electrostatic potential on the protein surface is shown in B2 and B4, which are oriented the same as in B1 and B3, respectively. Positively charged regions are shown in red, negatively charged regions are in blue, and neutral ones are in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unexpectedly, four of the N-terminal domain helices, α1, α2, α3, and α4, adopt two EF-hand folds. The first EF-hand is composed of α1 and α2, which are connected through a 7-residue loop (loop 1, residues 83–89), whereas helices α3 and α4 form the second EF hand with a 10-residue loop (loop 3, residues 117–126) connecting the two helices (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal portion of α5 contacts α1 and α2 at their ends opposite to the connecting loop, and it packs against α3 and α4 in a perpendicular manner. However, the EF-hands have no calcium ion bound in the structure, possibly because: 1) loop 1 is shorter than a canonical EF-hand loop, and it lacks conserved acidic residues; and 2) although loop 3 has a suitable length, it also lacks conserved acidic residues.The C-terminal domain contains six α-helices (α6–α11), four of which (α6–α9) are arranged in an anti-parallel manner with α6 packs on one side of the α7–α9 plane and α8 on the opposite side. The C-terminal helices α10 and α11 are positioned next to α8 and α9 on the side opposite to helices α6 and α7 and form one end of the elongated structure of DCN-1 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the distribution of conserved and charged residues on the protein surface differs significantly between two opposite sides of the rectangular parallelepiped-like protein (Fig. 2B). The convex side (side 1), which includes α2, α3, and α7, is enriched with negatively charged residues, most of which are not conserved (Fig. 2, B1 and B3). The concave side (side 2) is formed by helices α4, α6, and α9, and this side of the protein surface is enriched with positively charged residues, many of which, such as Lys-180 and Lys-225, are highly conserved (Fig. 2, B2 and B4). The location of conserved residues on the positively charged side of the protein surface suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of this area of the protein surface.The C-terminal domain is highly conserved among different species, with 9 invariant residues located within the last 29 amino acids, which encompass helices α10 and α11 (Fig. 1A). There are 7 acidic residues within the stretch of 29 amino acids in yeast DCN-1, making it highly negatively charged (Fig. 2B). The high degree of sequence conservation and the unusual surface charge distribution suggest a protein-protein interaction role of the C-terminal domain of DCN-1, although the precise functional significance of this structural feature is currently unknown.Structural Similarity between DCN-1 and c-Cbl—A search for similar protein structures using the DALI server (20Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) revealed significant structural homology (with a Z-score of 7.5 using yeast DCN-1 residues 74–159 as the template) between the N-terminal domain of DCN-1 and the EF-hand domain of c-Cbl, which is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases (21Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The two domains can be superimposed with a root mean squared deviation of 2.7 Å, using the Cα positions of residues located in α1–α4 for alignment (Fig. 3A), although the two domains share little sequence identity (<10%). As in DCN-1, the first EF-hand of c-Cbl does not bind a calcium ion. The second EF-hand of c-Cbl binds one calcium ion. However, the interactions deviate from that found in canonical EF-hands. For example, a main chain carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group of a threonine in c-Cbl are also involved in calcium binding.FIGURE 3Superposition of c-Cbl and DCN-1. A, a stereo diagram of superimposed DCN-1 (blue) and c-Cbl (gray) EF-hand motifs. A red sphere represents a calcium ion bound to the c-Cbl EF-hand motif. B, superposition of c-Cbl (only EF-hand and helix bundle motifs are shown) with DCN-1 to show the different spatial arrangement of the two helix bundle motifs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is interesting to note that c-Cbl also has a helical module as part of the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain (21Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Although it was called a four-helix bundle, the four helices in the TKB domain are arranged in manner better resembling the packing of a pair of parallel coiled-coils that are also characteristic of four of the helices (α6–α9) in the C-terminal domain of DCN-1. However, the four helices in c-Cbl are longer and, unlike the C-terminal domain of DCN-1, they are located N-terminal to the EF-hand domain. The spatial arrangement of the two helical domains with respect to their EF-hand is also different (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, both helical domains of c-Cbl and DCN-1 pack against their respective EF-hand domains through extensive interactions with the second EF-hand. The described structural similarity between DCN-1 and c-Cbl, which is an ubiquitin E3 ligase, suggests a functional parallel between the two proteins, namely, DCN-1 may function as a component of the neddylation E3 ligase.Direct Interaction between DCN-1 and Rbx-1—To explore the hypothesis that DCN-1 may function in a Nedd8 E3 ligase complex, we tested for direct interactions of yeast DCN-1 with the RING finger protein Rbx-1. Purified GST-Rbx1 was immobilized on GSH resins, and purified untagged DCN-1 was added to the GST-Rbx1-bound GSH resins in 10-fold molar excess (Fig. 4A). After extensive wash with the binding buffer, proteins bound to the GSH resins were eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. Western blotting of the eluted sample using a polyclonal anti-yDCN-1 antibody shows that DCN-1 co-eluted with GST-Rbx1, whereas DCN-1 was not retained on GST-bound GSH resins in a control experiment (Fig. 4B). Thus, DCN-1 interacts with Rbx-1 directly in vitro. We further measured the binding affinity between DCN-1 and Rbx-1 using the surface plasmon resonance technique (BiAcore) (see Supplemental Data). The results show that DCN-1 binds to GST-Rbx1 with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.7 μm (see supplemental data). This observation is consistent with and extends a previous observation that DCN-1, Cdc53, and Rbx-1 can coexist in a multiprotein complex (9Kurz T. Ozlu N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Interaction of DCN-1 and Rbx-1.

An anti-yeast DCN-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was used in the Western blots shown in B and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which region of DCN-1 interacts with Rbx-1, several truncation mutants of DCN-1 were engineered, and the DCN-1 variants were expressed in E. coli and purified in a manner similar to that for the full-length DCN-1. GST pulldown experiments with purified GST-Rbx1 showed that a C-terminal fragment of DCN-1 encompassing residues 141–269 binds to Rbx-1 with an affinity comparable with that of the wild-type DCN-1 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the C-terminal domain of DCN-1 is sufficient for interaction with Rbx-1.To pinpoint the DCN-1 residues important for interaction with Rbx-1, we made a number of point mutations of highly conserved residues within the C-terminal domain of DCN-1. These mutants include two single point mutations, S1(Q165A) and S2(E260A); four double mutations, D1(K180S/D183S), D2(D249S/D259S), D3(K225A/D226K), and D4(D185R/R216S); and three triple mutations, T1(D247A/D249S/D259S), T2(E263A/D249S/D259S), and T3(W254G/D249S/D259S). These mutant DCN-1 proteins were used in GST pulldown and Western blotting analyses. Among all of the DCN-1 mutants tested, only S2(E260A) showed a significant loss of binding to Rbx-1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, Glu-260 is important for binding Rbx-1, whereas the functions of other conserved residues remain to be elucidated. The structure shows that Glu-260 extends its side chain out from helix α10 and forms a contiguous exposed surface area with three adjacent residues, Glu-250, Phe-256, and Glu-263 (Fig. 2B). These residues are also highly conserved (Fig. 1A); thus, the surface region occupied by the 4 residues may have an evolutionarily conserved role of interacting with Rbx-1.DISCUSSIONOur structural study revealed an unexpected resemblance between the structures of DCN-1 and an ubiquitin E3 ligase, c-Cbl. Previous studies have shown that DCN-1 also interacts with Cullin, Nedd8, and ubiquitin (9Kurz T. Ozlu N. Rudolf F. O'Rourke S.M. Luke B. Hofmann K. Hyman A.A. Bowerman B. Peter M. Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that DCN-1 interacts directly with Rbx-1p via the C-terminal helical domain in this study. These results together suggest that DCN-1 functions as a component of the Nedd8 E3 ligase complex.It is clear that DCN-1 cannot function as a Nedd8 E3 ligase on its own. It lacks a RING domain or HECT (homologue to EGAP C terminus) domain associated with all ubiquitin E3 enzymes known to date, and the mechanistic similarity between protein ubiquitination and neddylation implicates the requirement of one of those domains in the Nedd8 E3 enzyme. Previous studies have shown that Rbx-1 could serve as the RING domain protein in the Nedd8 E3 complex. When compared with the prototypical active RING domain ubiquitin E3 ligase c-Cbl, it is possible that the “missing” RING domain of DCN-1 is provided in trans by Rbx-1. This is a particularly attractive hypothesis from a structural point of view because c-Cbl contains a RING domain in cis with the EF-hand and TKB domains, and the RING domain is positioned next to the helical TKB domain. A similar arrangement of the RING domain of Rbx-1 with respect to the helical domain DCN-1 is likely, as we have shown that the two domains interact directly. Future biochemical and structural studies will determine the precise mode of interaction among DCN-1, Rbx-1, and Cdc53. Ubiquitin-like proteins, such as Nedd8/Rub1, can be covalently attached to substrate proteins in a manner similar to ubiquitination. Modification by Nedd8, a process known as neddylation, has been found in Cullins and several other cellular proteins (1Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Neddylation and ubiquitination use parallel mechanisms; each involves their own E1, 3The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineSIRASsingle isomorphous replacement with anomalous signal 3The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineSIRASsingle isomorphous replacement with anomalous signal E2, and E3 proteins, and both follow a sequential modification process. During neddylation, the Nedd8 E1 heterodimer activates Nedd8 in an ATP-dependent process, and the enzyme and Nedd8 form a reaction intermediate through a thioester bond. The activated Nedd8 is then transferred to the conjugating enzyme E2, which also covalently links Nedd8 through a thioester bond. Next, the E2 interacts with an E3 to transfer Nedd8 through an isopeptide bond to a lysine residue of the substrate. The Nedd8 acceptor lysine is located in the C-terminal region of the Cullin family of ubiquitin E3 proteins (2Pan Z.Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K.

Two NRPs have been reported so far, NRP1 and NRP2. Unlike NRP1, little is known about NRP2 interactions with its ligands, VEGF165 and SEMA3F. Cell binding studies reveal that VEGF165 and SEMA3F bind NRP2 with similar affinities, 5.2 and 3.9 nm, respectively, and are competitive NRP2 ligands. Immunoprecipitation studies show that the B (b1b2) extracellular domain of NRP2 is sufficient for VEGF165 binding, whereas SEMA3F requires both the A (a1a2) and B domains. To identify residues of B-NRP2 involved in VEGF165 binding, point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. VEGF165 is a basic protein. Reduction of the electronegative potential of B-NRP2 by exchanging acidic residues for uncharged alanine (B-NRP2 E284A,E291A) in the 280–290 b1-NRP2 loop resulted in a 2-fold reduction in VEGF165 affinity. Conversely, enhancing the electronegative potential (B-NRP2 R287E,N290D and R287E,N290S) significantly increased VEGF165 affinity for B-NRP2 by 8- and 6.6-fold, respectively. The mutagenesis did not affect SEMA3F/B-NRP2 interactions. These results demonstrate that it is possible to alter VEGF165 affinity for NRP2 without affecting SEMA3F affinity. They also identify NRP2 residues involved in VEGF165 binding and suggest that modifications of B-NRP2 could lead to potentially high affinity selective inhibitors of VEGF165/NRP2 interactions.

NRP1 and NRP2 are often differentially expressed. In the neuronal system, NRP1 is expressed on sympathetic and sensory neurons, whereas NRP2 is detected on sympathetic neurons. Binding of SEMA3 to NRPs and complexing with plexins results in axon repulsion and growth cone collapse (6Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H.

For example, SEMA3A and SEMA3F inhibit steps in angiogenesis such as adhesion, migration, and capillary sprouting (23Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J.

The ability of two structurally disparate proteins, VEGF165 and SEMA3s, to bind to one single receptor (NRP) has engendered considerable interest in NRP structure. That VEGF165 and SEMA3A (Collapsin-1) are competitive inhibitors in EC binding, EC migration, and dorsal root ganglia collapse assays suggests possible overlapping binding sites on NRP1 (23Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). NRP1 and NRP2 have about 40% amino acid identity but share similar domain structure (1Fujisawa H. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) composed of a large extracellular domain (∼840 amino acids), a very short transmembrane region (25 amino acids) and a short cytoplasmic sequence (42 amino acids) in which no signaling consensus sequences have been identified so far. The NRP extracellular domain contains: (i) an A domain consisting of two a-domain repeats (a1a2), (ii) a B domain consisting of two b-domains repeats (b1b2), and (iii) a C domain, most likely involved in NRP oligomerization (35Takagi S.

Our previous studies using pull-down methods indicated that VEGF165 binds solely to the B domain of NRP1 (40Mamluk R. Gechtman Z. Kutcher M.E. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Domain deletion studies have also demonstrated that the B-NRP1 domain is essential for VEGF165 binding (41Gu C. Limberg B.J. Whitaker G.B. Perman B. Leahy D.J. Rosenbaum J.S. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18069-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, both A- and B-NRP1 domains are needed for SEMA3A binding (37Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 41Gu C. Limberg B.J. Whitaker G.B. Perman B.

Compared with NRP1, the structural features of NRP2 necessary for ligand binding have not been reported yet. In this report, we show that SEMA3F competes with VEGF165 for NRP2 binding and that VEGF165 needs only the B domain for optimal binding, whereas SEMA3F needs both the A and B domains. Moreover, point mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis to pinpoint VEGF165 binding sites based on information provided by the crystal structure of the b1-NRP1 domain (42Lee C.C. Kreusch A. McMullan D. Ng K. Spraggon G. Structure. 2003; 11: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and by the over 50% identity of the NRP1 and NRP2 b1 domains. VEGF165 is a basic protein. Mutation of 2 electronegative glutamates to neutral alanines in the 280–290 loop of b1-NRP2 decreased VEGF165 affinity by 2-fold. On the other hand, enhancing the electronegative potential of the same b1 loop increased VEGF affinity by 8-fold. The point mutations do not affect SEMA3F binding. These studies identify specific NRP2 residues that bind VEGF165. Furthermore, because B-NRP2 can inhibit VEGF165 binding to EC, further modifications of this NRP2 region to increase its affinity for VEGF165 could lead to more potent VEGF165 antagonists to target angiogenesis.

The sites of HindIII and EcoRV were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively, for consequent enzymatic digestion. PfuTurbo™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase was used for the PCR (95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles: 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 10 min) together with the following primer pairs: A-NRP2, forward, 5′-CTTACCAAGCTTTGCGGAGGTCGTTTGAATC and reverse, 5′-TACAGATATCTTGACCAGGTAGTAACGCC; B-NRP2, forward, 5′-CTTACCAAGCTTTGCAATGTTCCTCTGGGC and reverse, 5′-TACAGATATCTTACAGCCCAGCACCTCCAG; AB-NRP2, forward, 5′-CTTACCAAGCTTTGCGGAGGTCGTTTGAATC and reverse, 5′-TACAGATATCTTACAGCCCAGCACCTCCAG.

The full-length, human SEMA3F vector was a gift of Dr. M. Tessier-Lavigne (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). The SEMA3F V5-His6-tagged was prepared by cloning from the above pSecTag construct onto the pcDNA 3.1 V5-His6 vector. Briefly, the cDNA was amplified from the pSecTag vector including the ATG start codon and the Igκ chain coding sequence by PCR (94 °C for 4 min, 15 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 5 min; 68 °C for 4 min) with the following primers: forward, 5′-GCCACCATGGAGACAGAGACACTC and reverse, 5′-GTCCGGAGGGTGGTGCCGGCG.

Expression and Purification of NRP2 Extracellular Domains and Semaphorins—The domain constructs were transiently transfected overnight into HEK293 cells using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6. The following day the culture medium was replaced by serum-free CD 293 medium and the conditioned media were collected after 48 h. The conditioned media were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 20 min, adjusted to 30 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, filtered on a 0.22-μm filter, and applied onto a 1-ml HiTrap™ chelating column loaded with NiSO4 and attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. After washing with 30 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, the proteins were eluted with 30 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by SYPRO Ruby staining and the positive fractions were subsequently desalted on a HiTrap desalting column. The protein concentrations were determined using the Quick Start™ Bradford dye reagent. The same experimental procedures were used for the purification of SEMA3F. Iodination of VEGF165 and SEMA3F and Binding to PAEC NRP2—VEGF165 and SEMA3F were iodinated using IODO-BEADS® as previously described by Soker et al. (21Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Specific activities of ∼60,000 and ∼10,000 cpm/ng were obtained for the two proteins, respectively. To determine the dissociation constants (Kd values) of 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-SEMA3F for PAEC NRP2, the cells were incubated in 96- or 48-well plates with increasing concentrations of the radioligand for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (Ham's F-12, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml heparin sodium salt). The supernatant was aspirated, the cells were thoroughly washed with cold PBS, lysed with 0.2 n NaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The values at each concentration point were corrected for the nonspecific binding obtained on the parental PAEC. The dissociation constants (Kd values) were calculated from average values of at least two experiments using the Software GraphPad nonlinear regression fitting parameters for one-site binding. For the competition-binding experiments, PAEC NRP1 and NRP2 were incubated in 48-well plates with 125I-VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) in binding buffer at increasing concentrations of cold SEMA3F (0 to 250 nm) for 1 h at 4 °C or PAEC NRP2 were incubated with 125I-SEMA3F (25 ng/ml) in binding buffer at increasing concentrations of cold VEGF165 (0 to 200 nm). Afterward, the cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed with 0.2 n NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The experiment was repeated in duplicates two to three times. Co-immunoprecipitation of 125I-VEGF165 and SEMA3F with the NRP2 Domains—125I-VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) was preincubated in binding buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml heparin sodium salt) with equal amounts of purified Myc-His6-tagged domains at room temperature for 2 h. The complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-Myc antibody. Protein G slurry (20 μl) was added to the immunocomplexes and an incubation of 1 h at 4 °C followed. The beads were washed with PBS, boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel followed by autoradiography. For quantification, an aliquot of the samples was measured in a γ-counter. In the case of SEMA3F, 25 μg/ml of V5-tagged SEMA3F were incubated with equal amounts of A-, B-, and AB-NRP2 in binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G slurry (20 μl) was added to the immunocomplexes and an incubation of 1 h at 4 °C followed. The beads were washed with PBS, boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-V5 antibody. The intensity of the bands was quantified with ImageJ. The dissociation constants (Kd values) of the different domains and B-NRP2 mutants for VEGF165 and SEMA3F were calculated. Five ng/ml of 125I-VEGF165 or 25 ng/ml of 125I-SEMA3F V5-His6-tagged were preincubated in binding buffer at room temperature with increasing concentrations (0 to 50 nm) of the different proteins. Immunoprecipitation of the complexes was carried out and the Protein G bead-associated radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The values obtained were plotted and the curves were fitted using the Origin5.0 software (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) with nonlinear regression fitting parameters for one-site binding. Inhibition of 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-SEMA3F Binding to PAEC NRP2 and HUVEC by the NRP2 Domains—The radioligands at a concentration of 5 ng/ml (125I-VEGF165) or 25 ng/ml (125I-SEMA3F) were preincubated in binding buffer (Ham's F-12, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml heparin sodium salt) with increasing concentrations of the discrete NRP2 domains (0, 10, 50, 300, and 1000 nm) at room temperature for 2 h. Afterward the complexes were added to the cells in 48-well plates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were aspirated, the cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed in 0.2 n NaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. The results are expressed as percentages of the cell-bound radioligand alone. IC50 values were calculated from the graphs (using Origin5.0) as the concentrations of the respective domain necessary to reduce the amount of cell-bound radioligand to 50% of the initial value. VEGF165 and SEMA3F Are Competitive NRP2 Ligands—Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) do not express VEGF165 receptors or semaphorin receptors and can be engineered to overexpress one receptor at a time, for example, NRP2 or NRP1 (21Soker S.

Kreuter M. Kim C.C. Klagsbrun M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The Kd of VEGF165 and SEMA3F for NRP2 were calculated from the binding curves of 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-SEMA3F for PAEC NRP2. The Kd for the 2 ligands were fairly similar, 5.2 ± 3.7 nm for VEGF165 (Fig. 1A) and 3.9 ± 1.5 nm for SEMA3F (Fig. 1B), respectively. To determine whether VEGF165 and SEMA3F are competitive inhibitors, 125I-VEGF165 (5 ng/ml, 0.12 nm) was incubated with PAEC NRP2 or PAEC NRP1 at increasing unlabeled SEMA3F concentrations (0 to 250 nm) (Fig. 1C). 125I-VEGF165 binding to PAEC NRP2 was inhibited by up to 80% at 100 nm cold SEMA3F (830-fold molar ratio of SEMA3F/125I-VEGF165). On the other hand, inhibition of 125I-VEGF165 binding to PAEC NRP1 was only 15% at the same concentration of cold SEMA3F. The diminished ability of SEMA3F to inhibit 125I-VEGF165 binding to NRP1 compared with NRP2 is consistent with SEMA3F having a 10-fold lower affinity for NRP1 compared with NRP2 (10Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In a complementary experiment, PAEC NRP2 were incubated with 125I-SEMA3F (25 ng/ml, 0.13 nm) and increasing concentrations of cold VEGF165 (0 to 200 nm). VEGF165 was able to compete with 125I-SEMA3F for NRP2 binding sites on PAEC NRP2. At the highest concentration of unlabeled VEGF165 (200 nm, about 1540-fold molar ratio VEGF165/125I-SEMA3F) 53% of 125I-SEMA3F was displaced from the cell surface by VEGF165 (Fig. 1D). The binding of 125I-SEMA3F to PAEC NRP1 was so low, alm"

Multidrug resistance in pathogenic microorganisms is increasing at an alarming rate, threatening human health around the world. Despite the World Health Organization's declaration over 10 years ago that tuberculosis was a global health emergency, the tuberculosis problem has worsened (1Forum World Health World Health Forum. 1993; 14: 438PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, new antimycobacterial agents are needed to treat Mtb strains resistant to existing drugs and to shorten the treatment course to improve patient compliance (2Basso L.A. Zheng R. Musser J.M.

Nucleoside metabolic pathways are a good source of new targets for anti-bacterials, as the enzymes/pathways involved are often different from their human counterparts. One of the promising pathways for the development of novel nucleoside analogs with antitubercular activity is the purine salvage pathway. Mycobacteria preferentially use adenosine kinase (ADK) 3The abbreviations used are:ADKadenosine kinaseMtb ADKadenosine kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosisMADmultiwavelength anomalous diffractionr.m.s. deviationroot mean square deviationAMP-PCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphateF-Ado2-fluoroadenosineRKribokinaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSeMetselenomethionineF-Ado2-fluoroadenosine 3The abbreviations used are:ADKadenosine kinaseMtb ADKadenosine kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosisMADmultiwavelength anomalous diffractionr.m.s. deviationroot mean square deviationAMP-PCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphateF-Ado2-fluoroadenosineRKribokinaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSeMetselenomethionineF-Ado2-fluoroadenosine to directly phosphorylate Ado, even though they have purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Rv3307) and adenosine deaminase (Rv3313c) (4Basso L.A.

Therefore, ADK may represent a good bioactivator/prodrug target because of its inherent capability to phosphorylate therapeutically useful purine nucleoside analogs and convert them into active nucleosides (6Miller R.L.

Based on the amino acid sequence, Mtb ADK is closely related to RK from Escherichia coli (25% identity) (10Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2474-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In E. coli, RK catalyzes the phosphorylation of ribose to ribose 5-phosphate, part of the pentose phosphate pathway. Both Mtb ADK and E. coli RK are dimers, whereas all other known ADKs, including human ADK, are monomers (11Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L.

Mtb ADK is encoded by the gene Rv2202c. It has recently been identified and cloned, and its gene product has been characterized biochemically (14Long M.C. Escuyer V. Parker W.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6548-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mtb ADK phosphorylates adenosine (Km = 0.8 μm) to adenosine monophosphate using ATP (14Long M.C. Escuyer V. Parker W.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6548-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that Ado analogs, like 2-methyladenosine, act as proinhibitors in Mtb, i.e. they require activation via phosphorylation before inhibiting other enzymes involved in DNA synthesis (15Parker W.B. Barrow E.W. Allan P.W. Shaddix S.C. Long M.C. Barrow W.W. Bansal N. Maddry J.A. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2004; 84: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The minimum inhibitory concentration of 2-methyladenosine on the cell growth of Mtb was determined to be 3.1 μg/ml (11 μm) (16Barrow E.W. Westbrook L. Bansal N. Suling W.J. Maddry J.A. Parker W.B. Barrow W.W. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 52: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, the antitubercular activity of 2-methyladenosine is directly dependent on ADK activity (15Parker W.B. Barrow E.W. Allan P.W. Shaddix S.C. Long M.C. Barrow W.W. Bansal N. Maddry J.A.

It has been shown that ADK activity in 2-methyladoenosine- and 2-fluoroadenosine-resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis strains (SRI101 and SRI301) was significantly lower (<10 nmol/mg/min for SRI101 and <110 nmol/mg/min for SRI301) as compared with wild-type M. smegmatis mc2155 (3400 nmol/mg/min), suggesting that ADK is responsible for the activation of these nucleoside analogs to toxic metabolites (17Chen C.K.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2-Methyladenosine has also been shown to inhibit the growth of Mtb in infected macrophages in a hypoxic shift-down model (18Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. Infect. Immunol. 1996; 64: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by ADK may show inhibitory efficiency against Mtb in the persistent state (16Barrow E.W. Westbrook L. Bansal N. Suling W.J. Maddry J.A. Parker W.B. Barrow W.W. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 52: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 2-Methyladenosine was shown to possess fairly selective activity against Mtb, signifying the differences in the substrate preferences between mycobacterial and human purine metabolic enzymes. Human ADK shows a Km of 960 μm for 2-methyladenosine, whereas Mtb ADK shows a Km of 79 μm (14Long M.C. Escuyer V. Parker W.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6548-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Besides 2-methyladenosine, several other nucleoside analogs with modifications to the adenine ring have been analyzed and found to possess promising antitubercular activity (19Long M.C. Parker W.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1671-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For example, the fluorinated analogs, such as 2-fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, 3-fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, and 2,3-difluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, not only exhibited antitubercular activity but also proved to be better substrates for Mtb ADK than human ADK (20Pittillo R.F.

Allan P.W. Luo M.Z. Liu M.C. Sartorelli A.C. Parker W.B. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2007; 59: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The substrate-specific activities of 2-fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, 3-fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, and 2,3-difluoro-3-deaza-adenosine for Mtb ADK were 63, 16, and 81 nmol/mg/min, respectively; whereas for human ADK they were <0.5, 1, and 6 nmol/mg/min (23Long M.C.

Chemother. 2007; 59: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicating that differences exist between the substrate binding sites of these enzymes. To provide further insight into the structure, function, and inhibition of Mtb ADK, we have solved the crystal structure of Mtb ADK to 1.5-Å resolution using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). We also report the structural basis for the binding of adenosine, ATP analog (AMP-PCP), and 2-fluoroadenosine to ADK through three binary complex structures. The substrates and their analogs (adenosine, 2-fluoroadenosine, and AMP-PCP) were obtained from Sigma. A Hi-Trap nickel chelating column from GE Healthcare was used for protein purification. Crystal screen solutions from Hampton Research and Emerald Biosciences were used for obtaining ADK crystals. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—A 972-bp DNA fragment containing the ADK (Rv2202c accession no. Q10391) gene was amplified by PCR with Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA as a template. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AGATGAAGCATATGACGATCGCGGTAACCGGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGATGACTCGAGTTAGGCCAGCACGGCGACGATCTC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites in the pET28b vector containing an N-terminal His tag (Novagen). The DNA was subcloned using NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites into the pET28b vector (Novagen) to generate a recombinant vector containing a 5′ sequence encoding a 20-amino acid N-terminal His tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. After ligation, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression of apo-protein and E. coli B834(DE3) cells for producing selenomethionine-incorporated protein. For protein expression, cell cultures were grown in LB media at 37 °C. The cells were induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cell density reached A600 ∼ 0.6-1.0. Cell cultures were incubated for about 18 h at 20 °C before harvest. Selenomethionylated (SeMet) protein was prepared according to published methods (24Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were lysed using a French press, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. Recombinant ADK protein was purified by a nickel affinity column, making use of the engineered His6 tag at the N terminus. For purification buffers, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 10-500 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol were used. The His tag was then cleaved by dialyzing the protein (in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with tobacco etch virus protease. The tobacco etch virus and tag were then separated from ADK by passing the dialyzed sample through another nickel affinity chromatography column. Purified ADK was dialyzed a second time in the same composition buffer as before. Purified recombinant protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml prior to crystallization. The protein was more than 95% pure as observed by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization—Crystals were obtained by either hanging drop or sitting drop vapor diffusion methods. A protein concentration of 15-20 mg/ml was mixed with an equal volume (2 μl) of precipitant solution and incubated at 19 °C, forming a 4-5-μl drop. Apo-SeMet ADK was found to crystallize in 1.0 m potassium/sodium tartrate and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, by screening with Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton) and Wizard I and II (Emerald Biosciences). The crystals of the apo-ADK and ADK·AMP-PCP complex were obtained by mixing equal volumes (2 μl) of 18 mg/ml protein (preincubated for 2 h at room temperature with 5 mm AMP-PCP) with 20% PEG 8000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 200 mm magnesium acetate tetrahydrate. For the substrate-bound protein crystals, ADK was preincubated with 5 mm adenosine/2-fluoroadenosine for 1 h at room temperature prior to setting up crystal plates. Crystals were obtained in conditions containing 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, and 1.4 m trisodium citrate dihydrate. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The initial native data set for Mtb apo-ADK was collected at 1.5-Å resolution at APS-23ID (Advanced Photon Source) in the C2 space group (Table 1). Molecular replacement of the apo-ADK data were attempted with a search model of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase from Thermus thermophilus (Protein Data Bank code 1v1s (25Ohshima N. Inagaki E. Yasuike K. Takio K. Tahirov T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) using various programs (PHASER, MOLREP, EPMR, and AMORE). However, no reasonable solution was obtained from the whole molecule or separate domains. Therefore, experimental phases from the SeMet incorporated apo-ADK crystal were obtained using the MAD phasing method (26Ogata C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (supplementary materials Table 1). The SeMet ADK crystal diffracted up to 2.4-Å resolution at APS-23ID in the P4122 space group. Seven selenium sites were found using SHELXD with three different wavelength MAD data. SOLVE/RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) were used to refine the sites, calculate initial protein phases, and build the model. A final model was obtained after several cycles of manual model building using XTALVIEW (28McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). This 2.4-Å model was then used as a search model against 1.5-Å resolution data using PHASER (29Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Data sets of binary complexes of ADK·Ado, ADK·F-Ado, and ADK·AMP-PCP were collected on our home source using an R-axis IV imaging plate system and rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with osmic mirrors. All the ADK·ligand complex structures were solved with the molecular replacement method by PHASER using Molecule A of the 1.5-Å apo-ADK structure as a search model.

Clear electron density for Ado, 2-fluoroadenosine (F-Ado), and AMP-PCP (Fig. 1A and supplementary materials Fig. S1) was visible in the SNW map prior to any model building. Several cycles of manual model building and maximum likelihood refinement in REFMAC5 yielded the final model.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for apo and ligand bound ADK structuresMtb apo-ADKMtb ADK·AMP-PCPMtb ADK·AdoMtb ADK·F-AdoData collectionUnit cell (Å)a = 114.27a = 95.05a = 71.90a = 71.92b = 75.18b = 75.18b = 71.90b = 71.92c = 94.73c = 52.38c = 110.80c = 110.54β = 121.05β = 109.80Space groupC2C2P3121P3121Number of molecules per asymmetric unit (Z)2111Resolution limit (Å)81.1-1.557.5-1.962.2-1.962.2-1.9Completeness (%)99.8 (99.0)99.9 (99.0)97.4 (97.0)99.6 (99.1)I/σI29.0 (4.0)18.0 (4.4)19.6 (3.1)11.0 (4.0)RsymaRsym = ∑h∑i|Ihi - 〈Ih〉|/∑h∑iIhi, where Ihi is the ith observation of the reflection h, whereas <Ih> is the means intensity of reflection h.0.04 (0.23)0.05 (0.30)0.04 (0.35)0.08 (0.19)RefinementResolution limit (Å)81.11-1.557.54-1.962.26-1.962.26-1.9Reflections (working/free)104,080/5,48525,991/1,37924,855/1,29923,982/1,289RcrystbRcryst = ∑|Fo| - |Fc|/|Fo|.

The atomic coordinates of apo and binary complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the codes 2PKF (apo), 2PKM (Ado), 2PKK (F-Ado), and 2PKN (AMP-PCP). The x-ray crystal structure of Mtb apo-ADK with one molecule in the asymmetric unit was solved using the MAD method with crystals of selenomethionylated protein formed in the space group P4122 at 2.4-Å resolution. Apo-ADK also crystallized in the C2 space group with two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, and these crystals diffracted to 1.5-Å resolution. The comparison of both subunits of C2 apo-ADK with the SeMet ADK reveals that the overall structure of these protomer was not severely affected by their crystal packing; the r.m.s. deviation between these protomer (after omitting their crystal contact region (α2, α7-9)) is less than 0.2 Å. ADK co-crystals were produced after the incubation of protein with adenosine (Ado), AMP-PCP, or 2-fluoroadenosine (F-Ado) (Table 1). The ADK·AMP-PCP crystal was in the C2 space group and diffracted to 1.9-Å resolution; ADK·Ado and ADK·F-Ado crystals are in the P3121 space group and diffracted to 1.9-Å resolution. All of the ADK·ligand complex structures were solved with the molecular replacement method using the 1.5-Å resolution apo-ADK subunit as a search model. Overall Structure—Like the E. coli RK and human ADK structures, each subunit of Mtb ADK contains a small lid domain (residues 9 to 48 and 99 to 120) and a large α/β domain (residues 1 to 8, 49 to 98, and 121 to 323) (Fig. 1B). The small lid domain is formed by 5 β strands (β2, β3, β4, β8, and β9) and a short helix, α1. The large domain is an α/β domain consisting of α(9-14)/β (12Mathews I.I. Erion M.D. Ealick S.E.

The β1, β5, β6, β10, and β11 strands are all parallel, reside in approximately the same plane, and associate with α(3-8). β Strands 12-15 are also roughly planar and associate with α(9-14). The large domain makes no significant interactions with the small domain in the apo-structure. In the crystal lattice of the apo-structure, each independent molecule of the asymmetric unit forms a tight, intact dimer with a twofold symmetry related subunit (Fig. 2). The majority of the dimer interface results from the interaction of the β strands of the small lid domain that protrude from the large α/β domain of each subunit. Four of the β strands (β2, β4, β8, and β9) of the lid domain are more or less planar, whereas β3 points away from this plane forming no intrasubunit interactions. However, the β3′ strand of the symmetry related subunit is anti-parallel with β9, completing a 5 β-stranded extended sheet (β2, β4, β8, β9, and β3′). These β strands pack close to each other, forming a flattened β barrel at the center of the dimer. The dimer interface of the 5 β-stranded sheet of each subunit is formed primarily via hydrophobic interactions (see supplementary materials Table 2 for distances) involving residues Met15, Phe21, Leu25, Leu30, Val33, Phe37, Leu43, Met44, Thr103, Ile113, and Ser115. Apart from the hydrophobic interactions, residues His13, Arg101′, His13′, and Arg101 of both subunits interact with each other through hydrogen bond interactions, forming a positive patch of electrostatic surface potential at the bottom of the β barrel. The significance of this positive surface is not clear at this point; however, it is possible that this region might bind other molecules like inorganic phosphates. It has been previously shown that inorganic phosphates can act as activators of mammalian ADK (38Hao W. Gupta R.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 889-899PubMed Google Scholar). In both subunits of the apo-enzyme dimer, the substrate binding pocket is completely open and is freely accessible to solvent; hence, we refer to the apo-ADK structure as an “open dimer” (Fig. 2A). The ADK·AMP-PCP Binary Complex Is Very Similar to the Apo-ADK Structure—The structure of the ADK·AMP-PCP complex reveals that each subunit of the dimer binds to a single AMP-PCP molecule. The ADK·AMP-PCP dimer is very similar to that of apo-ADK (r.m.s. deviation of the Cαs of the dimers is 0.75 Å). This indicates that the binding of AMP-PCP has no significant effect on the relative orientation of the substrate binding pocket, lid domain, or dimer interface. AMP-PCP is located in a shallow cleft formed by the ends of β strands β12, β13, β14, and β15, and α helices α11 and α12 on the enzyme surface. The small loop between β13 and β14 is named “small ATP binding loop,” and the loop between β15 and α11 is named “large ATP binding loop” (according to the E. coli RK nomenclature). The γ-phosphate of the AMP-PCP is positioned at the end of this shallow binding pocket, ∼5 Å away from the Ado binding pocket (Fig. 4A). The adenine and ribose rings of AMP-PCP are partially buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of residues Pro226, Val243, Glu246, Val255, Ala284, and Leu288. The N-1 and N-3 atoms of the base form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atom of Glu246 and main chain oxygen atom of Ser281, respectively. The Glu246 side chain is disordered in the electron density map; however, the backbone of Glu246 is positioned so that the side chain could interact with ei"

To analyze the biological functions of ADAM28, we screened binding molecules to secreted-type ADAM28 (ADAM28s) by the yeast two-hybrid system and identified P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Binding between the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM28s and the extracellular portion of PSGL-1 was determined by yeast two-hybrid assays, binding assays of the domain-specific recombinant ADAM28s species using PSGL-1 stable transfectants and leukocyte cell lines expressing native PSGL-1 (HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells), and co-immunolocalization and co-immunoprecipitation of the molecules in these cells. Incubation of HL-60 cells with recombinant ADAM28s enhanced the binding to P-selectin-coated wells and P-selectin-expressing endothelial cells. In addition, intravenous injection of ADAM28s-treated HL-60 cells increased their accumulation in the pulmonary microcirculation and alveolar spaces in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced inflammation. These data suggest a novel function that ADAM28s promotes PSGL-1/P-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling adhesion to endothelial cells and subsequent infiltration into tissue spaces through interaction with PSGL-1 on leukocytes under inflammatory conditions.

In addition, we have reported that ADAM28 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung carcinomas with correlations to carcinoma cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis (25Ohtsuka T. Shiomi T. Shimoda M. Kodama T. Amour A. Murphy G. Ohuchi E. Kobayashi K. Okada Y. Int. J.

Thus, these data suggest the possibility that ADAM28 is involved in various cellular and tissue reactions such as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell motility, shedding of cell surface proteins, and cell proliferation. However, little is known about the biological functions of human ADAM28 and their molecular mechanisms under pathophysiological conditions. In this study, we screened ADAM28s-interacting proteins by the yeast two-hybrid system and identified P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Our data provide the evidence that the binding between the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM28s and the extracellular portion of PSGL-1 enhances PSGL-1/P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro and the interaction promotes accumulation of PSGL-1-expressing cells in the lung microcirculation and alveolar spaces in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced inflammation. Based on our results, we propose a novel pathway by which ADAM28s is involved in the promotion of leukocyte rolling adhesion to blood vessel endothelial cells and the subsequent migration into tissue spaces under inflammatory conditions. Yeast Two-hybrid System—MATCHMAKER Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 and the MATCHMAKER human lung cDNA library were purchased from Clontech. cDNA fragment encoding the disintegrin-like (Dis), cysteine-rich (CR), and secreted-specific (SS) domains corresponding to Cys410-Arg540 of ADAM28s was amplified by PCR using human lung cDNA library with the corresponding primers (Table 1). The product was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector, generating pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS. The pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS plasmid was co-introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 with the human lung cDNA library according to our previous methods (27Hashimoto G. Shimoda M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32483-32491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were plated and selected on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Robust colonies >2 mm in diameter were restreaked onto the same agar plates and allowed to grow for 1 week. This restreaking step was repeated twice more, and plasmids were isolated and introduced into Escherichia coli strain DH5α according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones harboring target cDNA were isolated, and cDNA sequences were determined using a Mega-Base 1000 DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences).TABLE 1PCR primers to construct vectorsVectorOligonucleotide sequencepGBKT7-Dis/CR/SSForward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGTGGGAACCAGTTGGTG-3′Reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATCTGAAATGATTTTCCTTCG-3′pGBKT7-DisForward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGTGGGAACCAGTTGGTG-3′Reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTGAGGGAAGCCATTGACTTGG-3′pGBKT7-CRForward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGCCATCACGGGAAGG-3′Reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCTGGTCCCCACAGCTCTGTG-3′pGBKT7-SSForward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTAGGAGGACAAATCCTTTCC-3′Reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCAGCAACCCTAAAACCAACCTC-3′pCMVTag4a-PSGL-1Forward, 5′-CCGGAATTCGTGCCATGCCTCTGCAAC-3′Reverse, 5′-ACGCGTCGACAGGGAGGAAGCTGTGCAGG-3′pCMVTag4a-Pro/MetForward, 5′-GGAATTCCCCAGCATGTTGCAAGGTCTC-3′Reverse, 5′-ACGCGTCGACAATTGGAGTGGATATGATATCTGTAGG-3′pCMVTag4a-Dis/CR/SS Signal peptideForward, 5′-GGAATTCCCCAGCATGTTGCAAGGTCTC-3′Reverse, 5′-ACGCAGATCTAGCACTTACTGCAACAGAGAG-3′Dis/CR/SS domainsForward, 5′-ACGCAGATCTATTTGTGGGAACCAGTTGG-3′Reverse, 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCTGAAATGATTTTCCTTCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—cDNA fragments encoding the Dis, CR, or SS domain of ADAM28s were amplified by PCR using pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS plasmid with the corresponding primers (Table 1).

Establishment of Stable Transfectants Expressing PSGL-1—cDNA encoding human full-length PSGL-1 was prepared by PCR from the cDNAs derived from HL-60 cells (a human myeloid cell line) using the corresponding primers (Table 1), and cloned into pCMVTag4a (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), generating pCMVTag4a-PSGL-1. Stable transfectants expressing PSGL-1 or mock transfectants were prepared by transfection of pCMVTag4a-PSGL-1 or pCMVTag4a vector alone to COS7 cells as described previously (28Shiomi T. Inoki I. Kataoka F. Ohtsuka T. Hashimoto G. Nemori R. Okada Y. Lab. Investig. 2005; 85: 1489-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and 35 stable transfectants were established. The expression of PSGL-1 and ADAM28 in COS7 cells, mock transfectants, and PSGL-1 transfectants was examined by immunoblotting with anti-PSGL-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (KPL1 mAb; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ADAM28 mAb (297-2F3) specific to the metalloproteinase domain of ADAM28 (25Ohtsuka T.

The fragments were cloned into EcoRI/SalI-digested pCMV-Tag4a vector to fuse the signal peptide to the amino terminus of the Dis/CR/SS domains, generating pCMVTag4a-Dis/CR/SS. The FLAG-tagged cDNA fragments encoding ADAM28s species were subcloned into pFASTBac1 vector (Invitrogen), generating pFASTBac1-pro-ADAM28s, pFASTBac1-Pro/Met, and pFASTBac1-Dis/CR/SS. The vectors were infected to insect Sf9 cells, and the recombinant full-length pro-ADAM28s (rpro-ADAM28s) and its deletion mutants consisting of the Dis, CR, and SS domains (rDis/CR/SS) or the Pro and Met domains (rPro/Met) were purified by anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gels (Sigma) according to our previous methods (14Mochizuki S.

A similar binding assay was performed with HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells (a T-lymphoma cell line). The competitive inhibition study was performed by incubation of stable transfectants, HL-60 cells, and Jurkat cells with a 10-fold excess amount of nonlabeled rADAM28s species prior to the binding assay. The binding assay was also carried out in the presence of 1 μm KB-R7785, an ADAM inhibitor (a gift by Dr. Koichiro Yoshino, Carnabioscience, Kobe, Japan) (8Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y.

For the inhibition studies, these cells were incubated with anti-PSGL-1 mAb (KPL1 mAb or PL1 mAb; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PSGL-1 polyclonal Ab (H-300 Ab; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or non-immune IgG prior to the binding assays. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cell suspensions of HL-60 and Jurkat cells were incubated with rpro-ADAM28s in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS) or buffer alone. After incubation with anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) or nonimmune mouse IgG, they were plated on glass slides, fixed with methanol/acetone/formaldehyde (27Hashimoto G. Shimoda M. Okada Y. J. Biol.

The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with KPL1 mAb as described above. 125I-Labeled rpro-ADAM28s on the same membranes was detected by an imaging plate and the BAS-2000 system (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Adhesion Assay of HL-60 Cells to Immobilized P-selectin—Prior to the adhesion assay, the glycosylation patterns of PSGL-1 in HL-60 and Jurkat cells were examined by flow cytometry using CSLEX-1 Ab (BD Biosciences) and NCC-ST-439 Ab (Nippon Kayaku Co., Tokyo, Japan), which recognize sialyl-Lewis X and both nonsulfated and 6-sulfated sialyl-Lewis X on core 2-type O-glycans, respectively. Microtiter plates (NalgeNunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with human P-selectin (R & D Systems) or bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Suspensions of HL-60 cells, which were labeled with 2′,7′-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein tetrakis (acetoxymethyl) ester (BCECF-AM; Sigma) (30Hirose M. Kawashima H. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), were incubated with rpro-ADAM28s, rDis/CR/SS, or rPro/Met and allowed to adhere to the microtiter plates for 10 min at 4 °C. The adherent cells were observed by an inverted microscope, and a percentage of adherent cells to added cells was calculated by quantitating the fluorescence intensity (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan). For inhibition studies, the cells were incubated with rpro-ADAM28s in the presence of H-300 Ab, KPL1 mAb, or nonimmune IgG prior to the adhesion assay. Similarly, the adhesion assay was performed with active rADAM28s (14Mochizuki S. Shimoda M. Shiomi T. Fujii Y. Okada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Suspensions of BCECF-AM-labeled HL-60 cells were reacted with rpro-ADAM28s, rDis/CR/SS, rPro/Met, active rADAM28s, or buffer alone, distributed over the plates of HUVECs, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with shaking at 60 rpm with an orbital shaker (Taitec, Saitama, Japan) (33Kameda H. Morita I. Handa M. Kaburaki J. Yoshida T. Mimori T. Murota S. Ikeda Y. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells attached to HUVECs were observed by an inverted microscope, and the fluorescence intensity of the cell lysates was measured. Inhibition studies using anti-PSGL-1 Abs (H-300 Ab and KPL1 mAb) or nonimmune IgG were also performed. Adhesion and Transendothelial Migration Study of HL-60 Cells in a Mouse Model—Systemic inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) or phosphate-buffered saline in adult C57BL/6 mice (9-10 weeks; SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) 18 h prior to the experiments (34Friederichs J.

BCECF-AM-labeled HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 25 mm HEPES were incubated with rpro-ADAM28s, rDis/CR/SS, rPro/Met, or buffer alone and then injected into mouse tail veins. After 12 h, the lungs were resected under deep anesthesia. Frozen sections were examined by a fluorescence microscope, and the number of HL-60 cells per1mm2 of the lung tissues from six mice in each group was determined by counting fluorescent cells in at least 10 distinct sections per animal. For the inhibition study, mice were treated with neutralizing anti-P-selection mAb (RB40.34 mAb; BD Biosciences) 2 h before the cell injection (36Kunkel E.J. Jung U. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1391-H1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To localize the endothelial cells, frozen sections fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were subjected to immunofluorescent staining using rat anti-CD31 mAb (MEC13.3; BD Biosciences) and rhodamine-conjugated secondary Ab (Immunotech). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were prepared (37Reutershan J. Basit A. Galkina E.V. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: L807-L815Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence intensity of the cell pellets was measured by plate reader. Care of the animals was in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Keio University School of Medicine, and our experiments have been approved by the University Animal Welfare Committee. Statistical Analysis—Results between the two independent groups were determined by the Student's t test. Comparisons among more than three groups were determined by the Bonferroni/Dunn test. Statistical analyses were carried out using StatView statistical software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC) on a personal computer. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Screening of Proteins That Interact with ADAM28s and Determination of Its Interacting Domain—To seek binding proteins to ADAM28s, we screened 1.0 × 107 clones of human lung cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system using a cDNA fragment encoding the Dis, CR, and SS domains of ADAM28s as bait (Fig. 1A), and isolated 215 positive clones. Among the clones, five were identified as human PSGL-1; they encoded the decamer repeats, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of PSGL-1. Then we further performed yeast two-hybrid assays to determine the ADAM28s domain involved in the binding with PSGL-1. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, plasmid DNAs encoding different domains of ADAM28s (pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS, pGBKT7-Dis, pGBKT7-CR, and pGBKT7-SS) were co-introduced with that encoding full-length PSGL-1 (pACT2-PSGL-1) into S. cerevisiae strain AH109. The yeast transformants of pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS or pGBKT7-Dis with pACT2-PSGL-1 and positive control transformants expressing p53 and SV40 showed definite growth on high stringency plates, whereas only negligible background growth was observed with those of pGBKT7-CR, pGBKT7-SS, or pGBKT7 vector alone (negative control) with pACT2-PSGL-1 (Fig. 1B). When the α-galactosidase activity of each transformants was measured, the transformants of pGBKT7-Dis/CR/SS or pGBKT7-Dis with pACT2-PSGL-1 showed higher activity as compared with other transformants (Fig. 1C). These data strongly suggest that the Dis domain of ADAM28s interacts with PSGL-1. Binding of Recombinant ADAM28s Species to PSGL-1-expressing Cells—The expression levels of PSGL-1 in th"

Although many chemokine amino acid residues involved in binding have been identified, much less is known about the bound regions of GAG. Heparan sulfate (HS) is the predominant cell surface GAG, and its heterogeneous nature offers proteins a variety of structural motifs with which to interact. In the present study, we describe the interactions of three CC chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, with HS-derived oligosaccharides. To this end, we generated and characterized a complex HS octasaccharide library containing 17 different octasaccharide compositions based on acetyl and sulfate group content. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to detect chemokine-HS octasaccharide complexes in the bound state, and an affinity purification protocol was used to select and identify chemokine-binding octasaccharides from the complex mixture. The results indicate that HS octasaccharide sulfation is the foremost requirement for chemokine binding. However, within octasaccharides of constant charge density, acetylation is also observed to augment binding, suggesting that there may be as yet undiscovered specificity in the chemokine-HS interaction.

Chemokines are a large class of cytokines that direct leukocyte migration during various physiological processes, including routine immune surveillance, development, and inflammation (1Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These proteins exert their various functions by binding to and signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors within the leukocyte plasma membrane. Prior to signal transduction, chemokines are retained near their site of production by a separate interaction with cell surface and extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 2The abbreviations used are:GAGglycosaminoglycanCCR2CC chemokine receptor 2HSheparan sulfateMCP-1, -2, and -3monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1, 2, and 3CCL2, -8, and -7CC chemokine family ligands 2, 8, and 7ESIelectrospray ionizationFTICR MS or FTMSFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometryHAhyaluronanα-d-GlcNAc, α-d-N-acetylglucosamineβ-d-GlcAβ-d-glucuronic acidl-IdoAl-iduronic acid.

This property also seems to be required for in vivo activity, and can be induced by GAG binding (4Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.

GAGs are complex, linear, anionic, polysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units (8Taylor K.R. Gallo R.L. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 9Varki A.

GAGs are broadly classified into four families, based on sugar composition, glycosidic bond linkage, and presence of specific structural modifications. These four families are as follows: heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronan. Heparin and HS (along with hyaluronan) are the principle protein-binding GAGs (9Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.1999: 145-149Google Scholar). Due to differences in localization of the heparinoids (heparin and HS), HS is thought to be the more relevant protein binding GAG. Heparin is produced exclusively in mast cells, cleaved to 15-kDa fragments, and sequestered in intracellular granules. Alternatively, HS is expressed by virtually all cell types as the glycan module of HS proteoglycans (9Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.1999: 145-149Google Scholar, 10Noti C. Seeberger P.H. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 731-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Depending on the protein core, HS proteoglycans are either secreted or tethered to the plasma membrane, displaying their HS on the outer face (9Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H.

During synthesis, residues within the polymer can undergo several modification reactions, including N-deacetylation/N-sulfation, epimerization of d-GlcA to l-iduronic acid (l-IdoA), 2-O-sulfation of the uronic acid, and both 3- and 6-O-sulfation of the substituted glucosamine (12Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). With the exception of 3-O-sulfation, heparin is heavily modified by each of the previous reactions. On the other hand, HS modifications, although tissue specific, are predominantly present at low levels. Sparse modification allows HS to display greater disaccharide sequence variability than heparin, which may facilitate specific protein interactions (12Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

More than one hundred known heparin-binding proteins exist (11Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar). Despite this, and due to the issue of localization, HS can be considered the major physiological interaction partner for the majority of heparin-binding proteins discovered in vitro. That heparin is so commonly used in biochemical assays may reflect its abundance, commercial availability, and relative simplicity when compared with HS (14Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The same heterogeneity within HS that can facilitate specific protein interactions also convolutes many analyses. Thus the choice of the more tractable heparin substrate is often made, despite the coincident loss of HS sequence information. So while heparin-based studies are generally quite valuable, more detailed investigations require the utilization of HS. Previously, our laboratory developed a series of complementary techniques designed to screen protein-GAG interactions using a combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS or simply FTMS) and affinity purification with MS detection (15Yu Y.

These techniques rely on both the ability of ESI to transfer intact non-covalent complexes from solution to the gas phase and on the high resolving power of FTMS (16Loo J.A. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 17Smith R.D. Bruce J.E. Wu Q.Y. Lei Q.P. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1997; 26: 191-202Crossref Google Scholar, 18Sobott F. McCammon M.G. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Philos. Transact. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363 (discussion 389–391): 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). The aforementioned methods were developed using a commercially available heparin octasaccharide library on the basis that octasaccharides were previously shown to be an ideal size for binding chemokine oligomers (6Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E. Borlat F. Kungl A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22294-22305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the present study we extend these and new methods of analysis toward the examination of chemokine-HS interactions. Generation and characterization of a library of sulfate-bearing HS octasaccharides allowed us to observe the interactions of three CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) ligands, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, with specific HS octasaccharides. FTICR MS was effectively used to detect the extent of sulfation and acetylation on each chemokine-bound saccharide. We observed that, although each chemokine is able to bind HS octasaccharides of moderate sulfation, they all preferentially bind to saccharides of increasing sulfation. Interestingly, among octasaccharides of constant sulfation (and charge density), each chemokine favored interactions with the more acetylated species. These observations offer new insights as to possible mechanisms of chemokine-HS binding and afford direction for future study. Materials‒Porcine intestinal HS was purchased from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH), and Arixtra™ (fondaparinux sodium) was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC). Bio-Gel® P-10 gel was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) and prepared via the manufacturer's instructions. Heparinase III (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8) was a gracious gift from Prof. Ram Sasisekharan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific. CCR2 ligands, MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3, were expressed and purified as previously described (15Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Crown S.E. Hsu A.R. Handel T.M. Leary J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32200-32208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HS Depolymerization‒HS was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and extensively depolymerized at 37 °C using heparinase III. Heparinase III cleaves preferentially at regions of low sulfation generating a C4–C5 double bond on the uronic acid residue of newly generated nonreducing ends (19Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1986; 12: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Sulfated oligosaccharides are enriched by prolonged cleavage, which completely cleaves unsulfated regions to their disaccharide building blocks. After 20 h, the HS/heparinase III reaction was quenched by mixing 50:50 with methanol and boiling for 10 min. The product mixture was then frozen at –80 °C and freeze-dried. HS Oligosaccharide Size-exclusion Chromatography‒Depolymerized HS was redissolved in water and mixed with ammonium bicarbonate to 1 m NH4-HCO3 final concentration. The solution was then injected onto a 170 × 1.5 cm Econo-Column® (Bio-Rad) loaded with P-10 size-exclusion gel. The chromatographic separation was performed under gravity flow conditions at room temperature in 20 mm NH4HCO3. The flow rate varied between 1 and 3 ml/h, and fractions were collected at 30-min intervals. Separation was monitored by absorbance online at 254 nm and verified offline at 232 nm in 96-well plates. All fractions were lyophilized using an Eppendorf Vacufuge™ (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Preparation of HS Oligosaccharides for Analysis‒Lyophilized fractions were dissolved in 100 μl of Millipore H2O. These fractions were desalted by dialysis, at room temperature, against Millipore H2O using a 1-kDa molecular weight cut-off Dispo-Biodialyzer™ (The Nest Group, Inc., Southborough, MA). The absorbance of each desalted fraction was recorded in 0.03 m HCl at 232 nm and converted to concentration using the extinction coefficient of 5,500 m– cm–1. ESI FTICR of HS Oligosaccharides‒Mass spectra of all oligosaccharides were acquired on an APEX II 7-tesla FTICR mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) equipped with an Apollo (Bruker) electrospray ion source using negative ion mode detection. A 60 μm solution of each desalted fraction was prepared in 50:50 H2O:MeOH with 5 mm NH4OH. A low concentration of NH4OH (or NH4OAc) is used to prevent desulfation during the ESI process (21Saad O.M. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1274-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 1 μl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Nebulizing and drying gas pressures were maintained at 35 and 25 p.s.i., respectively. A capillary exit voltage of –25.8 V was used during desolvation. Approximately 128 broadband time domain transients containing 1,024,000 data points were averaged and subjected to zerofill, Gaussian multiplication, and fast Fourier transform. The parameters of the ESI source, ion optics, and ICR cell were optimized to maximize signal intensity while minimizing cation adduction and desulfation of oligosaccharides. The mass spectrum of the HS octasaccharide library was calibrated externally using the pharmaceutical GAG analog Arixtra™. All data were acquired and processed using Xmass version 6.0.0 (Bruker). Oligosaccharide composition was determined from the monoisotopic mass using HOST software (22Saad O.M. Leary J.A. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 5902-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CCR2 Ligand-HS Oligosaccharide Noncovalent Complex Assembly and Analysis‒Filtration trapping assay and ESI-FTICR of non-covalent protein-oligosaccharide complexes were performed as previously described (15Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Crown S.E. Hsu A.R. Handel T.M. Leary J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32200-32208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μm HS octasaccharide library was incubated with 40 μm chemokine in 100 μl of 100 mm NH4OAc. The buffer was successively exchanged with three 1-ml volumes of 200 mm NH4OAc. A 10-kDa centrifugal molecular weight cut-off filter was employed to retain non-covalent chemokine-octasaccharide complexes while allowing free saccharides to be filtered through (Millipore). At the conclusion of filtration steps, ∼100 μl of solution containing free chemokine and chemokine-octasaccharides complexes remained. This solution was infused into the ESI-FTICR mass spectrometer using positive ion detection. Acquisition parameters were the same as those previously described (15Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Crown S.E. Hsu A.R. Handel T.M. Leary J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32200-32208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to the filtration trapping experiments, 20 μm MCP-2 was mixed with a 55 μm concentration of HS octasaccharide library in 200 mm NH4OAc and infused directly into the ESI-FTICR mass spectrometer. Our previous work (MS and isothermal titration calorimetry) indicates that chemokines bind oligosaccharides with low micromolar affinity (23Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), however millimolar binding affinities are theoretically accessible by MS-based methods (24Hofstadler S.A. Sannes-Lowery K.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We also stress the requirement that non-covalent protein-ligand complexes (here chemokine-GAG) must be electrosprayed from a buffered aqueous solution. Traditional organic solvent systems employed in MS denature proteins of interest destroying there activity and binding properties. Likewise other denaturing conditions, such as low pH, have been observed to destroy chemokine-GAG binding, and the corresponding non-covalent complexes are no longer observed. Hydrophobic Trapping/Chemokine-based Affinity Enrichment of HS Octasaccharides‒Hydrophobic trapping/elution was performed as previously described with minor modifications (15Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Crown S.E. Hsu A.R. Handel T.M. Leary J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32200-32208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A mixture of 80 μm chemokine and 100 μm HS octasaccharide-library was prepared in 100 μl of 100 mm NH4OAc. The solution was then loaded onto a pre-conditioned Oasis solid-phase extraction cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). Oligosaccharides not specifically bound to protein were eluted by flushing the cartridge with three successive 1-ml volumes of 200 mm NH4OAc. Finally the chemokine-binding HS-oligosaccharides were eluted from the cartridge-bound chemokine via a high stringency wash with 1.25 ml of 760 mm NH4OAc and collected separately. The product solution was lyophilized, resuspended in 100 μl of water, and subject to dialysis against Millipore H2O to remove salt impurities. After dialysis, sample volume and absorbance were recorded prior to concentrating each sample to ∼5 μl. The samples were then diluted in 35 μl of 50:50 H2O:MeOH with 5 mm NH4OH and infused into the electrospray source for FTMS detection. At the time of infusion, the sample concentrations were ∼10–15 μm. Instrumental parameters were identical to those used for analysis of HS size-exclusion fractions. Isolation of Sulfated HS Octasaccharides‒HS saccharides were effectively separated by P-10 size-exclusion chromatography. The largest components included in the gel began to elute at 16 h post injection, while the disaccharides eluted last between 75 and 100 h. Within this range, three peaks contained relatively pure mixtures of hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharides (Fig. 1). Three of the fractions, 62, 63, and 64, within the DP8 peak profile, contained the same octasaccharides, in similar relative abundances, and were pooled to create a working mixture for all subsequent experiments. This mixture is referred to as the HS octasaccharide library. ESI-FTICR Analysis of HS Octasaccharide Library‒Seventeen different octasaccharide compositions were identified in the HS octasaccharide library and differed in acetyl and sulfate group content (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The library varied in sulfate content from 3 to 10 per octasaccharide, while acetyl group content ranged from 0 to 2 (Table 1). Several isomers likely exist for each composition identified, and the structure for a generic lyase-generated HS octasaccharide is illustrated in Fig. 3. Important is the fact that these compositions are indicative of successful enrichment for sulfated regions of the HS polymer, given that porcine intestinal HS is composed of ∼75% unsulfated disaccharides (25Griffin C.C.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Isolation of these regions is essential in identifying physiologically relevant ligand binding sites, as the majority of HS-binding proteins are known to bind either the sulfate-rich S-domains or their flanking mixed sequences (11Conrad H.E.

Each resulting mixture was placed in the sample compartment of a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filter, and the buffer was exchanged three times over ∼1.5 h. During this time, non-bound octasaccharides were washed through the filter and discarded. Unfortunately, MCP-2 consistently precipitated from solution during this procedure. However, both MCP-1 and MCP-3 remained in solution for MS analysis. The final solutions (∼100 μl) contained both free chemokine and non-covalent complexes between each chemokine and members of the HS octasaccharide library as determined by ESI-FTICR MS. MCP-3 is a monomer in solution and bound octasaccharides as a monomer. MCP-1, normally in monomer/dimer equilibrium in solution, bound HS octasaccharides only as a dimer (Table 2), consistent with previous binding studies using heparin (15Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M.

Both chemokines, MCP-1 and MCP-3, bound to HS octasaccharides containing moderate to relatively high sulfation. MCP-3 was observed in complex with octasaccharides of six compositions; (i.e. 6–9 sulfates and 0–2 acetyl groups, Fig. 4, Table 2). MCP-1 was also observed in complex with octasaccharides of six compositions. The sulfate content for MCP-1-bound saccharides observed by filtration assay ranged from 5 to 7, and acetyl groups from 1 to 2 (Table 2). In both cases, the most intense ions corresponding to non-covalent assemblies could be observed alone as well as complexed with a Na+ ion.TABLE 2Summary of chemokine-HS octasaccharide non-covalent complexes observed in the filtration trapping assay (MCP-1 and -3) and by direct infusion (MCP-2)Chemokine mass (monomer)Oligomerization stateComposition of bound HS-octasaccharidesAloneHS-boundSulfate contentAcetyl group contentDaMCP-1/CCL2 (8662.5)Monomer/dimer equilibriumDimer51 and 261 and 271 and 2MCP-2/CCL8aThe concentrations employed to observe non-covalent complexes between MCP-2 and the HS-octasaccharides by direct infusion were significantly lower than those used in the filtration trapping assay for MCP-1 and -3, and presentation of these results together is not meant for direct comparison.

Open table in a new tab Although MCP-2 precipitated under the conditions employed in the filtration trapping experiment, this chemokine could be mixed with the HS octasaccharide library, albeit at lower concentrations, and directly infused into the electrospray source for MS detection. In this instance, MCP-2 was observed as a dimer bound to octasaccharides with 1 acetyl group and both 6 and 7 sulfate groups (Table 2). It is worth noting that these saccharides were also present in the most abundant complexes with MCP-1 and MCP-3 after filtration trapping. Hydrophobic Trapping and Elution of Chemokine-bound Saccharides‒Octasaccharides of various compositions were retained in this assay based on their affinity for each chemokine under investigation. By comparing the spectrum of the library alone (acquired at 15 μm) to each spectrum acquired after chemokine-based affinity enrichment, a clear shift to octasaccharides of higher mass was observed (Fig. 5). The HS octasaccharides are present at different concentrations in the library due to factors, including differential occurrence of sequences in intact HS as well as the preference of the heparinase III cleavage reaction. The oligosaccharide mixtures obtained from hydrophobic trapping assay are also relatively complex. To comparatively evaluate these two mixtures, the mass spectral peak intensities from the hydrophobic trapping experiments (i.e. post enrichment) were compared with the same components present in the HS octasaccharide library (prior to enrichment). The quotient, Intensitypeak A-HS-library/Intensitypeak A-hydrophobic trapping, is defined as -fold intensity change. Plotting -fold intensity change versus octasaccharide mass clearly shows that selective enrichment correlates with increasing mass (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Binding preference correlates with octasaccharide mass. Absolute intensity from each peak in the hydrophobic trapping/affinity enrichment mass spectra was divided by the intensity of the corresponding peak in the HS library to generate -fold intensity change. This value is then plotted versus the octasaccharide mass. Chemokines used for enrichment are indicated. Peak intensities include Na+ or H2O adducts, if present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As stated, the number of N-acetyl groups observed (42.01 Da each) ranged from 0 to 2, contributing between 0 and 84.02 Da to the mass of any given octasaccharide. The number of sulfate modifications (79.97 Da each) varied from 3 to 10, contributing between 239.91 and 799.7 Da to octasaccharide mass. Thus increasing octasaccharide mass is primarily due to sulfation and selective octasaccharide enrichment correlates with that sulfation. However, detailed analysis reveals that, among octasaccharides of equal charge density (i.e. sulfation), acetylation is observed to augment binding. In conjunction with more highly sulfated species, octasaccharides with 7 sulfate groups were detected after affinity enrichment for all three chemokines. Within these saccharides, three variations in the N-acetyl group content were present, Octa(SO3)7, Octa(SO3)7Ac, and Octa(SO3)7(Ac)2. Despite identical charge density, each chemokine bound these saccharides differentially, with the more highly acetylated octasaccharides experiencing the greatest enrichment (Fig. 7). This relationship was also observed for octasaccharides with 5, 6, 8, and 9 sulfate groups and lends creed toward the concept that forces beyond electrostatics are involved in chemokine-GAG interactions. The work presented herein illustrates interactions of three CCR2 chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, with HS, a physiological ligand. The majority of studies addressing protein-HS interactions are undertaken using heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharide substrates. Reasons for the use of heparin may include its abundance, commercial availability, and relative simplicity when compared with HS (14Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although studies of this nature may be informative, and useful for method development, the fact remains that the majority of heparin-binding proteins may never come in contact with heparin in vivo (11Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar). Heparin is known to possess less structural and sequence diversity than HS (13Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) and, likewise, is devoid of the domain architecture observed in HS (14Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, HS presents greater possibilities for specific binding interactions with a multitude of proteins and provides experimental results that are more readily extrapolated to a physiological context. In this study, we have identified the detailed compositions of chemokine-bound HS octasaccharides and obtained information on their sulfate and acetyl group content. GAG-binding proteins generally bind to a relatively small stretch of the intact polymer (12Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), yet many studies involving chemokine-GAG interactions have focused on the use of bulk GAG polymers or nondescript oligosaccharide substrates (30Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 31Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P.

Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The results presented herein provide a more detailed description of chemokine binding as it may occur with intact HS. Reasons for generation of a HS octasaccharide library based on extensive depolymerization of intact HS using heparinase III (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8) are multifold. Heparinase III catalyzes the formation of a double bond at each newly generated nonreducing terminus during cleavage (20Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1986; 12: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Double bond formation facilitates appraisal of the cleavage reaction, quantification, and monitoring of product chromatography without further derivatization. Heparinase III also preferentially cleaves saccharides at regions of low sulfation (19Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8140-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), leaving the sulfated regions involved in protein interactions largely intact. Finally cleavage with heparinase III serves to remove an otherwise high concentration of interfering non-sulfated HS oligosaccharides, by sequentially cleaving them to disaccharides. The reaction products can then be effectively separated by size-exclusion chromatography to generate size-defined HS oligosaccharide libraries. Although 17 different octasaccharide compositions were identified in our HS octasaccharide library, each composition likely represents an isomeric population with varying functional group distribution between individual saccharides (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the exact mass measurements made possible by ESI-FTICR and have facilitated characterization of these HS octasaccharides based on sulfate and acetyl content, which might otherwise have been impossible using low resolution mass spectrometry or other techniques. Within our library, a diverse representation of sulfated and acetylated octasaccharides is present. This diversity allows us to catalog the differences in chemokine binding based on these HS structural elements. The chemokines, MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3, were observed in complex with multiple HS octasaccharide substrates. It is evident that each of these chemokines is capable of binding modestly sulfated saccharides. To our knowledge, this is the first example of these chemokines binding to such substrates, as previous studies were performed with highly sulfated heparin oligosaccharides or nondescript full-length GAGs (6Lau E.K.

Oddly, MCP-2 precipitated at the higher concentrations employed in the filtration assay. Nevertheless, the HS-binding characteristics of this protein could be observed at lower concentrations. MCP-2 shares 80% homology and 62% identity with MCP-1, including several key GAG-binding residues Arg-18, Lys-19, Arg-24, and Lys-49 (6Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E.

Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71417) Google Scholar), and given that they both form dimers in complex with GAG, it is not surprising that each displays a similar overall HS-binding profile. A cursory view of the data presented in Fig. 6, and previous studies, might lead to the presumption that nonspecific electrostatic interactions drive chemokine HS interactions. However, the sensitivity of our assays and the innate selectivity of the CCR2 chemokines allowed us to demonstrate that, although sulfation may be the principal requirement, acetylation augments chemokine binding. That chemokines might interact specifically with GAG structural elements is not a new concept (1Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 30Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge this is the first time N-acetylation has been linked to CCR2 chemokine-GAG binding. Defining the mechanism by which N-acetylation facilitates this interaction deserves further investigation. Within an HS octasaccharide there are 16 positions (12 hydroxyl groups and 4 amine groups) that may be covalently modified by sulfation. Each of the 4 amine groups can either remain N-acetylated, as they are during chain synthesis, or can be N-deacetylated/N-sulfated (rare free amines also exist). In an octasaccharide with a specified number of randomly distributed sulfate groups, the presence an N-acetyl group increases the likelihood of that O-sulfation is present. For instance, when one acetyl group is present, the sulfate groups may be distributed among the remaining 3 N-positions and all 12 potential sites of O-sulfation. Thus the probability of finding O-sulfation increases slightly when compared with an octasaccharide bearing no acetylation (12/15 versus 12/16). For the CCR2 chemokines, both octasaccharide sulfation and acetylation correlate with binding. Because each N-acetyl group present increases the probability that the sulfates are on the O-positions, this may indicate that O-sulfation is more relevant than N-sulfation in CCR2 ligand binding. If so, this conclusion would be in agreement with the results obtained using chemically modified full-length heparin as a substrate (30Kuschert G.S. Coulin F. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Hubbard R.E. Hoogewerf A.J. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12959-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, the intriguing possibility that a favorable interaction occurs between a chemokine and one or more N-acetyl group(s) of the saccharide cannot be ruled out. Whether acetylation plays an active or a passive role in chemokine binding, the observation that it affects binding would have been occluded by the use of heparin substrates, in which acetylation is scarce. We have shown that, when given a choice of oligosaccharide substrates, three CC chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3) preferentially bind octasaccharides of increasing sulfation. Although highly sulfated sequences of HS seem to be preferred substrates, we have also shown that these chemokines bind acetylated species with some specificity. These data raise the issue of the importance of acetylation to chemokine binding. Although sulfation may be considered the foremost requirement, Fig. 7 provides unambiguous evidence that the HS acetyl groups are also somehow involved in binding/selection. Whether distinct HS modification patterns are involved, remains to be determined. It should be noted that the preference of these chemokines for highly sulfated saccharides could mask their ability to bind to saccharides of lesser charge bearing only a set of specifically positioned sulfate and acetyl groups. Such minimally modified saccharides would likely be of therapeutic interest, and future studies will be aimed at detecting whether they exist. We gratefully thank Dr. Tracy M. Handel and her research group for providing the chemokine constructs. We also thank Prof. Ram Sasisekharan for his gracious gift of the heparinase III enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2046146293,"Although the cost of mate choice is an essential component of the evolution and maintenance of sexual selection, the energetic cost of female choice has not previously been assessed directly. Here we report that females can incur high energetic costs as a result of discriminating among potential mates. We used heart rate biologging to quantify energetic expenditure in lek-mating female Galápagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). Receptive females spent 78.9±23.2 kJ of energy on mate choice over a 30-day period, which is equivalent to ∼¾ of one day's energy budget. Females that spent more time on the territories of high-quality, high-activity males displayed greater energetic expenditure on mate choice, lost more mass, and showed a trend towards producing smaller follicles. Choosy females also appear to face a reduced probability of survival if El Niño conditions occur in the year following breeding. These findings indicate that female choice can carry significant costs, and suggest that the benefits that lek-mating females gain through mating with a preferred male may be higher than previously predicted."

So far, computer simulations were required for statistical inferences on the distribution of sequence motifs. Here, we show that these analyses are possible using an analytical, mathematical approach. For the assessment of non-randomness, our calculations only require information including genome size, number of (sampled) sequence motifs and distance parameters. We have developed computer programs evaluating our analytical formulas for the real-time determination of expected values and p-values. This approach permits a flexible cluster definition that can be applied to most effectively identify non-random or non-uniform sequence motif distribution.

The isomerizing phycoviolobilin:cysteine-α84-phycoerythrocyanin lyase is a member of the E/F-type lyases, which, in addition to chromophore attachment, has an isomerase activity thereby converting PCB to phycoviolobilin (PVB). This isomerase activity is related to the β-subunit of the enzyme, PecF, where a short, central motif has been identified that is related to this function (18Zhao K.H. Wu D. Zhou M. Zhang L. Böhm S. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8126-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If only PecE is present, PCB is attached to PecA, and the correct thioether bond is formed to cysteine-α84, but the chromophore is not isomerized to PVB (19Böhm S. α-Phycoerythrocyanin: Dynamics of Reversible Photochromism and Lyase-catalyzed Holoprotein Assembly.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12444-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To better clarify the mechanism of the lyase, we have now studied the spontaneous addition of PCB to PecA, and the same reaction in the presence of PecE. Rapid kinetics was investigated by stopped-flow methods, and protein-protein interactions were analyzed by gel filtration. The results support an autocatalytic reactivity of PecA, which is modified by a chaperone-like action of PecE. Expression and Purification of the Proteins—PecA and PecE from Mastigocladus laminosus (PCC7603) were expressed in Escherichia coli as described (20Storf M. Parbel A. Meyer M. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Deng M. Zheng M. Zhou M. Zhao K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12444-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both products carry N-terminal His6 and S tags and were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (21Zhao K-H. Wu D. Wang L. Zhou M. Storf M. Bubenzer C. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chromatography was repeated twice in potassium phosphate buffer, which was then replaced by Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 6.0) by repeated dialysis, thereby improving the solubility of PecE. Bilin Chromophores—PCB and PEB were extracted from Spirulina platensis and Porphyridium cruentum, respectively, and purified as earlier described (20Storf M. Parbel A. Meyer M. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Deng M. Zheng M. Zhou M. Zhao K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12444-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography—Samples in Tris buffer (1 m, pH 6.0) were concentrated to an overall volume of <1 ml using centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra-15, Millipore, Billerica, MA). They were then applied to the gel column, Superdex 200-16/60 preparative grade (Amersham Biosciences), flow rate 0.75 ml/min) equilibrated with Tris buffer (1 m, pH 6.0). The eluant was monitored with a diode array detector (Tidas, Diode-Array-Photometer, J&M, Germany; 280–800 nm, measurement interval 5 s). Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (15% stacking, 5% separating gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar)). UV-visible Spectra—UV-visible spectra were recorded with a model UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Enzymatic reactions were studied in the dark at room temperature and were initiated by adding the pigment (stock solution: 1–4 mm in Me2SO) to a final concentration of 10–50 μm in the respective cuvette. Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature. Stopped-Flow Measurements—These were performed with a model SFM-300 machine equipped with two 10-ml syringes and a third 1.9-ml syringe, all controlled by Bio-Kine software (V4.21a), using a TC-100/10T cuvette with 10-mm light path (BioLogic France), and interfaced with a diode array detector (TIDAS MMS 100-1, controlled by TIDASAQ software V2.15, J&M, Germany). The reaction was followed at 20 °C with a time resolution of 10 ms. Data were collected in the spectral range 450–800 nm with data points every 1 nm, thus recording the Q-bands of the chromophore. Solutions were adjusted so that after mixing, there were equimolar amounts of pigment and apoprotein (see “Results” for details). The resulting data were imported to the SpecFit fitting program (SPECFIT/32, Spectrum Software Associates) on a 3-decade logarithmic time base with additional compression (×30) and averaged to 44 wavelength points (8 nm spaced within the range from 450 to 800 nm). This increased the signal-to-noise ratio and reduced the computational burden with negligible loss of spectrophotometric data and optimized detection of early changes. Reactivity of PecA—It had been shown before that incubation of PecA with PCB (Fig. 1) leads to an autocatalytic covalent attachment and formation of a fluorescent product absorbing ∼645 nm (23Zhao K.H. Deng M.G. Zheng M. Parbel A. Storf M. Meyer M. Strohmann B. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This reaction is inhibited by Triton X-100 (TX) and cannot be restored by the addition of Mn2+. Chromophore attachment is greatly accelerated by the addition of PecE, and further by Mn2+, which in the presence of PecE can even partially compensate for the TX inhibition (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Under optimum conditions, the PecE-catalyzed reaction is complete in <30 min, compared with several hours for the autocatalytic process (Table 1). Moreover, there are distinctly different products formed depending on the presence or absence of PecE. The spontaneous addition product, which we designate P645 due to its absorption maximum at 645 nm, is relatively weak and comparable to that in the near-UV (Qvis/uv ≈ 1, Table 2), it also possesses low fluorescence yield (supplemental Fig. S1). The product, P641, formed in the presence of PecE has blue-shifted absorption (λmax = 641 nm, Fig. 2 and Table 1). The absorbance intensity of P641 is double (Qvis/uv ≈ 2, Table 2), that of P645, and it also has a much more intense fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1); its properties, therefore, are approaching those of native PC α-subunits (24Debreczeny M.P. Sauer K. Zhou J. Bryant D.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 8412-8419Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Sauer K. Scheer H. Sauer P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 427-440Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The chromophores of the two species are nonetheless identical, when judged from denaturation experiments. Addition of acidic urea (8 m and pH 1.5) leads to products with identical spectra (λmax = 662 nm, Fig. 2B) that are also identical to that of denatured CPC, but blue-shifted compared with the free chromophore, PCB, that contains an additional double bond. Such properties are characteristic for thioether-bound PCB (Fig. 1); P645 and P641 therefore only differ in the non-covalent interactions between protein and chromophore. Apparently, the chromophorylated protein is misfolded in the P645 state, at least in the region of attachment to the chromophore. This is strikingly supported by the fact, that the low absorbance, low fluorescence P645 is transformed, by incubation with PecE, to the high absorbance, high fluorescence P641 (Fig. 2C). As a sub-stoichiometric amount of PecE is sufficient to induce this change, we accept this as the first direct evidence for a previously suspected (5Schluchter W.M. Glazer A.N. Peschek G.A. Loeffelhardt W. Schmetterer G. The Phototrophic Prokaryotes. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publisher, New York1999: 83-95Crossref Google Scholar) chaperone-like activity for PecE, by which the metastable 645 nm product is (allowed to) conformationally rearrange to the more stable 641 nm product. We observed that the reaction is independent of ATP or GTP (21Zhao K-H. Wu D. Wang L. Zhou M. Storf M. Bubenzer C. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is therefore different from that of chaperones (26Lund P. Frontiers in Molecular Biology Vol 37: Molecular Chaperones in the Cell. Oxford University Press, 2001Google Scholar), and so we use the term “chaperone-like.” The action also proceeds with the post-translationally modified chromoprotein; that is, with the chromophore already bound to the apoprotein. In this respect, it resembles, e.g. calnexin, which acts on glycosylated proteins (27Bedard K. Szabo E. Michalak M. Opas M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 245: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Autocatalytic and PecE-catalyzed addition of PCB to PecA.

Open table in a new tab Protein Complex Formation—Long-lived interactions between PecA and PecE, and the influence of Mn2+ and PCB on complex formation among proteins and chromophore, were investigated by gel filtration and subsequent SDS-PAGE. Samples were routinely incubated for 2.5 h. They were then concentrated by Ni2+-affinity chromatography, dialyzed, concentrated again by centrifugal filter devices, and subjected to gel filtration (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Individual fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of PCB, the gel-filtration experiments showed no formation of PecA·PecE complexes that are stable enough to survive workup and chromatography. There are only homo-dimers and homo-trimers formed from PecE, whereas PecA is monomeric under the conditions applied (Fig. 3, A and B). There is no significant influence of Mn2+ on this behavior (not shown). The situation changes when PCB (30 μm) is present in otherwise identical conditions. Four major species can now be discerned in the chromatogram of the incubation mixture (Fig. 3C). Most chromophore absorption co-purifies with the last (and most intense) protein fraction, which subsequent SDS-PAGE proves to possess only PecA. This band shows a strong Zn2+-induced fluorescence (Fig. 3D) and is assigned, by its absorption, to the covalent PCB·PecA adduct, P641. All earlier eluting bands contain PecA and PecE in an approximately equimolar ratio, as judged from Coomassie staining. Based on their retention times, the major aggregates are assigned to heterodimers (PecA·PecE)1, heterohexamers (PecA·PecE)3, and high molecular complexes close to the exclusion volume that fits best to (PecA·PecE)9. All these bands contain PCB (absorption at 641 nm). Obviously, the presence of PCB promotes the interaction of the apoprotein, PecA, with the lyase α-subunit, PecE. The amount of PCB present is reduced with increasing size of the complexes, indicating that it even promotes complex formation if only few of the PecA molecules in the complex contain PCB. The aggregation is analytically fortunate, because it attests to the interaction between the lyase subunit and the substrates, PCB and PecA. Catalytically, it seems unreasonable for the product to remain associated with the enzyme. Importantly, however, P641 is not the end-product of the holo-lyase because, in the presence of the PecF subunit, the chromophore is isomerized to phycoviolobilin and the properly chromophorylated PVB-PecA (= α-PEC) is then released from the lyase. Rapid Kinetics of PecE-catalyzed PCB·PecA Formation—First evidence for interaction of PecA with PecE was obtained from experiments, in which PecA was preincubated with PecE prior to adding PCB. Increasing preincubation periods result in the higher fluorescence signals of the PecA-PCB-adduct immediately after adding PCB (supplemental Fig. S5); at the end of the reaction there was no difference in the yield of the PecA-PCB-adduct. This indicated that PecA and PecE, in less than a minute, formed a complex that is competent for rapid PCB addition. Therefore, the PecE-catalyzed attachment of PCB to PecA was studied by stopped-flow kinetics with diode-array detection using two different mixing modes. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. In the first set of experiments (panels A and B), three syringes were employed to mix solutions of PecA and Mn2+, of PecE and Mn2+, and of PCB, to a final 1:1:1 ratio of chromophore and the two proteins (30 μm each), and a final Mn2+ concentration of 1.5 mm. These conditions are referred to as type I. In the second set of experiments, a solution containing PecA, PecE, and Mn2+ was mixed with a solution containing PCB (panels C and D) to the same concentrations as before, and this scheme is referred to as type II. In both cases, there is early development of a red shoulder (∼670 nm), followed by an increase around 641 nm. However, the kinetics and the details of the absorption changes differ; which becomes more obvious in the difference spectra (panels B and D). In the type I experiments, where PecA and PecE come into contact only during rapid mixing, the red shoulder appears as a prominent, red-shifted difference band, which at periods >60 s is replaced by the difference band (λmax = 638 nm), which is characteristic of the product, P641. The type II reaction, in which PecA and PecE are already in contact before mixing, shows far more rapid formation of P641. Here, the red-shifted component shows at very early times, together with a blue-shifted component. The data of both reactions were analyzed using a multiexponential, irreversible linear reaction model. Single value decompositions of the data from the type II reactions yielded five significant temporal eigenvectors, indicating that four kinetic processes occur within the observed time window (5.5 ms to 150 s). These data sets were fitted to a linear four-step model. Starting with rate constants for the slow phase estimated from Fig. 4D, fitting is repeated until a stable convergence value of 10–14 is reached. Components derived from a typical fit are shown in Fig. 5. The spectrum of the first component agrees both qualitatively and quantitatively with that of free PCB. The spectrum of the final component is that of P641, although the reciprocal rate constant for the formation of the latter (20 min) far exceeds the observation time of 150 s. This degree of correspondence gives confidence in the quality of the fit. The spectrum of the first intermediate is shifted to the red, whereas that of the second intermediate to the blue of the PCB absorption, but both are of comparable intensity. The first, rapidly formed intermediate (τ = 33 ms) was designated P650, according to its red-shifted absorption maximum. Formation of the second intermediate is far slower (τ = 0.5 s), forming a P605 species named according to its blue-shifted maximum. The last intermediate, P638 (τ = 14 s), which is not obvious from visual inspection of the data shown in Fig. 5 (C and D), absorbs maximally near the final product. Like all previous intermediates, however, it still has an extinction coefficient of only ∼20% larger than that of free PCB. The large absorption increase is therefore confined to the final, slow step (τ ≈ 20 min) related to formation of the final product, P641. Global analyses of type I reactions, where PecA and PecE come together only during rapid mixing, converged more slowly and less reproducibly, but resulted consistently in only four significant components. The spectral signatures of the initial component (PCB), the final component (P641), and of the two intermediates are very similar to the respective ones of the type II reaction, but the intermediate, P605, is completely missing. The rate constants also differ considerably from those of the type II reaction; in particular, the formation of P650 is two orders of magnitude slower. Formation of P638 is only decreased by a factor of 2. No accurate estimate was possible for the rate constant of the slowest process: it was fixed at a value (τ3 = 33 min) that results in the correct extinction coefficient of P641. No rapidly formed intermediates were observed when PCB was incubated individually with PecA or PecE (not shown). Addition of Phycoerythrobilin—PecE is also capable of catalyzing the addition of phycoerythrobilin (Fig. 1) to PecA forming a red-shifted intermediate, but the reaction is so much slower that it could be investigated by conventional spectroscopy (Fig. 6). These slower kinetics enabled us to test whether the chromophore is already covalently bound in the red-shifted intermediate. Samples taken early during the reaction were subjected to denaturation by treatment with acidic urea (pH 1.5, 8 m), which uncouples chromophore-protein interactions (28Glazer A. Fang S. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5679-5685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Scheer H. Fong F.K. Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Biophysics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1982: 7-45Google Scholar); this resulted in spectra (λmax = 586 nm) that were identical to those of unreacted free PEB. Because the conjugation system would be shortened by cysteine addition, this indicates that the PEB is non-covalently adsorbed to the apoprotein binding pocket but not yet covalently attached (Fig. 6B). Only later after the formation of the red-shifted intermediate is the chromophore covalently bound, as shown by the blue-shifted absorption after denaturation treatment. The PecA Protein—PecA alone is competent for PCB addition (Fig. 2D), which indicates that it has an enzymatic capacity to covalently add free PCB to its Cys-84 residue. This process requires no cofactors and results in a covalent bond, as shown by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Zn2+ treatment. This autocatalytic PCB addition to form P645 is a slow process taking over 5 h for completion. Stopped-flow monitoring of PecA incubated with PCB gave no evidence for any interaction of the two within the monitored time scale of 100 s after mixing (not shown). These two findings suggest that PecA alone has an (autocatalytic) lyase activity but reacts only slowly with free PCB, without kinetically discernible intermediates. In addition, the product has lower absorption and fluorescence than biliproteins like α-CPC containing the PCB-chromophore in the native state (24Debreczeny M.P. Sauer K. Zhou J. Bryant D.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 8412-8419Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Sauer K. Scheer H. Sauer P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 427-440Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar); the chromophore is, therefore, bound in a sub-optimal state. The PecE Protein—The role of PecE is to assist the autocatalytic function of PecA, which is further enhanced by the presence of Mn2+. Rather than an intrinsic enzymatic activity of PecE, this suggests a chaperone-like role that involves activation of PecA, most likely brought about by conformational changes. The strongest evidence for this function comes from the capacity of PecE to catalyze transformation of the low absorbance, low fluorescence P645 to the high absorbance, high fluorescence PCB-adduct, P641 (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). We again emphasize that this role differs from that of native chaperones, because it does not require ATP or other high energy cofactors. Apparently, thermal energy is suff"

Although the availability of clone resources is growing, current collections are either not complete or not fully sequence-verified. We report an automated pipeline, supported by several software applications that enabled the construction of the first comprehensive sequence-verified plasmid clone resource for more than 96% of protein coding sequences of the genome of F. tularensis, a highly virulent human pathogen and the causative agent of tularemia.

Cleavage at Arg372 and Arg1689 are essential for procofactor activation; however cleavage at Arg740 has not been rigorously studied. To evaluate the role for cleavage at Arg740, we prepared and stably expressed two recombinant B-domainless factor VIII mutants, R740H and R740Q to slow and eliminate, respectively, cleavage at this site. Specific activity values for the variants were ∼50 and 20%, respectively, that of wild-type factor VIII. Activation of factor VIII R740H by thrombin showed an ∼40-fold reduction in the rate of A2 subunit generation, which reflected an ∼20-fold reduction in cleavage rate at Arg372. Similarly, a ∼40-fold rate reduction in cleavage at Arg1689 and consequent generation of the A3-C1-C2 subunit were observed. Rate values for A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunit generation were reduced by >700-fold and ∼140-fold, respectively, in the R740Q variant. These results suggest that initial cleavage at Arg740 affects cleavage at both Arg372 and Arg1689 sites. Results obtained evaluating proteolysis of the factor VIII mutants by factor Xa revealed more modest rate reductions (<10-fold) in generating A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits from either variant, suggesting that factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII was significantly less dependent upon prior cleavage at residue 740 than thrombin. Overall, these results support a model whereby cleavage of factor VIII by thrombin is an ordered pathway with cleavage at Arg740 facilitating cleavages at Arg372 and Arg1689, which result in procofactor activation.

Factor VIII is a plasma protein in which defects or deficiencies cause hemophilia A, the most frequently occurring severe inherited bleeding disorder. The activated form of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, functions as a cofactor for factor IXa, increasing its catalytic efficiency by several orders of magnitude in the phospholipid- and Ca2+-dependent conversion of factor X to factor Xa (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIII is synthesized as an ∼300-kDa single chain polypeptide (corresponding to 2332 amino acids) and is designated as six domains based on internal homologies: NH2-A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2-COOH (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Hollingshead P. Wion K.L. Nature. 1984; 312: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 3Vehar G.A. Keyt B.

Moreover, preceding the A3 domain and following the A1 and A2 domains are short segments containing high concentrations of acidic residues designated a1 (residues 337–372), a2 (residues 711–740), and a3 (1649–1689). Factor VIII is processed by cleavage at the B-A3 junction to generate a divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimeric protein composed of a heavy chain (A1-a1-A2-a2-B domains) and a light chain (a3-A3-C1-C2 domains) (2Wood W.I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thrombin is believed to act as the physiological activator of factor VIII, as association of factor VIII with von Willebrand factor impairs the capacity for the membrane-dependent factor Xa to efficiently activate the procofactor (6Eaton D.

Activation of factor VIII occurs through proteolysis by either protease via cleavage of three P1 residues at Arg740 (A2-B domain junction), Arg372 (A1-A2 domain junction), and Arg1689 (a3-A3 junction) (6Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). After factor VIII activation, there is a weak electrostatic interaction between the A1 and A2 domains of factor VIIIa (9Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spontaneous inactivation of the cofactor occurs through A2 subunit dissociation from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (11Fay P.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Cleavage at Arg372 exposes a cryptic functional factor IXa-interactive site in the A2 domain (11Fay P.J.

Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contributes to factor VIIIa specific activity (13Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus making both sites essential for procofactor activation. Although it is known that cleavage at Arg740 represents a fast step relative to cleavage at other sites in the activation of factor VIII (15Hill-Eubanks D.C. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17854-17858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the role for this event is unknown. In the present study, cleavage at Arg740 is examined using recombinant factor VIII variants possessing single point mutations of R740Q and R740H. Our results indicating altered rates of generation of factor VIIIa subunits dependent upon the residue at position 740 suggest an ordered mechanism for thrombin activation of factor VIII, whereby initial cleavage at Arg740 is required for efficient cleavage at both Arg372 and Arg1689. Alternatively, factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages at Arg372 and Arg1689 show less dependence upon initial cleavage at Arg740, suggesting that activation of factor VIII by this proteinase proceeds by a different mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The monoclonal antibody 1A4 recognizing the A3 domain was a generous gift from Bayer. The anti-A2 domain factor VIII monoclonal antibody R8B12 (9Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

The reagents human α-thrombin, factor IXa, factor X, and factor Xa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Recombinant nonsulfated hirudin and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin were from Calbiochem. Chromogenic factor Xa substrate Pefa-5523 (Pefachrome® FXa) was purchased from Centerchem. Factor VIII-deficient plasma was prepared as previously described (17Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared using N-octyl glucoside as previously described (18Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The Bluescript factor VIII vector (pBS factor VIII) and B-domainless factor VIII expression construct RENeo factor VIII were kindly provided by Pete Lollar and John Healey (Emory University).Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Factor VIII—B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was restricted from the factor VIII expression construct FVIIIHSQ-MSABNotI-RENeo using the endonucleases XhoI and NotI and cloned into the pBluescript II K/S-vector. The B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was further restricted using endonucleases SacII/ApaI and subcloned into the pBluescript II K/S-vector. The R740H and R740Q mutations were introduced into the construct using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as previously described (19Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of only the desired mutation was confirmed using dideoxy sequencing. The mutated factor VIII cDNA was then ligated back into the factor VIII expression construct, and subjected to a second round of dideoxy sequencing to confirm that only the desired mutation was present. FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect the factor VIII expression vector into BHK cells. The selection, subcloning, and cloning of stable transfectants were performed by standards methods, and the cloned cells were cultured in roller bottles for protein expression (20Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The conditioned media was collected daily, and the expressed proteins were purified by SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography as previously described (20Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A one-stage clotting assay was used to detect active fractions. The concentrations of purified factor VIII proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). Factor VIII specific activity values were determined using one-stage clotting and Coomassie dye binding assays (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar, 22Varfaj F. Neuberg J. Jenkins P.V. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Resultant factor VIII was more than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with the main contaminant as albumin. Factor VIII samples were quick-frozen and stored at –80 °C.Factor Xa Generation Assay—The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (23Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the factor VIII activation time course following thrombin addition, factor VIII (1 nm) was reacted with thrombin (0.05 nm) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) at 22 °C. Samples were removed at indicated time intervals, thrombin activity was inhibited by the addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml), and the reactions were immediately assayed following addition of factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (300 nm). For the experiments assessing the contribution of factor Xa to factor VIII activation, factor VIII (1 nm) and factor IXa (20 nm) were reacted in the absence or presence of thrombin (20 nm) for 1 min. Hirudin (10 units/ml) was added, and reactions were initiated after 1 min by addition of factor X (300 nm). The reactions were terminated with EDTA (50 mm) at the indicated times. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate Pefa-5523 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm for 5 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). To assess the Ki (apparent), various concentrations of the R740Q factor VIII (0–60 nm) were added to a reaction containing wild-type factor VIII (5 nm) and thrombin (0.05 nm) in the presence of phospholipids (10 μm) for 1 min. Thrombin was inactivated by addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml), and each sample was reacted with factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (300 nm). Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation, added to tubes containing EDTA (50 mm final concentration), and processed as described above.Cleavage of Factor VIII by Thrombin or Factor Xa—Factor VIII (100 nm) was reacted with 2.5 nm thrombin in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. Alternatively, factor VIII (100 nm) was reacted with factor Xa (2.5 nm) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) in the above buffer. Reactions were run at 22 °C and samples were taken at indicted time points during the time course. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min.Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Samples were run by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus at 175 V for 1 h. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blotting. Blots were probed using the anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibodies R8B12 or 1A4, followed by incubation in a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma). The signal was detected using the ECF® (enhanced chemifluorescence) system (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were scanned at 570 nm using Storm 860 (Molecular Devices). Densitometric scans were quantitated from linear density regions of the blots using Image Quant software (Molecular Devices).Data Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three separate times and the average values are shown. Western blots were analyzed by densitometry and nonlinear least squares regression and the initial time points were fitted to the single-exponential Equation 1, A=AΟ(1−e−kt)(Eq. 1) where Ao is 100 nm; the total A2 or A3-C1-C2 generated, k is the rate constant in minutes–1, and t is the time in minutes. Rates presented were determined by normalizing the rate constant by the concentration of thrombin and factor Xa.Kinetic parameters were determined by Xa generation analysis. Km and Vmax were calculated by fitting the data using non-linear least-squares regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten Equation 2, VΟ=(Vmax×[S])/(Km+[S])(Eq. 2) where vo is the initial velocity in (nm/min), and [S] is the concentration of wild-type factor VIII in nm. The Ki for R740Q factor VIII was calculated by fitting the data to the competitive inhibition Equation 3 by nonlinear least squares regression analysis, VΟ=(Vmax×[S])/{Km×(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]}(Eq. 3) where [S] is the concentration of wild-type factor VIII in nm, [I] is the concentration of R740Q factor VIII in nm, and Ki is the inhibitor dissociation constant for R740Q factor VIII.Mass Spectrometry—Wild-type and R740H factor VIII (250 nm) was digested with thrombin (12.5 nm) in non-denaturing conditions (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 22 °C. Digestions were terminated by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration). MALDI-TOF 2The abbreviations used are:MALDI-TOFmatrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flightAPCactivated protein C. mass spectra of the samples were collected on a Bruker Autoflex III smartbeam MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer at the Proteomics Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The MS/MS spectra were collected using a positive ion mode using a lift method to fragment the parent peak. The tandem mass spectra were identified using the MASCOT program to match experimental masses to the factor VIII sequence.RESULTSCharacterization of Recombinant Factor VIII Proteins—While earlier studies have identified mechanistic roles for cleavage of factor VIII at Arg372 and Arg1649 during its conversion from procofactor to cofactor, limited information exists on the role(s) served by cleavage at the relatively fast reacting Arg740 separating the A2 and B domains in factor VIII heavy chain. To evaluate thrombin cleavage at Arg740, two recombinant factor VIII mutants, R740H and R740Q were prepared and stably expressed. These residues were selected based upon a prior study evaluating cleavage at the Arg372 site (24Nogami K. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In that study, the thrombin-catalyzed cleavage rate at His372 site was reduced ∼80-fold relative to Arg at this position, whereas no detectable cleavage was observed for the P1 Gln372 mutation. Thus, these mutations were employed at the 740 position to, respectively, slow and eliminate proteolysis at this site. Specific activity values for the wild type, R740H, and R740Q factor VIII as measured using a one-stage clotting and Coomassie dye binding assays were 2.8 ± 0.3 units/μg, 1.5 ± 0.2 units/μg, and 0.6 ± 0.1 units/μg, respectively. These values suggested a near-normal phenotype (∼50% wild type) for the R740H variant, whereas the R740Q mutation approximated a mild hemophilic phenotype with a specific activity that was ∼20% that of wild-type factor VIII.Thrombin-catalyzed Cleavage of Recombinant Factor VIII and the Generation of A2 Subunit—To examine cleavage at residue 740 and its effect on other activating cleavages in factor VIII, reactions using catalytic levels of thrombin (2.5 nm) with factor VIII (100 nm) were performed and results visualized using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Wild-type or mutant B-domainless factor VIII expressed in BHK cells is secreted in two forms, a single chain (contiguous heavy chain and light chain) and the heterodimer. These forms along with the corresponding cleavage sites yielding factor VIIIa are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A. Although the recombinant factor VIII is described as B-domainless, there is a short peptide remnant of the B-domain separating the A2 domain and the a3 segment (Fig. 1A). Results from time courses of the thrombin-catalyzed cleavage reactions of wild type, R740H, and R740Q proteins probed by Western blotting using the anti-A2 domain-specific monoclonal antibody, R8B12 (25Ansong C. Miles S.M. Fay P.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. In examining cleavage of wild-type factor VIII, efficient cleavage of both single chain and heavy chain resulted in the rapid generation of the A2 subunit over the time course.The cleavage profiles for the Arg740 mutants were substantially altered from that of wild-type factor VIII. The R740H mutant showed reduced rates of cleavage at all thrombin-sensitive sites as judged by retention of significant levels of single chain factor VIII over an extended time course. Furthermore, factor VIII heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2) also persisted with little generation of A2 subunit as compared with the wild-type material. Two cleavage intermediates derived from single chain factor VIII were detected in this reaction that were less prominent in the reaction with wild-type factor VIII. One represented a contiguous A2-light chain possessing a molecular mass intermediate between single chain and factor VIII heavy chain, and derived from cleavage at Arg372, but not His740 or Arg1689. The second was designated A2-a3 and derived from cleavage at Arg372 and Arg1689, but not His740. The origin of this latter fragment was confirmed following blotting with antibody 10104 (data not shown), which is specific for the a3 segment. The overall effect of the R740H mutation was an ∼44-fold reduction in the rate of generation of A2 subunit 3The absence or presence of the 13-residue B domain remnant on the A2 subunit is not resolved by SDS-PAGE. Generation of A2 subunit from the single chain factor VIII necessarily lacks this peptide because the cleavage at the B-a3 junction is not catalyzed by thrombin or factor Xa and the A2-containing intermediates also containing this remnant are well resolved in the gel. However, the A2 subunit derived from factor VIII heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2-B) may or may not contain this peptide, and therefore specific cleavage rates at Arg740 cannot be determined. as a result of impaired cleavage at Arg372 and His740 (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Based upon summing band densities for the intermediates A2-LC and A2-a3, and A2 subunit, all of which represent products derived following cleavage at Arg372, the rate of cleavage at this site was reduced ∼17-fold compared with wild-type factor VIII. These results suggest that slowing thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis by incorporating a non-optimal P1 His at residue 740 yields significant reductions in subsequent cleavage rates at Arg372 and Arg1689 (see also below), which are required to yield the active cofactor.TABLE 1Rates of subunit generation during factor VIII activation by thrombin and factor XaFactor VIIIRate of A2 subunit generationRate of A3-C1-C2 subunit generationThrombinFactor XaThrombinFactor Xamin-1min-1min-1min-1Wild type21.8 ± 2.69.3 ± 0.9229 ± 2230.8 ± 5.4R740H0.5 ± 0.031.9 ± 0.65.1 ± 1.66.5 ± 0.6R740Q0.03 ± 0.010.8 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab To further test the hypothesis that cleavage at residue 740 regulates rates at subsequent sites, the P1 Arg740 residue was replaced with a non-cleavable Gln residue. Results from this analysis (Fig. 1C) showed further reduced rates of A2 subunit generation. Although weak band densities for the products were observed even at extended time points, the rate of A2 generated was determined to be reduced an additional ∼17-fold with the Gln mutation (Table 1). Furthermore, because this is a non-cleavable substrate, the A2 subunit generated likely terminates with the B-domain remnant. These data are consistent with a model where the rate of cleavage at Arg740 facilitates subsequent cleavage at Arg372 suggesting an ordered reaction pathway.Cleavage at Arg1689 in Factor VIII Proteins by Thrombin— Previous results have suggested that the presence of heavy chain promotes thrombin proteolysis of light chain (14Donath M.J. Lenting P.J. Van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The above observations monitored using the anti-A2 domain antibody support this contention. To directly assess effects of mutation at residue 740 on cleavage at the a3-A3 junction (Arg1689), Western blot reactions similar to those above were run with the A3 domain-specific antibody, 1A4. Blotting data evaluating rates of generation of A3-C1-C2 subunit for the wild type and R740H and R740Q variants are shown (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). These blots were quantitated by scanning densitometry, and results are presented in Fig. 2C. Because generation of A3-C1-C2 is derived from a single cleavage at Arg1689, rates for cleavage and subunit generation are equivalent. The cleavage rate for thrombin at Arg1689 was reduced ∼45-fold for R740H factor VIII and ∼143-fold for that site in R740Q factor VIII compared with the wild-type protein (Table 1).FIGURE 2Generation of A3-C1-C2 subunit following thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of recombinant factor VIII mutants. Panels A and B, recombinant factor VIII wild-type, R740H, and R740Q (100 nm) were reacted with thrombin (2.5 nm) for the indicated times and subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting using the 1A4 antibody. In panel C, densitometry data from blots are plotted as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Panel D shows results obtained using recombinant factor VIII wild type (100 nm) reacted with a lower thrombin concentration (0.125 nm). The symbols ▴ indicate wild type; ▪, R740H; and ♦, R740Q. Initial time points were fit to the single exponential equation using non-linear least squares regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These values were similar to the observed cleavage rate reductions at Arg372 for these variants, although rates for A2 subunit generation were retarded compared with A3-C1-C2 subunit generation due to the requirement for additional cleavage at the mutated P1 740 residue to generate A2 subunit. Therefore, under these conditions, generation of A2 subunit becomes rate-limiting in the activation pathway. Overall, these results indicate cleavage at residue 740 is required to facilitate subsequent cleavages at both Arg372 and Arg1689.Identification of the Liberated B Domain Peptide from R740H Factor VIIIa—Because cleavage at residue 740 liberates a small peptide remnant of the B-domain, validation that cleavage was occurring at the P1 His residue was determined by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Thrombin digests of both wild-type and the R740H variant were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mass spectrometry yielded a peak at 1538 m/z in both wild-type and R740H factor VIII (data not shown). Using MASCOT, the peak was identified as the factor VIII A2-B junction region possessing the sequence: SFSQN-PPVLKRHQ. These results confirm His740 as an authentic thrombin cleavage site.Thrombin Activation of Factor VIII Proteins—To investigate thrombin proteolysis of the factor VIII mutants and the generation of cofactor activity, a time course of thrombin activation of factor VIII was performed using a factor Xa generation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3). The wild-type and factor VIII variants (1 nm) were reacted with thrombin (0.05 nm) for indicated times, and proteins were assayed immediately in a purified system by Xa generation. Activity of the wild-type protein increased rapidly, peaking between 1 and 2 min after which this activity level quickly decayed to ∼10% peak activity at 30 min. The loss of activity over the time course results from inactivation of factor VIIIa by A2 dissociation from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (26Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison to wild-type factor VIII, the R740H variant showed a significantly altered activation profile. Upon addition of thrombin, cofactor activity increased slowly, reaching a maximal activity level that represented ∼20% the level observed for wild type. Moreover, the characteristic peak of factor VIIIa activity was replaced by broad plateau. Although the factor VIIIa R740H appears more stable over the time course, the rate of procofactor activation is balanced by the rate of inactivation of the labile cofactor (27Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, the low activity plateau suggests a reduced rate of procofactor activation by thrombin.FIGURE 3Activation of wild-type and mutant factor VIII by thrombin. Recombinant factor VIII WT, R740H, and R740Q (1 nm) were reacted with thrombin (0.05 nm) for the indicated times. Thrombin was inactivated by addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml) and factor VIIIa was reacted with factor IXa (20 nm), phospholipid vesicles (10 μm), and factor X (300 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Symbols ▴ indicate wild type; ▪, R740H; and ♦, R740Q.

To assess the transcriptional regulation of LO, we cloned the 5′-flanking region with 3,979 bp of the rat LO gene.

(EC 1.4.3.13) is a copper-dependent enzyme secreted by fibrogenic cells such as fibroblasts (1Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the initiation of cross-linking of collagen and elastin, major structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), by oxidizing peptidyl lysine residues within these proteins to peptidyl α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde, leading to the formation of condensation products stabilizing polymeric collagen or elastin as insoluble fibers. Thus, LO plays a central role in ECM morphogenesis and tissue repair (1Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell.

In addition to the major function in stabilizing the ECM, LO also exhibits other biological activities. As reported, expression of transfected LO cDNA inhibited Ha-ras-induced cell transformation indicating an anti-tumorigenic effect of LO (2Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). LO can oxidize lysine residues in various globular proteins other than collagen and elastin (1Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Oxidation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by LO blocks the proliferation of bFGF-stimulated cells and highly tumorigenic bFGF autocrine-transformed cells (3Li W. Nugent M.A. Zhao Y. Chau A.N. Li S.J. Chou I-N Liu G. Kagan H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified mature bovine LO displays chemotactic activity for monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (4Lazarus H.M. Cruikshank W.W. Narasimhan N. Kagan H.M. Center D.M.

LO and its oxidized substrates exist within the nuclei, potentially using histone H1 as a substrate and modulating the promoter activity of the collagen type III gene (6Li W. Nellaiappan K.

Increased LO activity is associated with fibrotic diseases such as lung and liver fibrosis and atherosclerosis (1Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), whereas decreased LO activity is associated with lathyritic agent-induced emphysema in animal models (9Snider G.L. Lucey E.C. Stone P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 133: 149-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and with disorders of copper metabolism like Menkes syndrome (10Harris E.D. Nutr. Rev. 1993; 51: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). LO gene expression is regulated at the mRNA level in response to intraor extracellular agents or conditions. LO transcription is up-regulated by transforming growth factor-β1 and interleukin-1β (11Boak A.M. Roy R. Berk J. Taylor L. Polgar P. Goldstein R.H. Kagan H.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Roy R. Polgar P. Wang Y. Goldstein R.H. Taylor L. Kagan H.M. J. Cell.

Sommer P. Csiszar K. Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, environmental agents can also act upon the LO gene resulting in its transcriptional modification. For example, our recent studies indicated that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), the particulate phase of smoke, inhibited synthesis of nascent LO transcripts leading to reduced levels of LO mRNAs in treated rat fetal lung fibroblasts (16Gao S. Chen K. Zhao Y. Rich C.B. Chen L. Li S.J. Toselli P. Stone P. Li W. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 87: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcription of the LO gene is driven by proximal promoter sequences, which interact with ubiquitous transcription factors. A region of 1,865 bp of the rat LO promoter upstream of ATG was found to direct luciferase reporter gene expression. CSC suppressed luciferase activity in cells transiently transfected with the LO promoter-luciferase gene chimeric vector consistent with its effects on LO mRNA levels (16Gao S. Chen K. Zhao Y. Rich C.B. Chen L. Li S.J. Toselli P. Stone P. Li W. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 87: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although several cis-elements have been characterized in the LO promoter region for human, mouse, and rat (17Csiszar K. Entersz I. Trackman P.C. Samid D. Boyd C.D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Jourdan-Le Saux C. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Sommer P. J. Cell.

Biochem. 1999; 194: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms for their activation remain to be understood. Because the rat LO gene is widely used as a model for studies on the expression and regulation of the LO gene, it is important and necessary to further define the rat LO gene promoter. Nuclear factor I (NFI) was originally described as a factor required for the replication of adenovirus DNA and then shown as a transcription factor widely involved in the regulation of constitutive or inducible gene expression, including both transactivation and repression (20Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). NFI encoded by four different genes (nfi-A, nfi-B, nfi-C/CTF, and nfi-X) binds to the consensus sequence TTGGC(N5)GCCAA (N indicates any nucleotide) on duplex DNA as a dimer. Notably, NFI can also bind to the individual half-site, i.e. TTGGC or GCCAA, with a some-what reduced affinity. The highly conserved N-terminal residues contain the DNA binding domain, whereas the proline-rich C-terminal residues constitute the transcriptional regulation domain (20Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Four cysteine residues are conserved in all DNA binding domains of NFI isoforms, but only three cysteines are required for the DNA binding activity. The fourth cysteine nonessential for DNA binding makes NFI proteins sensitive to oxidative damage. Exposure of cells to H2O2 inhibited the binding of NFI to its DNA consensus sequence (21Morel Y. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26969-26976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutation of the fourth cysteine induced NFI resistance to oxidative inactivation (22Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The feature of oxidation sensitivity of NFI may play a critical role in the cellular response to oxidative stress (23Bandyopadhyay S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). NFI has been reported to regulate the expression of a wide range of cellular and viral genes such as collagen (24Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further understand the control of LO gene transcription, we have cloned the 5′-flanking region of the rat LO gene, mapped its transcription start sites and core promoter elements, characterized the regulatory activities in transcription of its different subsegments, and demonstrated NFI as a critical transactivator interacting with the cognate cis-element in the promoter region for LO gene activation. Cell Culture—The rat fetal lung fibroblasts (RFL6) obtained from the ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator as described previously (28Chen L.J. Zhao Y. Gao S. Chou I-N. Toselli P. Stone P. Li W. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 83: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Stock cultures were derived from the frozen cell line and passaged every 4 days. A total of six passages was used for experiments. Primer Extension Analysis—To identify start sites of the LO transcription, we first carried out a primer extension assay as described (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from RFL6 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-ATGATGCTCCCGGCTCGTCCCTGCT-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), corresponding to positions from –23 to +2 in the rat LO sequence using the first nucleotide preceding the ATG codon as –1, was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Approximately 20,000–40,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotides were annealed with 20 μgof total RNA in 5× M-MLV first strand buffer (Invitrogen) and adjusted to a final volume of 19 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate treated double distilled H2O. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 1 min and subsequently incubated at 48 °C for 45 min. Then 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 8 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, and 40 units of M-MLV RT enzyme (Invitrogen) were added into the reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were mixed with 8 μl of a formamide sequencing gel loading buffer, heated at 90 °C for 1 min, and then chilled rapidly on ice. Aliquots of samples were analyzed on a 6% urea/acrylamide sequencing gel. The transcription start sites were identified by the sequencing ladders directly parallel to the run-off reverse transcripts (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 5′-RLM-RACE—The assay for 5′-RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RLM-RACE) was performed to confirm the rat LO transcription start sites with the First Choice™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions (30Husain A. Zhang X. Doll M.A. States J.C. Barker D.F. Hein D.W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA extracted from RFL6 cells was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the free 5′-phosphate group. Tobacco acid pyrophosphatase was then used to specifically remove the cap structure from the full-length mRNA, leaving a 5′-monophosphate. Note that non-tobacco acid pyrophosphatase-treated RNAs were also included in experiments as negative controls. An RNA oligonucleotide adaptor was next ligated to the newly decapped mRNA by T4 RNA ligase. With the ligated RNA as a template, LO cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and (dT)15 primers. The resulting cDNA was then amplified by nested PCR using Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as well as the rat LO gene primers (reverse) and the adaptor primers (forward) provided by the manufacturer. The gene-specific antisense inner primer 5′-GACTCTCGAGGGTTGTCACGCAGCAGCAGAATGG-3′ and the nested PCR outer primer 5′-CAGATGGGCTTGGAGTCCTC-3′ were designed for the RLM-RACE assay based on the sequence of rat LO cDNA (16Gao S.

The 5′-RLM-RACE PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and cloned into the pBluescript II SK (–) vector for sequencing as described (30Husain A. Zhang X. Doll M.A. States J.C. Barker D.F.

Construction of Reporter Plasmids and Cell Transfection—The full length of the rat LO gene promoter and various subregions thereof was obtained by PCR using the rat genomic DNA extracted from RFL6 cells as a template. One common reverse primer and eight different forward primers were used for generation by PCR of progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region of the LO gene, which were subsequently cloned into the SacI/XmaI sites of the promoterless and enhancerless firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic. Each of the 5′ primers contained four nucleotides, GTCA, a restriction site, i.e. SacI or XmaI (labeled with underline), and a specific primer sequence, followed by a number in parentheses indicating the 5′ end position of each primer in the LO promoter region as follows: reverse, 5′-GTCACCCGGGATGATGCTCCCGGCTCGTCCCTGCT-3′, corresponding to positions from –23 to +2 in the rat LO gene sequence using the first nucleotide preceding the ATG codon as –1; forward 1, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCTGTTTGCCCTGCACATCTTTAGTAA-3′ (–3,979); forward 2, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCACTTTGGAGGAAATGAAAGAGGGAC-3′ (–3,237); forward 3, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCGAATGCACTAGGAAAGTCTGGAGGA-3′ (–1,865); forward 4, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCAGTCACAACCTCCCCCATCCCAACG-3′ (–709); forward 5, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCTATTTTGGCTTGGGCCCATGGCCTG-3′ (–598); forward 6, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCGAGTGTGTCTCAGGATGTGTGTTCC-3′ (–517); forward 7, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCGAGTGGTGGAGCTGTCCGCCTTGC-3′ (–410); and forward 8, 5′-GTCAGAGCTCAGACACTGTGCGCTCTCCCGGAC-3′ (–277). LO gene-specific sequences for the primer design were based on the Rattus norvegicus chromosome 18 WGS supercontig NW_047513 (GenBank™ accession number) (16Gao S. Chen K. Zhao Y. Rich C.B. Chen L.

LO promoter fragments obtained were restricted with SacI and XmaI and ligated into similarly restricted plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene as described (16Gao S. Chen K. Zhao Y. Rich C.B. Chen L. Li S.J. Toselli P. Stone P. Li W. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 87: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting LO promoter constructs are referred to as the Prom with a number(s) corresponding to the distance in nucleotides from the 5′ end of the promoter sequence to the translation start codon ATG, including Prom–3,979, Prom–3,237, Prom–1,865, Prom–709, Prom–598, Prom–517, Prom–410, and Prom–277. In addition, the deletion constructs Prom–1,336, Prom–804, Prom–1,865/–1,335 (containing the sequence from –1,865 to –1,335), Prom–1865/–804 (containing the sequence from –1,865 to –804), and Prom–1,865/–911 (containing the sequence from –1,856 to –911) were derived from the construct Prom–1,865, which was digested with restriction enzymes KpnI/PvuII, KpnI/EcoRV, SmaI/PvuII, NotI/XhoI and HindIII alone, respectively, followed by self-ligation or treatment with mungbean nuclease and then self-ligation. Thus, a total of 13 LO promoter constructs were prepared (Fig. 4A). Each construct was sequenced from both ends to ensure the correct orientation and fidelity. To evaluate functionalities of the initiator (Inr), the downstream core promoter element (DPE) and the NFI-binding sites in the LO gene activation, we also isolated two other LO promoter 5′ deletions such as –80/–1 and –160/–1 containing Inr and DPE core promoter elements and NFI-binding sites, respectively. The reverse primer used for PCR amplification was the same as described above corresponding to the region from –23 to +2 of the rat LO gene sequence. The forward primers for the LO promoter –80/–1 and –160/–1 were 5′-GATCGAGCTCTCCTTCGCGGGATCTGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GATCGAGCTCCGGCCGCTCGCCCTTGGCAC-3′, respectively. LO promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were created with the pGL3-Basic vector. Using these newly and previously prepared LO promoter-reporter gene constructs compassing sequences –80/–1, –160/–1, and –804/–1 (see Fig. 3A and Fig. 8C) as DNA templates, mutations of the Inr, the DPE, or the NFI-binding sites were performed according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primer pairs used for the PCR amplification were 5′-GATCTGAGTCCCTGTCTTGGTGTTTCTCCTAGCCACGTCC-3′ for the Inr mutagenesis, 5′-CGTCCCTCCCCGAGAAGCCCCGAGCCGGGAGCATC-3′ for the DPE mutagenesis, 5′-CTGCCGCTCGCCCTGAACACCAGTCCCTGCGACC-3′ for the NFI-binding site 1 mutagenesis, and 5′-CTTCATGCATATTTGAACTTGGGCCCATGGCCTGGCTG-3′ for the NFI-binding site 2 mutagenesis (complementary reverse primers not shown, mutated nucleotides labeled with underlines). Each mutation was verified by direct sequencing.FIGURE 8Determination of functional NFI-binding sites in the LO promoter region –804/–1.

https://openalex.org/W2061449782,"GABAB (γ-aminobutyric acid, type B) is a heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptor. The GABAB1 subunit, which contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, is only transported to the cell surface when it is associated with the GABAB2 subunit. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies in transfected COS-7 cells and hippocampal neurons revealed that GABAB2 diffuses slowly within the plasma membrane whether expressed alone or with the GABAB1 subunit. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A revealed that GABAB2 moves freely within the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that slow movement of GABAB2 is a result of its plasma membrane insertion. Disruption of the cytoskeleton did not affect the mobility of GABAB2, indicating that its restricted diffusion is not due to direct interactions with actin or tubulin. To determine whether the C terminus of GABAB2 regulates its diffusion, this region of the subunit was attached to the lymphocyte membrane protein, CD2, which then exhibited a slower rate of lateral diffusion. Furthermore, co-expression of a cytoplasmically expressed soluble form of the GABAB2 C terminus increased movement of the GABAB2 subunit. We constructed forms of GABAB2 with various C-terminal truncations. Truncation of GABAB2 after residue 862, but not residue 886, caused a dramatic increase in its mobility, suggesting that the region between these two residues is critical for restricting GABAB2 diffusion. Finally, we investigated whether activation of GABAB might modulate its movement. Treatment of COS-7 cells with the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen significantly increased its mobile fraction. These data show that the restricted movement of GABAB at the cell surface is regulated by a region within its C terminus.

GABAB receptors are metabotropic receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ aminobutyric acid (GABA). 2The abbreviations used are:GABAγ-aminobutyric acidFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingYFPyellow fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineAMPAα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid. Pre- and post-synaptic GABAB receptors are coupled to inhibitory G-proteins and can regulate neurotransmission via several mechanisms, including modulation of adenylyl cyclase (1Knight A.R. Bowery N.G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (2Poncer J.C. McKinney R.A. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M.

Formation of a functional receptor requires the heterodimerization of two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2 (5White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that the stable assembly of these subunits occurs, to some extent, via association of coiled-coil domains within their C termini (6Kammerer R.A. Frank S. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13263-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The subunits appear to serve different functions within the fully formed receptor. GABAB1 contains the agonist binding site on its large extracellular N terminus, and the affinity of this site for agonists is increased following heterodimerization with GABAB2 (7Calver A.R. Robbins M.J. Cosio C. Rice S.Q. Babbs A.J. Hirst W.D. Boyfield I. Wood M.D. Russell R.B. Price G.W. Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GABAB2 subunit contains intracellular loops that couple the receptor to the G-protein (8Duthey B. Caudron S. Perroy J. Bettler B. Fagni L. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol.

Heterodimerization of the GABAB subunits is important not only for proper receptor function but also for forward trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface (5White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J.

In the absence of GABAB2, the GABAB1 subunit is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum due to the presence of a C-terminal RSRR retention motif on its C terminus. The interaction of GABAB2 with GABAB1 apparently masks this motif, allowing the fully formed receptor to traffic to the cell surface, where it may be targeted to the synapse. The number of neurotransmitter receptors within post-synaptic membranes is dependent not only on insertion of new receptors but also on lateral diffusion of extrasynaptic receptors into the synaptic compartment (11Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D. Nature. 2002; 417: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Regulation of receptor movement within the plasma membrane is therefore likely to be important for plasticity at individual synapses. At excitatory synapses, lateral diffusion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors has been suggested to regulate synaptic strength following either long-term potentiation or long-term depression (12Andrasfalvy B.K. Magee J.C. J. Physiol. Pt. 2. 2004; 559: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Ashby M.C. Maier S.R. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. J.

Furthermore, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors readily exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments via movement within the plasma membrane (15Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 2002; 34: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, the behavior of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors is less well understood. The dynamics of the glycine receptor (16Jacob T.C. Bogdanov Y.D. Magnus C. Saliba R.S. Kittler J.T. Haydon P.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10469-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the ionotropic GABAA receptor (17Meier J. Vannier C. Serge A. Triller A. Choquet D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) have recently been examined. Extrasynaptically, both receptors diffuse freely, but within the synaptic compartment interactions with the synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin significantly slow their movement. To date, however, membrane dynamics of the GABAB receptor have yet to be investigated. In the present study we explored the movement of the GABAB receptor within the plasma membrane. We found lateral diffusion of GABAB at the cell surface to be slow, due to restricted mobility of the GABAB2 subunit. Disruption of the cytoskeleton did not affect GABAB2 diffusion; however, truncation of the GABAB2 C-terminal region allowed GABAB2 to diffuse more rapidly. We show, therefore, that GABAB exhibits distinct cell surface dynamics that can be regulated by a region within the C terminus of the GABAB2 subunit. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected 24 h later using JetPEI (Autogen Bioclear, Calne, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 h post-transfection before FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) analysis. Primary neuron cultures were prepared from E18 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos. Briefly, dissected hippocampi were mechanically dissociated in Hanks' balanced salt solution lacking calcium and magnesium, supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 10 mm HEPES. Cells were plated immediately onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (5 μg/ml) and cultured in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 serum-free supplement, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 μm glutamate, 0.05% gentamicin. To restrict the proliferation of non-neuronal cells, after 4 days the medium were changed to Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 3 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside, 0.05% gentamicin. Neurons were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) 5 days in vitro according to the manufacturer's instructions and imaged 48 h later. Approximately 1–3% of cells were transfected per coverslip; 8–10 dendrites from distinct cells were analyzed in each independent experiment. Plasmids—HA-tagged GABAB2 and Myc-tagged GABAB1b were obtained from GlaxoSmithKline, as were the GABAB1b-YFP and GABAB2-YFP and their CFP derivatives. All GABAB2 truncations and chimeras were generated by PCR from the HA-tagged construct in pCDNA3.1(-). The truncated forms of GABAB2 were produced by excising the EcoRV/HindIII fragment from the HA-tagged GABAB2 in pCDNA3.1(-). The different regions of interest were obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify them using the common forward primer 5′-GCA GGA CGG GAT ATC TCC ATC CGC CCT CTC C-3′ that covers the EcoRV site positioned in the third extracellular loop of GABAB2. The reverse primers covered the C terminus from amino acids 920, 886, 862, or 841 and contained codons at these positions that permitted ligation inframe into eYFP-N1 (Clontech). These were as follows: GABAB2Δ920, 5′-GCT AAG CTT GAC GCA GGG GCT GAC ACA GCT GGC-3′; GABAB2Δ886, 5′-GCT AAG CTT TGG GAG AGT TTA TAT CTT CTA TAC G-3′; GABAB2 Δ862, 5′-TGT GTT CCA CTG AAG CTT GGG ATT TTG ATC GAG-3′; GABAB2Δ841, 5′-GCA AGC TTT CCC AGG TTG AGG ATG TCA TTG AGC-3′. The PCR products were then ligated into the EcoRV/HindIII-digested HA-tagged GABAB2 to produce the protein of interest. For production of the YFP-tagged truncated forms of GABAB2 the plasmids containing the ligated PCR products were excised from pCDNA3.1 using NheI and HindIII, and this fragment was then ligated into NheI/HindIII-digested eYFP-N1. The plasmid containing CD2 fused to the C-terminal tail of mGluR1a previously described (18Chan W.Y. Soloviev M.M. Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and NotI to remove the mGluR1a sequence. YFP (Clontech) was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-GAC TCA GAT CTC GAG CTA AGC TTC GAA TTC-3′ and 5′-GAT CTA GAG TCG CGG CCG CTT TAC TTG TAC-3′ containing 5′-BglII and 3′-NotI sites. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with the appropriate enzymes, and ligated into the digested CD2 plasmid to give the construct CD2-YFP. This in turn was digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated with the PCR product obtained from amplifying the C-terminal tail of the GABABB2 subunit using the primers 5′-GTG CCG AAG CTC GAG ACC CTG AGA ACA AAC-3′ and 5′-CCA CGG ATC CAG GCC CGA GAC CAT GAC TCG-3′, after digestion with the same enzymes, to give CD2-R2-YFP. This contained the N-terminal and transmembrane domain of CD2 followed by the C terminus of the GABAB2 subunit and then YFP. To give a soluble form of the GABAB2 subunit C terminus that could be detected in cells, the C terminus of the subunit was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CTC ATC ACC CTG AGA TCT AAC CCA GAT GCA GC-3′ and 5′-CGT ATC TAG ATT ACA GGC CCG AGA CCA TGA CTC G-3′. The product was digested with BglII and XbaI and the product inserted into similarly digested pECFP-C1 (Clontech). All PCR reactions were carried out using the proofreading KOD polymerase (Invitrogen) and the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. DNA alterations to all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. FRAP—We subjected transfected COS-7 cells or hippocampal neurons to FRAP analysis to assess the lateral diffusion of expressed proteins (19Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Cells expressing YFP-tagged proteins were maintained at 37 °C and imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope with a ×40 oil objective. Regions of interest (ROIs) in COS-7 cells were circular with a diameter of 7 μm; in hippocampal neurons, the ROIs were 7-μm lengths of dendritic processes. ROIs were scanned for 5 cycles with an Argon 514 laser at 1% maximal power to determine initial fluorescence intensity before being bleached by 15 cycles at 90% maximal laser power. The fluorescence intensity of the whole cell was captured for 2 min at 1% laser power; recovery is presented as percentage of original fluorescence, corrected for any bleaching due to repetitive scanning. To examine the effects of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), baclofen (100 μm; Sigma), lactrunculin (5 μm; Sigma), or colchicine (5 μm; Sigma), the cells were incubated with the appropriate compound at 37 °C for 1 h prior to FRAP analysis. For antagonist treatments, cells were incubated with the GABAB antagonist CGP-54626 (4.2 μm; Tocris Cookson, Ellisville, MO) for 10 min and then co-treated with antagonist (4.2 μm) and baclofen (100 μm) for 1 h prior to FRAP analysis. For treatment with antagonist only, cells were incubated with 4.2 μm CGP-54626 for 1 h. For diffusion analysis of HA-tagged proteins, we incubated COS-7 cells expressing these constructs with an anti-HA antibody (kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline) conjugated with the fluorophore Alexa 488 (Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Labeling kit; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then imaged as described above, except using an Argon 488 laser instead of the 514 laser. Data analyses were performed using Igor Pro 5.05 software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) with FRAP plug-in written by K. Miura (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany). Data are presented as means ± S.E., representing at least three independent experiments/group, each group containing a minimum of 10 cells. For the region of interest of each cell, the fluorescence recovery curve was best fitted with a double exponential function with Phair normalization (20Phair R.D. Gorski S.A. Misteli T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The mobile fraction and time to half-maximal recovery (t½ maximal) was calculated from each curve. Immunocytochemistry—Following the transfection period, COS-7 cells were treated for 1 h at 37°C with either lactrunculin, to block actin polymerization, or colchicine, to block tubulin polymerization. After treatment, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed for 5 min at in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and then washed twice with PBS and twice with Tris-saline. To detect intracellular proteins, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum. To visualize actin, cells were incubated in PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h, washed with PBS, and mounted on slides. For tubulin detection, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing mouse anti-β-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse ALEXA 546 (Molecular Probes). After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted and viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope with a ×40 oil objective. GABAB Diffuses Slowly within the Plasma Membrane, as Measured by FRAP Analysis—To determine the diffusional mobility of GABAB2 at the cell surface, we performed FRAP experiments on COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a YFP-tagged GABAB2 construct. We monitored subunit movement within the plasma membrane by focusing the laser excitation at the cell surface. Fluorescent proteins within a defined region of the cell were photobleached by high intensity laser, and the diffusion of unbleached proteins into the bleached region was monitored for 2 min. GABAB2 diffused very slowly at the cell surface compared with the diffusion rate of YFP-tagged CD2, a membrane-targeted protein known to freely move within the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). To examine the mobility of the GABAB receptor, cells were co-transfected with GABAB1b-CFP and GABAB2-YFP. In the absence of GABAB2, GABAB1b did not reach the cell surface (data not shown). Movement of the GABAB1b-GABAB2 heterodimer was similar to the diffusion rate of GABAB2 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the restricted movement of GABAB is limited by the diffusion of the GABAB2 subunit. Slow diffusion of GABAB2 is specific to the plasma membrane, because retention of GABAB2 in the endoplasmic reticulum following brefeldin A treatment increased its diffusion rate (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the YFP tag was not affecting subunit diffusion, we also analyzed movement of HA-GABAB2 by live labeling of surface receptors with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies directed against HA (supplemental Fig. S1). No difference in mobility was detected between YFP-tagged GABAB2 and HA-tagged GABAB2. Diffusion of GABAB2 was also restricted in plasma membrane of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. As expected, transfection of primary neurons using Lipofectamine yielded transfection rates of ∼1–3%. FRAP analysis of neurons transiently transfected with either GABAB2-YFP or CD2-YFP revealed that movement of GABAB2 was constrained within dendrites relative to movement of CD2-YFP (Figs. 2, A and B). The mobility of GABAB2-YFP was not affected by co-expression with GABAB1 (Fig. 2C). Disruption of the Cytoskeleton Does Not Significantly Affect GABAB2 Movement—Previous studies investigating receptor movement suggest that receptors may interact directly or indirectly with the cytoskeleton. The AMPA receptor binds actin directly (21Coleman S.K. Cai C. Mottershead D.G. Haapalahti J.P. Keinanen K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shen L. Liang F.

A. 2001; 98: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), whereas in the inhibitory synapse GABAA interacts with the anchoring protein gephyrin (16Jacob T.C. Bogdanov Y.D. Magnus C. Saliba R.S. Kittler J.T. Haydon P.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10469-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Meier J. Vannier C. Serge A. Triller A. Choquet D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine whether slow diffusion of the GABAB receptor might be due to interaction with the cytoskeleton, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with GABAB2-YFP and treated them with either latrunculin (5 μm, 1 h), to inhibit actin polymerization, or colchicine (5 μm, 1 h), to inhibit tubulin polymerization. Using FRAP analysis, we found that neither latrunculin (Fig. 3A) nor colchicine (Fig. 3B) treatment substantially affected GABAB2 lateral diffusion within the plasma membrane. Furthermore, lactrunculin treatment did not affect diffusion of GABAB2-YFP in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that slow movement of GABAB2 is unlikely due to direct interaction between the subunit and the cytoskeleton. The C Terminus of GABAB2 Regulates Its Membrane Diffusion—Because recent studies suggest that the C terminus of GABAB2 might contain interaction regions important for trafficking (24Pagano A. Rovelli G. Mosbacher J. Lohmann T. Duthey B. Stauffer D. Ristig D. Schuler V. Meigel I. Lampert C. Stein T. Prezeau L. Blahos J. Pin J. Froestl W. Kuhn R. Heid J. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stabilization (25Grunewald S. Schupp B.J. Ikeda S.R. Kuner R. Steigerwald F. Kornau H.C. Kohr G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1070-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Fairfax B.P. Pitcher J.A. Scott M.G. Calver A.R. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Couve A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12565-12573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) of the fully formed GABAB receptor, we next investigated whether the C-terminal region of GABAB2 might also be involved in regulating diffusion of the subunit at the cell surface. To determine whether the presence of the GABAB2 C terminus is sufficient to slow diffusion of a surface protein, we ligated the GABAB2 C terminus (R2C) to the C terminus of CD2 to generate CD2-R2C-YFP. FRAP analysis of COS-7 cells expressing either this construct or CD2-YFP revealed that the mobile fraction of CD2-R2C-YFP was significantly (p < 0.001) smaller compared with the mobile fraction of CD2-YFP (52.82 ± 2.63 versus 80.63% ± 1.43) (Fig. 4, A and B). Conversely, CD2-R2C-YFP took significantly (p < 0.05) more time to reach half-maximal (t½ maximal) recovery than CD2-YFP (9.04 ± 1.42 versus 4.99 s ± 0.41 s) (Fig. 4B). CD2-R2C-YFP also diffused significantly more slowly than CD2-YFP in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, we constructed a soluble version of the GABAB2 C terminus. Co-expression of COS-7 cells with GABAB2-YFP and soluble R2C significantly (p < 0.001) increased the mobile fraction of GABAB2-YFP relative to GABAB2-YFP expressed alone (72.01 ± 3.14 versus 47.53% ± 3.88) and decreased t½ maximal recovery (24.28 ± 5.01 versus 53.23 s ± 5.96 s) (Fig. 4, C and D). These data suggest that the GABAB2 C terminus regulates diffusion of GABAB at the cell surface. Lateral Diffusion of GABAB2 Is Regulated by a 24-Amino Acid Region within the C Terminus—To determine which region of the GABAB2 C terminus might be involved in regulating its lateral diffusion rate, we constructed a series of C-terminal-truncated forms of GABAB2 with truncations at residues 841, 862, 886, or 920 (Fig. 5A). We then transfected COS-7 cells with one of the following constructs: GABAB2-YFP, Δ920-YFP, Δ886-YFP, Δ862-YFP, or Δ841-YFP. Although plasma membrane diffusion rates of Δ920-YFP and Δ886-YFP were similar to the diffusion of GABAB2-YFP, both Δ862-YFP and Δ841-YFP exhibited faster movement as measured by FRAP analysis than GABAB2-YFP (Fig. 5B). The mobile fraction of Δ862-YFP was significantly (p < 0.01) higher compared with the mobile fractions of either GABAB2-YFP or Δ886-YFP (67.91 ± 7.74 versus 43.24% ± 3.21 or 43.15% ± 4.39) (Fig. 5C). Correspondingly, the t½ maximal recovery of Δ862-YFP was also significantly reduced relative to recovery of either GABAB2-YFP or Δ886-YFP (7.80 ± 0.55 versus 47.47 ± 4.69 or 52.89 s ± 4.69 s) (Fig. 5C). Co-expression of GABAB1-YFP with Δ841, compared with co-expression with GABAB2, significantly increased its mobile fraction (71.62 ± 3.23 versus 48.83% ± 2.72) and decreased its t½ maximal recovery (15.6 ± 4.32 versus 31.15 s ± 4.26 s) (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that diffusion of GABAB1 is therefore regulated by the GABAB2 subunit. Thus, the region of the GABAB2 C terminus between amino acids 862–886 may be important for regulating mobility of GABAB at the cell surface. Agonist Binding Increases Lateral Diffusion of GABAB2—To determine whether lateral diffusion of GABAB2 could be dynamically regulated, we treated COS-7 cells co-transfected with GABAB1b-CFP and GABAB2-YFP with the GABAB agonist baclofen. After 1 h of baclofen treatment (100 μm), cells were subjected to FRAP analysis of GABAB2-YFP. Treatment with baclofen increased lateral diffusion of GABAB2-YFP (Fig. 6A) and significantly (p < 0.001) increased its mobile fraction relative to untreated controls (63.49 ± 6.92 versus 39.62% ± 2.47) (Fig. 6B). Co-treatment of cells with the GABAB antagonist CGP-54626 (4.2 μm) prevented the effect of baclofen on the mobile fraction (35.69% ± 4.77; p < 0.01); treatment with the antagonist alone had no effect on the mobile fraction relative to the control group (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that, although GABAB2 movement is restricted under basal conditions, stimulation of the receptor might alter its membrane dynamics. In the present study, we examined lateral diffusion of the GABAB receptor within the plasma membrane using FRAP analysis of fluorescently tagged GABAB2 subunits. We found that the GABAB receptor and the GABAB2 subunit diffuse slowly at the cell surface in both hippocampal neurons and heterologous cells. Our data suggest that the restricted diffusion of the receptor is regulated by a region within the C terminus of the GABAB2 subunit. The diffusion characteristics of GABAB differ from those reported for other neurotransmitter receptors. We consistently found GABAB to exhibit a mobile fraction of ∼40%. By contrast, AMPA receptors are reported to have a mobile fraction of >80% both in COS-7 cells (27Sharma K. Fong D.K. Craig A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in extrasynaptic regions of neurons (13Ashby M.C. Maier S.R. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Similarly, the GABAA receptor has been shown to diffuse rapidly within the extrasynaptic membrane (28Charrier C. Ehrensperger M.V. Dahan M. Levi S. Triller A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8502-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rapid diffusion is not restricted to receptor ion channels, as the G-protein-coupled serotonin 5-HT1a (29Pucadyil T.J. Chattopadhyay A. Glycoconj. J. 2007; 24: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and dopamine D1 (30Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) receptors also move freely in extrasynaptic membrane. Taken together, the data indicate that GABAB receptors exhibit distinctive diffusion dynamics. To assess the regulation of GABAB diffusion, we examined the effect of disrupting the cytoskeleton on receptor movement. We observed that the restricted diffusion of GABAB2 was not altered following latrunculin or colchicine treatment. In contrast, disruption of microtubules increases the diffusion rate of glycine receptors (28Charrier C. Ehrensperger M.V. Dahan M. Levi S. Triller A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8502-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and disturbance of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin has been shown to disrupt AMPA clustering due to interaction between the GluR1 subunit and the actin complex (21Coleman S.K. Cai C. Mottershead D.G. Haapalahti J.P. Keinanen K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J.

Our data indicate that direct interactions between GABAB2 and either actin or tubulin are unlikely to be responsible for anchoring GABAB at the cell surface. Similarly, diffusion of the GABAA receptor appears to be unaffected by latrunculin treatment (31Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I. Spector I. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2423-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and diffusion of the dopamine D1 receptor is unaffected by microtubule disruption (30Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Diffusion of these receptors is likely regulated by interactions with intracellular proteins other than actin, as movement of GABAA is restricted when bound to gephyrin (16Jacob T.C. Bogdanov Y.D. Magnus C. Saliba R.S. Kittler J.T. Haydon P.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10469-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the D1 receptor is anchored via a direct interaction with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (30Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that GABAB2 might possess an intracellular region capable of similar protein interactions. We next investigated whether the C terminus of GABAB2 might regulate its diffusion. Intracellular regions are likely to be involved in movement of receptor at the cell surface, as a recent study has demonstrated that an intracellular loop of GABAA regulates its diffusion (32Peran M. Hooper H. Boulaiz H. Marchal J.A. Aranega A. Salas R. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the C terminus of the GABAB2 subunit contains several important regions, such as those involved in dimerization with GABAB1 (6Kammerer R.A. Frank S. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13263-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), G-protein binding (8Duthey B. Caudron S. Perroy J. Bettler B. Fagni L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4162-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that attachment of the GABAB2 C terminus to a freely diffusing protein significantly slowed diffusion of that protein within the plasma membrane. Furthermore, when GABAB2 was co-expressed with a soluble form of its C terminus, the diffusion rate of the subunit was increased. Taken together, these findings suggest that the C-terminal region of GABAB2 does regulate its dynamics at the cell surface. To determine whether a specific domain within the C terminus controls GABAB2 diffusion, we constructed a series of truncated subunits. FRAP analysis of these constructs revealed that the region of the GABAB2 C terminus between residues 862 and 886 is critical for restricting movement of the subunit at the cell surface, as removal of this region significantly increased its diffusion rate. Furthermore, our data on diffusion of GABAB1-YFP indicate that the C terminus of GABAB2 regulates movement of the heterodimerized receptor. MUPP1, a scaffolding protein, binds to a motif within the GABAB2 C terminus (33Balasubramanian S. Fam S.R. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4162-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, this interaction is unlikely to regulate GABAB diffusion because the motif (residues 938–941) is distal to the domain identified in the present study. In addition, truncation of the C-terminal region of GABAB2 containing the MUPP1 binding motif did not affect GABAB diffusion. In the present study, we have identified a domain involved in regulation of GABAB movement, although the protein or proteins that might interact with GABAB at this site remain to be determined. Nevertheless, these data indicate interaction sites exist on the GABAB2 C terminus that are important for trafficking, stability, and movement of GABAB at the cell surface. We investigated whether stimulation of GABAB might affect receptor movement, as previous studies have demonstrated that movement of other metabotropic receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1a receptor, is greater following agonist stimulation (29Pucadyil T.J. Chattopadhyay A. Glycoconj. J. 2007; 24: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Pucadyil T.J. Kalipatnapu S. Harikumar K.G. Rangaraj N. Karnik S.S. Chattopadhyay A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15852-15862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We treated cells expressing GABAB1 and GABAB2 with the agonist baclofen and found that baclofen stimulation significantly increased its diffusion rate; the effect of baclofen was prevented by co-treatment with a GABAB antagonist. Agonist binding may induce a conformational change in the receptor that alters its interactions with intracellular scaffolding proteins. Our data suggest a mechanism by which release of neurotransmitter into the synapse might increase diffusion of nearby extrasynaptic receptors, thereby allowing movement into the post-synaptic density. Regulation of receptor diffusion, and therefore receptor number, is crucial for maintaining synaptic strength. Recently, the dynamics of several neurotransmitter receptors, including AMPA, GABAA, and glycine, have been described (13Ashby M.C. Maier S.R. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27Sharma K. Fong D.K. Craig A.M. Mol. Cell.

Science. 2003; 302: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). In the present study we have demonstrated for the first time that GABAB exhibits restricted movement within the plasma membrane; furthermore, we determined that diffusion of GABAB is regulated by a specific region within the C terminus of the GABAB2 subunit. These findings provide insight into the regulation of GABAB receptor movement at the cell surface and are consistent with the hypothesis that regulated lateral diffusion is a mechanism by which the cell controls synaptic strength.

https://openalex.org/W2115023989,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that transduces apoptotic signals from a variety of stresses. We have shown previously that alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G12 and G13 proteins stimulate ASK1 kinase activity and ASK1-dependent apoptosis. Here, we report a novel mechanism of G-protein-dependent regulation of ASK1. We demonstrated that G alpha13 forms a complex with ASK1 in an activation-independent manner. Both N- and C-terminal regulatory domains of ASK1 were essential for the efficient interaction, while its kinase domain was not required. Formation of the G alpha13-ASK1 complex was enhanced by JNK-interacting leucine zipper protein, JLP. Constitutively activated G alpha13Q226L increased ASK1 expression. Short-term activation of a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor that is coupled to G alpha13 also increased ASK1 expression. Importantly, prolonged activation of 5-HT4 receptor in COS-7 cells or prolonged treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin concomitantly down-regulated both G alpha13 and ASK1. Data showed that G alpha13Q226L reduced the rate of ASK1 degradation, decreased ASK1 ubiquitination, and reduced association of ASK1 with an E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, previously shown to mediate ASK1 degradation. Our findings indicate that ASK1 expression levels can be regulated by G alpha13, at least in part via control of ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2066826819,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) activity is regulated by MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), which phosphorylate the regulatory Tyr and Thr residues in ERKs activation loop, and by various phosphatases that remove the incorporated phosphates. Although the role of the phosphorylated residues in the activation loop of ERKs is well studied, much less is known about the role of other residues within this loop. Here we substituted several residues within amino acids 173–177 of ERK2 and studied their role in ERK2 phosphorylation, substrate recognition, and subcellular localization. We found that substitution of residues 173–175 and particularly Pro174 to alanines reduces the EGF-induced ERK2 phosphorylation, without modifying its in vitro phosphorylation by MEK1. Examining the ability of these mutants to be dephosphorylated revealed that 173-5A mutants are hypersensitive to phosphatases, indicating that these residues are important for setting the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of ERKs. In addition, 173-5A mutants reduced ERK2 activity toward Elk-1, without affecting the activity of ERK2 toward MBP, while substitution of residues 176-8 decreased ERK2 activity toward both substrates. Substitution of Asp177 to alanine increased nuclear localization of the construct in MEK1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that this residue together with His176 is involved in the dissociation of ERK2 from MEKs. Combining CRS/CD motif and the activation loop mutations revealed that these two regions cooperate in determining the net phosphorylation of ERK2, but the role of the CRS/CD motif predominates that of the activation loop residues.

Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15799-15808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), ERK1c (8Aebersold D.M. Shaul Y.D. Yung Y. Yarom N. Yao Z. Hanoch T. Seger R. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). ERKs operate within a signaling cascade containing several tiers of protein kinases, including Rafs, MEKs, ERKs, and MAPKAPKs (5Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.10.005PubMed Google Scholar). The transmission of signals via the cascade is mediated by a sequential phosphorylation and activation of these components, which allows a rapid and tightly regulated signal transmission. ERKs are phosphorylated by their upstream kinases MEK1 and MEK2 (MEKs) on Tyr and Thr residues within a Tyr-Glu-Thr (TEY) motif in their activation loop, which results in their full activation (10Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.-H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 11Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Upon activation, ERKs can either translocate into the nucleus to phosphorylate a large number of nuclear substrates or remain in the cytoplasm where they phosphorylate another set of cytoplasmic substrates. In addition, ERKs can phosphorylate RSK or other MAPKAPKs, which in turn can increase the magnitude of ERK-induced phosphorylation events (1Yoon S. Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These activities finally culminate into the regulation of a large number of stimulated cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival (5Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.10.005PubMed Google Scholar). extracellular signal-regulated kinase antibody cytoplasmic retention sequence common docking motif mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK phosphatases myelin basic protein 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin fetal bovine serum glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline radioimmune precipitation assay buffer mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase docking site for ERK-FXF As a central component in the regulation of many stimulated cell functions, ERKs are spatially and temporally regulated (5Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.10.005PubMed Google Scholar). The temporal regulation, which is important for the specificity of ERKs signals (4Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), is mediated primarily by removal of phosphates from the regulatory Thr or Tyr residues of ERKs (12Yao Z. Seger R. Curr. Genomics. 2004; 5: 385-393Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This inactivation could occur through the action of Ser/Thr phosphatases (PPs) (13Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), protein Tyr kinases, such as PTP-SL (14Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), or a subgroup of dual specificity phosphatases, termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) (15Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PTPs and MKPs interact with the ERKs via a D domain, similar to that of MEKs (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Upon binding, PTPs remove only the phosphate from the pTyr residues, which is sufficient to induce complete inactivation of the ERKs (17Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this initial dephosphorylation is usually followed by removal of the phosphate from the pThr residue by the PPs (18Yao Z. Dolginov Y. Hanoch T. Yung Y. Ridner G. Lando Z. Zharhary D. Seger R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PPs inactivate ERKs by removing the phosphate from the pThr, followed by removal of the phosphate from the pTyr. However PPs are not known to bind any specific docking domain in ERKs. MKPs inactivate ERKs by an essentially simultaneous removing of the phosphates from the pTyr and pThr residues (19Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition to MEKs and phosphatases, ERKs are regulated by their interaction with scaffold proteins and substrates (20Chuderland D. Seger R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2005; 29: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Multiple domains on ERKs are involved in docking interactions with its regulators. These docking interactions contribute to the efficiency and selectivity of the ERK signaling. One of these domains is the cytoplasmic retention sequence (CRS)/common docking (CD) motif (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 21Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This domain is composed of acidic and hydrophobic residues that allow interaction of ERKs with a variety of proteins by binding to their D domain, which contains basic and hydrophobic residues (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Other regions in ERKs that can contribute to MEKs binding are the hydrophobic β7–β8 and αd-αE groove (22Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), several residues within the kinase insert domain (KID) (23Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and possibly also a stretch of amino acid in the N terminus of ERKs (24Eblen S.T. Catling A.D. Assanah M.C. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another important docking site is the docking site for ERK-FXF (DEF) binding domain (25Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which binds through hydrophobic interactions to the DEF domain, mainly in ERKs interacting substrates (26Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The binding through these docking domains is reversible, as upon stimulation, phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop induces conformational change (11Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), which releases the bound proteins. Interestingly, ERKs can also bind to some proteins in a non-reversible manner, leading to sequestration from regulatory proteins (e.g. Vimentin (27Perlson E. Hanz S. Ben-Yaakov K. Segal-Ruder Y. Seger R. Fainzilber M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar)) or to specific localization (e.g. tubulin (28Reszka A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)). This binding seems to be mediated by loop L6 in the small lobe of ERKs (29Reszka A.A. Bulinski J.C. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), probably together with residues in the kinase insert domain (30Perlson E. Michaelevski I. Kowalsman N. Ben-Yaakov K. Shaked M. Seger R. Eisenstein M. Fainzilber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylated regulatory Thr and Tyr (29Reszka A.A. Bulinski J.C. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Perlson E. Michaelevski I. Kowalsman N. Ben-Yaakov K. Shaked M. Seger R. Eisenstein M. Fainzilber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Residues in the activation loop of ERKs beside the regulatory Thr and Tyr residues are important for the regulation of ERK activity as well (31Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 32Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The activation loop is a part of the activation segment, which is defined as the region between the conserved DFG and APE motifs in the big lobe of kinases (31Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In ERK2 the activation loop encompass residues 173 to 185 and contains the two regulatory residues Thr183 and Tyr185. We have previously showed that beside these two regulatory residues in the activation loop, residues 173–181 participate in the regulation of ERK2 activity as well (32Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In particular we showed that His176 together with additional residues in the activation loop are responsible for the detachment of ERK2 from MEK1 upon mitogenic stimulation. Thus, these residues may play a role in controlling the subcellular localization of ERK2 and thereby its localization-dependent regulation. In this study we addressed the role of the N-terminal region of the activation loop together with the CRS/CD motif in the regulation of ERK2 activation, activity, and subcellular localization. We show that substitution of residues 173–175, and particularly Pro174 to alanines significantly reduces ERK2 phosphorylation in vivo. We show that these residues actually plays a negative role in the dephosphorylation of ERK2 by phosphatases, but do not interfere MEKs binding. In addition, we show that these residues are also important for the recognition of ERK2 substrate, Elk1. We also found that Asp177 plays a role in determining the MEK1-dependent subcellular localization of ERK2, but not in its phosphorylation by MEKs. Moreover, we show that residues 176-8 are important for the catalytic activity of ERK2 toward Elk1. Finally, combination of activation loop and CRS/CD motif mutations reveled that these two regions cooperate in determining the net phosphorylation of ERK2, but the role of the CRS/CD predominate that of the activation loop residues. Overall, our results implicate several residues within the activation loop of ERK2 in regulating its inactivation rate, subcellular localization and activity, which together are important in determining the ERK2 signal specificity.

DNA Constructs and Mutations—WT-GFP-ERK2, GFP-173A, GFP-176A and GFP-316A were previously described (21Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GFP-173,5,7A, GFP-174A, and GFP-177A were prepared using site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were sequenced to verify their proper structure. GFP-316/173A and GFP-316/173,5,7A were prepared by inserting either 173A or −173,5,7A mutants into GFP-316A using PflMI and PpuMI restriction sites. MKP3-glutathione S-transferase (GST) was cloned by ligating MKP3 into the ClaI sites of pGFLEX, HA-MEK1, and HA-MKP3 were prepared by ligating MEK1 or MKP3 into the 3′-end of the HA tag followed by insertion into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). These cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method. CHO cells were grown in F12-DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Protein Expression and Purification—The MKP3-GST was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purified as a GST fusion protein essentially as described (33Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the cells were lysed by sonication followed by addition of 1% Triton X-100 (30 min at 4 °C), spun down (30,000 rpm 30 min), and the supernatant was combined with 2 ml of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After incubation the matrix was washed, and the fusion protein was eluted with 1 bed volume of reduced glutathione. Subcellular Localization Studies—CHO cells were co-transfected with the various GFP-ERK2 constructs together with HA-MEK1. The GFP-ERK2 mutants and the HA-MEK1 were transfected in a ratio of 1:3, respectively. Serum-starved cells were washed with PBS and fixed (20 min in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS). The cells were than permeabilized by 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (23 °C, 5 min), washed with PBS, and stained with monoclonal anti-HA Ab and rhodamine-conjugated goat-anti-rat Ab. The nuclei were visualized using DAPI. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells were grown to subconfluence and serum-starved for 18 h (0.1% FBS). After treatments, the cells were rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS and once with ice-cold Buffer A, scraped into Buffer H and disrupted by sonication (2 pulses for 7 s of 70 watts) on ice. The extracts were centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 15 min at 4 °C) and the supernatants were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with the appropriate Abs, which were detected using alkaline phosphatase or ECL according to the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation—One day after transfection, cells were serum-starved (0.1% FBS) for 16 h, and then stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml, Sigma) or left untreated. The cells were washed, lysed and centrifuged as described above. The extracts were incubated (2 h, 4 °C) with A/G-conjugated monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Ab), after which the beads were washed twice with RIPA, once with 0.5 m LiCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and either once with PBS for Western blot analysis, or twice with buffer A for the in vitro kinase assay or RMP for the in vitro phosphatase assay. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to either Western blotting as described above, or to an in vitro kinase assay/in vitro phosphatase assay as described below. Partial Purification of MEKs from COS7 Cells Using DE52 Column—Partial MEKs purification on a DE52 column was preformed as described previously (34Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in EGF-stimulated (50 ng/ml, 5 min) COS7 cells. After harvesting as above, the lysate was loaded onto a DE52 column, followed by washed with 400 μl of Buffer A that eluted the partially purified active MEKs. In Vitro Kinase and Phosphatase Assays—The immunoprecipitated GFP-ERK2 proteins were mixed with partially purified MEKs and Buffer RMK in a final volume of 30 μl. The phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min with constant shaking and either terminated by sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min and Western blotting or the active GFP-ERKs were washed as described below. For MBP and Elk1 phosphorylation, the active GFP-ERK2 constructs were washed once with RIPA, twice with 0.5 m LiCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0 and twice with Buffer A, and mixed with either MBP (5 μg) or Elk1 (0.25 μg) and Buffer RMK containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1–2 cpm/fmol, 30 μl, 30 °C, 30 min with constant shaking). The reaction was terminated by boiling in a sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography and Western blot analysis as indicated. For phosphatase assay the phosphorylated active ERK2s were immunoprecipitated and washed once with RIPA, twice with 0.5 m LiCl in 0.1 m Tris pH 8.0 and twice with RMP. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified MKP3-GST and Buffer RMP (30 μl, 30 °C, 30 min, with shaking). The reaction was terminated by boiling in sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting. In a previous study (32Wolf I. Rubinfeld H. Yoon S. Marmor G. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24490-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that several activation loop residues besides Thr183 and Tyr185 participate in ERKs regulation. Here we studied the molecular mechanisms by which these additional residues participate in the regulation of ERK2 activity and localization. For this purpose, we substituted either residues 173–175 (GFP-173A) or 176–178 (GFP-176A) to alanines (Fig. 1) in constructs that were GFP-fused (21Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To study the acidic cluster within this region, we substituted either residues Asp173, Asp175, Asp177 (GFP-173,5,7A), Pro174 (GFP-174A), or Asp177 (GFP-177A) to alanines. To study the role of these residues in conjunction with the CRS/CD motif, we combined the activation loop mutants together with the CRS/CD motif mutants (Asp316, Asp319, and Glu320; GFP-316A) to construct double mutants (GFP-316/173,5,7A and GFP-316/173A). Residues 173–175 of ERK2 Regulate Its Thr and Tyr Phosphorylation—To test the effect of the activation loop residues of ERK2 on its phosphorylation by MEKs, the constructs were co-transfected with HA-MEK1 into COS7 cells, which were then serum-starved and stimulated with EGF. Anti pERKs Ab used in a Western blot revealed that the stimulated phosphorylation of GFP-173A was much lower than that of WT-GFP-ERK2. This effect was mainly due to substitution of Pro174, as similar effect was detected also with GFP-174A. However, the acidic residues Asp173 and Asp175 might have a supporting role because GFP-173,5,7A exhibited a slightly reduced phosphorylation without any effect of GFP-177A. GFP-176A showed similar phosphorylation to WT-GFP-ERK2, suggesting that residues 176–178 are not involved in TEY phosphorylation. To examine the interrelationships of the activation loop residues with another regulatory region, namely the CRS/CD motif, we used combined CRS/CD-activation loop mutants. Interestingly, when the CRS/CD alone mutant (GFP-316A) was used, we found that despite the reported reduced interaction of this mutant with MEK1 (21Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of GFP-316A in our system was not reduced as expected, but was in fact elevated both in resting and in stimulated COS7 cells. This effect could have been achieved by a residual CRS/CD-independent phosphorylation of GFP-316A by MEKs that cannot be suppressed by phosphatases, which do not interact with CRS/CD motif-lacking ERKs as well (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This tilted equilibrium suggests that the CRS/CD motif is required to phosphatase association more than it is required for MEK interaction. Combined activation loop with CRS/CD mutations showed a slight reduction in their phosphorylation as compare with GFP-316A. These results indicate that the two regions operate additively in regulating the phosphorylation of ERK2. Moreover, the effects detected here are not restricted to EGF-stimulated COS7 cells, as similar results were obtained with TPA-treated CHO cells (data not shown) verifying the general role of residues 173–175 in ERK2 phosphorylation. In Vitro Phosphorylation of ERK2 by MEK1 Is Not Affected by the Substitution of Residues 173–175—The reduced phosphorylation observed with the activation loop mutants could be explained either by reduce interaction with MEKs or elevated interaction with phosphatases. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we examined the phosphorylation of the construct by active MEK1 in vitro. For this purpose we used immunoprecipitated ERK constructs from starved COS7 cells. Active MEKs were purified from EGF-stimulated COS7 cells and enriched using DE-52 column (34Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the phosphorylation of the activation loop mutants GFP-173A and GFP-174A was not changed, and that of GFP-176A or GFP-177A mutants was only slightly reduced (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is likely that the reduced phosphorylation of the mutants observed in cells (Fig. 2) is not due to reduced MEKs phosphorylation. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of constructs mutated in their CRS/CD was significantly reduced (Fig. 3), confirming the importance of this region in MEKs phosphorylation (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 21Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results suggest that dephosphorylation predominate the regulation of ERK2 activity via both CRS/CD motif and the activation loop residues.FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of GFP-ERK2 and its mutants in COS7 cells.
