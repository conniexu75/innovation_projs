https://openalex.org/W2134762386,"Molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins have provided deeper insights into their functions and interactions with surrounding environments at the atomic level. However, compared to solvation of globular proteins, building a realistic protein/membrane complex is still challenging and requires considerable experience with simulation software. Membrane Builder in the CHARMM-GUI website (http://www.charmm-gui.org) helps users to build such a complex system using a web browser with a graphical user interface. Through a generalized and automated building process including system size determination as well as generation of lipid bilayer, pore water, bulk water, and ions, a realistic membrane system with virtually any kinds and shapes of membrane proteins can be generated in 5 minutes to 2 hours depending on the system size. Default values that were elaborated and tested extensively are given in each step to provide reasonable options and starting points for both non-expert and expert users. The efficacy of Membrane Builder is illustrated by its applications to 12 transmembrane and 3 interfacial membrane proteins, whose fully equilibrated systems with three different types of lipid molecules (DMPC, DPPC, and POPC) and two types of system shapes (rectangular and hexagonal) are freely available on the CHARMM-GUI website. One of the most significant advantages of using the web environment is that, if a problem is found, users can go back and re-generate the whole system again before quitting the browser. Therefore, Membrane Builder provides the intuitive and easy way to build and simulate the biologically important membrane system."
https://openalex.org/W1993338842,"The principles of organization and functioning of cellular membranes are currently not well understood. The raft hypothesis suggests the existence of domains or rafts in cell membranes, which behave as protein and lipid platforms. They have a functional role in important cellular processes, like protein sorting or cell signaling, among others. Theoretical work suggests that the interfacial energy at the domain edge, also known as line tension, is a key parameter determining the distribution of domain sizes, but there is little evidence of how line tension affects membrane organization. We have investigated the effects of the line tension on the formation and stability of liquid ordered domains in model lipid bilayers with raft-like composition by means of time-lapse confocal microscopy coupled to atomic force microscopy. We varied the hydrophobic mismatch between the two phases, and consequently the line tension, by modifying the thickness of the disordered phase with phosphatidylcholines of different acyl chain length. The temperature of domain formation, the dynamics of domain growth, and the distribution of domain sizes depend strongly on the thickness difference between the domains and the surrounding membrane, which is related to line tension. When considering line tension calculated from a theoretical model, our results revealed a linear increase of the temperature of domain formation and domain growth rate with line tension. Domain budding was also shown to depend on height mismatch. Our experiments contribute significantly to our knowledge of the physical-chemical parameters that control membrane organization. Importantly, the general trends observed can be extended to cellular membranes. The principles of organization and functioning of cellular membranes are currently not well understood.

Domain budding was also shown to depend on height mismatch. Our experiments contribute significantly to our knowledge of the physical-chemical parameters that control membrane organization. Importantly, the general trends observed can be extended to cellular membranes. Cellular membranes form closed volumes that define the cell and organelle identity, although ensuring the exchange of matter, energy, and information that is required for life. They do so by means of a complex protein and lipid composition that is actively regulated in time and varies not only among the different cellular membranes but also between the two leaflets that form the membrane bilayer (1van Meer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3159-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). During the last years, it has also become clear that the existence of lateral heterogeneities or domains in membranes is essential for a number of cellular functions. The raft theory predicts the existence of lipid assemblies that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. These membrane domains are thought to behave as protein and lipid platforms, important for protein trafficking and sorting, cell signaling, and other cellular processes (2Jacobson K. Mouritsen O.G. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that rafts are dynamic structures of transient nature and sizes in the nanometer range (5Samsonov A.V. Mihalyov I. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1486-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Though still debated, the widely accepted view implies a situation far from equilibrium, where signaling or sorting processes would induce the coalescence of these lipid assemblies into more stable larger platforms in the membrane (6Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the current knowledge of membrane organization is not sufficient to fully explain the behavior and functioning of cellular membranes. Precisely because of their complex composition and dynamics, it is difficult to understand the principles that govern the lateral organization of the cell membrane in relation to its function. During the last years, some of the physical properties of the plasma membrane have been studied with model membranes that mimic the lipid composition of rafts. Model membranes are still far away from representing the intricacy found in cells, but they constitute simplistic systems that can help understanding the principles of the processes that happen in cellular membranes. In model lipid membranes with “raft-like” composition, large domains are observable by fluorescence microscopy or AFM (7Bacia K. Scherfeld D. Kahya N. Schwille P. Biophys.

These domains are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol and appear as a liquid ordered (Lo) phase, coexisting with a liquid disordered (Ld) 2The abbreviations used are: Ld, liquid disordered; Lo, liquid ordered; PC, phosphatidylcholine; DPoPC, 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMoPC, 1,2-dimyristoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DEiPC, 1,2-dieicosenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DEruPC, 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SM, N-stearoyl-d-erythro-sphingosylphosphocholine; Chol, cholesterol; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; AFM, atomic force microscopy; A/P, area to perimeter ratio; DiD, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate; CtxB-488, cholera toxin-labeled with Alexa488. phase. In such membranes, domains exhibit a circular shape, which is rapidly recovered after a mechanical distortion (5Samsonov A.V. Mihalyov I. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1486-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 9Chiantia S. Kahya N. Ries J. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This tendency to minimize the boundary length indicates the presence of line tension at the phase interface. AFM and x-ray scattering measurements show that the Lo phase is thicker than the Ld one, giving rise to a “height mismatch” at the domain edge (13Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 14Maulik P.R. Shipley G.G. Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26966-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The exposure of the hydrophobic tails of the lipids to the aqueous solvent would have a very unfavorable energetic effect, and as a consequence, the membrane distorts at the boundary to avoid it (16Kuzmin P.I. Akimov S.A. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This height mismatch has an energetic cost per unit length that is probably one of the main parameters contributing to the line tension at the phase boundary. The distribution of domain sizes depends on the balance between line tension, which tends to increase size in order to reduce total boundary length and entropy and electrostatic repulsions, which oppose raft merger (16Kuzmin P.I.

Acta. 2005; 1746: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). As a consequence, line tension is probably a major factor in the regulation of raft size. Line tension at the domain interface has been experimentally estimated in giant unilamellar vesicles with phase separation (8Baumgart T. Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Nature. 2003; 425: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 19Baumgart T. Das S. Webb W.W. Jenkins J.T. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1067-1080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and very recently, in planar supported bilayers by means of nucleation rate measurements (20Blanchette C.D. Lin W.C. Orme C.A. Ratto T.V. Longo M.L. Langmuir. 2007; 23: 5875-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Theoretical models have related line tension to physical properties of the membrane, like phase height mismatch, lateral tension, and spontaneous curvature (16Kuzmin P.I. Akimov S.A. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Akimov S.A. Kuzmin P.I. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2007; 75: 011919Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). According to them, line tension increases quadratically with phase height mismatch. However, there is little experimental evidence about how line tension affects the lateral membrane organization and the formation of domains in terms of kinetics of domain formation, domain size and shape, and domain dynamics and stability. To address these questions, we have investigated the effects of the line tension on the formation of Lo domains in model lipid bilayers with raft-like composition. Given the link between line tension and phase height mismatch, we systematically varied the height mismatch between the two phases and consequently the line tension, by modifying the thickness of the Ld phase with PCs of different acyl chain length. Our studies involved measurements at non-equilibrium conditions. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy and AFM imaging, we analyzed the kinetics of domain formation, the domain shape and size, and the demixing temperature from Ld to Ld-Lo coexistence, as a function of the hydrophobic mismatch. Our results indicate a great influence of the line tension on the physical-chemical properties of Lo domains. We observed that at higher hydrophobic mismatch, the increased line tension led to bigger domains that formed with significantly faster kinetics to minimize the interface length. Interestingly, both the demixing temperature and the domain growth rate increased linearly with line tension, calculated from phase height mismatch measurements according to the model in (16Kuzmin P.I. Akimov S.A. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Under conditions close to equilibrium, domains were bigger and more circular at higher line tension. In addition, experiments in giant unilamellar vesicles linked height mismatch to line tension and domain budding. Preparation of Supported Bilayers—1,2-Dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPoPC), 1,2-dimyristoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMoPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dieicosenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DEiPC), 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DEruPC), N-stearoyl-d-erythro-sphingosylphosphocholine (SM), and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Planar supported bilayers were prepared as described in (22Chiantia S. Ries J. Kahya N. Schwille P. Chem. Phys. Chem. 2006; 7: 2409-2418Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in chloroform at the desired molar concentration, and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD-C18) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the lipid mixtures at a 0.01% (mol/mol) concentration. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen flux followed by vacuum for 1 h. Lipid films were rehydrated to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 and vortexed for 5 min. A small aliquot (10 μl) of the suspension of multilamellar vesicles was diluted in 140 μl of 3 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 3 mm NaN3, pH 7.4. The suspension was then bath-solicited at 60 °C until small unilamellar vesicles were obtained and then put in contact with freshly cleaved mica substrate, previously glued to a glass coverslip. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 2 min and then at 68 °C for 10 min. At this temperature, the samples were rinsed several times with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 3 mm NaN3, pH 7.4, to remove the non-fused vesicles. Sample temperature was controlled with a BioCell (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany). The lipid content per sample was ∼2 nmol, calculated assuming an average area per lipid molecule of 0.6 nm2 (4Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Preparation of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles—Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of the desired lipid composition were prepared according to the electroformation method as described in (10Kahya N. Scherfeld D. Bacia K. Poolman B. Schwille P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28109-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of lipid mixture at 10 mg/ml was spread on indium tin oxide-coated coverslips at 65 °C. After solvent evaporation, the electrodes were assembled into custom-made perfusion chambers that were filled with 300 mm sucrose. Electroformation proceeded at 1.2 V and 10 Hz during ∼1 h. Samples were equilibrated to room temperature and checked for phase separation with the confocal microscope. Then, 5 μg of B subunit of cholera toxin-labeled with Alexa488 (CtxB-488) was added to the chamber, incubated for 30 min, and washed out with 300 mm sucrose solution. No apparent changes in the pattern of phase separation were observed upon CtxB-488 labeling (23Hammond A.T. Heberle F.A. Baumgart T. Holowka D. Baird B. Feigenson G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—We performed confocal fluorescence microscopy of supported lipid bilayers on a LSM Meta 510 instrument (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Confocal images were taken by using the excitation light of a He-Ne laser at 633 nm, which was reflected by a dichroic mirror (HTF 488/633) and focused through a Zeiss C-Apochromat ×20, 0.75 numerical aperture objective onto the sample. The fluorescence signal was collected by the same objective, passed a 680/30-nm band pass filter and finally detected by a photomultiplier. Confocal geometry was ensured by a 100-μm pinhole in front of the photomultiplier. GUVs were imaged in a commercial ConfoCor2 system (Carl Zeiss) using multi-track mode. Light from an Ar laser at 488 nm, and a He-Ne laser at 633 nm was reflected with a HFT UV/488/543/633 dichroic. A ×40 numerical aperture 1.2 C-Apochromat water immersion objective was used, and the pinhole size was set to 90 μm in the green channel, although adjusted in the red channel for the same z thickness. Emitted fluorescence was separated with a secondary dichroic beam splitter 570 dichroic and passed through 505 nm or 650 nm long pass filters to be finally detected with a photomultiplier. Image processing and analysis was carried out with ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Atomic Force Microscopy—AFM measurements were performed using a NanoWizard system (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) mounted on the same LSM Meta 510 setup used for microscopy. Contact mode topographic images were taken in the constant-deflection mode, using V-shaped silicon nitride cantilevers (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) with a typical spring constant of 0.08 newton/m. The force applied on the sample was maintained at the lowest possible value by continuously adjusting the set point during imaging. The scan rate was set to 1 Hz. Height and deflection were collected simultaneously in both trace and retrace directions. Images were line-fitted as required with JPK processing software (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Occasionally, isolated scan lines were removed. We performed image analysis with ImageJ and OriginPro (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Line Tension Affects the Demixing Temperature into Ld and Lo Phases—To systematically investigate the role of line tension on the properties of raft-like domains, we modulated the height mismatch between the Ld and Lo phases by changing the thickness of the Ld phase, which is enriched in unsaturated PC (4Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used PC of varying acyl chain length in different samples (see Table 1). We prepared supported lipid bilayers composed by a doubly unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (Chol) in a 2:2:1 ratio. We included 0.05% DiD, a fluorescent lipid analogue that partitions specifically to the Ld phase (7Bacia K. Scherfeld D. Kahya N. Schwille P. Biophys.

Usually, model membranes with such lipid mixture exhibit coexistence of Ld and Lo phases that can be visualized by AFM or fluorescence microscopy (7Bacia K. Scherfeld D. Kahya N. Schwille P. Biophys.

We considered an effective thickness of the Ld DOPC bilayer of 5.5 nm (26Leonenko Z.V. Finot E. Ma H. Dahms T.E. Cramb D.T. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3783-3793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Errors were estimated with Gaussian error propagation Open table in a new tab To ensure sample homogeneity, all samples had the same thermal history. After bilayer formation, samples were warmed up to 67 °C, above the transition temperature, and then cooled down to 21 °C in ∼5 min with a temperature controller. We performed this process only once for every membrane. During the cooling process Lo domains appeared when the temperature of phase demixing was achieved. We measured the formation and growth of domains with confocal microscopy. Because the fluorescent dye DiD is excluded from the Lo phase, Lo domains can be identified as dark patches in the membrane. Fig. 1 shows the first 5 min of the process. The corresponding movies can be found in the Supplemental Data and include the first 10 min of the kinetics of domain formation and growth. Interestingly, no domains were discernible in the case of the sample containing the PC with the longest acyl chain (DEruPC). For the rest of the samples, domains grew faster when membranes contained PC of shorter acyl chains (see series B to E in Fig. 1). In addition, phase demixing took place at different moments and subsequently at different temperatures depending on the acyl chain length. We define “demixing temperature” as the measured temperature at which the appearance of Lo domains was observed in our system (see Table 1). In the case of the sample composed of DEruPC:SM:Chol, we measured the demixing temperature in a different series of experiments in which the thermal history of the sample was modified to obtain observable domains (17Blanchette C.D. Lin W.C. Ratto T.V. Longo M.L. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4466-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When we cooled the sample just a couple of degrees below the demixing temperature, domains grew faster and bigger and could be then observed by confocal microscopy. After equilibration for 2.5 h at 21 °C, we scanned the same lipid membranes with AFM (see Fig. 2). We obtained topographical images of the sample surface at higher spatial resolution, from which we measured the height difference between the Ld and Lo phases for the different lipid compositions (see Table 1). In this case, domains with an average area of 0.056 ± 0.003 μm2 and ∼170 pm thicker than the surrounding Ld phase could be distinguished for the sample containing DEruPC. These results, contradictory to the microscopy observations, can be explained by the fact that the domain size could be below our optical resolution, or that the DiD dye would not partition specifically to the Ld phase for this lipid composition, or a combination of both. The images in Fig. 2 show that the Lo domains tend to be bigger and the difference in thickness between the two phases higher as the acyl chain length of the PC contained in the lipid bilayers decreases, in agreement with a thinner Ld phase. The height mismatch values measured for the different lipid compositions are shown in Table 1. If we combine the demixing temperatures measured for the different lipid compositions with the height mismatch that those lipid compositions exhibit between the Lo and Ld phases (see Table 1), we get an estimation of the dependence of the temperature of phase demixing with phase height mismatch. Fig. 3 depicts this relationship and shows that the demixing temperature strongly increases with height mismatch, and hence, line tension. Domain Growth, Size, and Shape Depend on the Line Tension—By image analysis, we quantified the distribution of domain sizes from the AFM images obtained for the different samples. Fig. 4 depicts the histograms of the logarithm of domain area and their corresponding fittings to Gaussian curves. There is a clear trend to domain enlargement with the increase in thickness difference between the Ld and Lo phases. Domain circularity, calculated as 4π (area/perimeter2) (ImageJ), is shown in Table 1. In agreement with the observations above, there is a tendency to increase domain circularity with phase height mismatch. As expected, phase height mismatch is related to an increased line tension and to the formation of bigger and more circular domains to minimize the energetic cost associated to the domain interface length. Though with a lower spatial resolution, we measured domain growth from the time series of domain formation obtained with the confocal microscope by image analysis. Fig. 5A shows that the average domain area increases approximately linearly with time for the different lipid mixtures. We calculated the rate of domain growth from the slope after 300 s, when the temperature of the sample could be considered constant. As observed in Fig. 5B, the rate of domain growth increased strongly with the height mismatch and thus, with the interfacial line tension, showing a similar dependence as the demixing temperature. We compared the mechanism of domain growth during the 2.5 h of membrane equilibration for the different lipid compositions. We observed that domain fusion happens mostly during the first minutes of phase separation, whereas Ostwald ripening predominates at later stages, favoring the growth of the bigger domains and the shrinkage and disappearance of the smaller ones. The latter phenomenon becomes more important for lipid mixtures that show a larger height mismatch, suggesting a higher energy barrier for domain interaction. According to Cohen and colleagues (16Kuzmin P.I. Akimov S.A. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the monolayer deformation at the raft boundary increases with height mismatch. As a consequence, the energy barrier for domains come into contact, which implies interaction of membrane deformations (16Kuzmin P.I. Akimov S.A. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys.

Membrane Curvature in GUVs Responds to Domain Line Tension—In addition to minimization of domain boundary length, line tension has been shown to induce out-of-plane membrane curvature (8Baumgart T.

As a result, the shape of vesicles with line tension differs from that of vesicles without a phase separation. Because membrane curvature is constrained in supported lipid bilayers, we used GUVs, which were free-standing membranes, to investigate the role of phase height mismatch on vesicle shape. Because GUV preparation yields very heterogeneous samples, we analyzed hundreds of vesicles and attempted to extract relevant information from the ensemble measurements. Fig. 6 shows representative vesicles obtained for the different lipid compositions measured by confocal microscopy. In agreement with the observations made in planar supported bilayers, no phase separation could be distinguished in the GUVs containing DEruPC (Fig. 6, A and B), which had the longest acyl chai"
https://openalex.org/W1965949765,"Background Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have profound impairments in the interpersonal social domain, but it is unclear if individuals with ASC also have impairments in the intrapersonal self-referential domain. We aimed to evaluate across several well validated measures in both domains, whether both self-referential cognition and empathy are impaired in ASC and whether these two domains are related to each other. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty adults aged 19-45, with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism and 30 age, sex, and IQ matched controls participated in the self-reference effect (SRE) paradigm. In the SRE paradigm, participants judged adjectives in relation to the self, a similar close other, a dissimilar non-close other, or for linguistic content. Recognition memory was later tested. After the SRE paradigm, several other complimentary self-referential cognitive measures were taken. Alexithymia and private self-consciousness were measured via self-report. Self-focused attention was measured on the Self-Focus Sentence Completion task. Empathy was measured with 3 self-report instruments and 1 performance measure of mentalizing (Eyes test). Self-reported autistic traits were also measured with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Although individuals with ASC showed a significant SRE in memory, this bias was decreased compared to controls. Individuals with ASC also showed reduced memory for the self and a similar close other and also had concurrent impairments on measures of alexithymia, self-focused attention, and on all 4 empathy measures. Individual differences in self-referential cognition predicted mentalizing ability and self-reported autistic traits. More alexithymia and less self memory was predictive of larger mentalizing impairments and AQ scores regardless of diagnosis. In ASC, more self-focused attention is associated with better mentalizing ability and lower AQ scores, while in controls, more self-focused attention is associated with decreased mentalizing ability and higher AQ scores. Increasing private self-consciousness also predicted better mentalizing ability, but only for individuals with ASC. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that individuals with ASC have broad impairments in both self-referential cognition and empathy. These two domains are also intrinsically linked and support predictions made by simulation theory. Our results also highlight a specific dysfunction in ASC within cortical midlines structures of the brain such as the medial prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2081762851,"In an accompanying paper, we show that the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response or mtUPR is initiated by the activation of transcription of chop through an AP-1 element in the chop promoter. Further, we show that the c/ebp beta gene is similarly activated and CHOP and C/EBP beta subsequently hetero-dimerise to activate transcription of mtUPR responsive genes. Here, we report the discovery of six additional mtUPR responsive genes. We found that these genes encoding mitochondrial proteases YME1L1 and MPP beta, import component Tim17A and enzymes NDUFB2, endonuclease G and thioredoxin 2, all contain a CHOP element in their promoters. In contrast, genes encoding mitochondrial proteins Afg3L2, Paraplegin, Lon and SAM 50, which do not have a CHOP element, were not up-regulated. Conversely, genes with CHOP elements encoding cytosolic proteins were not induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in mitochondria. These results indicate that mtUPR responsive genes appear to share a requirement for a CHOP element, but that this is not sufficient for the regulation of the mtUPR. A more detailed analysis of promoters of mtUPR responsive genes revealed at least two additional highly conserved, putative regulatory sites either side of the CHOP element, one a motif of 12 bp which lies 14 bp upstream of the CHOP site and another 9 bp element, 2 bp downstream of the CHOP site. Both of these additional elements are conserved in the promoters of 9 of the ten mtUPR responsive genes we have identified so far, the exception being the Cpn60/10 bidirectional promoter. Mutation of each of these elements substantially reduced the mtUPR responsiveness of the promoters suggesting that these elements coordinately regulate mtUPR."
https://openalex.org/W2050359514,"Protein encoding genes have long been the major targets for research in schizophrenia genetics. However, with the identification of regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) as important in brain development and function, miRNAs genes have emerged as candidates for schizophrenia-associated genetic factors. Indeed, the growing understanding of the regulatory properties and pleiotropic effects that miRNA have on molecular and cellular mechanisms, suggests that alterations in the interactions between miRNAs and their mRNA targets may contribute to phenotypic variation.We have studied the association between schizophrenia and genetic variants of miRNA genes associated with brain-expression using a case-control study design on three Scandinavian samples. Eighteen known SNPs within or near brain-expressed miRNAs in three samples (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: 420/163/257 schizophrenia patients and 1006/177/293 control subjects), were analyzed. Subsequently, joint analysis of the three samples was performed on SNPs showing marginal association. Two SNPs rs17578796 and rs1700 in hsa-mir-206 (mir-206) and hsa-mit-198 (mir-198) showed nominal significant allelic association to schizophrenia in the Danish and Norwegian sample respectively (P = 0.0021 & p = 0.038), of which only rs17578796 was significant in the joint sample. In-silico analysis revealed that 8 of the 15 genes predicted to be regulated by both mir-206 and mir-198, are transcriptional targets or interaction partners of the JUN, ATF2 and TAF1 connected in a tight network. JUN and two of the miRNA targets (CCND2 and PTPN1) in the network have previously been associated with schizophrenia.We found nominal association between brain-expressed miRNAs and schizophrenia for rs17578796 and rs1700 located in mir-206 and mir-198 respectively. These two miRNAs have a surprising large number (15) of targets in common, eight of which are also connected by the same transcription factors."

This paper presents a microrobotic system for fully automated zebrafish embryo injection, which overcomes the problems inherent in manual operation, such as human fatigue and large variations in success rates due to poor reproducibility. Based on computer vision and motion control, the microrobotic system performs injection at a speed of 15 zebrafish embryos (chorion unremoved) per minute, with a survival rate of 98% (n = 350 embryos), a success rate of 99% (n = 350 embryos), and a phenotypic rate of 98.5% (n = 210 embryos). The sample immobilization technique and microrobotic control method are applicable to other biological injection applications such as the injection of mouse oocytes/embryos and Drosophila embryos to enable high-throughput biological and pharmaceutical research."
https://openalex.org/W2027575476,"We have previously reported on the discovery of a mitochondrial specific unfolded protein response (mtUPR) in mammalian cells, in which the accumulation of unfolded protein within the mitochondrial matrix results in the transcriptional activation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial stress proteins such as chaperonin 60, chaperonin 10, mtDnaJ, and ClpP, but not those encoding stress proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the cytosol. Analysis of the chaperonin 60/10 bidirectional promoter showed that the CHOP element was required for the mtUPR and that the transcription of the chop gene is activated by mtUPR. In order to investigate the role of CHOP in the mtUPR, we carried out a deletion analysis of the chop promoter. This revealed that the transcriptional activation of the chop gene by mtUPR is through an AP-1 (activator protein-1) element. This site lies alongside an ERSE element through which chop transcription is activated in response to the ER stress response (erUPR). Thus CHOP can be induced separately in response to 2 different stress response pathways. We also discuss the potential signal pathway between mitochondria and the nucleus for the mtUPR."
https://openalex.org/W2048865828,"Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns and trigger innate immunity leading to initiation of adaptive immunity. TLR-mediated activation of dendritic cells (DCs) is known to be a critical event in the initiation of cellular and humoral immune responses. Recent work however suggests that B cells also express TLRs, and that they can be activated via TLR ligands. However, whether such B cell activation occurs only on memory B cells, or whether it can also occur on truly naïve B cells remains controversial. Furthermore, the expression and functional relevance of TLRs on distinct subsets of B cells, which are known to play differential roles in humoral responses is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of different TLRs in distinct subsets of murine B cells (naïve, memory, follicular, marginal zone, B-1 and peyer's patch). In contrast to the reported restricted expression pattern of TLRs in human peripheral blood naïve B cells, murine splenic naïve B cells express a variety of TLRs with the exception of TLR5 and 8. Consistent with this relatively broad expression pattern, murine naive B cells proliferate and secrete antibody to a variety of TLR agonists in vitro, in the absence of B-cell receptor cross-linking. In addition, we observed subtle differences in the antibody secretion pattern of follicular, marginal zone, B-1 and peyer's patch B-cell subsets. Conclusions/Significance Thus various B cell subsets, including truly naïve B cells, express multiple TLRs, and signaling via such TLRs results in their robust proliferation and antibody secretion, even in the absence of dendritic cell activation, or T-cell help."
https://openalex.org/W2025347753,"PRMT1 is the predominant member of a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) that have been implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing, and signal transduction. It was previously reported that the human PRMT1 pre-mRNA was alternatively spliced to yield three isoforms with distinct N-terminal sequences. Close inspection of the genomic organization in the 5′-end of the PRMT1 gene revealed that it can produce up to seven protein isoforms, all varying in their N-terminal domain. A detailed biochemical characterization of these variants revealed that unique N-terminal sequences can influence catalytic activity as well as substrate specificity. In addition, our results uncovered the presence of a functional nuclear export sequence in PRMT1v2. Finally, we find that the relative balance of PRMT1 isoforms is altered in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2086181965,"Arrestins ensure the timely termination of receptor signaling. The role of rhodopsin phosphorylation in visual arrestin binding was established more than 20 years ago, but the effects of the number of receptor-attached phosphates on this interaction remain controversial. Here we use purified rhodopsin fractions with carefully quantified content of individual phosphorylated rhodopsin species to elucidate the impact of phosphorylation level on arrestin interaction with three biologically relevant functional forms of rhodopsin: light-activated and dark phosphorhodopsin and phospho-opsin. We found that a single receptor-attached phosphate does not facilitate arrestin binding, two are necessary to induce high affinity interaction, and three phosphates fully activate arrestin. Higher phosphorylation levels do not increase the stability of arrestin complex with light-activated rhodopsin but enhance its binding to the dark phosphorhodopsin and phospho-opsin. The complex of arrestin with hyperphosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin is less sensitive to high salt and appears to release retinal faster. These data suggest that arrestin likely quenches rhodopsin signaling after the third phosphate is added by rhodopsin kinase. The complex of arrestin with heavily phosphorylated rhodopsin, which appears to form in certain disease states, has distinct characteristics that may contribute to the phenotype of these visual disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2107044634,"Background Canopy structure, which can be defined as the sum of the sizes, shapes and relative placements of the tree crowns in a forest stand, is central to all aspects of forest ecology. But there is no accepted method for deriving canopy structure from the sizes, species and biomechanical properties of the individual trees in a stand. Any such method must capture the fact that trees are highly plastic in their growth, forming tessellating crown shapes that fill all or most of the canopy space. Methodology/Principal Findings We introduce a new, simple and rapidly-implemented model–the Ideal Tree Distribution, ITD–with tree form (height allometry and crown shape), growth plasticity, and space-filling, at its core. The ITD predicts the canopy status (in or out of canopy), crown depth, and total and exposed crown area of the trees in a stand, given their species, sizes and potential crown shapes. We use maximum likelihood methods, in conjunction with data from over 100,000 trees taken from forests across the coterminous US, to estimate ITD model parameters for 250 North American tree species. With only two free parameters per species–one aggregate parameter to describe crown shape, and one parameter to set the so-called depth bias–the model captures between-species patterns in average canopy status, crown radius, and crown depth, and within-species means of these metrics vs stem diameter. The model also predicts much of the variation in these metrics for a tree of a given species and size, resulting solely from deterministic responses to variation in stand structure. Conclusions/Significance This new model, with parameters for US tree species, opens up new possibilities for understanding and modeling forest dynamics at local and regional scales, and may provide a new way to interpret remote sensing data of forest canopies, including LIDAR and aerial photography."
https://openalex.org/W2040048585,"In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, histone proteins organize the linear genome into a functional and hierarchical architecture. In this paper, we use the crystal structures of the nucleosome core particle, B-DNA and the globular domain of H5 linker histone to build the first all-atom model of compact chromatin fibers. In this 3D jigsaw puzzle, DNA bending is achieved by solving an inverse kinematics problem. Our model is based on recent electron microscopy measurements of reconstituted fiber dimensions. Strikingly, we find that the chromatin fiber containing linker histones is a polymorphic structure. We show that different fiber conformations are obtained by tuning the linker histone orientation at the nucleosomes entry/exit according to the nucleosomal repeat length. We propose that the observed in vivo quantization of nucleosomal repeat length could reflect nature's ability to use the DNA molecule's helical geometry in order to give chromatin versatile topological and mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2038347974,"APPL1 (adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif 1) is an Akt/protein kinase B-binding protein involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways for various receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases. Here, we establish a role for APPL1 in insulin signaling in which we demonstrate its interaction with Akt2 by co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays. In primary rat adipocytes and skeletal muscle, APPL1 and Akt2 formed a complex that was dissociated upon insulin stimulation in both tissues. To investigate possible APPL1 function in adipocytes, we analyzed Akt phosphorylation, 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and Glut4 translocation by immunofluorescence following APPL1 knockdown by small interfering and short hairpin RNAs. We show that APPL1 knockdown suppressed Akt phosphorylation, glucose uptake, and Glut4 translocation. We also tested the effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes of expressing full-length APPL1 or an N- or a C-terminal APPL1 construct. Interestingly, expression of full-length APPL1 and its N terminus suppressed insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake and Glut4 translocation to roughly the same extent (40-60%). We confirmed by cellular fractionation that Glut4 translocation was substantially blocked in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with full-length APPL1. By cellular fractionation, APPL1 was localized mainly in the cytosol, and it showed a small degree of re-localization to the light microsomes and nucleus in response to insulin. By immunofluorescence, we also show that APPL1 partially co-localized with Glut4. These data suggest that APPL1 plays an important role in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation in muscle and adipose tissues and that its N-terminal portion may be critical for APPL1 function.

Insulin-activated glucose transport results from a vesicular transport process by which the glucose transporter isoform Glut4 moves from an intracellular membrane compartment to the cell surface, where it can clear glucose. An implication from the above data is that the actions of Akt2 are likely to converge on one or more substrates that function at some step in insulin-regulated Glut4 trafficking. So far, AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa) is the only experimentally documented substrate known to play a role in this regard (8Sano H. Kim S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W.

AS160 has the property of a GTPase-activating protein for the Rab family of small GTPases that are known to play an important role in vesicular traffic (9Behnia R. Kim S.

The GTPase-activating protein activity of AS160 is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation at several serine residues, and mutation of these sites, followed by introduction of this mutated construct into adipocytes, has a dominant-negative affect and inhibits Glut4 translocation (8Sano H.

Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), these data suggest multiple possible modes of action for Akt in Glut4 trafficking, consequently multiple Akt substrates. In this regard, APPL1 (adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif 1) was first discovered as an Akt-binding protein in yeast two-hybrid assays using Akt2 as bait (32Mitsuuchi Y. Kim S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Subsequently, APPL1 has been implicated as playing a role in the insulin-sensitizing actions of adiponectin in muscle (33Mao X. Kim C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). As the definition of APPL1 indicates, it has multiple domains that imply multiple possible cellular functions and loci of action, and these include a BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain with a possible role in mediating membrane curvature (34Habermann B. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Peter B.J. Kim H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

A very recent study has implicated APPL1 in the formation of both G-protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase signaling complexes (38Lin D.C. Kim C. Brewer N.E. Bell A. Testa J.R. Grimes M.L. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8928-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we sought to determine the possible role of APPL1 in insulin-dependent Glut4 trafficking in adipocytes. Materials—Dexamethasone, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and fetal bovine serum (Australian origin) were purchased from Sigma. Aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were obtained from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Calf serum was purchased from Invitrogen, and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). The expression vector pcDNA3.1/His was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-Glut4 antibody used for immunofluorescence and protein G Plus-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibody 1F8 (39James D.E. Kim R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) was used for Western blotting. Anti-APPL1 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-Akt1 and anti-Akt2 antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. Morris J. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Two days after confluence, cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 4 days, the induction medium was removed, and cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and insulin. Plasmid Vectors, shRNA, and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—A human APPL1 construct was made by reverse transcription-PCR from human embryonic kidney cells. Full-length APPL1 and N-terminal (amino acids 1-428) and C-terminal (amino acids 443-709) APPL1 constructs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/His. For shRNA, the designed sense oligonucleotides contained a 4-nucleotide overhang to create a BglII restriction site (GATC) plus three Cs, followed by a 21-nucleotide sense siRNA sequence (5′-gatccccggatttatgatgcacagaatg-3′), a 9-nucleotide loop (TTCAAGAGA), a 21-nucleotide reverse complementary antisense siRNA sequence (5′-cattctgtgcatcataaatcc), and a polymerase III terminator (TTTTTA). The complementary antisense oligonucleotides contained a 4-nucleotide overhang at the 5′ terminus to create a HindIII restriction site (AGCT), but no 4-nucleotide BglII restriction site (GATC) at the 3′ terminus. These oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into pSUPER vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) via BglII and HindIII sites. The scrambled shRNA sequence (gcgcgctttgtaggattcg) described previously (40Zhang L. Kim D.K. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2053-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was used as a control. All plasmid vectors were purified using CsCl gradients. For siRNA, the following cDNA target sequences were used: scrambled siRNA, 5′-cagtcgcgtttgcgactgg-3′; PTEN siRNA, 5′-gtatagagcgtgcagataa-3′; and APPL1 siRNA, 5′-cacacctgacttcgaaact-3′. Subcellular Fractionation of Rat Adipocytes and 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Fractionation was performed as described previously (41Simpson I.A. Kim D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 42Kandror K.V. Kim P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, epididymal adipocytes of male Sprague-Dawley rats were removed and digested with collagenase (Roche Applied Science) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)) for 45 min at 37 °C. After collagenase treatment, isolated adipocytes were exposed or not to 50 nm insulin for 15 min. Membrane trafficking was stopped with 2 mm KCN, and cells were transferred to HES buffer (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) and homogenized with a Teflon/glass tissue grinder. For 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the cells were exposed or not to 100 nm insulin for 15 min, collected in HES buffer, and homogenized with a Teflon/glass tissue grinder. Subcellular fractions (plasma membranes and heavy and light microsomes) were obtained by differential centrifugation and resuspended in HES buffer. All buffers used in this work contained a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 5 mm benzamidine (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation—Protein amounts in various fractions from rat muscle and primary and cultured adipocytes were determined by the BCA method. Cellular protein (100 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of anti-APPL1 antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then, 10 μl of protein G Plus-agarose was added to these samples and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, samples were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 μm aprotinin A (pH 7.2)). The washed samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with monoclonal or polyclonal antibody as indicated in the figures and legends. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for detection. Immunofluorescence—This was performed as described previously (43Hosaka T. Kim C.C. Presman E. Kim S.K. Zhang Z. Breen M. Gross D.N. Sztul E. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2882-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes were split onto collagen-coated glass coverslips. After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 4 h and stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at room temperature. They were then incubated for 3 h with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for Glut4 or 1:1500 for the His tag in buffer A at room temperature, followed incubation with Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were observed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal fluorescence microscope. Electroporation—This protocol was performed as described previously (44Okada S. Kim M. Pessin J.E. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 93-96PubMed Google Scholar), and the CsCl plasmid purification routinely results in ≥70% of the cells being transfected (data not shown). Briefly, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with 250 μg of plasmid under low voltage conditions (0.16 kV and 950 microfarads) using Gene Pulser II. The cells were split onto collagen-coated dishes. For overexpression experiments, the cells were used after 24-48 h of recovery time. For shRNA and siRNA transfection, the cells were used after 72 h of recovery time. Following transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 4-6 h and stimulated with or without 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 37 °C. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—Transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 2 h and incubated in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (121 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm CaCl2, and 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Then, cells were either treated or not with 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, 10 μm 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was added and incubated for 5 min. Glucose uptake was stopped by ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer with 5 μm cytochalasin B and 25 mm glucose. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer with 25 mm glucose. Samples were assayed for 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in disintegrations/min/mg of protein. TIRF Microscopy—The home-built TIRF microscope has been described previously (45Bellve K.D. Kim D. Standley C. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Hayakawa A. Corvera S. Fogarty K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16139-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The incident angle at the glass/water interface was measured using a previously described method (46Schmoranzer J. Kim M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), from which a typical evanescent field depth of ∼100 nm was estimated. Two Coherent Innova 70C lasers, argon (488-nm line) and argon/krypton (568-nm line), excite the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)- and monomeric red fluorescent protein 1 (mRFP1)-tagged fusion proteins, respectively. The resulting fluorescence passes through a 488-568PC dichroic mirror (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) and EGFP and mRFP1 signals were selected using HQ525/50 band-pass (Chroma) and 3RD590LP long-pass (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) filters, respectively. Because of chromatic aberration, the red image was focused ∼0.4 μm below the green image, which was corrected by a piezoelectric driver (E-662 LVPZT amplifier, Physik Instrumente GmbH & Co., Waldbronn, Germany) coupled to the objective. Thus, for two-color TIRF experiments, one image was taken with a 80-ms exposure, followed by a 200-ms interval during which the laser light and its matching emission filter were selected, and the corresponding focal plane was adjusted piezoelectrically before another 80-ms exposure for the second image. The TIRF microscope is equipped with a Nikon ×60 1.45-numerical aperture objective, and the whole microscope setup is enclosed in a heated chamber with the interior temperature maintained at 35 °C. Resulting TIRF images have 100-nm pixel size. Image analysis was carried out using home-developed tools (available at invitro.umassmed.edu). APPL1/Akt2 Interaction Is Regulated by Insulin—APPL1 is expressed to significant levels in skeletal muscle and other tissues, including heart, testis, and pancreas, and in hepatocytes (32Mitsuuchi Y. Kim S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but its expression has not heretofore been demonstrated in adipocytes. Thus, we sought to determine whether this adaptor protein is present in adipocytes and if it interacts with Akt2 basally and under conditions that lead to Glut4 translocation, viz. insulin exposure in fat and muscle. By co-immunoprecipitation, there was a robust interaction of APPL1 with Akt2 under basal conditions in muscle (Fig. 1A) and fat (Fig. 1B), and remarkably, insulin disrupted this interaction almost completely (Fig. 1, A-C). We next determined the extent of APPL1/Akt interaction by a pulldown assays and determined that ∼20% of Akt2 bound to APPL1 under basal conditions (Fig. 1D), which is significant in light of the small amount of Akt2 that is required for maximal glucose transport activation (see “Discussion”) (47Whitehead J.P. Kim J.C. Clark S. Martin S. Meneilly G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27816-27824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We then sought to determine whether this interaction might have functional consequences for signaling and Glut4 trafficking by reducing the interaction using APPL1-directed siRNA and shRNA. APPL1 Knockdown Inhibits Akt Phosphorylation, Insulin-stimulated Glucose Transport, and Glut4 Translocation—We employed both siRNA and shRNA strategies to knock down APPL1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), both strategies led to an ∼50% decrease in APPL1 expression compared with the scrambled RNA controls (upper panels), with no effect being observed upon adiponectin or ERK1/2 expression. This knockdown resulted in a 50% decrease in insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation and had no effect on overall Akt2 expression (middle and lower panels). There was no effect on insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation under these conditions. Moreover, insulin-dependent glucose transport was decreased significantly (50-70%) by both experimental strategies (Fig. 3, A and B). As an additional assay, the insulin-dependent translocation of Myc-tagged Glut4 was measured and found to be decreased to approximately the same extent as glucose transport by APPL1-directed siRNA (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3APPL1 knockdown inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Glut4 translocation. A, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with siRNA against mouse APPL1 or a scrambled (scr) sequence by electroporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” under the following conditions: basal (B) and 1 and 100 nm insulin (Ins). The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. *, p ≤ 0.05. B, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with pSUPER containing shRNA against mouse APPL1 by electroporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 72 h, the cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 15 min prior to measurement of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake as described for A. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. **, p ≤ 0.01. C, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with Myc-Glut4-EGFP and siRNA against mouse APPL1 by electroporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 96 h, the cells were serum-starved, treated with or without 100 nm insulin, fixed, and"
https://openalex.org/W2139162770,"The sharing of wild plant foods is infrequent in chimpanzees, but in chimpanzee communities that engage in hunting, meat is frequently used as a ‘social tool’ for nurturing alliances and social bonds. Here we report the only recorded example of regular sharing of plant foods by unrelated, non-provisioned wild chimpanzees, and the contexts in which these sharing behaviours occur. From direct observations, adult chimpanzees at Bossou (Republic of Guinea, West Africa) very rarely transferred wild plant foods. In contrast, they shared cultivated plant foods much more frequently (58 out of 59 food sharing events). Sharing primarily consists of adult males allowing reproductively cycling females to take food that they possess. We propose that hypotheses focussing on ‘food-for-sex and -grooming’ and ‘showing-off’ strategies plausibly account for observed sharing behaviours. A changing human-dominated landscape presents chimpanzees with fresh challenges, and our observations suggest that crop-raiding provides adult male chimpanzees at Bossou with highly desirable food commodities that may be traded for other currencies."
https://openalex.org/W2080636764,"The apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G) and its fellow cytidine deaminase family members are potent restrictive factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and many other retroviruses. A3G interacts with a vast spectrum of RNA-binding proteins and is located in processing bodies and stress granules. However, its cellular function remains to be further clarified. Using a luciferase reporter gene and green fluorescent protein reporter gene, we demonstrate that A3G and other APOBEC family members can counteract the inhibition of protein synthesis by various microRNAs (miRNAs) such as mir-10b, mir-16, mir-25, and let-7a. A3G could also enhance the expression level of miRNA-targeted mRNA. Further, A3G facilitated the association of microRNA-targeted mRNA with polysomes rather than with processing bodies. Intriguingly, experiments with a C288A/C291A A3G mutant indicated that this function of A3G is separable from its cytidine deaminase activity. Our findings suggest that the major cellular function of A3G, in addition to inhibiting the mobility of retrotransposons and replication of endogenous retroviruses, is most likely to prevent the decay of miRNA-targeted mRNA in processing bodies.

More than 474 miRNAs have been identified in humans so far, and ∼30% of the genes in the human genome are predicted to be subject to miRNA regulation (4Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9777) Google Scholar). The expression of many miRNAs is usually specific to a tissue or developmental stage, and the miRNA expression pattern is altered during the development of many diseases (3Rana T.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Mature miRNAs are generated from RNA polymerase II-transcribed primary miRNAs that are processed sequentially by the nucleases Drosha and Dicer. Although miRNA can guide mRNA cleavage, the basic function of miRNA is to mediate inhibition of protein translation (1Bartel D.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) through miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs). The guiding strand of miRNA in a miRISC interacts with a complementary sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of its target mRNA by partial sequence complementarities, resulting in translational inhibition (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29225) Google Scholar). A 7-nucleotide “seed” sequence (at positions 2-8 from the 5′-end) in miRNAs seems to be essential for this action (4Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9777) Google Scholar). The composition of the miRISC is similar to that of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is responsible for mRNA cleavage guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29225) Google Scholar, 3Rana T.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2003; 13: 807-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some differences exist between miRISCs and siRNA RISCs. For example, the major Argonaute protein in siRNA RISC is Ago-2, whereas all four of the Ago proteins (Ago1-4) are found in miRISC (3Rana T.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 8Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Filipowicz W. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Further, the siRNA RISC may be associated with various RNA-binding proteins such as fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP), TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP), and the human homolog of the Drosophila helicase Armitage, Mov10, possibly in a cell type-specific manner (9Chendrimada T.P.

The miRNA-mediated translational repression consistently correlates with an accumulation of miRNA-bound mRNAs at cytoplasmic foci known as processing bodies (P-bodies) (8Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Filipowicz W. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have indicated that P-bodies are actively involved in miRNA-mediated mRNA repression (14Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, several miRISC-related components, such as miRNAs, mRNAs repressed by miRNAs, Ago-1, Ago-2, and Mov10, are found in P-bodies (14Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). P-body formation is a dynamic process that requires continuous accumulation of repressed mRNAs (20Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Schweizer D. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, P-bodies serve not only as sites for RNA degradation, but also for storage of repressed mRNAs (15Liu J. Rivas F.V. Wohlschlegel J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parker R. Hannon G.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). These mRNAs may later return to polysomes to synthesize new proteins (14Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In fact, some cellular proteins can facilitate the exit of miRNA-bound mRNAs from P-bodies. For example, a stress situation may induce the relocation of HuR, an AU-rich element-binding protein, from the nucleus to P-bodies in the cytoplasm where it binds to the 3′-UTR of its target mRNA encoding CAT-1 (21Bhattacharyya S.N. Habermacher R. Martine U. Closs E.I. Filipowicz W. Cell. 2006; 125: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). This binding increases the stability of the miR-122-bound mRNA by assisting it to egress from the P-body and return to polysomes. However, the mechanism underlying this reverse transport of miRNA-bound mRNA out of P-bodies remains to be further clarified. The cellular apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G protein (APOBEC3G or A3G) is a potent antiretroviral factor that belongs to the cytidine deaminase family (22Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 23Turelli P. Trono D. Science. 2005; 307: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A3G can be incorporated into HIV-1 particles and cause extensive C to U conversion in the viral minus-stranded DNA during reverse transcription (24Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that A3G protein carrying mutations in the catalytic domain of the cytidine deaminase retains substantial anti-HIV-1 activity (24Zhang H. Yang B.

PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is associated with a high molecular mass structure (>700 kDa) in replicating cells, and this interaction is RNase-sensitive (34Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C.

Further studies indicate that A3G interacts with many RNA-binding proteins, among which are several miRNA-related proteins, such as Ago1, Ago2, Mov10, and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1). These interactions are either partially or completely resistant to RNase A digestion (32Gallois-Montbrun S. Kramer B. Swanson C.M. Byers H. Lynham S. Ward M. Malim M.H. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the major cellular function of A3G seems to be related to P-body-related RNA processing and metabolism. As recent development has indicated that the function of P-body is closely related to miRNA activity, we therefore investigated the possibility of a connection between A3G and miRNA function. Plasmid Constructions—The miRNA reporter constructs used in this study (pmir16-luc, pmir10b-luc, pmir25-luc, and pEGFP-c1-let-7a) were obtained by directly inserting the annealed corresponding miRNA-binding sites into the 3′-UTR region of the luciferase gene in the pMIR-REPORT vector (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) between the SpeI and HindIII sites or into the 3′-UTR region of the green fluorescent protein gene, gfp, in the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD, Mountain View, CA) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. A3B gene with a V5 epitope tag sequence at its 3′ terminus was amplified from the mRNA of H9 cells through RT-PCR, and the sequence was confirmed. Then the modified A3B was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector. Wild-type and mutant A3G-expressing plasmids were amplified by PCR using constructs described previously as templates and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (24Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Detailed information about the oligonucleotides used for cloning or PCR is provided in supplemental Table S1. Cell Isolation, Culture, and Transfection—Primary CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the CD4+ T cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) and subsequently activated by treating with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (42Chen K. Huang J. Zhang C. Huang S. Nunnari G. Wang F.X. Tong X. Gao L. Nikisher K. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The purity of CD4 T-cells can reach 98%. For isolation of monocytes, CD14+ cells were purified from PBMCs by positive selection with CD14+ micromeads (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) using auto MACS according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. The purity of the CD14+ cells is large than 98% as determined by FACS staining with CD14 antibody. Monocytes were further cultured in complete RPMI in the presence of 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, R&D Systems) and 0.5 ng/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, R&D Systems) for 7 days. The activated CD4+ T cells and H9 T cells were transfected using an Amaxa nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD), as described (42Chen K. Huang J. Zhang C. Huang S. Nunnari G. Wang F.X. Tong X. Gao L. Nikisher K. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 293T or HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for plasmids or HiPerfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for siRNAs or antisense miRNA inhibitors. Macrophages were transfected using jetPEI (Polyplus-Transfection Inc. New York, NY). Synthesis of siRNAs and Antisense miRNA Inhibitors—The miRNA gene sequences were selected from the Sanger Center miRNA Registry. The siRNAs and synthetic antisense miRNA inhibitors (2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides) against mir-16 and mir-28 were chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). miRNA Array Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) from 293T cells transfected with pcDNA-A3G-HA or the pcDNA3 parent vector was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The following RNA processing, microarray fabrication, array hybridization, and data acquisition were performed at LC Sciences (Houston, TX). Briefly, 2-5 μg of total RNA sample, which was size-fractionated using a YM-100 Microcon centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and the small RNAs (<300 nt) isolated were 3′-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated to the poly(A) tail for later fluorescent dye staining. Two different tags were used for the two RNA samples in dual-sample experiments. Hybridization was performed overnight on a Paraflo microfluidic chip using a microcirculation pump (Atactic Technologies, Houston, TX). On the microfluidic chip, each detection probe consisted of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target microRNA or other RNA (control or customer defined sequences) and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to extend the coding segment away from the substrate. Each region in the chip comprises a miRNA probe region, which detects miRNA transcripts listed in Sanger miRBase Release 9.0. Total 469 human miRNAs were tested. The detection probes were made by in situ synthesis using PGR (photogenerated reagent) chemistry. Hybridization used 100 μl of 6× SSPE buffer (0.90 m NaCl, 60 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) containing 25% formamide at 34 °C. After hybridization detection used fluorescence labeling using tag-specific Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. Hybridization images were collected using a GenePix 4000B laser scanner (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized using Array-Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Data were analyzed by first subtracting the background and then normalizing the signals using a LOWESS filter (Locally-weighted Regression). The ratio of the two sets of detected signals (log2 transformed, balanced) and p values of the t test were calculated; differentially detected signals were those with less than 0.01 p values. Real-time RT-PCR Detection—To confirm the miRNA array results, “stem-loop” real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to detect cellular miRNAs, as described, but with minor modifications (43Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). The primers for RT-PCR to detect miRNA were designed based on the miRNA sequences provided by the Sanger Center miRNA Registry (supplemental Table S1). The miRNAs were isolated from 293T cells with the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). RT reactions were performed by means of the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed on the 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). U6 RNA was used as an endogenous control for miRNA detection, while β-actin or β-tubulin mRNA was measured as an endogenous control for luciferase gene expression detection. The cycle number at which the product level exceeded an arbitrarily chosen threshold (CT) was determined for each target sequence, and the amount of each miRNA relative to U6 RNA (or luciferase to β-actin mRNA) was described using the formula 2-ΔCT, where ΔCT = CT(miRNA (or luciferase) - CT U6 RNA (or β-actin). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Primary CD4+ T cells and H9 cells transfected with gfp-containing plasmids were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a Beckman Coulter cytometer (Fullerton, CA) at 48 h post-nucleofection. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and positive percentage rate (%) of green fluorescing cells was determined. Luciferase Assay—A luciferase assay was performed as described (42Chen K. Huang J. Zhang C. Huang S. Nunnari G. Wang F.X. Tong X. Gao L. Nikisher K. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7645-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The co-immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blotting assays were performed as described (44Yang S. Sun Y. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4889-4893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-A3G and anti-A3F antibodies were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Polysome Profile Analysis—Polysome profiles were determined as described with modifications (45Nottrott S. Simard M.J. Richter J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium, and treated with various reagents as indicated in the figure legend, and harvested at 48-h post-transfection at 70-80% confluency by replacing the culture media with fresh media containing cycloheximide (100 μg/ml; Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), followed by resuspension in an ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 units/μl RNasin, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. Nuclei and other cellular debris were then removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were subsequently layered on top of 15-50% sucrose gradients. Centrifugation proceeded at 36,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckmann SW41Ti rotor. The location of polysomes in the gradient was determined by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm using a spectrophotometer. RNAs in each fraction were extracted using TRIzol reagent and subjected to RT-PCR detection using primer pairs for the luciferase and β-tubulin genes. Immunofluorescence and in Situ Hybridization Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of pGFP-GW182delta1 plasmid (Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA) (19Jakymiw A. Lian S. Eystathioy T. Li S. Satoh M. Hamel J.C. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of pcDNA-A3G-HA using FuGENE 6. Cells were fixed at 36-h post-transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, followed by blocking in a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Monoclonal anti-HA (Sigma) was used at 1:500 dilution, and a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for detection. The coverslips were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope System (Thornwood, NY). For in situ hybridization analysis, HeLa cells growing on gelatin-coated coverslips were transfected with the pGFP-GW182delta1 plasmid and pmir-16-luc together with pcDNA-A3G-HA, pcDNA3, or various antisense anti-mir inhibitors, as indicated in the figure legend. At 48-h post-transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde, 10% acetic acid, and PBS. After washing twice in PBS, cells were permeabilized by treatment with 70% ethanol overnight. Probes and coverslip were denatured at 80 °C for 75 s. After rehydration in 2× SSC, (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 50% formamide, the fixed and permeabilized cells (∼105) were hybridized for 1 h in a moist chamber at 37 °C in 40 μl of a mixture containing 10% dextran sulfate, 2 mm vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex, 0.02% RNase-free bovine serum albumin, 40 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA, 2× SSC, 50% formamide, and 10 μl of Cy3-labeled locked nucleic acid probes (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA; for sequence of the probes, see supplemental Table S1), complementary to the luciferase coding regions diluted with 50% deionized formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) to a final concentration of 10 nm. After washing three times for 5 min in a washing buffer containing 0.1× SSC and 50% formamide at 65 °C, followed by washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in antifade medium containing 0.1 μg/ml DAPI. Subsequently, the coverslips were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. A3G Counteracts miRNA-mediated Repression of Protein Translation—We first examined the effect of A3G on the expression of miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we did not find that A3G significantly changed the miRNA expression in 293T cells (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). A3G also did not significantly change the expression of miRNA processors such as Drosha and Dicer1 or RISC components such as Ago2 and Mov10 (supplemental Fig. S3). Further, A3G also did not change the level of expression of P-body components such as GW182, Xrn1 and Lsm1 (supplemental Fig. S3). Nevertheless, the microarray data did indicate that several miRNAs, such as mir-16, mir-10b, mir-25, and let-7a, are abundant in 293T cells. To study whether A3G affects the efficiency of miRNA-mediated translational repression, various 293T cell-enriched miRNA-binding sites with perfect or partial complementarity to their corresponding miRNAs were inserted into the 3′-UTR of luciferase (luc) or gfp (Fig. 1a). These plasmids were transfected into 293T cells, which naturally do not express A3G (22Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 27Yang B. Chen K. Zhang C. Huang S. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with or without an A3G-HA-expressing plasmid. Fig. 1b shows that the presence of mir-16, mir-10b, or mir-25 miRNA-binding sites in the 3′-UTR of luc gene remarkably inhibited the expression of luciferase. Interestingly, A3G significantly counteracted this inhibition. Similar phenomenon can be observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1c). To verif"
https://openalex.org/W2083296702,"Cellular accumulation of DNA damage has been widely implicated in cellular senescence, aging, and premature aging. In Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and restrictive dermopathy (RD), premature aging is linked to accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which results in genome instability. However, how DSBs accumulate in cells despite the presence of intact DNA repair proteins remains unknown. Here we report that the recruitment of DSB repair factors Rad50 and Rad51 to the DSB sites, as marked by gamma-H2AX, was impaired in human HGPS and Zmpste24-deficient cells. Consistently, the progeria-associated DSBs appeared to be unrepairable although DSBs induced by camptothecin were efficiently removed in the progeroid cells. We also found that these progeroid cells exhibited nuclear foci of xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), a unique nucleotide excision repair protein. Strikingly, these XPA foci colocalized with the DSB sites in the progeroid cells. This XPA-DSB association was further confirmed and found to be mediated by DNA, using a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and coimmunoprecipitation. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of XPA in HGPS cells partially restored DSB repair as evidenced by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and comet assays. We propose that the uncharacteristic localization of XPA to or near DSBs inhibits DSB repair, thereby contributing to the premature aging phenotypes observed in progeria arising from genetic defects in prelamin A maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2025227606,"Understanding the factors that influence the success of ecologically and economically damaging biological invasions is of prime importance. Recent studies have shown that invasive populations typically exhibit minimal, if any, reductions in genetic diversity, suggesting that large founding populations and/or multiple introductions are required for the success of biological invasions, consistent with predictions of the propagule pressure hypothesis. Through population genetic analysis of neutral microsatellite markers and a gene experiencing balancing selection, we demonstrate that the solitary bee Lasioglossum leucozonium experienced a single and severe bottleneck during its introduction from Europe. Paradoxically, the success of L. leucozonium in its introduced range occurred despite the severe genetic load caused by single-locus complementary sex-determination that still turns 30% of female-destined eggs into sterile diploid males, thereby substantially limiting the growth potential of the introduced population. Using stochastic modeling, we show that L. leucozonium invaded North America through the introduction of a very small number of propagules, most likely a singly-mated female. Our results suggest that chance events and ecological traits of invaders are more important than propagule pressure in determining invasion success, and that the vigilance required to prevent invasions may be considerably greater than has been previously considered."
https://openalex.org/W2126040395,"Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2 (UGT2)B15 and B17 enzymes conjugate dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and its metabolites androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-DIOL) and androsterone (ADT). The presence of UGT2B15/B17 in the epithelial cells of the human prostate has been clearly demonstrated, and significant 3α-DIOL glucuronide and ADT-glucuronide concentrations have been detected in this tissue. The human androgen-dependent cancer cell line, LNCaP, expresses UGT2B15 and -B17 and is also capable of conjugating androgens. To assess the impact of these two genes in the inactivation of androgens in LNCaP cells, their expression was inhibited using RNA interference. The efficient inhibitory effects of a UGT2B15/B17 small interfering RNA (siRNA) probe was established by the 70% reduction of these UGT mRNA levels, which was further confirmed at the protein levels. The glucuronidation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 3α-DIOL, and ADT by LNCaP cell homogenates was reduced by more than 75% in UGT2B15/B17 siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells when compared with cells transfected with a non-target probe. In UGT2B15/B17-deficient LNCaP cells, we observe a stronger response to DHT than in control cells, as determined by cell proliferation and expression of eight known androgen-sensitive genes. As expected, the amounts of DHT in cell culture media from control cells were significantly lower than that from UGT2B15/B17 siRNA-treated cells, which was caused by a higher conversion to its corresponding glucuronide derivative. Taken together these data support the idea that UGT2B15 and -B17 are critical enzymes for the local inactivation of androgens and that glucuronidation is a major determinant of androgen action in prostate cells. Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2 (UGT2)B15 and B17 enzymes conjugate dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and its metabolites androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-DIOL) and androsterone (ADT). The presence of UGT2B15/B17 in the epithelial cells of the human prostate has been clearly demonstrated, and significant 3α-DIOL glucuronide and ADT-glucuronide concentrations have been detected in this tissue. The human androgen-dependent cancer cell line, LNCaP, expresses UGT2B15 and -B17 and is also capable of conjugating androgens. To assess the impact of these two genes in the inactivation of androgens in LNCaP cells, their expression was inhibited using RNA interference. The efficient inhibitory effects of a UGT2B15/B17 small interfering RNA (siRNA) probe was established by the 70% reduction of these UGT mRNA levels, which was further confirmed at the protein levels. The glucuronidation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 3α-DIOL, and ADT by LNCaP cell homogenates was reduced by more than 75% in UGT2B15/B17 siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells when compared with cells transfected with a non-target probe. In UGT2B15/B17-deficient LNCaP cells, we observe a stronger response to DHT than in control cells, as determined by cell proliferation and expression of eight known androgen-sensitive genes. As expected, the amounts of DHT in cell culture media from control cells were significantly lower than that from UGT2B15/B17 siRNA-treated cells, which was caused by a higher conversion to its corresponding glucuronide derivative. Taken together these data support the idea that UGT2B15 and -B17 are critical enzymes for the local inactivation of androgens and that glucuronidation is a major determinant of androgen action in prostate cells. Production and secretion of testosterone by the testis has long been considered one of the major factors influencing androgen function in androgen target tissues, namely, the prostate. Thus, circulating testosterone taken up from the circulation is converted by 5α-reductase to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 4The abbreviations used are: DHT, dihydrotestosterone; DHT-G, DHT-glucuronide; 3α-DIOL, androstane-3α, 17β-diol; ADT, androsterone; UGT2, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2; UDPGA, UDP-glucuronic acid; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectometry; RT, reverse transcription; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; AR, androgen receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PSA, prostate-specific antigen. the natural androgen receptor agonist (1Zhou Z.X.

There is clear evidence now that adrenal steroid precursors, namely dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate, are converted to testosterone in several tissues (2Bélanger A. Pelletier G. Labrie F.

The observation that the DHT concentration in prostate is only decreased by 50% in castrated patients treated for prostate cancer further support the role of adrenal steroid precursors as a source of androgens (4Geller J.

These findings of local transformation of circulating steroids into bioactive testosterone and DHT have been integrated in the process called “intracrinology,” where several steroidogenic enzymes, including 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-Δ4–5 isomerase (3α-HSD type 1), 17β-HSDs, and 5α-reductase, contribute to the formation of DHT (2Bélanger A.

Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that tissue DHT concentrations are also modulated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) type 3 and 17β-HSD type 7, which form inactive androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-DIOL) and androsterone (ADT) (8Couture J.F. de Jesus-Tran K.P.

Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although extremely important in modulating tissue DHT levels, these steroidogenic enzymes are reversible. By contrast, glucuronidation of these substrates, namely DHT, 3α-DIOL, and ADT, is an irreversible process of steroid metabolism, and this conjugation is present in several androgen target tissues (10Green M.D. Oturu E.M.

Thus, the bulky, polar metabolite is no longer able to interact with its corresponding receptor, and its excretion is facilitated by the increase in water solubility (15Mackenzie P.I. Walter Bock K.

Of the 17 UGT enzymes identified in humans, only 3 conjugate testosterone and its metabolites at physiologically relevant levels: UGT2B7, -B15, and -B17 (2Bélanger A. Pelletier G. Labrie F.

UGT2B7 and -B17 conjugate ADT at the position 3-hydroxyl, whereas only UGT2B7 forms 3α-DIOL-3-glucuronide. UGT2B15 and -B17 specifically conjugate DHT and 3α-DIOL at the 17-hydroxyl position (2Bélanger A. Pelletier G. Labrie F. Barbier O. Chouinard S. Trends Endocrinol.

Labrie F. Mellstrom D. Swanson C. Knutsson T. Peeker R. Ljunggren O. Orwoll E. Eriksson A.L. Damber J.E. Ohlsson C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This was in agreement with previous reports indicating the presence of UGT2B15 and -B17 transcripts in the prostate and the localization of both enzymes by immunohistochemistry in luminal and basal epithelial cells, respectively (19Barbier O.

Res. 2004; 30: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although circulating testosterone and adrenal steroid precursors and several local steroidogenic enzymes are implicated to ensure production of tissue DHT in a given tissue and, consequently, the expression of androgen-dependent genes, it is now clear that androgen-conjugating enzymes also contribute to local androgen homeostasis. Most interestingly, the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism within the coding region of the UGT2B15 gene, which results in an amino acid change from an aspartic acid to a tyrosine at position 85, has been previously reported (11Lévesque É. Beaulieu M. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The UGT2B15D85 enzyme is less efficient in glucuronidating DHT, and it was postulated that the presence of this low activity allele would result in higher intraprostatic DHT concentrations (11Lévesque É.

In the present study we have tested the hypothesis that glucuronidation of androgen in LNCaP cells may alter the expression of androgen-dependent genes. In androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, UGT2B15 and -B17 are highly expressed (17Chouinard S. Pelletier G. Bélanger A. Barbier O. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 5431-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the conjugation of androgen metabolites such as DHT, 3α-DIOL, and ADT have been demonstrated (2Bélanger A.

The presence of UGT2B15/B17 in LNCaP cells was particularly useful to investigate the regulation of their expression by several factors, including androgen, growth factors, and cytokines (17Chouinard S.

An anti-rabbit IgG horse antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the second antibody, and the resulting immunocomplexes were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (ECL) (Renaissance, Quebec, Quebec, Canada) and exposed on Hyperfilm™ (Eastman Kodak Co) for 15–60 s. Glucuronidation Assay and Steroid Assays—Enzymatic assays were performed using 10–20 μg of total proteins in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with dithiothreitol (0.5 mm) in the presence of 1 mm UDPGA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 8.5 mm saccharolactone, and 200 μm concentrations of the different substrates (25Turgeon D.

The formation of glucuronide conjugates in cell homogenate and in cell media DHT-G was measured by using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described (25Turgeon D.

The formation of DHT- and R1881-glucuronide by LNCaP cell homogenates (40 μg) was investigated using 0.2 μCi of [14C]UDPGA in enzymatic assay buffer using 20 μm R1881 or DHT for 16 h of incubation at 37 °C and stopped as described above. The presence of glucuronide was demonstrated on TLC using a migration buffer containing toluene:methanol:acetic acid (7:3:1). RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription (RT), and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from LNCaP cells according to the Tri-Reagent acid phenol protocol as specified by the supplier (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The reverse transcription reaction was performed using 1.0 μg of total RNA with 100 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and 3.75 ng of random hexamer (Roche Applied Science) at 42 °C for 50 min. The real time PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 instrument from Applied Biosystems. For each gene, the amplification efficiency was tested using 2–5 log of concentrations of cDNA produced from LNCaP cell-purified mRNA, and real time PCR were performed as previously described (17Chouinard S. Pelletier G. Bélanger A. Barbier O. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 5431-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A final volume of 20 μl for each reaction comprised 10 μl of SYBRGreen PCR mix, 2 μl of each primer (Table 1), and 6 μl of a RT product (1/100 dilution for genes of interest and 1/1000 for 28S). Conditions for real time PCR were 95 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 15 s, and 56 °C (UGT2B10, -B15, -B17, KLK4, and VEGF), 60 °C (TMPRSS2 and 28S), 62 °C (B11, AR, and PSA), 63 °C (ABCG1 and SLC16A6), 65 °C (NKX3.1), or 68 °C (RAD23) for 60 s for 40 cycles. ΔΔCt values were calculated by normalizing target gene mRNA with 28S RNA levels. The Ct values of UGT2B were normalized with the internal control 28S (ΔCt = Ctgene of interest – Ct28S, and ΔΔCt were obtained by comparison of siRNA UGT2B15/B17, and Non-Target. For expression of PSA, NKX3.1, TMPRSS2, KLK4, SLC16A6, VEGF, ABCG1, and RAD23A, ΔΔCt values were obtained by normalizing treated cells with control cells.TABLE 1Conditions for real time PCRGenesPrimersFinal concentrationnm28SForward, 5′-AAACTCTGGTGGAGGTCCGT-3′125Reverse, 5′-CTTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA-3′UGT2B10Forward, 5′-ATCCCACAAAAGGTTCTT-3′125Reverse, 5′-GCCTTCATGTGAGCAATA-3′UGT2B11Forward, 5′-AAAGGTTCTGTGGAGATTTGAC-3′125Reverse, 5′-GACATTGTGTTGAAGTCCAAT-3′UGT2B15Forward, 5′-GTGTTGGGAATATTATGACTACAGTAAC-3′125Reverse, 5′-GGGTATGTTAAATAGTTCAGCCAGT-3′UGT2B17Forward, 5′-TGACTTTTGGTTTCAAGC-3′300Reverse, 5′-TTCCATTTCCTTAGGCAA-3′PSAForward, 5′-GGCAGGTGCTTGTAGCCTCTC-3′400Reverse, 5′-CACCCGAGCAGGTGCTTTTGC-3′ARForward, 5′-GAAGCCATTGAGCCAGGTGT-3′125Reverse, 5′-TCGTCCACGTGTAAGTTGCG-3′NKX3.1Forward, 5′-CGCTCACGTCCTTCCTCATC-3′400Reverse, 5′-CCTTTCTGGCTCGGTCTCTGC-3′TMPRSS2Forward, 5′-GTGATTTCTCATCCAAATTA-3′300Reverse, 5′-TCCAGCAGAGCTGTTCTGGC-3′KLK4Forward, 5′-GGCACTGGTCATGGAAAACGA-3′300Reverse, 5′-TCAAGACTGTGCAGGCCCAGCC-3′SLC16A6Forward, 5′-ACATCTTCATTCAGAGCATAGC-3′150Reverse, 5′-GTCCCATCTTACACGGTCTC-3′VEGFForward, 5′-GACAAGAAAATCCCTGTGGGC-3′150Reverse, 5′-AACGCGAGTCTGTGTTTTTGC-3′ABCG1Forward, 5′-CGCATCACCTCGCACATTG-3′150Reverse, 5′-TCCCGAAGAAAGACTCCCATG-3′RAD23AForward, 5′-CCCACCTCAGGCATGTCCCATCCC-3′150Reverse, 5′-GCAGATACTCCACGGCTCGGTGGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analyses—A nonparametric Student t test was used to analyze for significant difference between the experimental groups by using the JMP Version 5.0.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Dose- and Time-dependent Inhibition of UGT2B mRNA Levels Using UGT2B15/B17 siRNA—The UGT inhibition efficiency was assayed by transfecting LNCaP cells with a non-target (control) or with increasing concentrations of a specific UGT2B15/B17 siRNA probe (Table 2) for 72 h. We observed a 70% inhibition of UGT2B15 and -B17 mRNA levels with 25 nm siRNA with no further significant inhibition using higher concentrations (Fig. 1A). Analyses of other UGT2B genes expressed in LNCaP cells reveal that the siRNA probe is specific for UGT2B15 and -B17 mRNA (Fig. 1B). UGT2B7 was also expressed in this cell line, but its levels of expression were almost at the limit of detection (data not shown). Using 25 nm siRNA, we next performed a time-course experiment up to 96 h after transfection. We observed a decrease of 70% in mRNA expression for UGT2B15/B17 at 24 h after transfection with the siRNA, and this inhibition was maintained up to 96 h (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Time-dependent inhibition of UGT2B15/B17 mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels. LNCaP cells were transfected with 25 nm of Non-target (control) or B15/B17 siRNA and subsequently cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. A, UGT2B15 and -B17 mRNA levels were quantified using real time PCR. Data are the mean of two experiments performed in triplicate. B, UGT2B15, B17, and calnexin (loading control) protein levels were analyzed using specific antibodies in total LNCaP cells proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Time-dependent Inhibition of UGT2B15 mRNA and Protein Levels in LNCaP Cells—To further ascertain the inhibition of UGT2B15/B17 expression, we then quantified the UGT2B15 and -B17 protein levels in transfected cells cultured for 72 and 96 h. As expected, Western blot experiments reveal significant levels of UGT2B15 and -B17 protein in both human liver microsome (positive control) and non-target siRNA-transfected cells. Interestingly, the UGT2B15 protein levels in UGT2B15/B17 siRNA-transfected cells were reduced to an undetectable level after 72 and 96 h, whereas the UGT2B17 protein content was significantly reduced but still detectable (Fig. 2B). The equal loading of SDS-PAGE gels was subsequently ensured by Western blotting with the anti-calnexin antibody. These observations confirm that the UGT2B15/B17 siRNA drastically affects the synthesis of the two proteins in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of Androgen-conjugating Activity of UGT2B15/B17 in LNCaP Cells—The consequences of UGT2B15 and -B17 inhibition on the formation of androgen glucuronide were subsequently investigated in glucuronidation assays with siRNA-transfected LNCaP cell homogenates and DHT, ADT, and 3α-DIOL as substrates. The UGT2B17-dependent formation of ADT-3G was 62 and 75%-reduced in UGT2B15/B17-deficient cells cultured for 72 and 96 h, respectively (Fig. 3), which confirms the marked inhibition of UGT2B17 transcript and protein levels. The conjugation of 3α-DIOL and DHT was also decreased by more than 55% (after 72 h) to reach a maximal reduction of almost 95% for 3α-DIOL and 85% for DHT (after 96 h). Because both androgens are substrates of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, these reductions further confirm that both UGT activities are affected by the UGT2B15/B17 probe (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that reduction of UGT2B15 and -B17 expression in LNCaP cells results in a lower androgen-conjugating activity in these cells. The impact of the loss in UGT2B15/B17 proteins was also assessed in living cells by measuring the concentrations of DHT and DHT-G in media of UGT-deficient and control cells (Fig. 4). In control cells treated with DHT at 1000 and 5000 pm, the amounts of DHT in media after 12 h of incubation were still significant and were dose-dependent as previously demonstrated (30Guillemette C. Bélanger A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the presence of DHT, LNCaP cells also produced DHT-G in a dose-dependent manner. This observation confirms that LNCaP cells in culture are able to glucuronidate physiologically relevant concentrations of DHT. Marked increased amounts of DHT in media were measured in UGT2B15/B17-deficient cells compared with control cells when 1000 and 5000 pm DHT was added for 12 h (Fig. 4A). By contrast, a significant decrease in production of DHT-G was observed (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these observations demonstrated that inhibition of UGT2B15 and -B17 expression reduces the formation of androgen-glucuronide derivatives both in in vitro assay and in cultured cell media and that this inhibition results in higher DHT concentrations in cell media. Inhibition of UGT2B15/B17 Enhances the Androgen Signaling Pathway in LNCaP Cells—To first decipher the consequences of the reduction of DHT glucuronidation on the cellular response to androgens, the mRNA levels of eight androgen-regulated genes were compared in control and UGT-deficient LNCaP cells cultured in the presence or absence of 1 nm concentration of R1881 and DHT for 12 h. As illustrated in Table 3, this set of genes (six up-regulated: PSA, KLK4, NKX3.1, SLC16A6, TMPRSS2, and VEGF; two down-regulated: ABCG1 and RAD23A) was chosen based on previous studies having reported the androgen-dependent regulation of their expression in LNCaP cells (31Ma A.H.

https://openalex.org/W2083708006,"The inactive X chromosome characteristic of female somatic lineages is reactivated during development of the female germ cell lineage. In mouse, analysis of protein products of X-linked genes and/or transgenes located on the X chromosome has indicated that reactivation occurs after primordial germ cells reach the genital ridges.We present evidence that the epigenetic reprogramming of the inactive X-chromosome is initiated earlier than was previously thought, around the time that primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate through the hindgut. Specifically, we find that Xist RNA expression, the primary signal for establishment of chromosome silencing, is extinguished in migrating PGCs. This is accompanied by displacement of Polycomb-group repressor proteins Eed and Suz(12), and loss of the inactive X associated histone modification, methylation of histone H3 lysine 27.We conclude that X reactivation in primordial germ cells occurs progressively, initiated by extinction of Xist RNA around the time that germ cells migrate through the hindgut to the genital ridges. The events that we observe are reminiscent of X reactivation of the paternal X chromosome in inner cell mass cells of mouse pre-implantation embryos and suggest a unified model in which execution of the pluripotency program represses Xist RNA thereby triggering progressive reversal of epigenetic silencing of the X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2077537034,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that controls the initiation and progression of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tpl2 is a MAPKKK in the MAPK (i.e. ERK) pathway, and the Tpl2-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is activated by the pro-inflammatory mediators TNFα, interleukin (IL)-1β, and bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Moreover, Tpl2 is required for TNFα expression. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of Tpl2 should be a valid approach to therapeutic intervention in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases in humans. We have developed a series of highly selective and potent Tpl2 inhibitors, and in the present study we have used these inhibitors to demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Tpl2 is required for the LPS-induced activation of MEK and ERK in primary human monocytes. These inhibitors selectively target Tpl2 in these cells, and they block LPS- and IL-1β-induced TNFα production in both primary human monocytes and human blood. In rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes these inhibitors block ERK activation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and the production of IL-6, IL-8, and prostaglandin E2, and the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-3. Taken together, our results show that inhibition of Tpl2 in primary human cell types can decrease the production of TNFα and other pro-inflammatory mediators during inflammatory events, and they further support the notion that Tpl2 is an appropriate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other human inflammatory diseases.

Tpl2 is a member of the MAPKKK family of serine/threonine kinases. It resides upstream of the MAPKKs MEK1 and MEK2, and, in turn, the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. This Tpl2-MEK-ERK signaling module is activated in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli, and it regulates the expression of several pro-inflammatory mediators (1Das S. Cho J. Lambertz I.

The success of these drugs has validated the use of anti-TNFα therapies for treating arthritic and inflammatory diseases, and they have necessitated the search for small molecule inhibitors with similar or related mechanisms of action. Due to its physiological roles in cytokine signaling networks and its key role in the production of TNFα, a highly selective, small molecule inhibitor of Tpl2 should constitute an effective therapy for TNFα-driven inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Genetic studies with tpl2–/– mice have shown that Tpl2 is required for the expression of TNFα in circulating plasma following the administration of LPS in vivo, and cultured macrophages from tpl2–/– mice exhibited markedly reduced TNFα production following LPS stimulation (2Dumitru C.D.

These data implicate the Tpl2-MEK-ERK module as a fundamental signaling component in cells of the innate immune system. However, Tpl2 signaling also regulates adaptive immunity. MEK/ERK activation in response to CD40 stimulation is ablated in tpl2–/– B cells, and a study of tpl2–/– dendritic cells demonstrated that Tpl2 is a negative regulator of IL-12 production in that cell type (4Eliopoulos A.G.

Dendritic cell IL-12 is known to induce Th1-type T cell differentiation, and Th1-skewed immune responses in tpl2–/– mice were observed following ovalbumin immunization or Leishmania major infection in vivo. Although the foregoing studies indicate that Tpl2 is an important regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity, all of those studies were performed with Tpl2-deficient mice and cells derived from those mice. Currently, there are almost no reports of the targeted down-regulation of Tpl2 in human cell types (for one such report, see Ref. 6Rodriguez C. Pozo M. Nieto E. Fernandez M. Alemany S. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies are necessary to further validate Tpl2 as a therapeutic target for human inflammatory disorders. We have used highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitors of Tpl2 activity to validate several functions of Tpl2 in human cells. First, we demonstrate that Tpl2 is required for the LPS-induced activation of MEK and ERK in primary human monocytes. Second, we show that inhibition of Tpl2 blocks LPS- and IL-1β-induced TNFα production in primary human monocytes and human blood. Third, our Tpl2 inhibitors block ERK activation, COX-2 expression, and the production of various soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in RA-FLS. Taken together, our data confirm physiological roles for Tpl2 in human inflammatory cell types, and they provide essential insights into the value of Tpl2 as a target for therapeutic intervention in human inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For inhibitor studies with TNFα-stimulated, non-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 7), the cells were plated in DMEM, 0.5% FBS 1 day prior to testing. Inhibitors were added 30–45 min before stimulation with 100 ng/ml rhTNFα (R&D Systems). Cell lysates were then prepared in 1× LDS buffer and immunoblotted. Media aliquots from 4-h stimulations were analyzed for IL-8 by electrochemiluminescence detection on a Sector6000 plate reader according to the manufacturerŉs instructions (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). Toxicity was assessed using the WST-1 Reagent. Primary Human Monocytes—Human blood buffy coats were purchased from the Blood Transfusion Service at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). Monocytes were prepared by negative selection. For each preparation, EDTA was added to the buffy coat to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the buffy coat was incubated with the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment antibody mixture from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada) for 20 min (6 ml of mixture per 50 ml of buffy coat). The buffy coat was then diluted with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% FBS and 1 mm EDTA, layered on an equal volume of Ficoll-Paque (Sigma), and centrifuged at 500 × g for 20 min (brake on low or off). Cells located within ∼1 cm above the interface were removed, layered on an equal volume of Ficoll-Paque, and centrifuged as above. All cells above this second interface were collected, pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 2% FBS, 1 mm EDTA (brake on high). The cell pellet was suspended to 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (pH 7.3) supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Cellular yields were routinely 65–80% CD14-positive as judged by flow cytometry. Monocytes were plated in 48-well formats at 400 μl (∼800,000 cells) per well, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for ≥30 min. Tpl2 inhibitor or vehicle (Me2SO) was added for 30–45 min. Final Me2SO concentrations were 0.25%. Salmonella typhimurium LPS (Sigma) was used at 10 ng/ml, and rhIL-1β (BioSource International) was used at 100 ng/ml. Cell lysates were prepared in 1× LDS buffer and immunoblotted. For cytokine determinations, monocytes were stimulated for 3–4 h and media aliquots were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence detection. Toxicity was assessed using the WST-1 Reagent. Whole Blood—Cytokine levels in human blood were analyzed as described previously (18Gavrin L.K. Green N. Hu Y. Janz K. Kaila N. Li H.Q. Tam S.Y. Thomason J.R. Gopalsamy A. Ciszewski G. Cuozzo J.W. Hall J.P. Hsu S. Telliez J.B. Lin L.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5288-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blood samples were stimulated for 3–4 h with LPS or rhIL-1β at 10 or 100 ng/ml, respectively. RA-FLS—Cryopreserved RA-FLS (Cell Applications, San Diego, CA) were thawed and cultured in Synoviocyte Growth Medium according to the supplierŉs instructions. In all experiments, media was changed to RPMI 1640, 0.5% FBS, and Tpl2 inhibitor or vehicle (Me2SO) was added 30–45 min before stimulation with 100 ng/ml rhIL-1β or rhTNFα. Cell lysates were prepared in 1× LDS buffer and immunoblotted. Media aliquots from 4-h stimulations with rhIL-1β were analyzed for PGE2 by ELISA (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI), and for IL-6 and IL-8 by electrochemiluminescence detection. Media aliquots from 24-h stimulations with rhIL-1β were analyzed for MMPs by Luminex (R&D Systems). Media aliquots from 24-h stimulations with rhTNFα were analyzed for PGE2 by ELISA. Toxicity was assessed using the WST-1 Reagent. Peritoneal Macrophages—All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were provided food and water ad libitum. tpl2–/– mice (backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for >10 generations) were obtained from Dr. Philip Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University). These mice were crossed with 129S5 mice to produce F1 heterozygotes. The F1 mice were inter-crossed to produce F2s. Female TPL2+/+, TPL2+/–, and tpl2–/– F2 littermates (8–12 weeks of age) were injected intra-peritoneally with 1 ml of sterile 4% Brewer thioglycollate broth (BD Biosciences), and 72 h later peritoneal exudate cells were isolated by lavage with RPMI 1640. The cells were washed and plated in RPMI 1640, 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at ∼3 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish. After ∼5 h, non-adherent cells were removed by repeated washing, and the adherent macrophages were subjected to various treatments. Total macrophage protein levels were quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). S. typhimurium LPS was from Sigma, and rmIL-1β and rmTNFα were from BioSource International. Cell lysates were prepared in 1× LDS buffer and immunoblotted as above. Cytokine levels in media supernatants were measured by electrochemiluminescence detection. A Chemical Series of Selective Tpl2 Inhibitors—We have developed a series of compounds that inhibit Tpl2, and the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of the early prototypes in this series have been described (18Gavrin L.K.

Compounds 1, 2, and 3 in this article (structures shown in Figs. 2A and 3A) are representative of our chemical series of Tpl2 inhibitors inasmuch as they are highly selective for Tpl2 inhibition when tested against a panel of 13 kinases. This panel includes kinases known to be involved in TNFα production (e.g. p38 and MK2) plus other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. As an example of the highly selective nature of our Tpl2 inhibitors, Table 1 shows the cell-free IC50 values in all 13 kinase assays for the C8-chloronaphthyridine-3-carbonitrile shown in Fig. 2A and named here as Compound 1. Among these 13 kinases, Compound 1 was least selective against CaMKII, but it was 2000-fold less potent against CaMKII than Tpl2 (Tpl2 IC50 = 12 nm). Importantly, relative to the unsubstituted parent molecule (compound 31 in Ref. 19Hu Y. Green N. Gavrin L.K. Janz K. Kaila N. Li H.Q. Thomason J.R. Cuozzo J.W. Hall J.P. Hsu S. Nickerson-Nutter C.

The overexpression of Tpl2 from this plasmid augmented the steady-state phosphorylation levels of endogenous MEK and ERK and the production and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 (Fig. 1). This TPL2-driven production of IL-8 is consistent with our published findings (21Channavajhala P.L. Wu L. Cuozzo J.W. Hall J.P. Liu W. Lin L.L. Zhang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47089-47097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These responses required the catalytic activity of overexpressed Tpl2 because they did not occur in the presence of the kinase-inactive Tpl2-K167R. Thus, our HeLa transfectants provided MEK/ERK activation and IL-8 production as cellular responses that are induced by Tpl2 kinase activity. Indeed, Compound 1 inhibited IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1 μm (Fig. 2B). Compound 1 also inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown). Tpl2 Catalytic Activity Is Required for the LPS-induced Activation of MEK and ERK in Primary Human Monocytes—Next, we screened our Tpl2 inhibitors by measuring their inhibition of LPS-induced MEK phosphorylation in freshly isolated primary human monocytes.

This process can be pharmacologically disturbed in C57BL/6 mice, and thus infertility can be induced, by small molecular sugar-like compounds (alkylated imino sugars). Here the biochemical basis of this effect has been investigated. Our findings suggest that in vivo alkylated imino sugars primarily interact with the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. This enzyme cleaves glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide, is sensitive to imino sugars in vitro, and has been characterized as β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2). Imino sugars raised the level of glucosylceramide in brain, spleen, and testis, in a dose-dependent fashion. In testis, multiple species of glucosylceramide were similarly elevated, those having long acyl chains (C16–24), as well as those with very long polyunsaturated acyl chains (C28–30:5). Both of these GlcCer species were also increased in the testes from GBA2-deficient mice. When considering that the very long polyunsaturated sphingolipids are restricted to germ cells, these results indicate that in the testis GBA2 is present in both somatic and germ cells. Furthermore, in all mouse strains tested imino sugar treatment caused a rise in testicular glucosylceramide, even in a number of strains, of which the males remain fertile after drug administration. Therefore, it appears that acrosome formation can be derailed by accumulation of glucosylceramide in an extralysosomal localization, and that the sensitivity of male germ cells to glucosylceramide is genetically determined.

It occupies a bridging position in the metabolic pathways of sphingolipids, connecting “simple” sphingolipids (including ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingomyelin (1Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar)) with complex glycosylated sphingolipids (e.g. gangliosides GM3 and GM1), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Also, in contrast to complex GSLs, which have a luminal/extracellular orientation in cellular membranes, GlcCer is in part uniquely oriented in the cell, being located in the cytosolic leaflet of cellular membranes with its carbohydrate moiety extending into the cytosolic compartment (2Meer G. Wolthoorn J. Degroote S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Degroote S. Wolthoorn J. van Meer G. Semin. Cell Dev.

Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This is a consequence of the cellular topology of GSL biosynthesis. The synthesis of GlcCer, catalyzed by the ceramide-glucosyltransferase (GlcCer synthase, Fig. 1 and Table 1), takes place in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the cis-Golgi cisternae (5Coste H. Martel M.B.

From here GlcCer is translocated to the luminal side of the Golgi, where it is converted into more complex GSLs, starting with the addition of a galactose by lactosylceramide synthase (10Kolter T. Proia R.L. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25859-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Alternatively, after synthesis GlcCer can be transported by nonvesicular means to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (11Warnock D.E. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young Jr., W.W.

Open table in a new tab It has long been known that GlcCer is degraded in lysosomes by glucocerebrosidase/GBA1 (Fig. 1 and Table 1), but it is increasingly evident that GlcCer can also be hydrolyzed in an extralysosomal location, through the glucosylceramidase activity of β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2, Fig. 1 and Table 1). This enzyme was originally identified and characterized as the microsomal bile acid β-glucosidase, or β-glucosidase 2 (12Matern H. Gartzen R. Matern S.

It was recently found that GBA2 also has glucosylceramidase activity, it cleaves the sphingolipid glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide (15Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C.

In addition, the enzymatic activity of GBA2 has been identified as the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (16Boot R.G. Verhoek M. Donker-Koopman W. Strijland A. van Marle J. Overkleeft H.S. Wennekes T.

This has emerged from the analysis of male (129S6/SvEv x C57BL/6) mice that are deficient for GBA2. The GBA2-deficient male mice have increased levels of glucosylceramide in their testes, liver, and brain (15Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the male GBA2–/– mice produce round-headed spermatozoa that have aberrant acrosomes. The fertility of the male GBA2-deficient mice is reduced, as assessed in natural mating tests (15Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Also, in wild-type testis GBA2 was detected by immunostaining in Sertoli cells (15Yildiz Y.

The data on the subcellular localization of GBA2 suggest that it is present in the ER (15Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S.

Taken together, these studies suggest that the lack of non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity leads to an accumulation of GlcCer in Sertoli cells, which, in turn, has a deleterious impact on spermatid development, resulting in reduced fertility. It has thus been proposed that an elevation of glucosylceramide in Sertoli cells has a disrupting effect on spermatogenesis (15Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The bile acid β-glucosidase activity of GBA2 can be inhibited by N-alkylated imino sugars such as N-carboxynonyldeoxynojirimycin and N-dodecyldeoxynojirimycin, having IC50 values of 20 and 2 nm, respectively (13Matern H. Heinemann H. Legler G. Matern S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11261-11267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity is sensitive to N-alkylated imino sugars, including N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) (16Boot R.G. Verhoek M. Donker-Koopman W. Strijland A. van Marle J. Overkleeft H.S. Wennekes T. Aerts J.M. J. Biol.

In addition, the latter two imino sugars induce infertility in C57BL/6 mice, by perturbing spermiogenesis, leading to the production of abnormal spermatozoa that lack acrosomes (19der Spoel, A. C., Jeyakumar, M., Butters, T. D., Charlton, H. M., Moore, H. D., Dwek, R. A., and Platt, F. M. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 17173–17178Google Scholar). This prompted speculation that the impairment of sperm development caused by NB-DNJ and NB-DGJ may be caused by inhibition of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase/GBA2 (15Yildiz Y. Matern H.

Reprod. 2006; 21: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This implies that, similar to the GBA2-deficient mice, imino sugar administration to wild-type mice should result in elevation of GlcCer levels in the testes and other tissues. In turn, this would further support the notion that non-lysosomal GlcCer accumulation in the testis leads to impairment of spermatogenesis. However, we have recently reported that administration of NB-DNJ to male mice does not necessarily result in infertility. The reproductive effect of NB-DNJ in male inbred mice is strain-dependent (23Bone W. Walden C.M. Fritsch M. Voigtmann U. Leifke E. Gottwald U. Boomkamp S. Platt F.M. van der Spoel A.C. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2007; 5: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have shown that the reproductive consequences of NB-DNJ are much milder in male mice of various inbred strains from the Swiss/Castle lineages, judging by the acrosomal and nuclear morphology of their spermatozoa. Also, after NB-DNJ administration, FVB/N, DBA/2, and 129S1/SvImJ males were equally fertile as controls in natural mating tests (23Bone W. Walden C.M. Fritsch M. Voigtmann U. Leifke E. Gottwald U. Boomkamp S. Platt F.M. van der Spoel A.C. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2007; 5: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have here investigated the biochemical consequences of administration of alkylated imino sugars to male mice, in particular the effects on GlcCer and on enzymes involved in GlcCer metabolism. The data presented here are consistent with the notion that GBA2 is the primary target of alkylated imino sugars that induce infertility in male C57BL/6 mice. We have extended previous studies with detailed analyses of the lipid structures of the GlcCer species in imino sugar-treated and in GBA2-deficient mice. Also, examination of GlcCer levels in the testes of NB-DNJ-treated males, from strains that remain fertile after drug administration, revealed that GlcCer accumulation in the testis does not necessarily lead to impairment of spermatogenesis. Drug Administration—Male mice from various strains (BALB/c, C3H, C57BL/6, C57BL/10, DBA2, FVB/N, and NZW) were obtained from Harlan UK (Bicester, UK). Male mice from the 129S1/SvImJ, AKR/J, C57BR/J, and MA/MyJ strains were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed and sacrificed in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. NB-DNJ was a gift from Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK/CellTech UK, Slough, Berkshire, UK. NB-DGJ was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Downsview, ON, Canada). To administer imino sugars, 6- or 10-week-old mice were fed a diet of powdered mouse chow (expanded Rat and Mouse Chow 1, ground, Special Diet Services, Witham, Essex, UK) containing either NB-DNJ or NB-DGJ. The diet and compounds (both as dry solids) were mixed thoroughly, and stored at room temperature. Mice were administered an imino sugar for 5 weeks, unless stated otherwise. Imino Sugar Determination—The serum concentration of NB-DNJ was measured by high-performance cation-exchange chromatography on a BioLC system (Dionex, Camberley, Surrey, UK) with pulsed amperometric detection according to Ref. 24Mellor H.R. Adam A. Platt F.M. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Glycolipid Extraction and Purification—For isolation of GlcCer, tissues were homogenized in deionized water (≤250 mg wet weight/ml) with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, lyophilized, and extracted four times with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) over 24 h. Combined extracts were dried under a steam of nitrogen. Aliquots of extracted lipids normalized to dry weight were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform and loaded on silicic acid columns (prepared with 3 ml of 10% (w/v) silicic acid (mesh 200–400; Sigma) slurry in chloroform). Columns were washed with 2 ml of chloroform, and eluted with 6 ml of acetone. Eluates were dried under nitrogen. For isolation of neutral and anionic glycolipids other than GlcCer, tissues were homogenized as above and extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3, v/v/v). Glycolipids were processed and purified by C18-chromatography as described (25Neville D.C. Coquard V. Priestman D.A. te Vruchte D.J. Sillence D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 331: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thin Layer Chromatography—Aliquots of silicic acid- and C18-purified glycolipids corresponding to 3 mg dry weight (unless stated otherwise) were spotted on HPTLC plates (VWR, Lutterworth Leicestershire, UK), which were resolved as specified in the text. Neutral sphingolipids isolated from brain samples were loaded on borate-impregnated HPTLC plates that were developed in chloroform, methanol, 25% NH4OH, water (130:35:4:4, v/v/v/v). Glycolipids were detected with orcinol. Immediately after staining images were recorded with an Epson Perfection 4870 scanner. Glycolipid levels were quantitated with Image J 1.36b software. For preparative thin layer chromatography aliquots of silicic acid-purified glycolipids corresponding to 6 mg dry weight were spotted on HPTLC plates, which were developed in chloroform/methanol/water (65:30:4, v/v/v). Areas of the plate corresponding to bands of interest were scraped. The silica was extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and once with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Mass Spectrometry—Analysis was performed with a triple quadrupole instrument (VG micromass (Cheshire, UK) model Quattro II) equipped with a nano-electrospray source and gold-sputtered capillaries as described (26Gunzer F. Hennig-Pauka I. Waldmann K.H. Sandhoff R. Grone H.J. Kreipe H.H. Matussek A. Mengel M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 118: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelins were detected with a precursor ion m/z +184 scan (cone voltage: 40 V and collision energy: 35 eV) (27Brugger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Glucocerebrosidase Digestion and Glucose Detection—Glycolipids purified by preparative TLC were dried under nitrogen, and incubated with 5 μl of 36 units/ml glucocerebrosidase (Ceredase®, Genzyme, West Malling, Kent, UK) in 50 μl of 0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.8% sodium taurodeoxycholate for 2 h at 37°C. Reaction mixtures were diluted with H2Oto200 μl and loaded on 10-mg Oasis HLB extraction cartridges (Waters, Elstree, Hertfordshire, UK) equilibrated with methanol and water). Columns were washed with 1 ml of 5% methanol in H2O, and eluted with 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml of acetone. Eluates were dried under nitrogen gas, and loaded on a HPTLC plate. To detect enzyme-released glucose, the material in the flow-through and wash fractions of the HLB columns was concentrated by lyophilization. Dried samples were redissolved in 50 μl of deionized water and duplicate aliquots (10 μl) analyzed by a BioLC system (Dionex), equipped with a PA-10 column (4 × 250 mm) and an AminoTrap guard column. Following isocratic elution with 18 mm NaOH at 1 ml/min at 30 °C, glucose was detected electrochemically using an ED50 detector using a triple potential discontinued waveform 1. The column was regenerated with 200 mm NaOH following each sample analysis. The peak area corresponding to glucose was analyzed with on-line Chromeleon chromatographic software (Dionex). Non-lysosomal Glucosylceramidase—The inhibitory effects of DNJ derivatives on the activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase were determined in membrane preparations from various tissues using a method adapted from Refs. 17Overkleeft H.S.

Homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g (4 °C). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. Membranes were washed three times in the phosphate buffer, resuspended in this buffer, and stored at –80 °C. For the enzyme assay aliquots of the membrane suspension were preincubated with conduritol β-epoxide (CBE) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, ON, Canada) at a final concentration of 2.5 mm for 15 min, supplemented with an imino sugar to the desired concentration, incubated for 15 min, then diluted 3-fold in 4.5 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucoside (Sigma) in 0.1 m citric acid, 0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.8, in a final volume of 30 μl, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10.7. Released 4-methylumbelliferone was detected using a Fluoroskan Ascent fluorometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK; excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm). GlcCer Synthase—Decapsulated testes were homogenized with a Dounce (tight-fitting pestle) in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (1.2 ml/testis). Large particles were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation (600 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (100 μl/testis), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Upon thawing, membrane suspensions were vortexed and spun in a microcentrifuge (10 min, 4 °C). To solubilize GlcCer synthase, pellets were extracted with 1% CHAPS (Sigma C3023) and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h, as described (7Marks D.L. Wu K. Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Watanabe R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

Statistics—Quantitative data were statistically evaluated with Student's t test (comparison between two groups) or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test (more than two groups), and phenotypic parameters were tested for correlation with Pearson test, using GRAPHPAD INSTAT version 3.0b for Macintosh (GraphPad Software). Values were considered statistically significantly different when p < 0.05. Effects of High- and Low-dose NB-DNJ on Complex Glucosphingolipids in Testis—High-dose administration of NB-DNJ (1200–2400 mg/kg/day) lead to a 22–36% reduction in levels of complex GSLs in the testes of C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, when treated with low doses of NB-DNJ, complex GSL levels were unchanged (15–150 mg/kg/day) or 15% increased (5 mg/kg/day) (Fig. 2, A and B). Six and nine months of drug administration at 15 mg/kg/day resulted in a similar increase in testicular complex GSLs (Fig. 2C). Effects of High- and Low-dose Imino Sugars on GlcCer in Various Tissues—In the testes from NB-DNJ-treated C57BL/6 mice a number of neutral glycolipids were increased, present in three closely migrating bands (one major and two minor) on thin layer chromatograms developed with a solvent mixture optimized for small neutral GSLs (Fig. 3A). The testicular glycolipids comigrated with GlcCer standards (Fig. 3A). In addition, the compounds isolated by preparative TLC were fully digested with glucocerebrosidase, yielding free glucose (Fig. 3B). These data identify the glycolipid species that is affected by imino sugar treatment as glucosylceramide. The glucosylceramide level in the testes from C57BL/6 mice treated with NB-DNJ was dose-dependent (Fig. 3A). From 1 to 15 mg/kg/day GlcCer levels were positively correlated with drug dose, reaching a maximum of 6 times control value at 15 mg/kg/day (Fig. 3C). Conversely, from 15 to 2400 mg/kg/day GlcCer was negatively correlated with drug dose, and, at the highest drug dose, GlcCer was at a similar level as in untreated mice (Fig. 3, A and C). NB-DGJ administration had a comparable effect on testicular GlcCer. The level of this glycolipid was also at first positively correlated with dose, reached a maximum, and was then negatively correlated with dose (Fig. 3D). However, after NB-DGJ treatment GlcCer was maximally elevated at a higher dose, 300 mg/kg/day, compared with NB-DNJ. In addition, at 150–600 mg/kg/day of NB-DGJ, GlcCer levels were higher than in mice treated with 5–150 mg/kg/day NB-DNJ (Fig. 3D). At 15 and 150 mg/kg/day the GlcCer levels differed significantly between the two imino sugars. Low-dose NB-DNJ also increased GlcCer significantly in spleen, but not in liver (Fig. 3D). In addition, GlcCer could be detected in the brains of mice treated with 5 mg/kg/day NB-DNJ (Fig. 3E). Brain GlcCer increased with dose to reach a maximum at 1200 mg/kg/day (Fig. 3, D and E). However, the increase in brain GlcCer relative to control samples could not be calculated, because the GlcCer levels in brains of untreated mice were below the level of detection, even after loading 6 times more material from control brains (Fig. 3E). NB-DNJ and Testicular GlcCer: Kinetics and Reversibility—To investigate the kinetics of the imino sugar-induced rise in GlcCer in testis, and whether this effect was reversible, C57BL/6 mice were treated with NB-DNJ for increasing lengths of time, to a maximum of 35 days, and then allowed to recover from the drug for up to 25 days. The increase in GlcCer was most rapid over the first 5 days of NB-DNJ administration, and modest during the following 6 days (Fig. 4, A and B). From day 11 to 35 of drug treatment GlcCer did not change significantly. GlcCer was also monitored following withdrawal of NB-DNJ from mice that had been treated for 35 days. GlcCer levels rapidly decreased during the first 5 days off drug, and were similar to control values 10 days after drug withdrawal (Fig. 4, A and B). GlcCer was also measured in the testes of mice that had been treated with 15 mg/kg/day NB-DNJ for longer periods of time, up to 12 months. From 3 to 12 months of drug administration GlcCer was 5–7-fold increased, comparable with the rise in GlcCer after short-term treatment (Fig. 4C). Testicular GlcCer did not change significantly from 3 to 12 months of NB-DNJ administration. When the drug was withdrawn from long term-treated animals for 9 weeks, their testicular GlcCer levels were similar as in age-matched control animals. Taken together, NB-DNJ administration resulted in a higher steady-state level of testicular GlcCer, which was reached within 11 days, and was maintained at the same level for the duration of drug treatment. The increase in GlcCer was reversible both after short and long-term NB-DNJ regimens. Further Analysis of Testicular GlcCer—The fact that testicular GlcCer resolved in three closely migrating bands on TLC (Figs. 3A and 4A) suggested that multiple species of GlcCer are present in this tissue, differing in their ceramide moieties. Two major types of N-acyl chains have been identified in testicular sphingolipids, differing in length and level of saturation. The acyl chains are either long (C16–24) and saturat"
https://openalex.org/W1986706321,"Here we report the identification and molecular function of the p53 tumor suppressor-like protein nvp63 in a non-bilaterian animal, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. So far, p53-like proteins had been found in bilaterians only. The evolutionary origin of p53-like proteins is highly disputed and primordial p53-like proteins are variably thought to protect somatic cells from genotoxic stress. Here we show that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at low levels selectively induces programmed cell death in early gametes but not somatic cells of adult N. vectensis polyps. We demonstrate with RNA interference that nvp63 mediates this cell death in vivo. Nvp63 is the most archaic member of three p53-like proteins found in N. vectensis and in congruence with all known p53-like proteins, nvp63 binds to the vertebrate p53 DNA recognition sequence and activates target gene transcription in vitro. A transactivation inhibitory domain at its C-terminus with high homology to the vertebrate p63 may regulate nvp63 on a molecular level. The genotoxic stress induced and nvp63 mediated apoptosis in N. vectensis gametes reveals an evolutionary ancient germ cell protective pathway which relies on p63-like proteins and is conserved from cnidarians to vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1981927611,"The insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) binds to its cognate nuclear receptor composed of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) and triggers the main developmental transitions, in particular molting and metamorphosis. We present the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domains of EcR/USP in complex with 20E at 2.4Å resolution and compare it with published structures of EcR/USP bound to ponasterone A (ponA). ponA is essentially identical to 20E but lacks the 25-OH group of 20E. The structure of 20E-bound EcR indicates that an additional hydrogen bond is formed compared with the ponA-bound receptor, yet, paradoxically, ponA has a significantly higher affinity for EcR than 20E. Theoretical studies based on docking and free energy methods lead to a rationale for understanding the difference in binding affinities between 20E and ponA. Results of the calculations indicate that the favorable contribution from the extra H-bond made by 25-OH of 20E is counterbalanced by its larger desolvation cost compared with that of ponA. The contribution of 25-OH to the binding affinity is further compared with those of 20- and 22-OH groups. Ligands that lack the 20- or 22-OH group are indeed known to bind less favorably to EcR than 20E, an effect opposite to that observed for ponA. The results indicate that their respective contributions to receptor-ligand complex stability reside mostly in their different contributions to solvation/desolvation. Together, the data demonstrate the critical role of ligand desolvation in determining binding affinity, with general implications for the binding of hormones to their cognate nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2044473915,"There is compelling evidence indicating that sleep plays a crucial role in the consolidation of new declarative, hippocampus-dependent memories. Given the increasing interest in the spatiotemporal relationships between cortical and hippocampal activity during sleep, this study aimed to shed more light on the basic features of human sleep in the hippocampus.We recorded intracerebral stereo-EEG directly from the hippocampus and neocortical sites in five epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluations. The time course of classical EEG frequency bands during the first three NREM-REM sleep cycles of the night was evaluated. We found that delta power shows, also in the hippocampus, the progressive decrease across sleep cycles, indicating that a form of homeostatic regulation of delta activity is present also in this subcortical structure. Hippocampal sleep was also characterized by: i) a lower relative power in the slow oscillation range during NREM sleep compared to the scalp EEG; ii) a flattening of the time course of the very low frequencies (up to 1 Hz) across sleep cycles, with relatively high levels of power even during REM sleep; iii) a decrease of power in the beta band during REM sleep, at odds with the typical increase of power in the cortical recordings.Our data imply that cortical slow oscillation is attenuated in the hippocampal structures during NREM sleep. The most peculiar feature of hippocampal sleep is the increased synchronization of the EEG rhythms during REM periods. This state of resonance may have a supportive role for the processing/consolidation of memory."
https://openalex.org/W1987297410,"Using a transgenic mouse model harboring chromosomally integrated lacZ mutational target genes, we previously demonstrated that mutations accumulate with age much more rapidly in the small intestine than in the brain. Here it is shown that in the small intestine point mutations preferentially accumulate in epithelial cells of the mucosa scraped off the underlying serosa. The mucosal cells are the differentiated villus cells that have undergone multiple cell divisions. A smaller age-related increase, also involving genome rearrangements, was observed in the serosa, which consists mainly of the remaining crypts and non-dividing smooth muscle cells. In the brain we observed an accumulation of only point mutations in no other areas than hypothalamus and hippocampus. To directly test for cell division as the determining factor in the generation of point mutations we compared mutation induction between mitotically active and quiescent embryonic fibroblasts from the same lacZ mice, treated with either UV (a point mutagen) or hydrogen peroxide (a clastogen). The results indicate that while point mutations are highly replication-dependent, genome rearrangements are as easily induced in non-dividing cells as in mitotically active ones. This strongly suggests that the point mutations found to have accumulated in the mucosal part of the small intestine are the consequence of replication errors. The same is likely true for point mutations accumulating in hippocampus and hypothalamus of the brain since neurogenesis in these two areas continues throughout life. The observed intra-organ variation in mutation susceptibility as well as the variation in replication dependency of different types of mutations indicates the need to not only extend observations made on whole organs to their sub-structures but also take the type of mutations and mitotic activity of the cells into consideration. This should help elucidating the impact of genome instability and its consequences on aging and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009693550,"Recent evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived cells may contribute to repair and lesion formation following vascular injury. In most studies, bone marrow-derived cells were tracked by transplanting exogenous cells into bone marrow that had been compromised by irradiation. It remains to be determined whether endogenous circulating progenitors actually contribute to arterial remodeling under physiological conditions. Here, we established a parabiotic model in which two mice were conjoined subcutaneously without any vascular anastomosis. When wild-type mice were joined with transgenic mice that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in all tissues, GFP-positive cells were detected not only in the peripheral blood but also in the bone marrow of the wild-type mice. The femoral arteries of the wild-type mice were mechanically injured by insertion of a large wire. At 4 wk, there was neointima hyperplasia that mainly consisted of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells. GFP-positive cells were readily detected in the neointima (14.8+/-4.5%) and media (31.1+/-8.8%) of the injured artery. Some GFP-positive cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin or an endothelial cell marker. These results indicate that circulating progenitors contribute to re-endothelialization and neointimal formation after mechanical vascular injury even in nonirradiated mice."

Four human HSDs from the AKR superfamily, AKR1C1–AKR1C4, can reduce 3-, 17-, and 20-ketosteroids in different ratios (14Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.-F. Lin H.-K. Ma H. Moore M.

They catalyze the 4-pro-R hydride transfer from NADPH to the acceptor carbonyl on the steroid substrate in an ordered bi-bi reaction where NAD(P)(H) binds first and leaves last (16Ricigliano J.W.

Rat liver 3α-HSD (AKR1C9), which shares 69% sequence identity with its human homologs, represents the best system to relate structure to function for HSDs, because crystal structures exist for the apoenzyme (E) (18Hoog S.S.

Albert R.H. Jez J.M. Ma H. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Steroids. 1997; 5: 799-812Google Scholar). These “snapshots” of the enzyme along the reaction pathway reveal that significant conformational changes occur upon the binding of each ligand and provide a structural basis for the ordered bi-bi mechanism (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for androstanedione reduction and androsterone oxidation catalyzed by AKR1C9ParameterMeasuredCalculatedaSteady-state parameters were calculated with the equations that define the steady state kinetic parameters in terms of individual rate constants where the interconversion of the central complex is taken into account (28) using the estimates of rate constants listed in Table 2ParameterMeasuredCalculatedaSteady-state parameters were calculated with the equations that define the steady state kinetic parameters in terms of individual rate constants where the interconversion of the central complex is taken into account (28) using the estimates of rate constants listed in Table 2kcatRed (s-1)0.42 ± 0.020.41kcatOxi (s-1)0.82 ± 0.040.82KmNADPH (μm)0.083 ± 0.0030.081KmNADP+ (μm)1.51 ± 0.21.53KmAdionebAdione = androstanedione and Arone = androsterone (μm)0.65 ± 0.040.65KmAronebAdione = androstanedione and Arone = androsterone (μm)4.05 ± 0.54.05KiNADPH (μm)0.17 ± 0.040.17KiNADP+ (μm)1.20 ± 0.361.20a Steady-state parameters were calculated with the equations that define the steady state kinetic parameters in terms of individual rate constants where the interconversion of the central complex is taken into account (28Segel I.H.

In the binary complex, the cofactor is woven through the α-helices by 22 contacts with the enzyme. Superimposition of the structures of the apoenzyme and the binary complex showed that the tight binding of the cofactor is associated with significant movement of loops A and B. Interestingly, the β1-α1 loop and part of loop B, and the C-terminal tail were disordered in the binary complex, but become ordered in the AKR1C9·NADP+·testosterone complex to form a mature steroid binding cavity. The influence of loop dynamics on catalysis remains unclear and raises the possibility that additional enzyme forms can exist on the reaction pathway. A complete detailed kinetic mechanism, including microscopic rate constants for conformational changes of all enzyme forms involved in ligand binding, and the chemistry of transformation have yet to be described for any HSD in real-time. Knowledge of the number of enzyme forms that exist is a pre-requisite to identify all the steps that could be intercepted by HSD inhibitors. The hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by HSDs is reversible in vitro. The seemingly directional preference of an individual HSD, either an AKR or an SDR, seen in transfection studies is believed to be governed by the cofactor ratio and cofactor preference. In the cytosol, the relationships are [NADPH] >> [NADP+] and [NAD+] >> [NADH] (21Veech R.L. Eggleston I.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Thus enzymes that have high affinity for NADPH will act as reductases, and those that preferentially utilize NADH/NAD will act as oxidases. AKRs have nanomolar affinity for the NADPH/NADP+ pair. We found that the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5α-DHT catalyzed by human type 3 3α-HSD (AKR1C2) occurred unimpeded in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ but that the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 3α-androstanediol oxidation catalyzed by AKR1C2 was potently inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of NADPH, suggesting that the reaction is unidirectional under normal cellular redox conditions (5Rižner T.L. Lin H.-K. Peehl D.M. Steckelbroeck S. Bauman D.R. Penning T.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2922-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, transfection studies with HSDs showed that a functional pseudo-equilibrium was reached such that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions were identical (23Khun N. Sharma K.K. Andersson S. Auchus R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 429: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Papari-Zareei M. Brandmaier A. Auchus R.J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, directionality and/or reversibility of an HSD are also related to the equilibrium constant of the reaction, which has generally not been reported for mammalian HSDs. In this study we elucidate the complete kinetic mechanism for a mammalian HSD at physiological pH using AKR1C9. We find that the reaction sequence is governed by 9 enzyme forms, and 16 kinetic constants were estimated. We also find that the internal equilibrium constant for the reaction favors oxidation but this is not reflected in the overall Keq, which favors reduction. The kinetic Haldane and the energy diagram confirmed that Keq was governed by ligand binding terms that favored reactants in the reduction direction. Our findings are discussed within a physiological context. Materials—Cofactors were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Steroids were purchased from Steraloids. Deuterated compounds for the synthesis of deuterated NADPH were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. NADP+-specific alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii was purchased from Sigma. Aldehyde dehydrogenase was purchased from Roche Biochemicals. The expression of pET16b-3α-HSD in Escherichia coli DE3 cells and purification of recombinant AKR1C9 have been described previously (25Ratnam K. Ma H. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7856-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A specific activity of 1.6 μmol of androsterone oxidized/min/mg of protein was determined. All other reagents were of ACS grade or better. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 4% acetonitrile. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—Initial velocities were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by monitoring NADPH depletion or production by the loss or gain of emission at 450 nm upon excitation at 340 nm. Double reciprocal plots of families of lines in which the initial velocities were plotted against substrate concentrations, androstanedione 0.07–7 μm and NADPH 0.07–8 μm for reduction, and androsterone 0.1–30 μm and NADP+ 0.39–27 μm for oxidation, were constructed (26Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the minimal rate equation for an ordered bi-bi reaction, Equation 1 (also see Scheme 1), v=VmAB/(KiAKmB+KmAB+KmBA+AB)(Eq. 1) with the Cleland FORTRAN program and analyzed for a sequential mechanism. Patterns from plots of families of lines (see “Results”) using the SEQUEN program were judged to be the best fit according to the criteria of Cleland (27Cleland W.W. Adv. in Enzymol. 1977; 45: 273-387Google Scholar). The individual rate constants described in Scheme 1 were obtained using the measured steady-state kinetic parameters based on the definitions of these parameters in terms of rate constants for an ordered bi-bi reaction where the isomerization of the central complex is included in the reaction sequence (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 274-574Google Scholar). kAb, kAr, kQr, and kQb, which describe cofactor binding and release, were directly calculated. However, the remaining rate constants could only be derived by iteratively fitting six independent algebraic equations for each of the six steady-state parameters that were measured (i.e. kcatRed, KmNADPH, KmAndrostanedione, kcatOxi, KmNADP+, and KmAndrosterone). Initial estimates and constraints of rate constants were made based on results of transient kinetic experiments. (see “Transient State Kinetic Analysis”). Values of the rate constants were adjusted until all the fits converged simultaneously, i.e. the calculated values of all six steady-state parameters matched the measured values. The synthesis of 4-pro-R-[2H]NADPH (NADPD) was performed as described by Hermes et al. (29Hermes J.D. Morrical S.W. O'Leary M.H. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5479-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Viola et al. (30Viola R.E. Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Analysis of the NADPD product and assessment of deuterium incorporation was determined at 2.9 ppm by [1H]NMR. The [2H] content at the 4-pro-R position was estimated to be >99%. For estimates of primary KIEs, initial velocities were performed as described previously by substituting NADPD in the assays. The nomenclature of Northrop (31Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used where Dkcat is the ratio of kcat determined in the presence of NADPH versus NADPD, and Dkcat/Km is the ratio of kcat/Km determined in the presence of NADPH versus NADPD. Measurement of Equilibrium Constant—The equilibrium constant of the reaction was determined experimentally using a method described by Talalay and Levy (32Talalay P. Levy H.R. Ciba Foundation Study Group No. 2: Steric Course of Microbiological Reactions. Little, Brown & Co, Boston1959: 64-66Google Scholar). In this method, the equilibrium was approached from both the reduction and oxidation directions. Experiments were performed at different cofactor and steroid concentrations. In a typical experiment, the initial reaction mixture contained 4.1 μg of AKR1C9, 22.6 μm androstanedione, 34.6 μm androsterone, and 23 μm NADPH (in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5% methanol at 25 °C). When the equilibrium was reached, 8.5 nmol of NADP+ was added to force the oxidative reaction and establish a new equilibrium. The changes in absorbance at 340 nm were monitored to calculate the concentrations of reactants and products at each equilibrium end-point permitting the calculation of Keq. Transient State Kinetic Analysis—Transient state kinetic assays were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow reaction analyzer instrument fitted with a 20-μl flow cell and a dead time of ∼1 ms. All concentrations are given as final. Kinetics of Binary Complex Formation—The binding of NADPH to AKR1C9 was monitored in real-time using stopped-flow spectroscopy by exciting the protein at 290 nm and capturing the emission of the energy transfer band at 450 nm through a 10-nm band-pass filter. The energy transfer band is produced as a result of the interaction of NADPH with Trp-86 (33Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conversely, to monitor the binding of NADP+, the decrease in protein fluorescence emission at 330 nm was recorded upon quenching the excited tryptophanyl residues at 290 nm. In a typical experiment, AKR1C9 (0.25 μm) was mixed with NADPH (2.0–11 μm). For NADP+ binding, enzyme (0.70 μm) was mixed with NADP+ (4.4–36 μm). The time courses of the fluorescence increase or decrease at each concentration of ligand were best fitted to double exponential equation (Equation 2), Ft=(ΔF) 1e−kobs1t+(ΔF) 2e−kobs2t+Feq(Eq. 2) where Ft is the fluorescence at time t, ΔF is the amplitude of the fluorescence increase or decrease, kobs1 and kobs2 are the apparent first-order rate constants for the fast and slow phases, respectively, and Feq is the fluorescence at equilibrium. Data were analyzed based on a three-step model for cofactor binding (Scheme 2). Estimates of the kinetic constants K1 NADPH and k3–k5 were obtained by the method of Stone and Le Bonniec (34Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). K1 NADPH is the apparent dissociation constant of the initial loose complex. The plot of kobs2 versus [NADPH] provided the estimate of k5. Values of KdNADPH were determined by steady-state fluorescence titration (25Ratnam K. Ma H. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7856-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and estimates of K1 and k3–k5 were substituted into Equation 3 to solve for k6. Kd=K1NADPHK4K6/(K3K5+K4K6+K3K6)(Eq. 3) Similarly, estimates of kinetic constants for the binding of NADP+ (k13–k16 and K1NADP+) were obtained. Ligand Chase Experiments—Enzyme (0.4 μm) was incubated with NADPH (12 μm) in one syringe and mixed with NADP+ (40 μm) from a second syringe. The decrease of the energy transfer band corresponding to dissociation of NADPH from the binary complex was monitored at 450 nm. Transients were best fitted to a bi-exponential (Equation 2). Kinetics of Ternary Complex Formation—A solution containing enzyme (0.4 μm) and NADPH (12 μm) from one syringe was mixed with increasing concentrations of testosterone (3.60–6.15 μm) from a second syringe. Decreases in fluorescence at 450 nm were monitored with excitation at 295 nm. Fluorescence traces were marked by a single exponential decay. Five transient traces were averaged for each steroid concentration, and values for kobs were fitted to Equation 4 to solve for kon and koff (35Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-62Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Kobs=Kon[T]+Koff(Eq. 4) Transient State Turnover Experiments—For single turnover experiments, AKR1C9 (0.5 μm) was incubated with substoichiometric amounts of NADPH (0.3 μm) in one syringe and mixed with a varying excess of androstanedione (4–15.0 μm) added from a second syringe in the stopped-flow instrument. Similarly for single turnover of androsterone oxidation, a solution of AKR1C9 (0.8 μm) and NADP+ (0.6 μm) from one syringe were mixed with an excess of androsterone ranging from 7.0 to 30 μm from a second syringe. Reactions were monitored fluorimetrically (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 450 nm). Data were fitted to a single exponential equation. Plots of kobs versus steroid concentration were fitted to the hyperbolic equation (Equation 5), where A is the steroid concentration, klim is the maximum rate of single turnover, and Kd is a quasi dissociation constant for steroid substrate (34Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Kobs=Klim[A]/(Kd+[A])(Eq. 5) Values of klim provided the lower limits for the k+p and k-p and initial constraints on kBb, kBr, kPr, and kPb were set based on values of Kd during steady-state fitting analysis. To study multiple turnover of androstanedione reduction, a solution of AKR1C9 (1.5 μm) and NADPH (25 μm) was mixed with androstanedione (13.5 μm). A complete concentration series with androstanedione was not possible due to steroid solubility constraints. Kinetic transients of NADPH depletion at 450 nm were collected. Experiments were repeated in the absorbance mode. Similarly, multiple turnover experiments of androsterone oxidation were conducted in which AKR1C9 (1 μm) and NADP+ (40 μm) from one syringe were mixed with increasing concentrations of androsterone (10–35 μm) added from a second syringe. Transient traces were fitted to an equation (Equation 6) that contained both burst and steady-state terms, Ft=Ampe−kobst+vsst+c(Eq. 6) where Ft equals fluorescence at time t, Amp equals the amplitude of the burst, kobs is the apparent rate constant of the burst in units of s-1, vss is the steady-state rate in units of ΔF/Δt, and c is the fluorescence at equilibrium (35Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-62Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The maximum value of kobs yielded kburst, and the maximum value of vss was, subsequently, mathematically transformed into micromolar/second and divided by enzyme concentration to yield kss (s-1). Transient state single and multiple turnover primary KIEs were determined by substituting NADPD in single turnover and multiple turnover experiments. Dklim is the ratio of klim determined in the presence of NADPH versus NADPD, and Dklim/Kd is the ratio of klim/Kd determined in the presence of NADPH versus NADPD. klim and Kd are given by Equation 5. Dissection of the complete kinetic mechanism for AKR1C9 was conducted using androstanedione and NADPH, and androsterone and NADP+, as substrate pairs at physiological pH. Androstanedione and androsterone were chosen, because these steroids have been standards with which all other assays on this enzyme in our laboratory have been compared. NADP(H) cofactors were chosen, because bound NADP+ was present in the crystal structures of the binary and ternary complexes. Thus, the existence of kinetically inferred complexes could be related to structural changes in the enzyme. Steady-state Initial Velocity Studies—Initial velocity studies for androstanedione reduction and androsterone oxidation using NADP(H) were performed. Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity data (see supplemental data) were characterized by a fan of lines that converged to an intersecting point to the left of the origin and above or on the x-axis. This is indicative of a sequential mechanism defined by the requirement of the cofactor and substrate to bind to the enzyme to form a ternary complex before any product can be produced (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 274-574Google Scholar). The sequential mechanism was previously shown to be an ordered bi-bi reaction as seen in Scheme 1. Fits of family of lines were generated through the Cleland SEQUEN program to yield steady-state kinetic parameters given in Table 1. It was found that kcat = 0.82 s-1 for the oxidation direction was 2-fold greater than the reduction direction, kcat = 0.42 s-1, whereas KmNADPH was smaller than KmNADP+ by > 18-fold. Ki values for the cofactors were determined to be 0.17 μm and 1.51 μm for NADPH and NADP+, respectively, and were in reasonable agreement with the Kd values of 0.14 μm and 0.32 μm determined directly by fluorescence titration (25Ratnam K. Ma H. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7856-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The internal consistency of the kinetic parameters in Table 1 was checked with the kinetic Haldane relationship for an ordered bi-bi mechanism (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 274-574Google Scholar) by Equation 7. Keq=VmaxRedKiNADP+KmAndrosterone/(VmaxOxiKiNADPHKmAndrostanedione)(Eq. 7) The steady-state parameters in Table 1 gave a value of 22.7 for this expression where the forward direction is reduction. This is in good agreement with a value of 20.9 ± 1.8 determined experimentally using a method described by Talalay and Levy (32Talalay P. Levy H.R. Ciba Foundation Study Group No. 2: Steric Course of Microbiological Reactions. Little, Brown & Co, Boston1959: 64-66Google Scholar). The kinetic Haldane revealed that the Keq is dominated by submicromolar Ki and Km values for NADPH and androstanedione, respectively. Rate Constants Obtained in the Steady State—The individual rate constants described in Scheme 1 were calculated and derived from the measured steady-state parameters (Table 2). In the reduction direction these constants showed that the binding of NADPH (kAb) was slow and did not occur at the diffusion limit. The binding of androstanedione (kBb) to the binary complex occurred 5-times faster than kAb, and the rate of conversion of the central complex (k+p) was 6.6 s-1. The release of the steroid product androsterone (kPr) occurred at a comparable rate of 10.5 s-1. The main contribution to the overall kcat of 0.42 s-1 came from the release of the NADP+ product, kQr = 0.65 s-1.TABLE 2Estimates of rate constants for the individual steps described in Scheme 1Kinetic constantValuekAb (μm-1s-1)aRate constants were calculated with the following equations (28): kAb = kcatRed/KmNADPH; kAr = kcatRedKiNADPH/KmNADPH; kQr = kcatOxiKiNADP+/KmNADP+, and kQb = kcatOxi/KmNADP+5.1kAr (s-1)aRate constants"

In this study, we demonstrate that kringle 5 binds to a region localized in the N-terminal domain of the glucose-regulated protein 78, whereas microplasminogen does so through the C-terminal domain of the glucose-regulated protein 78. Both plasminogen fragments induce Ca2+ signaling cascades; however, kringle 5 acts through voltage-dependent anion channel and microplasminogen does so via the glucose-regulated protein 78. Because trafficking of voltage-dependent anion channel to the cell surface is associated with heat shock proteins, we investigated a possible association between voltage-dependent anion channel and glucose-regulated protein 78 on the surface of 1-LN human prostate tumor cells. We demonstrate that these proteins co-localize, and changes in the expression of the glucoseregulated protein 78 affect the expression of voltage-dependent anion channel. To differentiate the functions of these receptor proteins, either when acting singly or as a complex, we employed human hexokinase I as a specific ligand for voltage-dependent anion channel, in addition to kringle 5.

There are seven distinct domains in the Pg molecule: an N-terminal peptide (NTP), five kringle domains, and a serine proteinase domain (3Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E.

A recent study also suggests, that K5 binds with high affinity to surface-expressed glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) (13Davidson D.J. Haskell C. Majest S. Kherzai A. Egan D.A. Walter K.A.

Because trafficking of VDAC to the cell membrane is associated with the heat shock proteins GRP75 and HSP70 (16Schwarzer C. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Thinnes F.P. Hilschmann N. Int. J. Biochem.

The purpose of these studies was to differentiate functions of these proteins, either when acting singly or as a complex. We used human hexokinase I (HK-I) as a specific ligand for VDAC. In the search of a specific ligand for GRP78, we identified microplasminogen as a candidate, and found a putative sequence in this Pg domain containing the third BBS of the Pg molecule, with affinity for a domain in the C-terminal domain of GRP78. We demonstrate that a delicate balance exists between the interaction of HK-I and K5 with VDAC, which may be physiologically relevant to protect cells from apoptosis. We also determined that K5 induces a Ca2+ signaling cascade only through VDAC, whereas microplasminogen does so via GRP78. Materials—Culture media were from Invitrogen.

Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Cultures—All tumor cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (26Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HUVEC were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mm glutamine, 5 units/ml sodium heparin, and 200 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) (Collaborative Research). For experiments under hypoxic conditions (2% O2, 5% CO2, N2 balanced), the cells were incubated for 24 h in a C-chamber® connected to a ProOx® controller, both from Biospherix (Redfield, NY). Immunofluorescence Staining and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy of Non-permeabilized Cells—1-LN cells were grown on glass coverslips in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. The cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2, and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 7% fresh formaldehyde in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 90 min at room temperature. Excess serum was drained from the coverslips, and cells were incubated with the primary sheep anti-GRP78 or rabbit anti-VDAC1 IgGs in PBS containing 1% BSA, and 5 mm EDTA for 90 min at 4 °C. The cells were then rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody containing either a 1:400 dilution of an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG, an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or a mixture of both for 90 min at 4 °C in the dark. As controls, cells were incubated with the secondary IgG alone. Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were placed face down on 1.0-mm thick microscopy slides using mounting medium consisting of 90% glycerol, 0.1 m n-propylgalate, and 0.01% sodium azide. The coverslips were then sealed with nail polish and stored at 4 °C in a light tight box. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope with a krypton/argon laser and 40X/1.30 oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 fluorophores were detected with 510-560 band pass and 590 long pass filters, respectively. All images are single confocal sections prepared with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Levels—The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured using the fluorescent indicator Fura-2/AM (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in 1-LN cell monolayers plated on sterile coverslips on 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Fura-2/AM (2 mm) was added to the plates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with Hank's balanced salt solution. Glass coverslips, containing the cell monolayers in serum-free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium, were then placed on the inverted microscope and [Ca2+]i was measured using a digital imaging microscopy system employing dual excitation ratio imaging techniques. The overall digital imaging microscopy system consists of an IC-300 imaging work station (Inovision Corp., Research Triangle Park, NC), a Zeiss IM35 inverted microscope with a 75 watt xenon excitation lamp and a ×40 UVF 1.3 N, a Nikon objective, a low-light level ISIT 66 camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN), computer-controlled excitation and neutral density filter wheels, and a temperature controller maintaining temperature at 37 °C using controlled heated air circulation and a heated cell chamber. After collecting baseline data, the ligands are added to the cell monolayers to determine their effect on [Ca2+]i. Digitized video images are obtained by averaging up to 260 frames with the following filter combination: Fura-2 excitation, 240 and 380 nm; and emission >450 nm. Routinely, excitation intensity was attenuated 100-1000-fold before reaching the cell, to obtain background images. [Ca2+]i was measured by subtracting the background from images on a pixel basis. To obtain [Ca2+]i for an individual cell, the mean value of the pixel ratio for the cell was compared with values obtained with the same equipment using Fura-2-containing Ca2+-EGTA buffers (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On Cell Westerns—Tumor cell monolayers were grown in 48-well culture plates until confluent and rinsed in HBSS. All binding assays were done at 4 °C. Ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with 400 μl of PBS and incubated with a blocking solution containing 3% BSA and 5% nonimmune goat serum for 90 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. Blocking buffer was removed, and cells were covered with 200 μl of a solution containing sheep anti-GRP78 or rabbit anti-VDAC1 IgGs (50 ng/ml) in blocking buffer. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The next day, wells were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with 200 μl of a solution containing a 1:800 dilution of an IRDye 800 DX-conjugated affinity-purified anti-sheep or anti-rabbit IgGs in blocking buffer. Plates were kept under low light conditions following addition of IR-conjugated antibodies. Following a 60-min incubation at room temperature with gentle rocking, plates were again washed three times with PBS. They were then dried and imaged using the LI-COR Odyssey System. Images were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software. Ligand Binding Analysis—The cells were grown in 96-well strip tissue culture plates until the monolayers were confluent. The cells were then rinsed in HBSS. All binding assays were performed at 4 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 2% BSA. Increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled ligand were incubated with cells for 60 min. Free and bound ligand were separated by aspirating the incubation mixture and washing the cell monolayers rapidly three times with RPMI 1640 containing 2% BSA. The cells were stripped from the plates and radioactivity determined. The bound K5 and microplasminogen were calculated after subtraction of nonspecific binding measured in the presence of 50 mm p-aminobenzamidine. The bound hexokinase I (HKI) was calculated after subtraction of nonspecific binding measured in the presence of 50 μm nonlabeled HKI. The Kd and Bmax were determined after Scatchard Plot analyses using the statistical program GraphPad Prism® 4 from Graph-Pad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS at a density of 1 × 105/ml were plated in 96-well culture plates (0.1 ml/well) containing increasing concentrations of the tested ligands at a final volume of 0.2 ml/well. Cell proliferation was determined at 72 h using a BrdUrd labeling and colorimetric immunoassay detection method (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Results were expressed as absorbance at 372 nm (reference wavelength: 492 nm). Control cell proliferation was determined in the absence of any ligand. RNA Interference—RNA interference of GRP78 expression was induced with siRNA directed against the GRP78 mRNA as previously described (28Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Wang F. Pizzo S.V. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The chemical synthesis of dsRNA to the target GRP78 370KIQQLVK376 mRNA, and a Silencer® Negative control siRNA (control 1) was performed by Ambion (Austin, TX). The sense 5′-AAU ACA GCA AUU AGU AAA GTT-3′ and the antisense 5′-CUU UAC UAA UUG CUG UAU UTT-3′ oligonucleotides were annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates the day before the transfection with 40 nm positive or control oligonucleotides in Lipofectamine® 2000 from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Transfection medium was maintained on cells for 5 h and was then removed and substituted with complete medium. The reduction in GRP78 expression on the cell surface, 48 h after transfection, was estimated by on cell Western and PCR analyses. Measurement of GRP78 and VDAC mRNA Levels by Reverse Transcription—Total RNA from HUVEC or 1-LN cells treated with Lipofectamine or GRP78 dsRNA-Lipofectamine was extracted by a single step method using a RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with 1 μg of RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture, using M-MLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus) reverse transcriptase (200 units) and oligo(dT) as the primer for 1 h at 42 °C. The resulting cDNA (5 μl) was used as a template, and a 276-bp segment of the GRP78 cDNA was amplified using a 21-mer upstream primer (5′-AGAAATGAGTTGGAAAGCTAT-3′) identical to positions corresponding to amino acids Arg562-Tyr568 and a 21-mer downstream primer (5′-CTAACAACTCATCTTTTTCTGCTG-3′) complementary to positions Ala649-Leu654 of the amino acids encoded in the GRP78 mRNA. Similarly, a 237-bp segment of the VDAC1 cDNA was amplified using a 21-mer upstream primer (5′-GGCCTGACGTTTACAGAGAAA-3′) identical to positions corresponding to amino acids Gly68-Lys74 and a 21-mer downstream primer (5′-CTCGTAACCTAGCACCAGAGC-3′) complementary to positions Ala141-Glu147 of the amino acids encoded in the VDAC1 mRNA. A 302-bp segment of mouse β-actin (constitutive internal control) cDNA was co-amplified using a set of PCR primers provided in a R&D Systems kit (Minneapolis, MN). Amplification was carried out in a Whatman-Biometra T3 thermal cycler (Whatman Inc., Florham Park, NJ) for 35 cycles (one cycle: 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s). PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose-ethidium bromide gel. The gels were photographed, and the intensity of the individual GRP78 or VDAC1 and β-actin mRNA bands were evaluated and quantified as GRP78/β-actin or VDAC1/β-actin ratios. Caspase-7 Activity Assay—Caspase-7 activity was assayed with the chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (29Lee A.T.C. Azimahtol H.L.P. Tan A.N. Cancer Cell Int. 2003; 3: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). For preparation of lysates, 1-LN cells grown in 24-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) were incubated as required, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The cells were frozen and thawed three times in dry ice, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant fractions (the lysate) was determined by the Bradford assay from Bio-Rad. Assay mixture was prepared in a 96-well plate in a 0.2-ml reaction mixture containing 20 μg of lysate protein and the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (0.25 mm) in lysis buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Substrate hydrolysis was quantified using a molar extinction coefficient of 8800 m-1 × cm-1 for pNA at 405 (30Erlanger B.R. Kokowsky N. Cohen W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). All experiments were done in triplicate. Binding of K5 and Microplasminogen to HUVEC and 1-LN Human Prostate Cancer Cells under Normoxic and Hypoxic Conditions—Both K5 and microplasminogen bind to a large number of sites on HUVEC and 1-LN cells in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity. We had previously assessed only one binding site of K5 to HUVEC (11Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); however, here, we studied the binding of K5 at lower concentrations and assessed a second high affinity binding site of this ligand to either HUVEC or 1-LN cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The binding isotherm of K5 to HUVEC under normoxic conditions (Fig. 1A), and a Scatchard plot analysis, demonstrate both the lower affinity (Kd of 24 ± 4 nm) and the higher affinity (Kd of 0.4 ± 0.2 nm) binding sites (Fig. 1A, inset). Similarly, 1-LN cells possess both binding sites (Table 1). We previously identified the lower affinity binding site in HUVEC and 1-LN cells as VDAC (11Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The higher affinity binding site for K5 was identified as GRP78 and is localized in a region, which is blocked with an antibody (N-20) specific for the GRP78 N-terminal domain (13Davidson D.J. Haskell C. Majest S. Kherzai A. Egan D.A. Walter K.A. Scheneider A. Gubbins E.F. Solomon L. Chen Z. Lesniewski R. Henkin J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4663-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When increasing concentrations of K5 were added to HUVEC in the presence of the antibody N-20 (5 μm), K5 still binds to the cells; however, it binds only to the lower affinity binding site (Fig. 1B and inset). A similar experiment in the presence of an anti-VDAC IgG (5 μm) masks only the lower affinity binding site, clearly demonstrating the higher affinity K5 binding site (Fig. 1C and inset). These experiments demonstrate that GRP78 is the higher affinity binding site for K5, whereas VDAC is its lower affinity counterpart. The total number of K5 binding sites on the surface of these cells is large (24 ± 6 × 105 and 15 ± 3 × 105 binding sites for 1-LN and HUVEC cells, respectively) (Table 3).TABLE 1Binding of plasminogen fragments and HK1 to 1-LN and HUVEC cells under normal oxygen conditionsKd 1-LNKd HUVECHigh affinityLow affinityHigh affinityLow affinitynmnmK50.8 ± 0.321 ± 50.4 ± 0.224 ± 4K5+αN-20N/A16 ± 4N/A19 ± 3K5+αVDAC1 ± 0.6N/A2 ± 0.7N/AμPgN/A28 ± 4N/A22 ± 2HK1N/A27 ± 3N/A32 ± 8 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Binding of plasminogen fragments and HK1 to 1-LN and HUVEC cells under normal and hypoxia conditionsBmax 1-LNBmax HUVECNormalHypoxiaNormalHypoxiamolecules × 105/cellmolecules × 105/cellK524 ± 653 ± 715 ± 335 ± 5μPg36 ± 861 ± 518 ± 126 ± 3HK149 ± 665 ± 620 ± 240 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Next, we studied the kinetics of binding of K5 to HUVEC and 1-LN cells under hypoxic conditions. The results show changes in affinity of K5 for both the lower and the higher affinity binding sites (Table 2); whereas, the number of binding sites increases nearly 2-fold in both cells types (53 ± 7 × 105 and 35 ± 5 × 105 binding sites for 1-LN and HUVEC cells, respectively) (Table 3), thereby suggesting that hypoxia induces changes in the affinities and number of binding sites of both GRP78 and VDAC for K5.TABLE 2Binding of plasminogen fragments and HK1 to 1-LN and HUVEC cells under hypoxic conditionsKd 1-LNKd HUVECHigh affinityLow affinityHigh affinityLow affinitynmnmK54 ± 0.815 ± 66 ± 314 ± 5μPgN/A4 ± 1N/A12 ± 0.6HK1N/A45 ± 8N/A47 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Binding of Microplasminogen to Immobilized GRP78, HUVEC, and 1-LN Human Prostate Cancer Cells—Pg has three benzamidine binding sites, K5, the active site of the proteinase domain and an unknown site in the proteinase domain (7Varady A. Pathy L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 91-102Google Scholar). Microplasminogen, the segment of Pg including amino acids Lys530-Asn790, contains an as yet unidentified binding site for benzamidine. Because K5 binds to GRP78, and the binding is mediated by its benzamidine binding site (data not shown), we assessed the capacity of microplasminogen to bind to GRP78. Both 125I-labeled K5 and microplasminogen bind in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A); however, K5 shows a higher affinity for GRP78 than microplasminogen (Kd of 5 ± 2 and 28 ± 3 nm for K5 and microplasminogen, respectively). The binding of K5 to GRP78 is inhibited by Pg fragments containing K1-3, K4 and miniplasminogen (a K5 containing Pg fragment), but not by microplasminogen (Fig. 2B). Microplasminogen binds to HUVEC and 1-LN cells in a dose-dependent manner to a single class of binding sites. The binding isotherm and a Scatchard plot of microplasminogen binding to HUVEC under normal oxygen conditions are shown in Fig. 2C. Binding of 125I-labeled microplasminogen to GRP78 is inhibited only by non-labeled miniplasminogen or microplasminogen, but not by K5 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these experiments suggest that K5 and microplasminogen bind to different regions of GRP78. The binding data (Table 1) shows that microplasminogen binds to both cell types with similar affinities, under normoxic conditions (Kd of 28 ± 4 and 22 ± 2 nm for 1-LN and HUVEC cells, respectively) and to a large number of binding sites (36 ± 8 × 105 and 18 ± 1 × 105 binding sites for 1-LN and HUVEC cells, respectively). Binding of microplasminogen to cells under hypoxia was also assessed. Under these conditions, the affinity for microplasminogen increases (Kd 4 ± 1 and 12 ± 0.6 nm for 1-LN and HUVEC cells, respectively). As observed above for K5 the number of binding sites for microplasminogen also increases for both HUVEC and 1-LN cells under hypoxia (Table 3). Binding of HK-I to HUVEC and 1-LN Human Prostate Cancer Cells—HK-I binds to mitochondrial VDAC via a hydrophobic 15-amino acid sequence in its N-terminal region (31Xie G. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1984834061,"Loss of cell-matrix adhesion is often associated with acute epithelial injury, suggesting that “anoikis” may be an important contributor to cell death. Resistance against anoikis is a key characteristic of transformed cells. When nontransformed epithelia are injured, activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) by paracrine/autocrine release of soluble ligands can induce a prosurvival program, but there is generally evidence for concomitant dedifferentiation. The EGFR ligand, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor that can activate the EGFR via juxtacrine signaling or can be released and act as a soluble growth factor. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, expression of membrane-anchored HB-EGF increases cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Therefore, these studies were designed to test the effects of juxtacrine HB-EGF signaling upon cell survival and epithelial integrity when cells are denied proper cell-matrix interactions. Cells expressing a noncleavable mutated form of membrane-anchored HB-EGF demonstrated increased survival from anoikis, formed larger cell aggregates, and maintained epithelial characteristics even following prolonged detachment from the substratum. Physical association between membrane-anchored HB-EGF and EGFR was observed. Signaling studies indicated synergistic effects of EGFR activation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling to regulate apoptotic and survival pathways. In contrast, although administration of exogenous EGF partially suppressed anoikis in wild type cells, it also led to an increased expression of mesenchymal markers, suggesting dedifferentiation. Taken together, we propose a novel role for membrane-anchored HB-EGF in the cytoprotection of epithelial cells. Loss of cell-matrix adhesion is often associated with acute epithelial injury, suggesting that “anoikis” may be an important contributor to cell death. Resistance against anoikis is a key characteristic of transformed cells. When nontransformed epithelia are injured, activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) by paracrine/autocrine release of soluble ligands can induce a prosurvival program, but there is generally evidence for concomitant dedifferentiation. The EGFR ligand, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor that can activate the EGFR via juxtacrine signaling or can be released and act as a soluble growth factor. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, expression of membrane-anchored HB-EGF increases cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Therefore, these studies were designed to test the effects of juxtacrine HB-EGF signaling upon cell survival and epithelial integrity when cells are denied proper cell-matrix interactions. Cells expressing a noncleavable mutated form of membrane-anchored HB-EGF demonstrated increased survival from anoikis, formed larger cell aggregates, and maintained epithelial characteristics even following prolonged detachment from the substratum. Physical association between membrane-anchored HB-EGF and EGFR was observed. Signaling studies indicated synergistic effects of EGFR activation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling to regulate apoptotic and survival pathways. In contrast, although administration of exogenous EGF partially suppressed anoikis in wild type cells, it also led to an increased expression of mesenchymal markers, suggesting dedifferentiation. Taken together, we propose a novel role for membrane-anchored HB-EGF in the cytoprotection of epithelial cells. In mammalian tissues, epithelial cells grow and differentiate only when they are in the correct context and are removed by apoptosis when they are not. Epithelial cells sense their location through specific interactions with neighboring cells. In culture, confluent epithelial cells can be maintained for extended periods of time in the absence of exogenous factors; however, at low cell density with no cell contact, epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death if exogenous growth factors are not provided (1Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). In addition, epithelial cells also require appropriate interaction with extracellular matrix and undergo apoptosis if such interaction is prevented. Apoptosis in response to inappropriate cell/extracellular matrix interactions is termed anoikis (2Frisch S. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Of note, transformed cells are resistant to anoikis, and this resistance is considered a necessary step for metastasis (3Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Anoikis helps to maintain the correct cell number of high turnover epithelial tissues and is involved in a wide range of tissue-homeostatic, developmental, and oncogenic processes (2Frisch S. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar, 3Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, both proper cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are required for normal growth and differentiation of the epithelial cells. Polarized epithelial cells are susceptible to acute toxic and ischemic injury (4Versteilen A.M. Di Maggio F. Leemreis J.R. Groeneveld A.B. Musters R.J. Sipkema P. Int. J. Artif. Organs. 2004; 27: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Safirstein R. DiMari J. Megyesi J. Price P. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 519-522PubMed Google Scholar), which is accompanied by alterations in both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and results in loss of cell polarity (6Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). This loss of cell polarity is responsible for the redistribution of integrin subunits from the basolateral to the apical membrane and contributes to the shedding of cells from the supporting basement membrane (7Molitoris B.A. Leiser J. Wagner M.C. Pediatric Nephrology. 1997; 11: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Zuk A. Bonventre J.V. Brown D. Matlin K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C711-C731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Molitoris B.A. Dahl R. Geerdes A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F488-F495PubMed Google Scholar). With more sustained injury, epithelial cells undergo necrotic or apoptotic cell death (10Homsi, E., Janino, P., and de Faria, J. B. L. (2006) 69, 1385-1392Google Scholar, 11Devarajan P. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2005; 17: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells that do not die are thought to participate in the regeneration and restoration of epithelial function by flattening, spreading, and migrating into areas denuded by exfoliation, where they then dedifferentiate, proliferate, and finally redifferentiate into functional epithelial cells (6Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have documented dedifferentiation as an important event following epithelial injuries (12Bonventre J.V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S55-S61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), previous studies did not address whether dedifferentiation of epithelial cells is essential for survival during epithelial injury. Accumulating evidence indicates that locally produced growth factors may serve as mediators of regeneration of epithelial cells following acute injury (13Harris R.C. Adv. Ren. Replace. Ther. 1997; 4: 43-53PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hammerman M.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specifically, previous studies have suggested that EGF, 2The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; EGFR, EGF receptor; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphatidylinositol; aa, amino acids; SMA, smooth muscle actin; FSP, fibroblast-specific protein. or members of the EGF growth factor family, may play an important role in kidney tubule epithelial repair (13Harris R.C. Adv. Ren. Replace. Ther. 1997; 4: 43-53PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sakai M. Zhang M z. Homma Garrick T. Abraham B. A McKanna.J. A Harris.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2128-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, after either ischemic tubular injury or folic acid nephropathy, EGF receptor density increases (16Nouwen E.J. Verstrepen W.A. De Broe M.E. Ren. Fail. 1994; 16: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Hise M.K. Salmanullah M. Liu L. Drachenberg C.I. Papadimitriou J.C. Rohan R.M. Nephron. 2001; 88: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and subcutaneous injection of EGF or transforming growth factor-α significantly accelerates [3H]thymidine incorporation and recovery of renal epithelial cell function (13Harris R.C. Adv. Ren. Replace. Ther. 1997; 4: 43-53PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that although expression of EGF decreases, expression of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) increases in the kidney in vivo in response to acute renal tubular injury (16Nouwen E.J. Verstrepen W.A. De Broe M.E. Ren. Fail. 1994; 16: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Homma T. Sakai M. Cheng H.F. Yasuda T. Coffey Jr., R.J. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Hise M.K. Liu L. Salmanullah M. Drachenberg C.I. Papadimitriou J.C. Rohan R.M. Ren. Fail. 2000; 22: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous administration of HB-EGF has been shown to be protective against ischemic injury irrespective of its administration prior to or after the induction of injury. HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor (pro-HB-EGF) that is cleaved to release a soluble growth factor (sHB-EGF) (20Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G. Abraham J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that both isoforms of HB-EGF may serve as biologically active ligands for EGF receptors and therefore may signal via either juxtacrine or paracrine/autocrine modes (21Takemura T. Kondo S. Homma T. Sakai M. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31036-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nakamura K. Mitamura T. Takahashi T. Kobayashi T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18284-18290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using MDCK cells stably expressing wild type HB-EGF and either noncleavable and hence membrane-anchored or secreted HB-EGF mutants, we have reported that expression of soluble or noncleavable membrane-anchored HB-EGF mutant molecules resulted in distinctly different cell phenotypes. Although expression of soluble HB-EGF induced a transformed morphology with decreased cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, expression of the noncleavable membrane-tethered HB-EGF mutant enhanced cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of juxtacrine activation of EGFR under conditions similar to epithelial injury in vivo. The present studies utilized a model of anoikis, in which proper cell-matrix interaction was disrupted but cell-cell interactions were still possible in order to examine the potential role of membrane-anchored HB-EGF in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity. Cell Culture and Transfections—MDCK type II and MDCK5aa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The details of HB-EGF5aa construct, transfection, generation, and characterization of the stable cell lines has been described previously (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, to generate the noncleavable and hence membrane-anchored HB-EGF (HB-EGF5aa) construct, the 5-amino acid putative cleavage site (PVENP) of full-length rat HB-EGF was deleted. In addition, a C-terminal FLAG tag was added to this construct for ease of detection. MDCKII cells stably expressing this construct were named MDCK5aa cells. Immunoblotting using anti-rat HB-EGF antibody confirmed the expression of transfected construct, and immunolocalization using anti-FLAG antibody confirmed a predominantly lateral membrane localization of the expressed protein (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Further characterization indicated that inducers of cleavage of membrane-associated full-length HB-EGF fail to induce shedding of soluble HB-EGF in the MDCK5aa cells, indicating that these cells expressed a membrane-associated but noncleavable form of the protein (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two separate clones of MDCK5aa cells with similar expression levels that had been characterized in our previous study were used for the studies unless stated otherwise. To ensure that the observed cell death was caused by lack of attachment alone and not deprivation of critical medium components, we performed all anoikis assays in complete medium containing all supplements unless stated otherwise. Antibodies and Reagents—The rabbit anti-rat HB-EGF polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Li Feng (Department of Immunology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The mouse or rabbit anti-FLAG (M2), anti-vimentin, anti-cytokeratin antibodies, polyHEMA, and CRM-197 (a mutated, nontoxic diphtheria toxin) were purchased from Sigma. The anti-EGFR, anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1173), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and anti-clusterin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-caspase-3, Bcl-xL, Bad, Bax, and Bak antibodies and EGF were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Bim and anti-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-E-cadherin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). The apoptosis kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Anti-rabbit or mouse rhodamine-X or fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035, PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126 were obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The anti-EGFR blocking antibody (clone 528) was purified from hybridomas obtained from ATCC at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Antibody Core Facility. BB-94 (Batimastat, a broad range metalloproteinase inhibitor) was from British Biotechnology (Oxford, UK). Culture on PolyHEMA—Petri dishes (10 cm) or 6-well culture dishes (Falcon; BD Biosciences) were coated with a film of polyHEMA (Sigma), following the protocol reported by Folkman and Moscona (25Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). This methodology was utilized to prevent cell-substratum adhesion and thereby induce anoikis. Briefly, a solution of 120 mg/ml polyHEMA in 95% ethanol was mixed overnight, centrifuged at 2,500 rpm to remove undissolved particles, and diluted 1:10 with 95% ethanol. Then 0.95 ml/mm2 of the above polyHEMA mixture was pipetted into Petri dishes of 35- or 100-mm diameter, and dishes were left to dry at room temperature in the culture hood. Before use, poly-HEMA-coated dishes were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Unless stated otherwise, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells ml-1 in 35-mm culture dishes or 100-mm dishes. Detachment-induced Apoptosis Assay—Cells were cultured in medium containing complete supplements, including 10% fetal bovine serum on polyHEMA-coated dishes at a density of 100,000 cells ml-1 for 24 h. Cells were then collected by gentle centrifugation, washed with PBS, and diluted with PBS. A total of 25,000 cells were used to determine apoptosis with the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were carried out at least three times. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on poly-HEMA-coated culture dishes were replated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides for 20 min (the minimum time for attachment of the cells) at 37 °C, rinsed with ice-cold 1× PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min on ice. Staining and imaging were performed as described (24Singh A.B. Tsukada T. Zent R. Harris R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cross-linking—For cross-linking, cells from suspension culture were collected by gentle centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 1× PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) to avoid breaking of the cell-cell contact in clusters. The resulting cell suspension was plated in untreated plastic dishes to prevent any cell attachment and treated with disuccinimidyl suberate (a noncleavable chemical cross-linker; 1 mm in HEPES buffer, 30 min, room temperature), followed by quenching with 200 mm glycine in PBS, pH 7.2, for 15 min. Thereafter, cells were centrifuged as above, washed twice with 1× PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and processed for preparation of total cell lysate. Cytosol and Mitochondrial Enriched Fractions—Cytosol and mitochondrial enriched fractions were prepared using a kit from Active Motif North America (Carlsbad, CA) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Statistics—Graphic data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed, where appropriate, using Student's t test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Expression of Membrane-tethered HB-EGF Decreased Anoikis—Single cell populations of wild type MDCK and MDCK5aa cells (stably expressing the noncleavable and thus membrane-anchored HB-EGF mutant construct) were cultured on polyHEMA as described under “Materials and Methods.” After 24 h, cell death was determined using trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig. 1A, ∼40% of the wild type cells were dead after 24 h of culture on polyHEMA. By contrast, anoikis-induced cell death in MDCK5aa cells was reduced by 50% compared with the wild type cells. In further studies, we used cell reattachment as a measure of cell survival. Following culture of an equal number of cells on polyHEMA for 24 h, all cells was transferred to regular culture dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were washed to remove all dead and/or unattached cells, photographed, detached using trypsin-EDTA, and counted. As shown in Fig. 1B, the total number of viable MDCK5aa cells was 4 times higher compared with the wild type cells. This increase in the total number of cells was higher than the initial protection against cell death observed in MDCK5aa cells and suggested a combined role of cell survival and cell proliferation. Indeed, basal cell proliferation in MDCK5aa cells is higher compared with the wild type cells. 3A. B. Singh, K. Sugimoto, and R. C. Harris, unpublished data. To analyze further whether the observed cytoprotection in MDCK5aa cells was a transient or persistent event, we cultured equal number of wild type and MDCK5aa cells on polyHEMA. As described above, cells were plated in complete culture medium but did not receive any further replacement of culture medium. After 7 days of culture on polyHEMA, cells were then plated on regular culture dishes. Even after 7 days of suspension culture, a significant proportion of cells in MDCK5aa cells remained viable, as demonstrated by their ability to attach and spread. In contrast, although occasional wild type cell aggregates did adhere to the culture plates, there was no cell spreading (data not shown). Since these measures of cell viability do not differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic cell death, we utilized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based apoptosis-specific assay. Cells were subjected to growth on polyHEMA for 24 h and collected by gentle centrifugation. Cells were then further diluted, and a total of 25,000 cells were used for the apoptosis assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, MDCK5aa cells had a 51% decrease in anoikis compared with the wild type cells. Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole indicated extensive nuclear fragmentation in wild type cells but only rare fragmentation in the MDCK5aa cells (Fig. 1D). Expression of Proapoptotic Molecules Decreased in Cells Expressing Membrane-tethered HB-EGF—A balance in cell proliferative and apoptotic pathways is essential for the survival and normal functioning of epithelial cells (1Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). Anoikis disturbs this balance and induces activation of proapoptotic pathways, and expression/activity of different proapoptotic molecules is up-regulated upon induction of anoikis (26Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 27Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). In MDCK II cells, anoikis induces expression/activation of various proapoptotic molecules, including Bad, Bax, Bak, Bim, and caspases (2Frisch S. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar, 28Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To test whether the observed cytoprotection against anoikis in MDCK5aa cells resulted from prevention of the induction of apoptotic pathways, we examined expression/activation of proapoptotic molecules in MDCK5aa cells compared with the wild type cells. Samples from cells subjected to anoikis were collected at time 0 (when cells were plated on the polyHEMA-coated dishes) and at 4, 8, and 24 h after plating. Expression of Bak, Bax, Bim, Bad, and activated caspase-3 was determined using total cell lysate and antigen-specific antibodies. In addition, we examined poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, since PARP is cleaved differentially during apoptosis versus necrosis, and generation of an 85 kDa band is a signature pattern of apoptosis (30Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Although no differences were observed in the expression of Bak at all time points compared with the 0 h in either wild type or MDCK5aa cells, expression of Bax, Bim, Bad, and caspase-3 all increased in a time-dependent manner in the wild type cells, with the highest expression of Bax and caspase-3 at 8 h of culture on polyHEMA-coated plates and maximum expression of Bad and Bim at 24 h. PARP cleavage to generate the 85-kDa fragment was highest at 8 h and was also associated with a time-dependent increase in its protein expression. In MDCK5aa cells, although a minor increase in the expression of Bax was observed at early time points, its expression remained lower compared with wild type cells at all time points. Interestingly, although the pattern of Bim expression was not strikingly different in MDCK5aa cells compared with the wild type cells, there was an apparent mobility shift in MDCK5aa cells compared with wild type cells at all time points. It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of Bim results in a shift in its mobility, which induces its degradation and inactivation (31Hacker G. Suttner K. Harada H. Kirschnek S. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Iglesias-Serret D. de Frias M. Santidrian A.F. Coll-Mulet L. Cosialls A.M. Barragan M. Domingo A. Gil J. Pons G. Leukemia. 2007; 21: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bad expression remained suppressed in MDCK5aa cells at all time points of the study. Although an early activation of caspase-3 was observed in MDCK5aa cells upon plating onto polyHEMA, expression of cleaved caspase-3 remained lower in these cells at both the 8 and 24 h time points compared with wild type cells. In addition, the levels of PARP cleavage were lower in MDCK5aa cells at all time points compared with the wild type cells (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial Translocation of Proapoptotic Molecules Was Largely Prevented in MDCK5aa Cells upon Induction of Anoikis—The induction of apoptosis requires translocation of proapoptotic molecules from cell cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, which induces changes in the mitochondrial pore complex and thereby activates caspases (27Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar, 33Armstrong J.S. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We further determined whether the decreased expression of proapoptotic molecules in MDCK5aa cells was also associated with similar decreases in mitochondrial translocation. Cytosol and mitochondrial enriched fractions were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and equal amounts of protein were resolved to determine the relative expressions of Bad, Bax, Bak, and Bim in both fractions. Predominant expression of Bak was observed in the cytosolic fraction compared with the mitochondrial fraction, and similar to the expression in total cell lysate, no major differences were observed in the expression of Bak between wild type and MDCK5aa cells. In contrast, expression of Bax in the wild type cells was higher in the mitochondrial fractions at 8 and 24 h postanoikis. Similar to the expression in total cell lysate, expression of Bax in MDCK5aa cells was higher at 0 h in the mitochondrial fraction but remained lower compared with wild type cells thereafter (Fig. 3). Similarly, an increase in Bad expression in the mitochondrial fraction of wild type cells was observed, which was highest after 8 h of anoikis. In MDCK5aa cells, low levels of Bad expression were detected at 0 h but decreased thereafter and were lowest at 24 h after anoikis. Increased mitochondrial expression of Bim was also detected at 8 and 24 h in the wild type, whereas in the MDCK5aa cells, Bim expression showed a mobility shift and decrease in expression after induction of anoikis. The lack of apparent expression of Bax or Bim in the cytosolic fractions was due to loading a decreased amount of protein from cytosolic fractions to match the protein amount loaded for the mitochondrial fractions. Cells Expressing Membrane-anchored HB-EGF Formed Large Cell Aggregates and Demonstrated Increased Expression of Prosurvival Molecules—Although these results indicated that expression of membrane-anchored HB-EGF inhibited the activation of proapoptotic pathways, further studies examined whether there was simultaneous enhancement of prosurvival pathways. The role of Bcl-xL in the EGFR-dependent cytoprotection against anoikis is well documented (34Ramljak D. Coticchia C.M. Nishanian T.G. Saji M. Ringel M.D. Conzen S.D. Dickson R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Rosen K. Coll M.L. Li A. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the expression of Bcl-xL in the same total cell lysate used to detect expression of proapoptotic molecules. As shown in Fig. 4A, similar levels of expression of Bcl-xL were detected in both cell types at the zero time point. Although the expression of Bcl-xL remained largely unaltered in the wild type cells at all time points of the study, a robust increase in the expression of Bcl-xL was observed in the MDCK5aa cells in a time-dependent manner, with the highest expression at 24 h postanoikis (Fig. 4A). Formation of cell aggregates upon culture in suspension is a known characteristic of MDCK II cells (36Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When cultured on polyHEMA, both cell types formed cell aggregates, and the size of these aggregates increased with time. However, it was noteworthy that the aggregates formed in MDCK5aa cells were several times larger than the cell aggregates formed in the wild type cells (Fig. 4B). Cell aggregation upon denial of appropriate cell-matrix attachment is suggested to be a mechanism of self-defense against the anoikis-induced cell death (37Valentinis B. Reiss K. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 648-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clusterin, a protein important in cell survival, has been implicated in the formation of such aggregates (38Silkensen J.R. Skubitz K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2088603230,"The murine double minute (<i>mdm2</i>) gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a key role in the degradation of p53 tumor suppressor protein. Nevertheless recent data highlight other p53-independent functions of MDM2. Given that MDM2 protein binds ATP, can interact with the Hsp90 chaperone, plays a role in the modulation of transcription factors and protection and activation of DNA polymerases, and is involved in ribosome assembly and nascent p53 protein biosynthesis, we have evaluated and found MDM2 protein to possess an intrinsic molecular chaperone activity. MDM2 can substitute for the Hsp90 molecular chaperone in promoting binding of p53 to the <i>p21</i>-derived promoter sequence. This reaction is driven by recycling of MDM2 from the p53 complex, triggered by binding of ATP to MDM2. The ATP binding mutant MDM2 protein (K454A) lacks the chaperone activity both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. <i>Mdm2</i> cotransfected in the H1299 cell line with wild-type <i>p53</i> stimulates efficient p53 folding <i>in vivo</i> but at the same time accelerates the degradation of p53. MDM2 in which one of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues is mutated (C478S or C464A) blocks degradation but enhances folding of p53. This is the first demonstration that MDM2 possesses an intrinsic molecular chaperone activity, indicating that the ATP binding function of MDM2 can mediate its chaperone function toward the p53 tumor suppressor."

Studies have also shown that male circumcision is cost-effective and reduces the risk for certain ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The epidemiology of male circumcision in the United States is poorly studied and most prior reports were limited by self-reported measures. The study objective was to describe male circumcision trends among men attending the San Francisco municipal STD clinic, and to correlate the findings with HIV, syphilis and sexual orientation.A cross sectional study was performed by reviewing all electronic records of males attending the San Francisco municipal STD clinic between 1996 and 2005. The prevalence of circumcision over time and by subpopulation such as race/ethnicity and sexual orientation were measured. The findings were further correlated with the presence of syphilis and HIV infection. Circumcision status was determined by physical examination and disease status by clinical evaluation with laboratory confirmation. Among 58,598 male patients, 32,613 (55.7%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 55.2-56.1) were circumcised. Male circumcision varied significantly by decade of birth (increasing between 1920 and 1950 and declining overall since the 1960's), race/ethnicity (Black: 62.2%, 95% CI 61.2-63.2, White: 60.0%, 95% CI 59.46-60.5, Asian Pacific Islander: 48.2%, 46.9-49.5 95% CI, and Hispanic: 42.2%, 95% CI 41.3-43.1), and sexual orientation (gay/bisexual: 73.0%, 95% CI 72.6-73.4; heterosexual: 66.0%, 65.5-66.5). Male circumcision may have been modestly protective against syphilis in HIV-uninfected heterosexual men (PR 0.92, 95% C.I. 0.83-1.02, P = 0.06).Male circumcision was common among men seeking STD services in San Francisco but has declined substantially in recent decades. Male circumcision rates differed by race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Given recent studies suggesting the public health benefits of male circumcision, a reconsideration of national male circumcision policy is needed to respond to current trends."
https://openalex.org/W2007051222,"Differential enlargement of hind (T3) legs represents one of the hallmarks of insect evolution. However, the actual mechanism(s) responsible are yet to be determined. To address this issue, we have now studied the molecular basis of T3 leg enlargement in Oncopeltus fasciatus (milkweed bug) and Acheta domesticus (house cricket). In Oncopeltus, the T3 tibia displays a moderate increase in size, whereas in Acheta, the T3 femur, tibia, and tarsus are all greatly enlarged. Here, we show that the hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is expressed in the enlarged segments of hind legs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of Ubx during embryogenesis has a primary effect in T3 legs and causes shortening of leg segments that are enlarged in a wild type. This result shows that Ubx is regulating the differential growth and enlargement of T3 legs in both Oncopeltus and Acheta. The emerging view suggests that Ubx was co-opted for a novel role in regulating leg growth and that the transcriptional modification of its expression may be a universal mechanism for the evolutionary diversification of insect hind legs."
https://openalex.org/W1990242173,"Ethanol metabolism plays a central role in activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade leading to inflammation and apoptosis. Sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), one of the MAPKs, has been shown to induce apoptosis in hepatocytes. MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) has been shown to dephosphorylate MAPKs in several cells. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of MKP-1 in sustained JNK activation as a mechanism to explain ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. VL-17A cells (HepG2 cells overexpressing alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450-2E1) were exposed to ethanol for different time periods. Western blots were performed for MKP-1, phospho-JNK, phosphotyrosine, and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for AP-1 were performed. Apoptosis was measured by caspase-3 activity assay, TUNEL, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Reactive oxygen species were neutralized by overexpressing both superoxide dismutase-3 and catalase genes using lentiviral vectors in VL-17A cells. Ethanol incubation markedly decreased the MKP-1 protein levels to 15% of control levels and was associated with sustained phosphorylation of p46 JNK and p54 JNK, as well as increased apoptosis. VL-17A cells overexpressing superoxide dismutase-3 and catalase, treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or incubation of the cells with PKCδ small interference RNAs significantly inhibited the ethanol-induced MKP-1 degradation and apoptosis. Ethanol-induced oxidative stress enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, which in turn caused the proteasomal degradation of MKP-1, leading to sustained JNK activation and increased apoptosis in VL-17A cells.

MAPK are involved in various cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Cellular responses mediated by MAPK signaling vary depending upon the intensity and kinetics of MAPKs. One of the members of the MAPK family, JNK, has been shown to be an important mediator of cellular functions. Transient activation of JNK is necessary for liver regeneration (3Schwabe R.F. Kim C.A.

Although ethanol was found to be the activator of apoptosis via JNK activation, the mechanism by which ethanol prolongs the JNK activation is not known. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on Ser/Thr and Tyr residues, whereas 11 dual-specificity phosphatases or MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) terminate such activation (8Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). These phosphatases exhibit differential specificity toward MAPK substrates, show distinct subcellular localizations, and have different modes of regulation. Among these phosphatases, MKP-1 was originally identified as an ERK-specific phosphatase (9Sun H. Kim C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), and it has also been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate JNK and p38 MAPK in a cell-specific and context-specific manner (10Franklin C.C.

Although, MKP-1 expression has been shown to control the phosphorylation of JNK in other cell types, there is no evidence indicating that ethanol modulates JNK phosphorylation via MKP-1 in hepatocytes. The activation of MAPKs has been shown to be regulated by the activation of tyrosine kinase (12Fanger G.R. Kim N.L. Johnson G.L.

These studies demonstrate that PKCδ is one of the prime regulators of apoptosis in several cell types. However, the mechanism by which activation of PKCδ induces cell death remains largely unknown. The oxidative metabolism of ethanol by hepatocytes elicits a range of responses, including the generation of ROS, one of the important mediators of alcoholic liver injury (24Cardin R. Kim A.

Several reports have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2, superoxide anion (O.O2), and hydroxyl (OH–) ions, are important signaling molecules regulating JNK activity (31Sakon S.

Although it is known that oxidative stress induces the phosphorylation of JNK, the role of ethanol-induced oxidative stress, PKC activation, and the sustained activation of JNK in alcohol-induced injury are not known. In this report we have systematically analyzed the interplay among these molecules, and we demonstrate how ethanol-induced oxidative stress causes the sustained activation of JNK and apoptosis in hepatocytes, via the enhancement of MKP-1 degradation. Cell Culture—For this study, we used a recombinant cell line VL-17A, (derived from HepG2 cells), which constitutively expresses the ethanol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase, and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). Cell culture conditions have been followed as described previously (33Osna N.A. Kim D.L. Donohue T.M. Jr. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Osna N.A.

Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Subcloning of Superoxide Dismutase-3 (SOD3) and Catalase into the Lentiviral Vector—The fourth generation lentiviral vectors (LVs), containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with the human α1-AT promoter, were constructed as described previously (36Condiotti R. Kim M.A. Nolan G.P. Giladi H. Ketzinel-Gilad M. Gross E. Galun E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The LV-eGFP was used as a control vector, and the human SOD3 construct or catalase was cloned into LV by replacing eGFP. The sequence was verified for its accuracy with the original SOD3 or catalase sequence. All the lentiviral vectors were produced and concentrated as described previously (37Follenzi A. Kim L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 346: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The viral titer was quantitated using the p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously (38Lizee G. Kim J.L. Gonzales M.I. Chinnasamy N. Morgan R.A. Topalian S.L. Hum. Gene. Ther. 2003; 14: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transduction of Lentiviral Vectors—Sub-confluent layers of VL-17A cells were transduced with either LV-SOD3 and LV-catalase or LV-eGFP (108 transduction units/106 cells) in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replenished. Both medium and cells were assayed 5 days after transduction for SOD activity, using an SOD activity kit (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, catalog number 574601) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The overexpression of SOD3 was also analyzed by real-time PCR as described previously (39Wu J. Kim L. Yen R.D. Catana A. Nantz M.H. Zern M.A. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Catalase overexpression was analyzed by both activity assays and Western blots as described by us previously (39Wu J. Kim L. Yen R.D. Catana A. Nantz M.H. Zern M.A. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cell Treatments—VL-17A cells were routinely cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. All the ethanol-treatment experiments were performed under serum-free conditions. Prior to treatments, the cells were preincubated with various inhibitors, such as U0126 (ERK inhibitor, 10 μm, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number U120), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor, 10 μm, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number S7067) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor, 10 μm, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number S5567), rottlerin (10 μm, EMD Biosciences, catalog number 557370), genistein (30 nm, EMD Biosciences, catalog number 345834), or MG-132 (10 μm, EMD Biosciences, catalog number 474790) for 30–60 min under serum-free conditions. Then ethanol was added, and the mixture was incubated with the inhibitors for various time periods up to 4 h. In all the experiments involving the inhibitors, 0.1% Me2SO was added to the control cells. Ethanol was also incubated with cells overexpressing SOD3 and catalase for different time periods up to 4 h. After the treatments, the cells were collected for Western blots, RT-PCR analysis, or apoptosis assays. RT-PCR—The cells were collected, total RNA was isolated using Qiagen’s RNA isolation kit, and cDNA was synthesized. The human-specific MKP-1 (catalog number sc35937-PR), PKCδ (catalog number sc36253-PR), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (catalog number sc35448-PR) primers were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). MKP-1 and PKCδ were amplified for 25 cycles, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified for 20 cycles. The PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 20–25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified bands were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels. Western Blots and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates from different incubations were collected in mammalian cell extraction solution (Pierce, catalog number 78501), and the protein content was quantified using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce, catalog number 23225). The samples (30–60 μg/lane) were separated using 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected with anti-phospho-JNK (Upstate, catalog number 07-175), anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc571), anti-human MKP-1 (Upstate, catalog number 07-535), PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc213), or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number A5441) antibodies as described previously (40Shirahashi H. Kim J. Yamamoto N. Catana A. Wege H. Wager B. Okita K. Zern M.A. Cell Transplant. 2004; 13: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of protein solution (2 mg/ml) was precleared with protein-A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. This was followed by incubation with anti-PKCδ antibodies and protein-A Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Next day, the beads were washed three times using lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min with 20 μl of 2 × sample buffer. The tubes were centrifuged, the supernatant was resolved in polyacrylamide gels, and Western blots were performed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. EMSA—For determining the activation of AP-1 (Promega, Madison, WI, catalog number E3202), electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using a non-radioactive detection method. All the reagents and kits needed for this assay were obtained from Pierce. After different treatments, the cells were washed, and nuclear protein was isolated. AP-1 oligonucleotides were labeled with biotin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified using spin columns, and the binding reactions between the labeled oligonucleotides and the nuclear protein were conducted. The bound DNA-protein complex was separated by PAGE electrophoresis, followed by the detection of the shifted bands, as described previously (41He S.Q. Kim Y.H. Venugopal S.K. Dicus C.W. Perez R.V.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ROS Measurements—VL-17A cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h. The cells were washed and changed to serum-free media and incubated with E100 and 10 μm H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, catalog number D399). The conversion of H2DCFDA to fluorescent DCF was measured by spectrofluorometer as described previously (43Venugopal S.K. Kim S. Yang T. Jialal I. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3049-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assays—The cells were administered with different treatments as described above. After 4 h of incubation with ethanol, the cells were washed and analyzed for apoptosis. The TUNEL assay was performed using the Apoptag kit from Serologicals Corp. (Billerica, MA, catalog number S7165) as we have done previously (39Wu J. Kim L. Yen R.D. Catana A. Nantz M.H. Zern M.A. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In separate wells, DAPI staining was performed using mounting medium containing the DAPI. Caspase-3 activity assay kit was obtained from EMD Biosciences (catalog number 235419), and the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA Silencing Studies—PKCδ (catalog number sc36253), the scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (catalog number sc37007), and the transfection reagent (catalog number sc29528), were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. VL-17A cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well culture plate in an antibiotic-free normal VL-17A growth medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h of plating, the cells were washed and replaced with 0.8 ml of low serum Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). Both siRNA oligonucleotides (50 μm) and 6 μl of transfection reagent were diluted with 100 μlof Opti-MEM medium separately under sterile conditions. Both of the tubes were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and this mixture was added to each well. After 6 h of incubation, 1 ml of normal growth media was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 18 h. Then the cells were washed and cultured with normal growth media. After 24 h of culture with a change of growth media, the cells were used for the ethanol experiments under serum-free conditions. Statistical Analysis—All the experiments were performed in triplicates and at least three times. The statistical significance was calculated using one-way analysis of variance. The data were expressed as means ± S.E. and calculated using variance analysis and the Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons among groups. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. VL-17A cells were incubated with 100 mm ethanol (E100) for up to 4 h. The cells were collected, total protein was isolated, and the Western blots for both phospho-JNK and total JNK were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation of VL-17A cells with ethanol caused an increase in the phosphorylation of both p46 JNK and p54 JNK at 30 min that remained increased up to 4 h (Fig. 1A), and this increase was associated with an enhancement in the nuclear translocation of AP-1 (Fig. 1B). There was a 4-fold increase in caspase-3 activity when VL-17A cells were treated for 4 h with E100 (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was also measured by both the TUNEL assay and DAPI staining. Both apoptotic and total cells were counted in at least 10 high power fields, and the percentage of apoptosis was calculated by the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells. There was a significant increase in apoptosis with ethanol treatment (Fig. 1C). To evaluate the role of other MAPK cascade in mediating apoptosis, VL-17A cells were preincubated with U0126 (ERK inhibitor, 10 μm), SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor, 10 μm), or SP600125 (JNK inhibitor, 10 μm) for 30 min in serum-free conditions, followed by the addition of E100 for a further period up to 4 h. As a vehicle control, 0.1% Me2SO was added to the control cells. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by caspase-3 activation assay, or DAPI and TUNEL staining. The results showed that inhibition of either p38 MAPK or JNK caused a significant decrease in the caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1C) as well as DAPI and TUNEL staining (Fig. 1D). Inhibition of ERK did not cause any significant changes in the survival of the cells. MKP-1 is a dual specificity phosphatase, which is shown to be involved in deactivating JNK in various cells. Hence, we studied the effect of ethanol on MKP-1 expression in VL-17A cells. VL-17A cells were incubated with E100 for 0, 1, and 4 h, and the cells were collected for RNA and protein isolation. RT-PCR was performed for MKP-1 expression, and we found that there was no decrease in the MKP-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. Western blot results showed that there was a significant decrease in MKP-1 protein levels in VL-17A cells with ethanol administration (Fig. 2B). The relative gene expression was calculated by the ratio of MKP-1 expression to the housekeeping genes and presented as a densitograph (Fig. 2C). Ethanol has been shown to induce apoptosis, at least in part, via oxidative stress in hepatocytes. The available data show that inhibition of ethanol-induced oxidative stress decreases cell death. Therefore, we studied whether inhibition of ROS would lead to a recovery of the MKP-1 protein levels by co-expressing both SOD3 and catalase (SOD3/cat) using lentivirus in VL-17A cells. As an experimental control, the cells were transduced with LV-eGFP. Every day, both cells and media were analyzed for SOD3 and catalase expression (data not shown), and maximal expression was observed at 5 days after transduction. Hence, the transduced cells were used 5 days after LV transduction in all experiments. The cells were analyzed for SOD3 expression by real-time RT-PCR, and we found a significant increase in SOD3 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). This correlated with an increase in both intracellular and secreted SOD activity (Fig. 3B). The catalase expression was studied by both Western blots and catalase activity, and there was increased protein expression (Fig. 3C) and activity (Fig. 3D) in these cells. The percentage of in vitro transduction efficiency of LV was determined as described previously (38Lizee G. Kim J.L. Gonzales M.I. Chinnasamy N. Morgan R.A. Topalian S.L. Hum. Gene. Ther. 2003; 14: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The eGFP-positive cells were used as a transduction control in determining the effects of LV in these cells. The results showed that LV did not cause any significant changes in MKP-1 protein expression. SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells were used in ROS neutralization experiments. Both the transduced cells and untransduced cells were incubated with E100 for 1 h, the ROS release was measured by the conversion of H2DCFDA to fluorescent DCF, and the mean fluorescence intensity was calculated and corrected with the protein content. Ethanol caused an increase in the ROS release in VL-17A cells, and overexpression of SOD3/cat caused a significant inhibition of ROS production (Fig. 4A). Incubation of SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells with E100 did not cause any change in MKP-1 mRNA levels (data not shown) but caused a significant recovery in ethanol-induced MKP-1 protein degradation, as determined by Western blot (Fig. 4B). β-Actin was used as a loading control in these Western blots. The mechanism by which oxidative stress induced the MKP-1 degradation was analyzed. It had been shown in other systems that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ can induce proteasomal activation. Hence, we determined whether ethanol-induced oxidative stress caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Either inhibition of tyrosine kinase by a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (30 nm), or use of the SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells, decreased the ethanol-induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), whereas treatment of cells with either the proteasomal inhibitor (MG-132) or PKCδ inhibitor (rottlerin, 10 μm) did not decrease the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Next, the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ on MKP-1 degradation was studied. The cells were preincubated for 1 h with either rottlerin, genistein, or the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (10 μm) followed by co-incubation with E100 for an additional 4 h. In parallel experiments, SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells were also incubated with E100 for 4 h. Incubation of the cells with either of these inhibitors abolished ethanol’s effects on the MKP-1 protein degradation (Fig. 5B). Next, we studied whether the recovery of MKP-1 would result in the transient activation of JNK in these cells. Hence, MG-132 was preincubated with the cells for 1 h in serum-free conditions, which was followed by the incubation of E100 for 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h. In parallel experiments, SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells were also incubated with E100 at different time points. Incubation with ethanol caused a transient activation of JNK in these cells (Fig. 5C). To confirm that PKCδ is involved in ethanol-induced MKP-1 degradation, we designed siRNA-mediated PKCδ-silencing experiments. VL-17A cells were transfected with scrambled siRNAs or with PKCδ siRNA oligonucleotides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The siRNA transfection caused >70% inhibition of PKCδ mRNA (Fig. 6A) and protein (Fig. 6B) expression. As expected, transfection of the cells with the PKCδ siRNA did not decrease the ethanol-induced ROS release (data not shown); however, the ethanol-induced degradation of MKP-1 protein was restored in VL-17A cells transfected with PKCδ siRNA oligonucleotides but not in cells transfected with scrambled siRNAs (Fig. 6C). This MKP-1 restoration was associated with a decrease in the ethanol-induced sustained phosphorylation of p46 JNK and P54 JNK in PKCδ-transfected VL-17A cells (Fig. 6D, panel ii), whereas the scrambled siRNA transfected VL-17A cells did not show a decrease in JNK activity with ethanol (Fig. 6D, panel i). To assess whether the inhibition of sustained JNK activation could decrease the nuclear translocation of AP-1, one of the downstream targets of JNK, we conducted EMSA experiments. Incubation of VL-17A cells with E100 caused an increase in AP-1 nuclear translocation in scrambled siRNA transfected cells. On the other hand, ethanol-induced AP-1 nuclear translocation was inhibited in PKCδ siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6E). VL-17A cells were transfected with PKCδ or scrambled siRNAs followed by incubation with E100 for 4 h. In parallel experiments, the cells were preincubated with rottlerin, genistein, or MG-132, followed by incubation with E100 for 4 h. SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells were also incubated with E100 for 4 h. We determined that E100 treatment increased apoptosis in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA, whereas this increase was significantly inhibited in the PKCδ siRNA-transfected cells, cells pretreated with inhibitors, or SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells, as measured by the caspase-3 activity assay (Fig. 7A) and DAPI and TUNEL staining (Fig. 7, B and C). In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanism by which ethanol induces a sustained activation of p46 JNK and p54 JNK and causes apoptosis in VL-17A cells. Several studies have demonstrated that the duration and magnitude of JNK activation are important for determining whether cells undergo cell proliferation or apoptosis (3Schwabe R.F. Kim C.A.

Hepatology. 2003; 37: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), whereas prolonged and robust JNK activation promotes cell death (4Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 5Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G875-G879Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the addition of ethanol to primary rat hepatocytes has been shown to induce a rapid and robust induction of JNK (44Lee Y.J. Kim S.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 508: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this JNK induction by ethanol has not been determined previously. In our studies, we have used VL-17A cells, which are HepG2 cells overexpressing both alcohol dehydrogenase and CYP2E1, to study the molecular regulation of the sustained activation of JNK. These cells are well characterized and possess primary hepatocyte-like characters (33Osna N.A. Kim D.L. Donohue T.M. Jr. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Osna N.A. Kim D.L. Donohue T.M. Jr. Biochem.

In agreement with other findings, VL-17A cells showed a sustained increase in JNK phosphorylation and increased apoptosis with ethanol administration. We also tested the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. In our study we found that the induction of ERK1/2 by ethanol was slow and increased to a maximum at 4 h (data not shown). However, the addition of ERK inhibitor did not cause any significant changes in the cell survival at 4 h. Ethanol also induced the activation of p38 MAPK (data not shown), and its inhibition caused a decrease in apoptosis in VL-17A cells. Although previous reports have shown the mechanisms by which oxidative stress induces p38 MAPK (45Matsuzawa A. Kim K. Noguchi T. Sadamitsu C. Nishitoh H. Nagai S. Koyasu S. Matsumoto K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 46Matsuzawa A. Kim H. Tobiume K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it is possible that MKP-1 degradation is responsible for the sustained activation of p38 MAPK. Further studies are needed to establish this mechanism. Several studies have shown that MKP-1-deficient macrophage cells exhibit prolonged JNK activation as well as enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 compared with wild-type cells (47Zhao Q. Kim X. Nelin L.D. Yao Y. Matta R. Manson M.E. Baliga R.S. Meng X. Smith C.V. Bauer J.A. Chang C.H. Liu Y. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 48Hammer M.

Oravecz T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells MKP-1 degradation is associated with increased glutamate toxicity (50Choi B.H. Kim E.M. Lee J.H. Jun D.J. Kim K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These reports suggested to us that MKP-1 degradation might play a role in ethanol-induced sustained JNK activation and subsequent apoptosis. Therefore, we incubated VL-17A cells with ethanol and studied the expression of MKP-1. Ethanol incubation caused a significant decrease in the expression of MKP-1. Although we found a decrease in the protein level of MKP-1, RT-PCR data showed that there was no decrease in MKP-1 mRNA levels, suggesting that the regulation might be at a post-transcriptional level. Recently it was shown that ROS could promote a sustained JNK activation causing cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (32Kamata H. Kim S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, the oxidative metabolism of ethanol elicits the generation of ROS, and is involved in inducing apoptosis (1Aroor A.R. Kim S.D. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2339-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G875-G879Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Cardin R. Kim A. Fiorentino M.

Liver Physiol. 2002; 282: G257-G266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Increased oxidative stress has been shown to activate the MAPKs, but the magnitude of the activation depends on the dose and potency of the stimulus. Hence, we co-expressed both SOD3 and catalase, and our data showed that ethanol-induced ROS release was significantly inhibited by SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells. These results showed that these enzymes were biologically active in the in vitro system. In our studies the lentiviral-mediated overexpression of antioxidant genes restored the ethanol-induced degradation of MKP-1. To explore the molecular mechanism by which MKP-1 degradation is enhanced by ethanol-induced oxidative stress, we conducted further experiments. Previous studies have shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ could lead to MKP-1 degradation in neuronal cells (50Choi B.H. Kim E.M. Lee J.H. Jun D.J. Kim K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, other reports have shown that oxidative stress can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in several cells (18Kanthasamy A.G. Kim M. Kanthasamy A. Anantharam V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Brodie C. Kim P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 21Konishi H. Kim E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6587-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that ethanol-induced oxidative stress could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, which in turn would activate the proteasomal degradation of MKP-1 in hepatic cells. To test this hypothesis, first we studied whether ethanol incubation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and that inhibition of ROS could inhibit this process. Our data indicated that either overexpression of antioxidant genes or genistein, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, caused a significant decrease in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in VL-17A cells. But, incubation of MG-132 with ethanol did not decrease the PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, which suggested that proteasomes act downstream of PKCδ. Our data also confirmed that inhibition of either PKCδ or its tyrosine phosphorylation, or proteasomal activation reversed ethanol-induced MKP-1 degradation. Previous data have shown that chronic administration of ethanol either in vivo (51Roberts B.J. Kim B.J. Soh Y. Park S.S. Shoaf S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29632-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 52Bardag-Gorce F. Kim Q.X. Li J. French B.A. Fang C. Ingelman-Sundberg M. French S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or in vitro (53Bardag-Gorce F. Kim B.A. Nan L. Song H. Nguyen S.K. Yong H. Dede J. French S.W. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2006; 81: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) caused an inhibition of proteasomal activation. In our study, we show that acute administration of ethanol induces the activation of proteasomes. These data confirm that the effects of ethanol on signaling pathways differ depending on its concentration, means of administration, and its metabolism (1Aroor A.R. Kim S.D. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2339-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our data further indicate that ethanol-induced oxidative stress enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, followed by proteasomal activation and MKP-1 degradation. To further attest to this mechanism, we determined whether the recovery of MKP-1 levels could normalize the JNK activation. When we incubated the cells with MG-132 prior to ethanol exposure or treated SOD3/cat-overexpressing cells with ethanol, there was a recovery of MKP-1 leading to transient rather than sustained activation of JNK, and a resulting decrease in apoptosis. Previously it was shown that the incubation of a PKC inhibitor (GF109203X) or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) with primary rat hepatocytes for 1 h did not cause a decrease in the 200 mm ethanol-induced JNK activation (44Lee Y.J. Kim S.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 508: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to their findings, our data showed that inhibition of PKCδ using siRNA oligonucleotides caused a significant inhibition of ethanol-induced sustained JNK activation. There are several possible explanations for these conflicting results. The previous report employed extremely high levels of ethanol administration for only a brief time, thus it is possible that MAPK activation is dependent on the concentration and the time of ethanol exposure. To further confirm that ethanol-induced PKCδ activation is involved in MKP-1 degradation, we have utilized siRNA-mediated gene silencing of PKCδ. All the findings using rottlerin as a PKCδ inhibitor were reproduced with the siRNA silencing. To analyze whether PKCδ activation is upstream or downstream of the ROS generation, the PKCδ siRNA-transfected cells were incubated with ethanol, and we determined that the ROS release was not inhibited. This shows that the PKCδ activation is downstream of the ROS release. Inhibition of PKCδ using siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in the restoration of MKP-1 protein levels as well as transient activation of JNK in these cells. This transient activation of JNK also decreased the AP-1 nuclear translocation in these cells. Further experiments confirmed that ethanol-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited in the cells transfected with PKCδ siRNA oligonucleotides suggesting that there is a critical role for PKCδ in ethanol-induced apoptosis in hepatic cells. Our results suggest a newly described mechanism by which ethanol may induce apoptosis in hepatic cells. Ethanol-induced oxidative stress enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, which in turn promotes the proteasomal degradation of MKP-1. The degradation of MKP-1 causes the sustained activation of JNK leading to increased apoptosis. The proposed pathway is presented in Fig. 8. It is clear that this represents a novel, but not unique, pathway by which ethanol-induced ROS activates PKCδ and initiates the apoptosis cascade in hepatic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2005252002,"Background The mammalian olfactory system consists of several subsystems that detect specific sets of chemical cues and underlie a variety of behavioral responses. Within the main olfactory epithelium at least three distinct types of chemosensory neurons can be defined by their expression of unique sets of signal transduction components. In rodents, one set of neurons expresses the olfactory-specific guanylyl cyclase (GC)-D gene (Gucy2d, guanylyl cyclase 2d) and other cell-type specific molecules. GC-D-positive neurons project their axons to a small group of atypical “necklace” glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, some of which are activated in response to suckling in neonatal rodents and to atmospheric CO2 in adult mice. Because GC-D is a pseudogene in humans, signaling through this system appears to have been lost at some point in primate evolution. Principal Findings Here we used a combination of bioinformatic analysis of trace-archive and genome-assembly data and sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA to determine when during primate evolution the functional gene was lost. Our analysis reveals that GC-D is a pseudogene in a large number of primate species, including apes, Old World and New World monkeys and tarsier. In contrast, the gene appears intact and has evolved under purifying selection in mouse, rat, dog, lemur and bushbaby. Conclusions These data suggest that signaling through GC-D-expressing cells was probably compromised more than 40 million years ago, prior to the divergence of New World monkeys from Old World monkeys and apes, and thus cannot be involved in chemosensation in most primates."

In normal cells, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is believed to enhance chromosome stability by promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of double strand DNA breaks. Here we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are each essential for both chromosome stability and HDR. Tandem BRCT motifs, including those found at the C terminus of BARD1, are known to form a phosphoprotein recognition module.

As such, cells deficient in BRCA1 accumulate chromosome abnormalities and display hypersensitivity to a variety of genotoxic agents. Although the genome maintenance functions of BRCA1 are believed to be a major determinant of its tumor suppression activity, the specific molecular mechanisms by which BRCA1 affects genome stability remain elusive. The BRCA1 gene encodes a 1863-amino acid protein with an N-terminal RING domain and two tandem C-terminal BRCT repeats (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S.

In addition, the central region of BARD1 harbors three tandem ankyrin repeats of unknown function. The interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1 is mediated primarily by N-terminal sequences encompassing their respective RING domains (7Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C.

In support of this notion, Brca1- and Bard1-null mice suffer embryonic lethality with phenotypes that are essentially indistinguishable (10McCarthy E.E. Celebi J.T. Baer R. Ludwig T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because embryonic cells from these mice exhibit aneuploidy and accumulate chromosome abnormalities, BARD1, like BRCA1, is likely to function in the maintenance of genomic stability. Given the intimate relationship between BRCA1 and BARD1, lesions of the BARD1 gene might also be expected to promote oncogenesis, and indeed, tumor-specific missense mutations of BARD1 have been found in patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas (11Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2005; 42: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, these mutations are often accompanied by tumor-specific loss of the normal BARD1 allele (11Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, although cancer-associated BARD1 mutations are uncommon, their existence implies that BARD1 can serve as a target for genetic lesions that disrupt BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. Experimental support for this possibility has recently emerged from studies of mice that undergo cre-mediated inactivation of the Bard1 gene in their mammary epithelial cells. Remarkably, these animals develop breast tumors with an incidence, latency, and phenotype similar to those of mice undergoing mammary-specific inactivation of Brca1. 3R. Shakya, M. Szabolcs, E. E.

Baer, and T. Ludwig, unpublished data. Thus, BARD1 appears to function in vivo as a tumor suppressor in a manner reminiscent of BRCA1. Recent studies have shown that two tandem BRCT motifs, such as those arrayed at the C termini of BRCA1 and BARD1, can form a structural domain that specifically binds phosphorylated peptide sequences (14Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 15Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In this manner, the BRCT motifs of BRCA1 can control distinct cell cycle checkpoints through phospho-dependent interactions with different cellular proteins. For example, the transient G2/M checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation (IR) is dependent on recognition of Ser-327-phosphorylated isoforms of the CtIP protein by the BRCT motifs of BRCA1 (16Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Conversely, an interaction between these same motifs and the Ser-990-phosphorylated BACH1/BRIP1/FancJ protein is required for activation of the G2 accumulation checkpoint (15Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Although cellular proteins that associate with the BRCT motifs of BARD1 have not yet been identified, these motifs can also bind peptides in a phospho-dependent manner (17Rodriguez M. Yu X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52914-52918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). BRCA1 is required for homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSBs (18Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 19Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that overexpression of a truncated BARD1 polypeptide interferes with HDR in mouse embryonic stem cells, presumably through dominant-negative inhibition of the endogenous Brca1/Bard1 heterodimer (20Westermark U.K. Reyngold M. Olshen A.B. Baer R. Jasin M. Moynahan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7926-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More recently, the plant ortholog of BARD1 was shown to participate in homology-driven DNA recombination in somatic cells (21Reidt W. Wurz R. Wanieck K. Chu H.H. Puchta H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4326-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because HDR is a major pathway for DSB repair in mammals (22Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), the HDR defects associated with BARD1 dysfunction may contribute to genomic instability. Therefore, in the current study, we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 function in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are both essential for chromosomal stability and HDR-mediated repair of an induced chromosomal break. However, the HDR function of BARD1 was not perturbed by synthetic mutations of the BRCT sequences predicted to ablate phosphoprotein recognition. Thus, although the BRCT motifs of BARD1 are critical for HDR, their ability to bind phosphorylated ligands does not appear to be required for this process. Interestingly, although several cancer-associated missense mutations of BARD1 target the BRCT domains, none of these was found to affect HDR function, suggesting that the increased cancer risk conferred by these variants is not because of defects in HDR. Cell Lines—Bard-null mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines 10-05 and 18-09 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. To generate stably transformed subclones of these lines, 10-05 and 18-09 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with either the empty pIRESpuro vector (Clontech) or with the corresponding vector encoding human BARD1 with either a single (FLAG-BARD1/pIRESpuro) or three tandem (3xFLAG-BARD1/pIRESpuro) N-terminal FLAG epitopes. Following 3 weeks of selection with 5 μg/ml puromycin, individual clones were screened for BARD1 expression by immunoblotting with BARD1- or FLAG-specific antibodies. To generate HDR reporter lines, Bard1-null 18-09 cells were transfected with the DR-GFPhygro reporter construct (23Nakanishi K. Yang Y.G. Pierce A.J. Taniguchi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z.Q. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and transformants harboring randomly integrated copies of the reporter were selected with 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B. To identify subclones bearing a single intact copy of the reporter, the genomic DNAs of individual subclones were digested with restriction endonucleases (BglII, HindIII, PstI, and XbaI) and analyzed by Southern hybridization with the 800-bp HindIII fragment of the DR-GFPhygro plasmid. Two independently derived subclones with a single integrated copy of the DR-GFP reporter (18-09/DR-GFP-2 and 18-09/DR-GFP-4) were used for all HDR experiments. Antibodies—The BARD1-specific polyclonal antiserum has been described (7Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody (GH118) specific for mouse Brca1 was kindly provided by Shridar Ganesan and David Livingston (24Ludwig T. Fisher P. Ganesan S. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used included anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-NuMa (Ab-1, Calbiochem), and anti-α-tubulin (Ab-1, Oncogene Science Inc.). Cytogenetic Analysis—Cells in log phase of growth were treated with colcemid for 2 h, trypsinized, washed with PBS, and subjected to hypotonic treatment with 0.38% KCl at 37 °C for 20 min. After fixing in 3:1 methanol/glacial acetic acid, the cells were placed on glass slides and stained with Giemsa (Karyomax, Invitrogen). Metaphase spreads were examined for the presence of chromatid-type aberrations, including breaks, gaps, and exchanges. Statistical analysis was performed using the Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis website. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis of cytogenetic data. Multicolor spectral karyotype analysis was performed on metaphase preparations from Bard1-null carcinoma cells grown in culture using standard procedures as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Spectral Imaging, Vista, CA). HDR Assays—To measure repair of an I-SceI-induced DSB in the stably reconstituted 18-09/DR-GFP-2 reporter subclones (e.g. Fig. 3), ∼4 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 2 ml of nonselective medium on 6-well plates. After 20-24 h (at ∼70% confluency), the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of an I-SceI expression vector (pCBASce) (26Richardson C. Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or the corresponding empty vector (pCAGGS) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed and replated on 60-mm dishes in nonselective medium. Flow cytometric analysis to quantify the presence of GFP-positive cells was performed 2 days later on a FACSCalibur using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). For each sample, 50,000-100,000 cells were assessed, and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was calculated and displayed in Figs. 3, 4, 5. An independent transfection with a GFP-encoding vector was performed concurrently to provide a control for transfection efficiency. To measure HDR in transiently reconstituted 18-09/DR-GFP-2 and -4 subclones (e.g. Figs. 4 and 5), 5 × 105 reporter cells were seeded on 60-mm plates, allowed to attach for 20-24 h, and co-transfected with 1 μg of pCBASce or the corresponding empty vector (pCAGGS) and 2 μg of pIRESpuro expression vector encoding 3xFLAG-BARD1 or the corresponding empty vector. At 18 h after transfection, the cells were replated on 100-mm dishes. All other steps were performed as above.FIGURE 4Loss of the RING, ankyrin, or BRCT motifs decreases the efficiency of BARD1-mediated HDR. A, Bard1-null DR-GFP reporter cells (subclone 18-09/DR-GFP-4) were co-transfected with I-SceI endonuclease along with a vector encoding wild-type (i.e. full-length) BARD1, BARD1-ΔAnk, BARD1-ΔBRCT, BARD1-B202, BARD1-ΔRING, or the corresponding empty expression vector (pIRESpuro). Flow cytometry was performed 72 h post-transfection to quantify the number of GFP-positive cells. Average values from a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown, and the error bars indicate S.D.

These lines were derived from tumors that developed in mice harboring a conditional Bard1 allele that was specifically inactivated in mammary epithelial cells by cre-mediated recombination.3 Cytogenetic analysis of these lines, including the two used in this study (10-05 and 18-09), revealed aneuploid karyotypes exhibiting highly complex chromosomal rearrangements (see Fig. 1A for a spectral karyotype of the 10-05 tumor line). Giemsa-stained metaphase spreads of each line also displayed a high frequency of chromatid-type aberrations, indicative of ongoing chromosomal instability (data not shown). To determine whether Bard1 inactivation was responsible for the ongoing chromosomal instability, we asked whether complementation with exogenous BARD1 would ameliorate this phenotype and correct the chromosomal instability phenotype. Therefore, isogenic subclones of the 10-05 Bard1-null tumor line were generated by stable transfection with an empty mammalian expression vector or a vector that encodes the human BARD1 polypeptide with an N-terminal FLAG epitope (FLAG-BARD1). As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of exogenous BARD1 resulted in a proportional increase in endogenous Brca1 levels, indicating that human BARD1 can interact with and stabilize the mouse Brca1 polypeptide. Karyotype analysis of two independently derived BARD1-complemented subclones and two empty vector control subclones revealed a marked reduction in the frequency of chromatid-type aberrations in cells reconstituted with BARD1. Thus, the percentage of metaphases with one or more of these abnormalities was much lower in the BARD1-complemented subclones (11%) than in the empty vector controls (26%) (Table 1).TABLE 1The chromosomal instability of Bard1-null mammary carcinoma cells is reduced by reconstitution with human BARD1Subclones of Bard1-null 10-05 cellsNo. of metaphases scored% metaphases with the indicated no. of aberrationsaThe percentage of metaphases containing one or more chromatid-type aberrations (breaks, gaps, and/or exchanges) are shown.

MMC treatment resulted in increased levels of chromatid-type aberrations in both the BARD1-complemented subclones and the control subclones (Table 1). Significantly, however, the percentage of MMC-treated cells displaying abnormal metaphases was lower for the BARD1-complemented subclones (53%) than for the control subclones (70%). The difference was more pronounced when considering the number of metaphases displaying multiple aberrations; for example, although MMC-treated metaphases harboring three or more chromatid-type aberrations were rarely found in BARD1-reconstituted subclones (5%), these were clearly more prevalent in the control subclones (25%). These results indicate that the chromosomal instability phenotype of Bard1-null tumor cells is caused, at least in part, by loss of Bard1. The Ankyrin and BRCT Motifs of BARD1 Are Necessary for Maintenance of Chromosomal Stability—We previously showed that a truncated form of BARD1 lacking the C-terminal 575 amino acids, including the three ankyrin and the two BRCT repeats, exerts a dominant-negative effect on HDR of DSBs (20Westermark U.K. Reyngold M. Olshen A.B. Baer R. Jasin M. Moynahan M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7926-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This suggests that one or both of these functional domains is important for maintenance of chromosomal stability. To assess the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process, isogenic subclones of 10-05 cells were generated by stable transformation with vectors encoding FLAG-tagged human BARD1 polypeptides that lack either the three ankyrin repeats encoded by amino acids 426-521 (BARD1-ΔAnk) or the two BRCT repeats encoded by amino acids 602-777 (BARD1-ΔBRCT) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the range of BARD1 protein expression in these subclones was comparable with that observed for the subclones complemented with full-length BARD1. Also, expression of either BARD1-ΔAnk or BARD1-ΔBRCT increased endogenous Brca1 levels to a similar extent as full-length BARD1, indicating that the ankyrin and BRCT deletions do not impair the ability of these polypeptides to heterodimerize with and stabilize mouse Brca1. Two subclones expressing each of the BARD1 deletion mutants, matched by expression level to the full-length BARD1-complemented subclones, were then subjected to cytogenetic analysis. In contrast to full-length BARD1, stable expression of the mutant BARD1 polypeptides failed to restore chromosomal stability (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Thus, the proportion of metaphases bearing spontaneous de novo chromatid-type aberrations in the BARD1-ΔAnk (30%) and BARD1-ΔBRCT (33%) subclones was comparable with that of the control subclones (26%) and significantly higher than that of subclones reconstituted with full-length BARD1 (11%). Whereas MMC exposure increased the levels of chromatid-type aberrations in all subclones, the proportion of abnormal metaphases was greater in the control (70%), BARD1-ΔAnk (78%), and BARD1-ΔBRCT (71%) subclones than in those reconstituted with full-length BARD1 (53%). Again, this effect was more pronounced when considering metaphases that harbor multiple aberrations; thus, the number of metaphase spreads displaying three or more chromatid-type defects in the BARD1-ΔAnk (32%) and BARD1-ΔBRCT (23%) subclones was similar to that in the control subclones (25%) and significantly greater than that in subclones expressing full-length BARD1 (5%). These data indicate that both the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are necessary for suppression of both spontaneous and MMC-induced chromosomal instability. The RING, Ankyrin, and BRCT Motifs of BARD1 Are Each Necessary for Homology-directed Repair—To gain insight into the mechanism of BARD1-mediated chromosomal stability, we examined the structural requirements for BARD1 in the HDR of DSBs. HDR function can be examined in vivo using a DR-GFP reporter system that measures recombinational repair of an induced chromosomal DSB (27Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reporter harbors two distinct nonfunctional copies of the GFP gene (Fig. 3A). The first copy (SceGFP) is disrupted by an 18-bp insertion bearing the recognition site for the rare-cutting endonuclease I-SceI, whereas the second copy (iGFP) encodes only an internal region of the GFP gene lacking the N- and C-terminal coding sequences. However, a functional GFP gene can be generated when a DNA break triggered by I-SceI cleavage of SceGFP is repaired by HDR using iGFP as the template, and such events can be accurately quantified using flow cytometry (27Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of BARD1 on HDR, we generated Bard1-null cells containing a chromosomal DR-GFP reporter by transfecting the Bard1-null mammary carcinoma line 18-09 with the linearized DR-GFPhygro construct (23Nakanishi K. Yang Y.G. Pierce A.J. Taniguchi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z.Q. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Following selection with hygromycin B, individual subclones were isolated and screened by Southern analysis to identify those possessing a single integrated copy of the intact reporter (supplemental Fig. 1). One of the DR-GFP subclones of 18-09 (18-09/DR-GFP-2) was then transfected with an empty expression vector or the same vector encoding a FLAG-tagged full-length BARD1 polypeptide (3xFLAG-BARD1), and stably transformed subclones were selected with puromycin. As expected, BARD1 expression in the resultant subclones increased the steady-state levels of endogenous Brca1 (Fig. 3B). To measure HDR of an induced chromosomal DSB, the BARD1-complemented and control subclones were evaluated for the appearance of GFP-positive cells at 72 h"
https://openalex.org/W2028510406,"The first eukaryotic proline racemase (PRAC), isolated from the human Trypanosoma cruzi pathogen, is a validated therapeutic target against Chagas' disease. This essential enzyme is implicated in parasite life cycle and infectivity and its ability to trigger host B-cell nonspecific hypergammaglobulinemia contributes to parasite evasion and persistence. Using previously identified PRAC signatures and data mining we present the identification and characterization of a novel PRAC and five hydroxyproline epimerases (HyPRE) from pathogenic bacteria. Single-mutation of key HyPRE catalytic cysteine abrogates enzymatic activity supporting the presence of two reaction centers per homodimer. Furthermore, evidences are provided that Brucella abortus PrpA [for ‘proline racemase’ virulence factor A] and homologous proteins from two Brucella spp are bona fide HyPREs and not ‘one way’ directional PRACs as described elsewhere. Although the mechanisms of aminoacid racemization and epimerization are conserved between PRAC and HyPRE, our studies demonstrate that substrate accessibility and specificity partly rely on contraints imposed by aromatic or aliphatic residues distinctively belonging to the catalytic pockets. Analysis of PRAC and HyPRE sequences along with reaction center structural data disclose additional valuable elements for in silico discrimination of the enzymes. Furthermore, similarly to PRAC, the lymphocyte mitogenicity displayed by HyPREs is discussed in the context of bacterial metabolism and pathogenesis. Considering tissue specificity and tropism of infectious pathogens, it would not be surprising if upon infection PRAC and HyPRE play important roles in the regulation of the intracellular and extracellular amino acid pool profiting the microrganism with precursors and enzymatic pathways of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2039680865,"Background It is recognized that the ability of adipose tissue to expand in response to energy excess, i.e. adipocyte maturation, is important in determining systemic abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1, also known as PC-1) has been recently reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and related diseases. However, its role on adipose tissue physiology as a mechanism of systemic insulin resistance is not understood. This study was performed to evaluate whether ENPP1 is regulated during adipogenesis and whether over-expression in adipocytes can affect adipocyte maturation, a potential novel mechanism of ENPP1-related insulin resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings ENPP1 expression was found down-regulated during 3T3-L1 maturation, and over-expression of human ENPP1 in 3T3-L1 (pQCXIP-ENPP1 vector) resulted in adipocyte insulin resistance and in defective adipocyte maturation. Adipocyte maturation was more efficient in mesenchymal embryonal cells from ENPP1 knockout mice than from wild-type. Conclusions We identify ENPP1 as a novel mechanism of defective adipocyte maturation. This mechanism could contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in absence of obesity."

In the basal state pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin at a low rate and following a meal increase insulin release into the circulation sufficient to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Insulin is stored in β-cells as zinc hexamer crystals within mature granules that undergo tightly regulated exocytosis in response to extrinsic stimuli (such as glucose) that induce a cascade of events leading to the elevation of cytosolic calcium levels and/or of various second messengers (1Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Mears D. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Barg S. Pharmacol.

The readily releasable granule pool is apparently predocked at the cell surface with the Q-SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, in a complex with the granule R-SNARE protein VAMP2 and the calcium-regulated protein, synaptotagmin, although the specific synaptotagmin isoform remains unresolved (6Ohara-Imaizumi M.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, other studies have also indicated the involvement of the syntaxin 4 isoform in insulin secretion (10Saito T. Okada S. Yamada E. Ohshima K. Shimizu K. Shimomura K. Sato M. Pessin J.E. Mori M. J. Biol.

In any case, following the initial rapid first phase of insulin secretion, second phase secretion results from the recruitment of reserve granules to the plasma membrane that are also dependent on Q- and R-SNARE interaction for fusion. Various models describing the mechanism of insulin granule fusion with the plasma membrane have been proposed. Initial studies have suggested that the release of the insulin-containing dense core granule content occurs en masse, consistent with the formation of a plasma membrane pore that fully expands to encompass the granule membrane proteins and lipids (12Orci L. Amherdt M. Malaisse-Lagae F. Rouiller C. Renold A.E. Science. 1973; 179: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi N. Kishimoto T. Nemoto T. Kadowaki T. Kasai H.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9266-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has also been suggested that insulin granules may actually stack and communicate with each other with a given granule releasing its content into another granule leading to a continuously gating channel to the plasma membrane through a process called compound exocytosis (15Leung Y.M. Sheu L. Kwan E. Wang G. Tsushima R. Gaisano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 980-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Kwan E.P. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2734-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another model has recently been proposed in that each granule separately forms a transient plasma membrane pore with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of intraluminal cargo, and either complete mixing of the membrane components (kiss and run) or selective membrane mixing (cavicapture) followed by endocytosis and recycling of the vesicle/granule membrane proteins and lipids (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr.

A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although these studies examined the trafficking/release of single granule events, we have examined the macroscopic function of dynamin in the regulation of insulin secretion. Consistent with previous studies (18Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), inhibition of endocytosis does not lead to the appearance of the insulin granule membrane marker phogrin at the cell surface suggesting the transient opening of a selective granule-plasma membrane pore. Surprisingly however, expression of a dominant-interfering dynamin mutant or siRNA 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interference RNA; hGH, human growth hormone; Dyn, dynamin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. -mediated dynamin knockdown resulted in a marked inhibition of insulin secretion. These data indicate the presence of a direct coupling between insulin granule exocytosis (fusion pore opening) and endocytosis (fusion pore closure) events. Cell Culture and Transfection—Min6B1 (transformed mouse β) cells (20Lilla V. Webb G. Rickenbach K. Maturana A. Steiner D.F. Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml) and 71 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. INS-1E (transformed rat β) cells (21Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml) as previously described (20Lilla V.

Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). For hGH secretory assays, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of hGH cDNA plus either 6 μg of empty vector (pCDNA 3.1) or the dominant-interfering dynamin mutant (Dyn/K44A) cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturerŉs instructions (Invitrogen). For confocal fluorescent microscopy examination, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of phogrin-GFP or transferrin receptor cDNAs with Dyk/K44A, respectively. Dynamin 2 siRNA Knockdown and Immunoblotting—Min6B1 cells were grown on 15-cm dishes and electroporated with either 1 nmol of a scrambled or Dyn2-specific siRNA (Ambion) and cultured for 72 h. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a dynamin 2 antibody (Novus Biologicals), total dynamin antibody (Sigma), and a p115 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory) as an internal control. Min6B1 cell lysate and mouse brain tissue extracts were blotted with dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 antibodies (Novus Biologicals) as control for tissue-specific dynamin expression. hGH Secretion—The Min6B1 cells were plated in 60-mm (3 × 106 cells) coverslips for 24 h prior to transfection and were maintained for an additional 48 h post-transfection. The cells were then incubated in KRBH (4.7 mm KCl, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 2 h and then mounted in a Zeiss perfusion closed POC-R system (20Lilla V. Webb G. Rickenbach K. Maturana A. Steiner D.F. Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After assembly of the perfusion chamber, the cells were perfused in KRBH containing 2.8 mm glucose for 15 min, and the perfusate was switched to KRBH buffer containing either 16.7 mm glucose, 30 mm KCl or a mixture of multiple secretagogues: BM (16.7 mm glucose, 10 nm forskolin, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 30 mm KCl). The release of hGH into the medium was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). Insulin Secretion—The Min6B1 cells were transfected by electroporation with 1 nm of either the scrambled or Dyn2-specific siRNA for 72 h. The cells were then incubated in KRBH containing 2.8 mm glucose for 2 h and treated with 16.7 mm glucose for an additional 1 h. The release of insulin into the medium and total insulin content in the lysate were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia). Measurement of Membrane Capacitance—The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to measure changes in cell membrane capacitance as previously described (22Lindau M. Neher E. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 23Lam P.P. Leung Y.M. Sheu L. Ellis J. Tsushima R.G. Osborne L.R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2744-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, electrodes were coated with orthodontic wax (Butler, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) close to the tips and heat-polished. Resistances ranged from 3.5 to 5 mΩ when pipettes were filled with the intracellular solution, which contained: 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm triethanolamine chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm cAMP, and 5 mm MgATP (pH 7.25 adjusted with CsOH). The extracellular solution contained: 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Cell capacitance was estimated by the Lindau-Neher technique, implementing the “Sine + DC” feature of the Lock-in module (40 mV peak-to-peak and a frequency of 500 Hz) in the standard whole cell configuration (22Lindau M. Neher E. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Recordings were conducted using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier and Pulse software. A train of six 500-ms depolarizing pulses (1-Hz stimulation frequency from -70 to 0 mV) elicited insulin granule exocytosis. The experimental temperature was set at 30 °C. In these experiments, the cells were transfected with GFP-Dyn/WT or GFP-Dyn/K44A to identify the specific cells for patch clamping. Confocal Fluorescence—Min6B1 cells were plated in a 6-well plate with coverslips and transfected with phogrin-EGFP and Dyn/K44A. 48 h later, the cells were incubated in KRBH buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose for 2 h and then stimulated with either 16.7 mm glucose or BM for 1 h. Then the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with various primary (insulin and dynamin antibodies from Sigma) and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratory). For live cell imaging experiments, Min6B1 cells were electroporated with phogrin-GFP in the presence or absence of Dyn2 siRNA (1 nmol). Cells were then plated on 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (Mat Tek corp.) or plated on a 35-mm cover-slip for fixed images. Cells were imaged after a 72-h recovery period using a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning laser confocal microscope with 63×/1.4 numerical aperture Plan Apochromatic oil immersion objective lens and 488 nm laser excitation. A time series consisting of 200 images captured every 5 s was obtained for each cell. Stimulation was with BM as described above. Time series results were exported as QuickTime movies and text added using Adobe GoLive CS2. Movies were compressed using River Past Video Cleaner. Integral Membrane Proteins in Insulin Granules Do Not Translocate to the Plasma Membrane—It is well established that, following fusion of transport vesicle compartments (donor membranes) with the plasma membrane (acceptor membrane), donor integral membrane cargo proteins are physically inserted into the acceptor membrane and are readily visualized at the cell surface by fluorescence microscopy. For example, the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes or vasopressin stimulation of AQP2 translocation in collecting duct principal cells results in the visual redistribution of these proteins to the plasma membrane (24Procino G. Caces D.B. Valenti G. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 290: F985-F994Google Scholar). We therefore expressed the integral insulin granule membrane protein phogrin as a GFP fusion construct, and, as previously reported (25Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Katsuta H. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we observed a near identical co-localization with insulin containing intracellular compartments, presumably insulin granules (Fig. 1A, panels a–c). Although phogrin co-localized with these insulin granules, neither glucose nor the BM stimulatory mixture resulted in any detectable redistribution of phogrin to the cell surface membrane (Fig. 1B, panels a–c). These data indicate that the insulin granule membrane protein phogrin did not undergo full fusion with the plasma membrane during insulin granule exocytosis. To confirm this observation, we also performed live cell imaging of Min6B1 cells expressing phogrin-GFP (supplementary Fig. 1S). These images demonstrate that phogrin-GFP-containing granules are in dynamic motion but that secretagogue stimulation does not appreciably change the rate of intracellular trafficking or the accumulation of phogrin at the cell surface. Together, these data are consistent with recent reports indicating that the release of insulin occurs by a kiss and run or cavicapture type mechanism, which limits the mixing of insulin granule membrane contents with the plasma membrane (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All membrane proteins are thought to undergo continuous cycling from one compartment to another, albeit at different rates. Therefore, if phogrin does translocate to the plasma membrane, inhibition of endocytosis should result in an accumulation of phogrin at the cell surface. To further assess such possible phogrin translocation to the plasma membrane, we therefore examined the effect of blocking plasma membrane endocytosis on the cell surface accumulation of phogrin (Fig. 2). In the basal state, co-expression of the dominant-interfering dynamin mutant (Dyn/K44A) had no significant effect on the distribution of phogrin (Fig. 2A, panels a–c). Even more surprisingly, glucose stimulation in the presence of Dyn/K44A also did not result in any significant redistribution of phogrin (Fig. 2A, panels d–f). To ensure that Dyn/K44A inhibited plasma membrane endocytosis, the cells were cotransfected with transferrin receptor plus either empty vector or Dyn/K44A. Under these conditions, labeling of the transferrin receptor at the cell surface at 4 °C following by warming the cells to 37 °C for 30 min resulted in the expected internalization of the transferrin receptor (Fig. 2B, panels a and e). However, in the presence of Dyn/K44A the internalization of the transferrin receptor was efficiently inhibited (Fig. 2B, panels b–d and f–h). These data demonstrate that, although inhibition of endocytosis by Dyn/K44A results in the accumulation of general trafficking membrane proteins such as transferrin receptor at the cell surface, there was no effect on the cell surface localization of the insulin granule marker phogrin. Inhibition of Plasma Membrane Endocytosis Blocks Secretagogue-stimulated Insulin Secretion—As described above, because phogrin did not accumulate at the plasma membrane even when endocytosis was inhibited, we next examined the effect of Dyn/K44A on insulin secretion (Fig. 3). Min6B1 cells were co-transfected with either the empty vector or Dyn/K44A plus a plasmid encoding hGH, because previous studies have established that hGH functions as a marker of insulin secretion (26Cheviet S. Coppola T. Haynes L.P. Burgoyne R.D. Regazzi R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Iezzi M. Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) thus allowing for secretion only from (co-)transfected cells to be monitored. Expression of Dyn/K44A had no significant effect on basal release of hGH compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Glucose stimulation of control cells resulted in an approximate 6-fold increase in hGH release. By contrast, expression of Dyn/K44A markedly blunted the extent of glucose-stimulated hGH release that resulted in only an approximate 2.5-fold increase in secretion. This occurred without any significant change in the total amount of growth hormone content (Fig. 3B). The inhibition of glucose-stimulated hGH release in the media could have resulted from a reduction in either first phase secretion and/or second phase secretion. To assess the effect of Dyn/K44A on the dynamics of insulin secretion, we next examined the time-course of hGH secretion in transfected Min6B1 cells that were subjected to perifusion (Fig. 4). In control cells, glucose stimulation resulted in a rapid rise in the rate of hGH release that was maximal at ∼5 min and then began to decline (Fig. 4A). Although these cells do not display a robust glucose-stimulated second phase secretion, a small shoulder was apparent that probably represents second phase secretion. Consistent with the total secretion data, expression of Dyn/K44A markedly reduced both the initial and the extended time course of insulin secretion. To determine whether this was specific to glucose or a general phenomenon for multiple secretagogues, we next examined the effect of KCl-mediated cellular depolarization (Fig. 4B). In control cells, KCl induced a robust first phase release of hGH that was also maximal by ∼7 min and then declined toward basal secretory levels by 25 min. As observed for glucose stimulation, cells expressing Dyn/K44A displayed a marked reduction in the extent and rate of KCl-induced hGH release. Because depolarization-induced insulin secretion only stimulates first phase release (28Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), these data indicate that expression of Dyn/K44A inhibits first and second phase insulin secretion. We also determined whether the expression of Dyn/K44A could inhibit insulin secretion when stimulated by a strong mixture of multiple secretagogues. The BM secretagogue mixture (glucose, isobutylmethylxanthine, and KCl) is a very potent simulator of both first and second phase insulin secretion in Min6B1 cells (29Donelan M.J. Morfini G. Julyan R. Sommers S. Hays L. Kajio H. Briaud I. Easom R.A. Molkentin J.D. Brady S.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24232-24242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As expected, the combination of secretagogues in the BM mixture induced a striking increase in the rate of insulin secretion with an approximate 15-fold stimulation (Fig. 4C). Similar to the effect on glucose- and KCl-stimulated hGH secretion, expression of Dyn/K44A inhibited both initial and extended phases of hGH secretion. A comparison of the area under the curve values indicated that Dyn/K44A inhibited glucose, KCl, and the BM secretagogue mixture to similar extents (72.4 ± 4.7%, 77.6 ± 3.1%, and 78.4 ± 13% inhibition, respectively). Together, these data demonstrate that in the presence of Dyn/K44A there is a marked inhibition of secretagogue-stimulated granule content exocytosis. Dynamin Function Is Required for Granule Fusion with the Plasma Membrane—If dynamin function was necessary for the release of granule content, then we would predict that at a macroscopic level the fusion/opening of granules in the presence of Dyn/K44A would be reduced thereby preventing insertion of additional membrane content to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we determined the changes in total plasma membrane capacitance following a train of depolarizing voltage by patch clamp recordings. However, because Min6B1 cells were difficult to patch clamp, we first determined whether Dyn/K44A would inhibit secretagogue-stimulated secretion from the INS-1E β-cell line that is more amenable to patch clamping (Fig. 5). Although this cell line does not display a robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, it is highly responsive to the BM secretagogue mixture. As observed for the Min6B1 cells, BM stimulation resulted in a marked increase in hGH secretion in the empty vector and Dyn/WT co-transfected cells, whereas there was a dramatic inhibition of hGH secretion in the INS-1E cells transfected with Dyn/K44A (Fig. 5A). Similar to the Min6B1 cells, the Dyn/K44A-dependent inhibition of secretion occurred without any significant change in the total hGH reporter content (Fig. 5B). Having observed the similar phenomenon in INS-1E cells, we next examined the changes in total plasma membrane capacitance following a train of depolarizing voltage by patch clamp recordings (Fig. 6). As expected, serial depolarization triggered membrane capacitance (Cm) increases (exocytosis) in untransfected cells that tended to saturate following multiple depolarizing pulses (Fig. 6A). To determine the effect of dynamin expression, we transfected INS1-1E cells with Dyn/WT and Dyn/K44A containing a GFP tag to identified the transfected cell populations. Expression of Dyn/WT also resulted in increased membrane capacitance following depolarizing pulses essentially identical to that observed for the non-transfected INS-1E cells (Fig. 6B). However, in marked contrast, there was a near complete inhibition of the depolarization induction of membrane capacitance increase (Fig. 6C). Quantitative results are summarized in Fig. 6D and demonstrate that Dyn/K44A results in a major impairment in depolarization-stimulated increase in membrane capacitance consistent with a defect in insulin granule exocytotic fusion. siRNA-mediated Dynamin Knockdown Inhibits Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—Because the above data were obtained from co-transfection of a dominant-interfering dynamin mutant and with hGH as an insulin secretion marker, we subsequently examined the effect of siRNA-mediated reduction of dynamin on endogenous insulin secretion. It is well known that dynamin 1 is primarily expressed in neural tissues, whereas dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed and dynamin 3 expression is restricted to the testes with low levels in the lung and nervous tissue (30Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because insulin-secreting β-cells are neuroendocrine-like, we then examined the relative expression of the dynamin isoforms in the Min6B1 cells. As shown in Fig. 7A (upper panel), dynamin 1 was readily detected in mouse brain extracts (lane 1) with essentially no detectable expression in Min6B1 cells (lane 2). By contrast, immunoblotting with the dynamin 2 antibody (lower panel) demonstrated the presence of dynamin 2 in Min6B1 cell (lane 2) with very low levels in the mouse brain extract (lane 1). Because dynamin 2 was relatively more abundant in the Min6B1 cells, the cells were then transfected with either a scrambled siRNA or a dynamin 2-specific siRNA (Fig. 7B). 72 h following transfection there was an approximate 90% reduction of dynamin 2 protein levels compared with the scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). The reduction of dynamin 2 protein was specific, as p115 protein levels remained unchanged (lower panel). Moreover, immunoblotting with a total (pan) dynamin antibody that detects all three dynamin isoforms demonstrated an identical extent of dynamin protein reduction compared with the dynamin 2-specific antibody (middle panel). These data demonstrated that dynamin 2 is the predominant isoform in Min6B1 cells and that the dynamin 2-specific siRNA was highly effective in reducing dynamin protein levels. Having demonstrated the effectiveness of the dynamin 2 siRNA, we assessed the effect of dynamin protein reduction on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The dynamin 2 knock-down had no significant effect on basal release of endogenous insulin compared with control cells (Fig. 7C). In scrambled siRNA-transfected cells, glucose stimulation resulted in an approximate 3.5-fold increase in insulin release. By contrast, the knockdown of dynamin 2 markedly reduced the extent of glucose-stimulated insulin release and resulted in only an approximate 1.2-fold increase of insulin secretion. This occurred without any significant change in the total amount of insulin content (Fig. 7D). Similar to the expression of Dyn/K44A, we also did not detect any significant redistribution of phogrin-GFP in the Dynamin siRNA knockdown cells either in fixed images or by live cell imaging (supplemental Figs. 2S and 3S). Together, these data strongly support a required role for dynamin function in regulating the extent of insulin secretion (insulin granule exocytosis). Various studies have suggested that insulin granules undergo complete fusion resulting in the total mixing of granule membrane proteins and lipids with the plasma membrane (12Orci L. Amherdt M. Malaisse-Lagae F. Rouiller C. Renold A.E. Science. 1973; 179: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi N. Kishimoto T. Nemoto T. Kadowaki T. Kasai H.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9266-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other studies have suggested that the insulin granules transiently open a fusion pore to allow intraluminal contents to diffuse out followed by membrane closure. This latter process can either be non-selective (kiss and run) or selective (cavicapture) such that granule membrane proteins/lipids either mix or remain segregated from the bulk plasma membrane, respectively (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr.

More recently, confocal fluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of soluble insulin granule tracers detected the presence of plasma membrane compartments that appeared to undergo full fusion (6Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nishiwaki C. Nakamichi Y. Kikuta T. Nagai S. Nagamatsu S. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi N. Kishimoto T. Nemoto T. Kadowaki T. Kasai H.

Steyer J.A. Feldman M.E. Almers W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By contrast, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy examination of insulin granule membrane proteins indicated that, although small molecular weight proteins (VAMP2 and synaptotagmin I) were incorporated into the plasma membrane, the large granule membrane protein phogrin was found excluded from the plasma membrane and remained granule-associated (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, the larger soluble insulin granule marker, tissue plasminogen activator-monomeric red fluorescent protein, was retained much longer than the small soluble marker, neuropeptide Y-monomeric red fluorescent protein. It was therefore concluded that insulin release resulted from the transient opening of a selective fusion pore (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Consistent with these latter studies, we have also observed that the extent of phogrin incorporation into the plasma membrane following glucose stimulation is below visual detection by fluorescence microscopy. However, in contrast to phogrin in insulin-secreting cells, most other membrane proteins undergo continuous plasma membrane recycling, albeit at different rates, independent of their steady-state intracellular localization. For example, furin and TGN38 are predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network but transiently traffic to and from the plasma membrane (34Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 35Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Banno T. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28397-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Reaves B. Horn M. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is readily detected by the inhibition of plasma membrane endocytosis that results in their slow accumulation at the plasma membrane. Thus, we reasoned that if phogrin slowly cycled to the plasma membrane it would become apparent if endocytosis was blocked by the expression of the dominant-interfering dynamin mutant. However, inhibition of plasma membrane endocytosis, as assessed by transferrin receptor recycling, did not result in any appreciable cell surface accumulation of phogrin in either the basal or stimulated-state. These results indicate that insulin granules did not undergo full fusion with the plasma membrane, and they are consistent with a selective cavicapture type of fusion pore opening with only a limited extent of granule membrane mixing with the plasma membrane. More surprisingly, expression of Dyn/K44A or the siRNA-mediated dynamin 2 knockdown markedly reduced the extent of insulin secretion stimulated by glucose, KCl, and a combination of multiple secretagogues. Furthermore, examination of the time course of insulin release demonstrated that both first and second phase insulin secretion was inhibited. In agreement with these effects on insulin secretion, the depolarization-induced increase in membrane capacitance was also markedly blunted in the presence of Dyn/K44A. Although our data were unable to clearly distinguish between first and second phase insulin secretion, the effect of blocking dynamin function on secretory granule release has previously been observed in chromaffin cells by using catecholamine amperometry combined with different patterns of stimulation (37Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Artalejo C.R. Neuron. 2001; 31: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that anti-dynamin IgG antibody progressively reduced the total amount of catecholamine release following successive rounds of stimulation, suggesting a primary effect on second phase secretion. In any case, because dynamin is well established to function in the endocytotic process, one possibility is that the extent of granule exocytosis is directly coupled to endocytosis in a manner necessary to prevent unrestricted expansion of the plasma membrane surface area. Although this is an appealing hypothesis, dynamin has recently been observed to undergo trafficking to the sites of insulin release, whereas other recognized endocytotic proteins such as clathrin, epsin, and amphiphysin are not selectively recruited (17Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, because insulin granules are relatively large (300 nm), it is unlikely that granule fission occurs via a clathrin-mediated process. Because under these conditions dynamin is unlikely to function in classic endocytosis, another mechanism must account for its requirement in the continuation of insulin release. In this regard, an alternative secretory model has been proposed in which insulin granules are stacked together into a three-dimensional array beneath the plasma membrane, termed sequential exocytosis (15Leung Y.M. Sheu L. Kwan E. Wang G. Tsushima R. Gaisano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 980-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Orci L. Malaisse W. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 943-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Bokvist K. Holmqvist M. Gromada J. Rorsman P. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 439: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As the plasma membrane bound granules open and close the fusion pore, the attached granules generate additional fusion pores that open and close connecting one granule to the next and thereby forming a chain leading to the plasma membrane. In this granule-granule fusion model, dynamin would therefore not function in classic endocytosis but would regulate the closing of fusion pores between granules. This compound exocytosis model is also appealing, because it would account for the apparent inconsistency between a stable increase in membrane capacitance (increased plasma membrane mass) and the kiss and run/cavicapture model. In the kiss and run model, during the initial cargo release phase bulk membrane capacitance would be expected to increase; however, following closure of the transient fusion pore, membrane capacitance would decrease and return to the basal state in parallel to the changes in first and second phase insulin secretion. However, the changes in membrane capacitance remained relatively stable through each depolarization step, suggesting a continuous addition of membrane mass consistent with a complete fusion and membrane-mixing model. The compound exocytosis model can account for both results, because for a single granule the fusion pore can open and close transiently, but at the macroscopic level the multiple openings and closing would result in a steady-state (averaged) increase in membrane surface area. Moreover, this would also account for the relative ability of a small amount of granule SNARE proteins (VAMP2/synaptotagmin) to become incorporated into the plasma membrane but the bulk majority of the granule protein resident proteins (phogrin) to be excluded. Finally, it is important to recognize that total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of single granule fusion events was reported to be unaffected by the expression of a dominant-interfering dynamin mutant (40Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Scalettar B.A. Fantus C. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15957-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, our data demonstrate a marked reduction in the extent of insulin secretion. These observations are similar to those observed for chromaffin granule release in Munc18a knock-out mice (41Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this system, single granule release events have identical kinetic and biophysical properties in the control and knock-out mice; however, the number of granule release events is markedly reduced in the absence of Munc18a. These differences in microscopic versus macroscopic events may underlie the specific mechanisms involved in insulin secretion. The simplest explanation is the presence of limited fusion sites, such that dynamin-dependent granule fission is required for the empty insulin granule to be released from the fusion site allowing for the docking of a new cargo-loaded insulin granule.

https://openalex.org/W2085326075,"Because rates of evolution and species divergence times cannot be estimated directly from molecular data, all current dating methods require that specific assumptions be made before inferring any divergence time. These assumptions typically bear either on rates of molecular evolution (molecular clock hypothesis, local clocks models) or on both rates and times (penalized likelihood, Bayesian methods). However, most of these assumptions can affect estimated dates, oftentimes because they underestimate large amounts of rate change.A significant modification to a recently proposed ad hoc rate-smoothing algorithm is described, in which local molecular clocks are automatically placed on a phylogeny. This modification makes use of hybrid approaches that borrow from recent theoretical developments in microarray data analysis. An ad hoc integration of phylogenetic uncertainty under these local clock models is also described. The performance and accuracy of the new methods are evaluated by reanalyzing three published data sets.It is shown that the new maximum likelihood hybrid methods can perform better than penalized likelihood and almost as well as uncorrelated Bayesian models. However, the new methods still tend to underestimate the actual amount of rate change. This work demonstrates the difficulty of estimating divergence times using local molecular clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2003741190,"RGS2 and RGS5 are inhibitors of G-protein signaling belonging to the R4/B subfamily of RGS proteins. We here show that RGS2 is a much more potent attenuator of M1 muscarinic receptor signaling than RGS5.

Heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors mediate cellular responses to a variety of extracellular ligands, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli. Proper coordination of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling at the cellular and tissue level is required to ensure appropriate physiologic responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions. An important component of G-protein-coupled receptors signal coordination in human cells is the RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling) superfamily of proteins. RGS proteins inhibit G-protein signaling via their activities as GTPase-activating proteins for G-protein α subunits (1Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The human genome contains 37 RGS proteins (5Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2005; 1: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) characterized by a ∼120-amino acid domain called the “RGS-box.” The RGS protein superfamily can be further subclassified based on the architectural organization and RGS-box function of its members (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Many subfamilies are made up of larger RGS-box-containing proteins that include the RGS7-like, RGS12-like, RhoGEF-containing, and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases. These subfamilies are mainly composed of members with multiple modular signaling domains. By contrast, the RGSZ-like and RGS4-like (R4/B) subfamilies are made up of smaller proteins containing a RGS-box domain flanked by short amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal extensions. These two families are distinguished by the presence of a polycysteine domain in the amino terminus of the RGSZ-like members (7Barker S.A. Wang J. Sierra D.A. Ross E.M. Genomics. 2001; 78: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Members of the mammalian R4/B subfamily include RGS1, RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, RGS5, RGS8, RGS16, RGS18, and RGS21. Each R4/B subfamily member contains a domain in its short amino terminus that may form an amphipathic α helix upon association with a lipid bilayer (10Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It is believed that this domain is important for proper plasma membrane association and function of mammalian RGS proteins (11Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Our laboratory studies RGS proteins as regulators of vascular function. Because RGS2 and RGS5 mRNAs are both highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, we set out to characterize the determinants that are important for their relative function. Preliminary data from our laboratory showed that RGS2 localizes to the plasma membrane more efficiently and behaves as a more potent inhibitor of muscarinic receptor-dependent Gαq-mediated signaling than RGS5. This observation was at odds with a recent report that showed that RGS2 and RGS5 were similarly effective as inhibitors of muscarinic receptors (14Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To help rationalize this discrepancy, we investigated the mechanisms regulating differential localization and function of the R4/B subfamily members. It is known that RGS2 localizes to the mammalian cell plasma membrane more efficiently than other R4/B subfamily members and also functions as a more potent inhibitor of muscarinic receptor Gαq signaling (15Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Tovey S.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of three previously reported membrane targeting mechanisms to its localization and receptor inhibition has not been determined. First, the amino terminus of RGS2 can bind to the third intracellular loop of the M1 muscarinic receptor, whereas other R4/B subfamily members cannot (17Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Second, RGS2 contains three unique residues in its RGS-box that confer Gαq selectivity (15Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) compared with other R4/B subfamily members. Third, the amino-terminal amphipathic helix of RGS2 is sufficient to confer lipid binding and plasma membrane localization in mammalian cells, whereas the same domain in RGS4 localizes evenly throughout the cell (13Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, this domain is necessary for increased recruitment of RGS2 to the plasma membrane by constitutively active Gαq, an effect that is not seen for any of the other R4/B subfamily members tested except RGS3 (18Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we exploited the functional differences between RGS2 and RGS5 to dissect the relative contribution of these molecular determinants to membrane targeting and M1 muscarinic receptor inhibition. The data show that unique hydrophobic residues adjacent to the core amphipathic α helix domain in RGS2 are necessary to mediate its tonic plasma membrane association and increased function relative to RGS5. Since changing these residues does not interfere with receptor or Gαq binding, and interfering with the anionic lipid composition on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane results in RGS2 dissociation, these data point to differences in steady state association with the lipid bilayer in mammalian cells as a key explanation for the functional difference between RGS2 and RGS5. Materials—The cytomegalovirus promoter of the pEYFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech/BD Biosciences) was used to drive expression of all RGS protein constructs used in this study. The polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (catalog number 632376) was also from Clontech/BD Biosciences. Fura-2/AM and all tissue culture media and transfection reagents were from Invitrogen. HEK293 cells stably expressing the M1 muscarinic receptor (M1-HEK) were a kind gift from P. Burgon and E. Peralta (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The green fluorescent protein-tagged Gq expression construct was a kind gift from C. Berlot (Weis Center for Research, Danville, PA). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—HEK cells were grown in maintenance medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. M1-HEK cells were grown as above with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin added to the medium. cDNA Constructs—All RGS protein cDNA constructs were prepared by PCR cloning using Pfu polymerase (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada). The indicated RGS protein chimeras were generated by PCR-mediated ligation of cDNA sequences encoding amino-terminal (RGS2, aa 3The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acids; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FR, fluorescence ratio; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. 1-71; RGS5, aa 1-51) and carboxyl-terminal (RGS2, aa 72-211; RGS5, aa 52-184) residues. All RGS proteins were made as carboxyl-terminal YFP fusions by insertion into unique NheI and AgeI restriction sites ahead of YFP in pEYFP-C1. Robust expression was ensured by inclusion of an optimized translation initiation signal (19Kozak M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in the context of the first methionine codon (“Kozak consensus,” GCCACCATGGCG). Point mutations were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada), and primer sequences are available upon request. All constructs were purified using the Endofree Maxi kit (Qiagen) and verified by sequencing of the complete protein-coding region. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis Assays—COS-7 cells (∼0.2 × 106 cells in 12-well plates) were transiently transfected with 250 ng of M1 muscarinic receptor and 250 ng of either control vector or RGS protein expression constructs. Inositol phosphate production was measured 48 h after transfection according to the method of Ventkatakrishnan and Exton (20Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼0.5 × 106 cells/well in a 12-well dish were labeled in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without inositol) containing 4 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 17-24 h, washed twice, and treated with 200 μm carbachol in the presence of 5 mm LiCl. Incubations were carried out for exactly 45 min before stopping them by media aspiration and the immediate addition of 750 μl of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid. The entire contents of the well were collected and spun at 13,000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant fraction (700 μl) was neutralized with 214 μl of 0.7 m NH4OH before proceeding to the ion exchange chromatography steps. For each well to be measured, a separate 3-ml Dowex resin (AG 1-X8, 200-400-mesh, formate form) column was prepared. The entire sample was added to the column, and unbound 3H-labeled material consisting of the total inositol-containing fraction was collected after the addition of 4 ml of water. Following a wash with 4 ml of 40 mm ammonium formate, the inositol phosphate-containing fraction was eluted into collection tubes with 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate. 0.5 ml of each sample from total inositol-containing and inositol phosphate-containing fractions was added to 10 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. Inositol phosphate levels were expressed as the fraction of the total soluble 3H-labeled inositol material (inositol phosphate + total inositol-containing fraction) for each sample. Intracellular Calcium Imaging—M1-HEK cells were seeded at 50% confluence on polylysine-coated #1 glass coverslips in 6-well plates prior to transfection with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection, coverslips were washed and incubated in calcium imaging buffer (11 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 17 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) containing 5 μm Fura-2/AM and 0.05% pluronic acid for 40 min at 37 °C. Fura-2-loaded cells were washed again and incubated for at least 10 min in calcium imaging buffer to allow hydrolysis of the acetoxymethyl ester. Coverslips were mounted in a TC1-SL25 open bath chamber (BioScience Tools, San Diego, CA) and imaged on an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope using a ×10 water-dipping objective. Excitation light was provided by a DeltaRam V monochrometer (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) Fluorescence imaging was performed with ImageMaster imaging software (PTI). Images were acquired with a Photometrics Cascade 512B cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). YFP-expressing cells were identified using 505 ± 3-nm excitation light in conjunction with a YFP filter set (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) and selected as regions of interest within the ImageMaster software. Relative YFP fluorescence (RGS expression) and Fura-2 ratiometric (intracellular calcium) was determined for each region of interest and was calculated as mean pixel fluorescence value following 50 and 100 ms of exposure, respectively. For Fura-2 imaging, alternating excitation wavelengths (355 ± 5/396 ± 5 nm) were provided at ∼1 excitation pair/s in conjunction with a 495-nm dichroic mirror and a 510 ± 20-nm emission filter (Chroma Technology Corp.), and paired images were collected after a 100-ms exposure. Fluorescent ratio values for the image pairs were determined for regions of interest previously selected on the basis of their YFP expression. Base-line fluorescence ratios (FRs) of nonstimulated cells were collected for 30 frames prior to the addition of 100 μm carbachol. The percentage increase from base-line FR levels to the peak stimulated FR was calculated only for cells with a relative YFP fluorescence of <12,000. Identical excitation/emission conditions and data collection parameters were maintained for all individual experiments performed in this study. For determination of absolute calcium levels, FR data were converted to intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) using a look-up table generated using a mixture of two Molecular Probes™ Ca2+ calibration kits (catalog numbers C3009 and C3722; Invitrogen) to a final [Mg2+] of 375 nm. Confocal Microscopy—Polylysine-coated 25-mm circular #1 glass coverslips containing transfected cells were mounted in a modified Leyden chamber containing calcium imaging buffer. Confocal microscopy was performed on live cells at 37 °C using an Olympus FluoView 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images represent single planes on the basal side of the cell obtained with a ×60 oil objective. Confocal images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Measurement of RGS Protein Binding to M1 Muscarinic Receptor Third Intracellular Loop—HEK293T cells at 80% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine (40 ml of Lipofectamine to 8 ml of total plasmid DNA). 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini mixture; Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Total cell lysates were then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. The RGS pull-down assay using recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged M1 muscarinic receptor third intracellular loop protein (GST-M1i3) was performed as we previously described (17Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were mixed with GST-M1i3 prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 ml) and incubated by rotating at 4 °C overnight. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice in harvest buffer, the second time in the absence of Triton X-100. Protein was eluted from the beads by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Both load and bound RGS proteins were detected by subsequent immunoblotting for YFP as described above. Fluorescent Labeling of RGS2 Proteins—Recombinant histidine-tagged wild type and mutant RGS2 proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described (21Heximer S.P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) before dialysis in storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). RGS2 proteins in storage buffer were fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 532 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) at a 3:1 fluorophore/protein ratio. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h and then quenched with a 10-fold excess of glycine for 15 min. Excess fluorophore was removed by filtration through a Sephadex G25 spin column. Biotinylation of Gαq—Purified Gαqβγ was chemically biotinylated using biotinamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) at a 5:1 biotin/Gαqβγ ratio for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with a 10-fold excess of glycine for 15 min at room temperature. Gαqβγ was then activated by a 10-fold dilution into activation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm (GDP, 30 mm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm CHAPS) and allowed to incubate for 20 min at room temperature. AMF (50 mm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF)-activated Gαqβγ was then loaded onto a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. Biotinylated-Gαq was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm GDP, 30 mm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF, and 20 mm imidazole). Flow Cytometry Protein Interaction Assay—Equilibrium binding for AF532-RGS2 proteins and biotin-Gαq was determined using the flow cytometry protein interaction assay method, as described previously (22Roman D.L. Talbot J.N. Roof R.A. Sunahara R.K. Traynor J.R. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, Luminex LumAvidin beads were washed with bead-coupling buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 30 min in the dark with biotin-Gαq ata5nm final concentration. Beads were then washed with a flow buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and AMF was added for AMF-activated biotin-Gαq samples. Fluorescently labeled RGS2 proteins were diluted into flow buffer (with or without AMF) and were dispensed into a 96-well plate according to their concentration. 50 ml of biotin-Gαq (with or without AMF)-labeled beads were dispensed into each well and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for at least 30 min in the dark. The plate was then read on a Luminex 100IS 96-well plate-reading flow cytometer. Median fluorescence intensity values, measured in each experiment as duplicates, were plotted against the RGS2 concentration and fit to a single binding hyperbola (MFI = Bmax × [AF532-RGS2]/(Kd × [AF532-RGS2]) using GraphPad Prism 4. Statistical Analysis—For calcium imaging studies, shown are the averages of >50 cells on one experimental day that is representative of at least three independent experiments carried out on separate days. Confocal microscopy pictures show representative images from at least 50 cells. One-way analysis of variance was used to indicate statistical differences between the multiple groups studied in each experiment. Pairwise comparisons between groups were made using the unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was deemed significant. RGS2 Is a More Potent Inhibitor of M1 Muscarinic Receptor-mediated Phosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis Compared with RGS5—Data from several groups, including our own, have shown that RGS2 is a more potent inhibitor of Gαq-coupled muscarinic receptor signaling than other members of the R4/B subfamily of RGS proteins. Anger et al. (14Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, reported that RGS5 inhibited Gαq-dependent muscarinic receptor-coupled signaling with similar efficiency to that of RGS2. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we compared the ability of RGS2 and RGS5 to inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Carbachol-mediated increases in inositol phosphate accumulation were measured in COS-7 cells cotransfected with M1 muscarinic receptor and either control vector (pEYFP-C1), RGS2-YFP, or RGS5-YFP (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting confirmed that these constructs were expressed in similar amounts as single protein bands of the expected size (Fig. 1A, inset). At odds with the report of Anger et al. (14Anger T. Zhang W. Mende U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), RGS2 was found to be a more potent inhibitor of M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated inositol phosphate accumulation in this system. RGS2 Is a More Potent Inhibitor of M1 Muscarinic Receptor-mediated Intracellular Calcium Signaling Compared with RGS5—We next used intracellular calcium measurements to determine whether RGS2 and RGS5 were also different in their ability to regulate rapid physiologic responses (Fig. 1, B and C). pEYFP control plasmid or a RGS-YFP fusion construct was transfected into HEK293 cells containing stably expressed M1 muscarinic receptor. Fura-2-loaded cells were stimulated with carbachol, and intracellular calcium was measured using microscopy with ratiometric imaging software. RGS function is measured in single cells, preselected on the basis of their RGS-YFP expression levels, to afford a means for standardizing RGS function with protein expression in individual cells. Cells expressing low to intermediate levels (3500 < relative YFP fluorescence < 12,000) of YFP fluorescence were selected for study. This YFP expression range corresponded to RGS5 protein expression levels that are on the linear portion of its expression versus function curve (data not shown). In 13 separate experiments, the intracellular calcium data for >750 individual YFP-expressing (control) cells showed resting and peak carbachol-stimulated intracellular [Ca2+] of 105 ± 2 and 274 ± 12 nm, respectively. Fig. 1B shows the typical kinetic response following the addition of carbachol to YFP-, RGS2-YFP-, and RGS5-YFP-expressing cells (n > 50). Notably, the Fura-2 ratio response is reproducibly blunted in RGS2-expressing compared with YFP-expressing cells (55 ± 3%), whereas RGS5 typically showed much lower levels of inhibition (21 ± 2%). Fig. 1C shows the average percentage increase from base line of the fluorescent ratios for the traces in Fig. 1B. When all 13 experiments were analyzed in this manner, peak stimulated ratio increases were significantly lower for RGS2-YFP and RGS5-YFP compared with YFP controls in 13 of 13 experiments and 11 of 13 experiments, respectively. Moreover, peak stimulated Fura-2 ratios were significantly lower for RGS2-YFP compared with RGS5-YFP in 12 of 13 experiments. Taken together, these data indicate that RGS2 is more effective than RGS5 as an inhibitor of rapid intracellular calcium responses to M1 muscarinic receptor activation. Plasma Membrane Targeting Is a More Important Functional Determinant than Intrinsic RGS-box Function—Previous data from our laboratory showed that RGS2 contained three unique amino acid residues in its RGS-box domain that mediate its selective inhibition of Gαq-versus Gαi-mediated signaling (15Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gαq selectivity could explain the enhanced relative function of RGS2, we compared the ability of the RGS-box domains of RGS2 and RGS5 to act as inhibitors of M1 muscarinic receptor signaling. YFP fusions of the carboxyl-terminal RGS-box domains or RGS-box domains tagged with the K-Ras plasma membrane targeting sequence (CAAX motif) were constructed according to the schematic in Fig. 2A. Immunoblotting for YFP confirmed that all of the constructs expressed as protein bands of the expected sizes (Fig. 2B). Confocal microscopy was used to follow the localization of these clones in HEK cells (Fig. 2C). RGS2 localized to the nucleus and plasma membrane, whereas RGS5 was distributed uniformly through the cell. Notably, RGS2 stably associated with the plasma membrane under normal culture conditions (no carbachol) and after treatment with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (supplemental materials). Moreover, the stable RGS2 association with the plasma membrane was not decreased by serum starvation or increased by agonist addition. In dramatic contrast, RGS5 did not stably associate with the plasma membrane under any of the experimental conditions tested. We used the isolated RGS-box domains to study the relative functional contribution of membrane association and intrinsic RGS-box function for RGS2 and RGS5. The carboxyl-terminal RGS-box domains of RGS2 and RGS5 showed no measurable activity in two of three and one of three experiments, respectively. In cases where RGS-box activity of RGS5 could be detected compared with no RGS controls, its function was similar to that of full-length RGS5. By contrast, the function of the RGS-box of RGS2 was markedly impaired relative to the full-length protein (Fig. 3A). Moreover, appending a carboxyl-terminal prenylation (CAAX-box) membrane-targeting sequence increased the inhibitory function of the RGS-box domains for both RGS2 and RGS5 to levels similar to that of the wild type RGS2 (Fig. 3B). These data argue strongly against a role for differences in the RGS-box domains as the main functional difference between RGS2 and RGS5. Instead, these studies suggested that promoting constitutive plasma membrane association of the RGS-box domain of RGS2 and RGS5 is a critical determinant of their function as inhibitors of M1 muscarinic receptor signaling.

NKCC2 surface expression is subject to regulation by intracellular protein trafficking. However, the protein partners involved in the intracellular trafficking of NKCC2 remain unknown. Moreover, studies aimed at under-standing the post-translational regulation of NKCC2 have been hampered by the difficulty to express NKCC2 protein in mammalian cells. Here we were able to express NKCC2 protein in renal epithelial cells by tagging its N-terminal domain. To gain insights into the regulation of NKCC2 trafficking, we screened for interaction partners of NKCC2 with the yeast two-hybrid system, using the C-terminal tail of NKCC2 as bait. Aldolase B was identified as a dominant and novel interacting protein. Real time PCR on renal microdissected tubules demonstrated the expression of aldolase B in the thick ascending limb. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunolocalization experiments confirmed NKCC2-aldolase interaction in renal cells. Biotinylation assays showed that aldolase co-expression reduces NKCC2 surface expression. In the presence of aldolase substrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, aldolase binding was disrupted, and aldolase co-expression had no further effect on the cell surface level of NKCC2. Finally, functional studies demonstrated that aldolase-induced down-regulation of NKCC2 at the plasma membrane was associated with a decrease in its transport activity. In summary, we identified aldolase B as a novel NKCC2 binding partner that plays a key role in the modulation of NKCC2 surface expression, thereby revealing a new regulatory mechanism governing the co-transporter intracellular trafficking. Furthermore, NKCC2 protein expression in mammalian cells and its regulation by protein-protein interactions, described here, may open new and important avenues in studying the cell biology and post-transcriptional regulation of the co-transporter.

Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In polarized tissues, cation-Cl co-transport is involved in net transepithelial salt movement. They can be divided into sodium-dependent transporters, such as Na-K-2Cl co-transporters and the NaCl co-transporter and Na+-independent KCl co-transporters. All of the CCCs exhibit similar hydropathy profiles with 12 transmembrane spanning domains, an N terminus of variable length, and a long cytoplasmic C terminus (2Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC) protein are currently known (3Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NKCC1, the basolateral isoform, is by far the most widely distributed (4Xu J.C.

By contrast, NKCC2 is exclusively targeted to the apical cell surface and is exclusively found in the kidney (4Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz Jr., E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 40-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Apical sodium entry in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is mediated by NKCC2. Mutations of NKCC2 have been linked to some forms of Bartter syndrome, a severe human genetic disease involving NaCl wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis with hypercalciuria (7Simon D.B. Lifton R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F961-F966PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kurtz C.L. Karolyi L. Seyberth H.W. Koch M.C. Vargas R. Feldmann D. Vollmer M. Knoers N.V. Madrigal G. Guay-Woodford L.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1706-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunolocalization experiments revealed that NKCC2 is expressed not only at the cell surface but also in a population of subapical vesicles raising the hypothesis that intracellular trafficking may regulate NKCC2 membrane expression (9Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, vasopressin (AVP) induces the shuttling of these vesicles to the cell membrane leading to an increase in apical NKCC2 protein expression and activity (10Gimenez I. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26946-26951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Likewise, recent reports showed that cAMP increases surface expression of NKCC2 in rat thick ascending limbs (11Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F608-F616Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Intracellular regulation of protein trafficking generally involves protein-protein interactions. Such mechanisms have been reported for the basolateral isoform, NKCC1. Proteins that bind to NKCC1 include SPAK and OSR1, PP1, PP2A, CIP, and Hsp90 (12Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J.

The identification of several NKCC1-binding proteins supported further the view that regulation of NKCC2 might also involve a network of protein-protein interactions. In contrast to NKCC1, little is known about the protein partners of NKCC2. More specifically, the protein partners involved in the intracellular trafficking of NKCC2 remain unknown. Furthermore, previous attempts failed to express NKCC2 proteins in mammalian cells, and as a consequence, little is known about the post-translational regulations of the co-transporter. In this study, we report that we were able to address this issue by N-terminally tagging NKCC2 protein. In addition, to identify potential interacting partners of NKCC2, we screened a kidney cDNA expression library by the yeast two-hybrid assay using NKCC2 C terminus as bait. Among the positive identified clones, several matched the sequence of aldolase B. Aldolase B is a glycolytic enzyme that has specialized functions in fructose metabolism and gluconeogenesis (18Yanez A.J. Ludwig H.C. Bertinat R. Spichiger C. Gatica R. Berlien G. Leon O. Brito M.

However, several studies reported that besides its principal role in the carbohydrate metabolism, aldolase could also exert other functions in the cell (20Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovadi J. Mol.

In this study, we demonstrate that the proximal C-terminal domain of NKCC2 can specifically associate with aldolase B and that this interaction might play a crucial role in the control of apical NKCC2 expression in the kidney. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Penicillin and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Subclonings were carried out with the following vectors: 1) pGKT7 (Clontech), which contains the binding domain DNA of GAL4, a multiple cloning site (MCS), and a kanamycin resistance gene (KANAr); 2) pCMV-Myc (Clontech), which contains epitope c-Myc, an MCS, and an ampicillin resistance gene (AMPr); 3) pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen), which contains epitope V5, an MCS, and an AMPr resistance gene; 4) pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) which contains green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, an MCS, and a KANAr resistance gene. Mouse kidney thick ascending limb (MKTAL) cells (28Bourgeois S. Rossignol P. Grelac F. Chalumeau C. Klein C. Laghmani K. Chambrey R. Bruneval P. Duong J.P. Poggioli J. Houillier P. Paillard M.

OKP (a clonal of opossum kidney cell line) cells, kindly provided by Prof. R. Alpern (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) were passaged in high glucose (450 mg/dl) Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For DNA transfection, cells were grown to 60-70% confluence and then were transiently transfected for 6 h with plasmids using the Lipofectamine plus kit according to the manufacturerŉs instructions (Invitrogen) and grown to 100% confluence. Cells for control and experimental groups are always derived from the same flask and passage and were studied on the same day. Cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (0.4 m NaCl; 0.5 mm EGTA; 1.5 mm MgCl2;10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 5% (v/v) glycerol; 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the antibody of interest followed by affinity purification using protein G-agarose beads (Dynal). The antibodies used in this study were the following: mouse anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies (Clontech), mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), and goat anti-aldolase antibody (Euromedex). After incubation with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature, the immunocomplex was washed three times in PBS (Invitrogen). The protein samples were boiled in loading buffer, run on gradient 6-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, probed with primary antibodies of interest and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, according to standard procedures. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturerŉs instructions. Cultures to be immunostained were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, incubated for 5 min with 50 mm NH4Cl, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and incubated with DAKO (antibody diluent with background-reducing components; DAKO, Carpinteria) for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out using the antibodies of interest. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in DAKO. Treatment with the anti-V5 antibody was followed by the addition of a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Anti-aldolase and anti-Myc antibodies were visualized with a biotinylated anti-goat IgG antibody and Cy3-labeled streptavidin (red) and Cy2-labeled anti-mouse (green) IgG antibodies, respectively. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were transfected with a full-length NKCC2 tagged with Myc and/or aldolase B tagged with V5. After 48 h cells were placed on ice and rinsed twice with a cold rinsing solution containing PBS, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. Cells were then gently agitated at 4 °C for 1 h in borate buffer, pH 9, containing 1 mg/ml NHS-biotin. They were rinsed three times in quenching solution (rinsing solution with 100 mm glycine added) and agitated at 4 °C in quenching solution for 20 min. Then they were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, and cells were lysed for 45 min at 4 °C in solubilizing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm KCl, 120 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete 1697498, Roche Diagnostics). Samples were harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the lysate were normalized to 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were taken for total lysate fraction, and the rest of aliquots were incubated in avidin beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant (the intracellular fraction) was removed. Avidin beads were then washed with solubilizing buffer and then centrifuged for 7 min at 16,000 rpm seven times. Pellets were incubated in solubilizing buffer and denaturating buffer for 10 min at 95 °C and stored at -20 °C. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to mutate the two predicted glycosylations sites, Asn-442 and Asn-452 to glutamine, using the custom-made (MWG Biotec) oligonucleotides 5′-gatgccactggcagcatgcaagacaccatcgtttc-3′ and 5′-atgaattgccaaggctctgcggcctg-3′, respectively. The latter primer was used to create double mutants (N442Q,N452Q). All mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing. Construction of the GAL4 BD:Bait Gene Fusion—The cDNA fragment containing the first 108 AA of NKCC2 C-terminal tail region (named NKCC2 C1-term) was amplified by high fidelity PCR using the following primers: 5′-ccggaattcgacaacgctctggaattaac-3′ (sense) and 5′-cgcgtcgaccattctccccaagcctga-3′ (reverse). After restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI and SalI, the cDNA fragment was cloned into pGBKT7 vector carrying the TRP1 selection marker. DNA sequencing confirmed that the cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain of NKCC2 (bait) was in-frame with GAL4 BD. Testing the BD-NKCC2-C1-terminal Plasmid for Transcriptional Activation—To check for autoactivation of reporter gene promoters, the yeast reporter strain AH109 was transformed with the BD-NKCC2C1-terminal plasmid. The AH109 reporter contains three reporter genes, ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ, under the control of distinct upstream activating sequences and TATA boxes. These promoters yield strong and specific interaction to GAL4. Yeast cells were grown in YPDA medium (Clontech) complemented with 0.003% adenine hemisulfate. For transformation, a YPDA culture from AH109 (50 ml) grown to an A600 of ∼1 (18 h) was centrifuged at 1200 × g for 3 min, washed with 50 ml of distilled H2O, and resuspended in 1 ml of distilled H2O. Aliquots of 50 μl were treated with 240 μl of polyethylene glycol (50% w/v), 36 μl of 1 m LiAc, 25 μl of single-stranded DNA (2.0 mg/ml), 50 μl of distilled H2O, and 1 μg of plasmid. Transformed cells were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking the amino acids tryptophan, histidine, and/or adenine. The results indicated that the BD-NKCC2-C1-terminal construct did not autoactivate the reporter genes because no growth was observed. Library Screening—The GAL4 AD:cDNA library constructed in the yeast plasmid pACT2 from human kidney was purchased from Clontech. The cDNA library was already pretransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae host strain Y187. The cDNA library plasmid pACT2 contains the ampicillin gene for selection in Escherichia coli and a leucine marker for selection in the yeast host. Pretransformed libraries are screened by mating. AH109 transformed with NKCC2-C1term-BD plasmid was inoculated into 50 ml of SD lacking Trp and incubated at 30 °C overnight (18 h) with shaking at 250-270 rpm. After growing to an A600 of ∼1.5, the yeast culture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in the residual liquid (∼5 ml) by vortexing. For mating, the entire AH109 culture was combined with a 1-ml aliquot of the pretransformed library culture in a 2-liter sterile flask. After adding 45 ml of 2× YPDA/kanamycin medium, cells were incubated at 30 °C over-night with gentle swirling (30-50 rpm). After 20 h of mating, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.5× YPDA/kanamycin medium, plated selection medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, and incubated at 30 °C. The plates were checked for colonies after 4 days of incubation at 30 °C, and positive colonies were transferred to high stringency selection medium plates lacking Ade, His, Leu, and Trp and incubated at 30 °C for 2-3 days. Ade+, His+, Leu+, Trp+ transformant colonies were then rescreened by colony-lift assay for LacZ activity, and colonies that activated all of the reporter genes in the AH109 stain were further analyzed. Isolation and Sequence Analyses of Positive AD:cDNA Clones—AD:cDNA plasmids encoding the putative interacting proteins were isolated from yeast cells using an RPM yeast plasmid isolation kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Prey plasmids were rescued by transformation into DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen) and isolated using a kit from Qiagen. Insert sizes were checked by BglII digestion. cDNA plasmids were then sequenced and assessed using the BLAST program. Experiments were carried out on male C57BL/6J mice (8-10 week old; Charles Rivers Breeding Laboratories). Mice had free access to food (semi-synthetic diet; SAFE, Epinay, France) and were allowed to drink water ad libitum. After pentobarbital anesthesia (140 mg/g body weight, intraperitoneally), the left kidney was quickly perfused through the abdominal aorta with 5 ml of Hanks' modified microdissection solution and then with the same solution supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) collagenase (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The kidney was sliced along the cortico-papillary axis in small pieces, which were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in collagenase-containing (0.15% (w/v) microdissection solution. After rinsing, medullary and cortical thick ascending limbs were dissected at 4 °C under stereomicroscopic observation and were identified by morphological and topographical criteria as described previously (29Doucet A. Katz A.I. Morel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: F105-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted from pools of nephron segments (2-3 cm length) by using a microadaptation of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi, and reverse-transcribed using the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturerŉs protocol using random hexamers. Real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) with the DyNAmo™ CapillarySYBR Green quantitative PCR kit (Ozyme) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol, except that the final reaction volume was reduced to 8 ml. Each reaction was performed on the equivalent of 0.25 mm of microdissected MTAL. Primers used were chosen from the published mouse aldolase B, NKCC2, and carbonic anhydrase XIV cDNA sequences and were designed using LightCycler Probe Design (Roche Diagnostics) software. The sequences of the used primers were 5′-ctgaaattgcccagcg-3′ (sense) and 5′-agagggtctcgtggaa-3′ (reverse) for aldolase B, 5′-gagattggcgtggtcatagtcagaa-3′ (sense) and 5′-tgctgctgatgttgccgtcttt-3′ (reverse) for NKCC2, and 5′-gaagggacatacggagagggcag-3′ (sense) and 5′-gaagggacatacggagagggcag-3′ (reverse) for carbonic anhydrase XIV. Samples were submitted to 45 cycles of three temperatures steps as follows: 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 13 s. In the experiment, a standardization curve was made using serial dilutions (1 to 1:500) of a cDNA stock solution from total kidney. Total RNA extraction from MTAL and MKTAL cells was carried out with the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript II RT with random primers incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 75 °C for 15 min. A negative RT-PCR was performed with H2O as a replacement of superscript II. For PCR, 2 μl of the cDNA solution was supplemented with 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 1 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 μl of a 10 mm dNTP solution, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl. The sequence of the used primers to amplify full-length mouse aldolase B and NKCC2 cDNAs were 5′-gaggactcttcccctttgct-3′ (sense) and 5′-ataggtgtaggaggctgtga-3′ (reverse) for aldolase, and 5′-atgtcggtcagcatcccttcc-3′ (sense) and 5′-ttaagagtaaaatgttaagac-3′ (reverse) for NKCC2 (30Mount D.B. Baekgaard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. Final extension was for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were size fractionated on 1-2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Measurement of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was accomplished in cells grown to confluence on coverslips using the intracellularly trapped pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. pHi was estimated from the ratio of fluorescence with excitation wavelengths of 495 and 450 nm and emission wavelength 530 nm (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France). Calibration of the 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein excitation ratio was accomplished using the nigericin technique. Na-K-2Cl co-transport activity was measured as bumetanide-sensitive NH4 influx, as described previously (31Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Amlal H. Legoff C. Vernimmen C. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C455-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were first bathed at 37 °C in a CO2-free Hepes/Tris-buffered medium containing (in mm) 135 NaCl, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.8 KH2PO4, 0.2 K2HOP4, 1 CaCl2, and 10 BaCl2, to measure base-line pHi. 20 mm NH4Cl was then added to the medium (isosmotically replacing NaCl). After NH4Cl addition, a very rapid initial cellular alkalinization (ΔpHi) occurred because of immediate NH3 entry, which stopped when intracellular, and extracellular [NH3] became equal (NH3 equilibrium). The initial alkalinization was then followed by a pHi recovery (dpHi/dt). The ΔpHi caused by NH4Cl addition was used to calculate the cell buffer capacity (βi) as described previously (33Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). Transfecting OKP cells with myc-NKCC2 in the presence or the absence of aldolase-V5 had no effect neither on base-line pHi nor on the magnitude of the initial alkalinization when compared with mock-transfected cells. Consequently, βi was not different between the three groups. The mean values of βi (H+/liter/pH unit) were 29.32 ± 2.7 (n = 3) in mock-transfected cells, 31.11 ± 2.5 (n = 5) in OKP cells expressing myc-NKCC2, and 32.33 ± 2.4 (n = 5) in cells co-transfected with myc-NKCC2 and aldolase-V5 constructs. Therefore, Na-K-2Cl co-transporter activity is expressed as dpHi/dt. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were evaluated using paired or unpaired t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NKCC2 Expression in Mammalian Cells—To date, no one has been able to express NKCC2 protein in mammalian cells. Indeed, several attempts failed to stably express the co-transporter in transfected mammalian cells such as COS (SV40-transformed simian cell line), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), NIH 3T3 (mouse NIH/Swiss embryo fibroblast line), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (34Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 35Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol.

Interestingly, it has been shown previously that position- and sequence-specific tagging is crucial to generate a stable protein expression in cell culture (37Mikalsen T. Johannessen M. Moens U. Int.

Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most importantly, it has been reported that the degradation of several proteins can be blocked following fusion of the Myc tag to their N terminus (37Mikalsen T. Johannessen M. Moens U. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 2513-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hence, we anticipated that we could successfully express NKCC2 protein by tagging its N-terminal domain with Myc. Therefore, full-length mouse NKCC2 cDNA was cloned into pCMV-expression vector downstream of the c-Myc tag and used for transient transfection in either OKP or MKTAL cells, two models of previously characterized renal epithelial cell lines (28Bourgeois S.

https://openalex.org/W2068135227,"Analyses of the dynamics of diseases in wild populations typically assume all individuals to be identical. However, profound effects on the long-term impact on the host population can be expected if the disease has age and sex dependent dynamics. The Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) caused two mass mortalities in European harbour seals in 1988 and in 2002. We show the mortality patterns were highly age specific on both occasions, where young of the year and adult (>4 yrs) animals suffered extremely high mortality, and sub-adult seals (1-3 yrs) of both sexes experienced low mortality. Consequently, genetic differences cannot have played a main role explaining why some seals survived and some did not in the study region, since parents had higher mortality levels than their progeny. Furthermore, there was a conspicuous absence of animals older than 14 years among the victims in 2002, which strongly indicates that the survivors from the previous disease outbreak in 1988 had acquired and maintained immunity to PDV. These specific mortality patterns imply that contact rates and susceptibility to the disease are strongly age and sex dependent variables, underlining the need for structured epidemic models for wildlife diseases. Detailed data can thus provide crucial information about a number of vital parameters such as functional herd immunity. One of many future challenges in understanding the epidemiology of the PDV and other wildlife diseases is to reveal how immune system responses differ among animals in different stages during their life cycle. The influence of such underlying mechanisms may also explain the limited evidence for abrupt disease thresholds in wild populations."
https://openalex.org/W2165951075,"Prions have been documented in extra-neuronal and extra-lymphatic tissues of humans and various ruminants affected by Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE). The presence of prion infectivity detected in cervid and ovine blood tempted us to reason that kidney, the organ filtrating blood derived proteins, may accumulate disease associated PrP(Sc). We collected and screened kidneys of experimentally, naturally scrapie-affected and control sheep for renal deposition of PrP(Sc) from distinct, geographically separated flocks. By performing Western blot, PET blot analysis and immunohistochemistry we found intraepithelial (cortex, medulla and papilla) and occasional interstitial (papilla) deposition of PrP(Sc )in kidneys of scrapie-affected sheep. Interestingly, glomerula lacked detectable signals indicative of PrP(Sc). PrP(Sc) was also detected in kidneys of subclinical sheep, but to significantly lower degree. Depending on the stage of the disease the incidence of PrP(Sc) in kidney varied from approximately 27% (subclinical) to 73.6% (clinical) in naturally scrapie-affected sheep. Kidneys from flocks without scrapie outbreak were devoid of PrP(Sc). Here we demonstrate unexpectedly frequent deposition of high levels of PrP(Sc) in ovine kidneys of various flocks. Renal deposition of PrP(Sc) is likely to be a pre-requisite enabling prionuria, a possible co-factor of horizontal prion-transmission in sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2025131311,"Background Hedgehog signalling, interpreted in receiving cells by Gli transcription factors, plays a central role in the development of vertebrate and Drosophila embryos. Many aspects of the signalling pathway are conserved between these lineages, however vertebrates have diverged in at least one key aspect: they have evolved multiple Gli genes encoding functionally-distinct proteins, increasing the complexity of the hedgehog-dependent transcriptional response. Amphioxus is one of the closest living relatives of the vertebrates, having split from the vertebrate lineage prior to the widespread gene duplication prominent in early vertebrate evolution. Principal Findings We show that amphioxus has a single Gli gene, which is deployed in tissues adjacent to sources of hedgehog signalling derived from the midline and anterior endoderm. This shows the duplication and divergence of the Gli gene family, and hence the origin of vertebrate Gli functional diversity, was specific to the vertebrate lineage. However we also show that the single amphioxus Gli gene produces two distinct transcripts encoding different proteins. We utilise three tests of Gli function to examine the transcription regulatory capacities of these different proteins, demonstrating one has activating activity similar to Gli2, while the other acts as a weak repressor, similar to Gli3. Conclusions These data show that vertebrates and amphioxus have evolved functionally-similar repertoires of Gli proteins using parallel molecular routes; vertebrates via gene duplication and divergence, and amphioxus via alternate splicing of a single gene. Our results demonstrate that similar functional complexity of intercellular signalling can be achieved via different evolutionary pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2002016462,"Gp91(phox) is a transmembrane protein and the catalytic core of the NADPH oxidase complex of neutrophils. Lack of this protein causes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe and recurrent infections due to the incapacity of phagocytes to kill microorganisms.Here we optimize a prokaryotic cell-free expression system to produce integral mammalian membrane proteins.Using this system, we over-express truncated forms of the gp91(phox) protein under soluble form in the presence of detergents or lipids resulting in active proteins with a ""native-like"" conformation. All the proteins exhibit diaphorase activity in the presence of cytosolic factors (p67(phox), p47(phox), p40(phox) and Rac) and arachidonic acid. We also produce proteoliposomes containing gp91(phox) protein and demonstrate that these proteins exhibit activities similar to their cellular counterpart. The proteoliposomes induce rapid cellular delivery and relocation of recombinant gp91(phox) proteins to the plasma membrane. Our data support the concept of cell-free expression technology for producing recombinant proteoliposomes and their use for functional and structural studies or protein therapy by complementing deficient cells in gp91(phox) protein."
https://openalex.org/W1997437545,"One of the main obstacles to understanding complex biological systems is the extent and rapid evolution of information, way beyond the capacity individuals to manage and comprehend. Current modeling approaches and tools lack adequate capacity to model concurrently structure and behavior of biological systems. Here we propose Object-Process Methodology (OPM), a holistic conceptual modeling paradigm, as a means to model both diagrammatically and textually biological systems formally and intuitively at any desired number of levels of detail. OPM combines objects, e.g., proteins, and processes, e.g., transcription, in a way that is simple and easily comprehensible to researchers and scholars. As a case in point, we modeled the yeast mRNA lifecycle. The mRNA lifecycle involves mRNA synthesis in the nucleus, mRNA transport to the cytoplasm, and its subsequent translation and degradation therein. Recent studies have identified specific cytoplasmic foci, termed processing bodies that contain large complexes of mRNAs and decay factors. Our OPM model of this cellular subsystem, presented here, led to the discovery of a new constituent of these complexes, the translation termination factor eRF3. Association of eRF3 with processing bodies is observed after a long-term starvation period. We suggest that OPM can eventually serve as a comprehensive evolvable model of the entire living cell system. The model would serve as a research and communication platform, highlighting unknown and uncertain aspects that can be addressed empirically and updated consequently while maintaining consistency."
https://openalex.org/W1976732233,"Protective immunity against blood infections of malaria is partly specific to the genotype, or strain, of the parasites. The target antigens of Strain Specific Protective Immunity are expected, therefore, to be antigenically and genetically distinct in different lines of parasite. Here we describe the use of a genetic approach, Linkage Group Selection, to locate the target(s) of Strain Specific Protective Immunity in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi. In a previous such analysis using the progeny of a genetic cross between P. c. chabaudi lines AS-pyr1 and CB, a location on P. c. chabaudi chromosome 8 containing the gene for merozoite surface protein-1, a known candidate antigen for Strain Specific Protective Immunity, was strongly selected. P. c. chabaudi apical membrane antigen-1, another candidate for Strain Specific Protective Immunity, could not have been evaluated in this cross as AS-pyr1 and CB are identical within the cell surface domain of this protein. Here we use Linkage Group Selection analysis of Strain Specific Protective Immunity in a cross between P. c. chabaudi lines CB-pyr10 and AJ, in which merozoite surface protein-1 and apical membrane antigen-1 are both genetically distinct. In this analysis strain specific immune selection acted strongly on the region of P. c. chabaudi chromosome 8 encoding merozoite surface protein-1 and, less strongly, on the P. c. chabaudi chromosome 9 region encoding apical membrane antigen-1. The evidence from these two independent studies indicates that Strain Specific Protective Immunity in P. c. chabaudi in mice is mainly determined by a narrow region of the P. c. chabaudi genome containing the gene for the P. c. chabaudi merozoite surface protein-1 protein. Other regions, including that containing the gene for P. c. chabaudi apical membrane antigen-1, may be more weakly associated with Strain Specific Protective Immunity in these parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2054122030,"Patient-ventilator synchrony is a major concern in critical care and is influenced by phasic lung-volume feedback control of the respiratory rhythm. Routine clinical application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) introduces a tonic input which, if unopposed, might disrupt respiratory-ventilator entrainment through sustained activation of the vagally-mediated Hering-Breuer reflex. We suggest that this potential adverse effect may be averted by two differentiator forms of nonassociative learning (habituation and desensitization) of the Hering-Breuer reflex via pontomedullary pathways.We tested these hypotheses in 17 urethane-anesthetized adult Sprague-Dawley rats under controlled mechanical ventilation. Without PEEP, phrenic discharge was entrained 1:1 to the ventilator rhythm. Application of PEEP momentarily dampened the entrainment to higher ratios but this effect was gradually adapted by nonassociative learning. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the pneumotaxic center weakened the adaptation to PEEP, whereas sustained stimulation of the pneumotaxic center weakened the entrainment independent of PEEP. In all cases, entrainment was abolished after vagotomy.Our results demonstrate an important functional role for pneumotaxic desensitization and extra-pontine habituation of the Hering-Breuer reflex elicited by lung inflation: acting as buffers or high-pass filters against tonic vagal volume input, these differentiator forms of nonassociative learning help to restore respiratory-ventilator entrainment in the face of PEEP. Such central sites-specific habituation and desensitization of the Hering-Breuer reflex provide a useful experimental model of nonassociative learning in mammals that is of particular significance in understanding respiratory rhythmogenesis and coupled-oscillator entrainment mechanisms, and in the clinical management of mechanical ventilation in respiratory failure."
https://openalex.org/W2091770381,"RecA family proteins engage in an ATP-dependent DNA strand exchange reaction that includes a ssDNA nucleoprotein helical filament and a homologous dsDNA sequence. In spite of more than 20 years of efforts, the molecular mechanism of homology pairing and strand exchange is still not fully understood. Here we report a crystal structure of Sulfolobus solfataricus RadA overwound right-handed filament with three monomers per helical pitch. This structure reveals conformational details of the first ssDNA binding disordered loop (denoted L1 motif) and the dsDNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD). L1 and NTD together form an outwardly open palm structure on the outer surface of the helical filament. Inside this palm structure, five conserved basic amino acid residues (K27, K60, R117, R223 and R229) surround a 25 A pocket that is wide enough to accommodate anionic ssDNA, dsDNA or both. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that these five positively charged residues are essential for DNA binding and for RadA-catalyzed D-loop formation. We suggest that the overwound right-handed RadA filament represents a functional conformation in the homology search and pairing reaction. A new structural model is proposed for the homologous interactions between a RadA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and its dsDNA target."
https://openalex.org/W2048535337,"Shape encoding mechanisms can be probed by the sequential brief display of dots that mark the boundary of the shape, and delays of less that a millisecond between successive dots can impair recognition. It is not entirely clear whether this is accomplished by preserving stimulus timing in the signal being sent to the brain, or calls for a retinal binding mechanism. Two experiments manipulated the degree of simultaneity among and within dot pairs, requiring also that the pair members be in the same half of the visual field or on opposite halves, i.e., across the midline from one another. Recognition performance was impaired the same for these two conditions. The results make it likely that simultaneity of cues is being registered within the retina. A potential mechanism is suggested, calling for linkage of stimulated sites through activation of PA1 cells. A third experiment confirmed a prior finding that the overall level of recognition deficit is partly a function of display-set size, and affirmed submillisecond resolution in binding dot pairs into effective shape-recognition cues."
