https://openalex.org/W2899158916,"Globally, environmental disasters impact billions of people and cost trillions of dollars in damage, and their impacts are often felt most acutely by minority and poor communities. Wildfires in the U.S. have similarly outsized impacts on vulnerable communities, though the ethnic and geographic distribution of those communities may be different than for other hazards. Here, we develop a social-ecological approach for characterizing fire vulnerability and apply it to >70,000 census tracts across the United States. Our approach incorporates both the wildfire potential of a landscape and socioeconomic attributes of overlying communities. We find that over 29 million Americans live with significant potential for extreme wildfires, a majority of whom are white and socioeconomically secure. Within this segment, however, are 12 million socially vulnerable Americans for whom a wildfire event could be devastating. Additionally, wildfire vulnerability is spread unequally across race and ethnicity, with census tracts that were majority Black, Hispanic or Native American experiencing ca. 50% greater vulnerability to wildfire compared to other census tracts. Embracing a social-ecological perspective of fire-prone landscapes allows for the identification of areas that are poorly equipped to respond to wildfires."
https://openalex.org/W2898701288,"Mouse syngeneic tumor models are widely used tools to demonstrate activity of novel anti-cancer immunotherapies. Despite their widespread use, a comprehensive view of their tumor-immune compositions and their relevance to human tumors has only begun to emerge. We propose each model possesses a unique tumor-immune infiltrate profile that can be probed with immunotherapies to inform on anti-tumor mechanisms and treatment strategies in human tumors with similar profiles. In support of this endeavor, we characterized the tumor microenvironment of four commonly used models and demonstrate they encompass a range of immunogenicities, from highly immune infiltrated RENCA tumors to poorly infiltrated B16F10 tumors. Tumor cell lines for each model exhibit different intrinsic factors in vitro that likely influence immune infiltration upon subcutaneous implantation. Similarly, solid tumors in vivo for each model are unique, each enriched in distinct features ranging from pathogen response elements to antigen presentation machinery. As RENCA tumors progress in size, all major T cell populations diminish while myeloid-derived suppressor cells become more enriched, possibly driving immune suppression and tumor progression. In CT26 tumors, CD8 T cells paradoxically increase in density yet are restrained as tumor volume increases. Finally, immunotherapy treatment across these different tumor-immune landscapes segregate into responders and non-responders based on features partially dependent on pre-existing immune infiltrates. Overall, these studies provide an important resource to enhance our translation of syngeneic models to human tumors. Future mechanistic studies paired with this resource will help identify responsive patient populations and improve strategies where immunotherapies are predicted to be ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2899219545,"Drought is one of the harshest abiotic stresses hindering seed germination, plant growth, and crop productivity. A high rate and uniformity of germination under stressful conditions are vital for crop establishment and growth; thus, for productivity. A better understanding of the genetic architecture of seed germination under drought stress is a prerequisite for further increasing yield potential. Barley is considered one of the most abiotic stresses-tolerant cereals. Elucidating the drought tolerance of barley during seed germination would indeed pave the way towards improving the performance of all cereals. However, we still know relatively little about the genetic control of drought tolerance during the seed germination phase. In our study, 218 worldwide spring barley accessions were subjected to PEG-induced drought during seed germination. Induced drought stress ""20% PEG"" significantly reduced the seed germination parameters and seedling related traits. A genome-wide association scan (GWAS) was used to identify genomic regions associated with our trait of interest. In total, 338 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with several traits distributed across seven barley chromosomes, of which 26 genomic regions were associated with candidate genes. The current study found some of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that have previously been reported to be linked to seed germination-related traits under drought conditions, as well as some new associations. Noteworthy, the identified QTL colocalized with a number of genes (within interval ±0.5 Mbp) that are exclusively distributed on chromosomes 1H, 2H, and 5H. The annotation of these genes in barley shows their roles in drought tolerance through encoding different transcription factors. The function of the identified genes during seed germination was also confirmed by the annotation of their counterparts in Arabidopsis. The current analyses show the power of the GWAS both for identifying putative candidate genes and for improving plant adaptive traits in barley."
https://openalex.org/W2899174359,"Galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) is a critical pathogenic factor for IgA nephropathy (IgAN), but its value as a disease-specific biomarker remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the clinical significance of Gd-IgA1 in patients with IgAN.We retrospectively reviewed 111 patients who were diagnosed with IgAN based on the findings of renal biopsies (RB) at Showa University Hospital since 2007. Serum Gd-IgA1 (s-Gd-IgA1) at the time of RB was compared among 111 IgAN patients, 18 Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) patients, 29 lupus nephritis (LN) patients, 28 ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, and 13 minimal change disease (MCD) patients using ELISA with an anti-human Gd-IgA1-specific monoclonal antibody (KM55). We also immunohistochemically stained paraffin-embedded sections for mesangial Gd-IgA1 (m-Gd-IgA1) deposition using KM55.Although levels of s-Gd-IgA1 were comparable among IgAN and HSPN, s-Gd-IgA1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with IgAN compared with LN, AAV and MCD (IgAN vs. HSPN, LN, AAV, and MCD: 16.2 ± 9.1 vs. 14.2 ± 10.8, p = 0.263; 12.7 ± 9.4, p = 0.008; 13.1 ± 7.3, p = 0.059; and 8.2 ± 4.8 μg/mL, p<0.001, respectively). Mesangial-Gd-IgA1 deposition was specifically detected in IgAN or HSPN. The increase in s-Gd-IgA1 significantly correlated with m-Gd-IgA1 positivity in patients with IgAN, and s-Gd-IgA1 elevation and m-Gd-IgA1 deposition were evident in patients with histopathologically advanced IgAN. Moreover, s-Gd-IgA1 levels were significantly higher in IgAN patients with glomerular sclerosis and tubulo-interstitial lesions. Mesangial-Gd-IgA1 intensity negatively correlated with eGFR in IgAN. Multivariate analysis selected s-Gd-IgA1 elevation as a significant risk factor for a 30%-reduction in eGFR in IgAN (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.89; p = 0.038).Although IgAN and HSPN remain difficult to differentiate, s-Gd-IgA1 elevation and m-Gd-IgA1 deposition are reliable diagnostic factors that reflect IgAN severity. Serum-Gd-IgA1 could serve as a predictor of renal outcomes in IgAN. Thus, Gd-IgA1 could be significant biomarker for patients with IgAN."
https://openalex.org/W2898718493,"Objective Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness among working-age U.S. adults largely due to low screening rates. Rural populations face particularly greater challenges to screening because they are older, poorer, less insured, and less likely to receive guideline-concordant care than those in urban areas. Current patient education efforts may not fully address multiple barriers to screening faced by rural patients. We sought to characterize contextual factors affecting rural patient adherence with diabetic eye screening guidelines. Research design and methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 participants (20 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and 9 primary care providers) in a rural, multi-payer health system. Both inductive and directed content analysis were performed. Results Factors influencing rural patient adherence with diabetic eye screening were categorized as environmental, social, and individual using the Ecological Model of Health. Major themes included limited access to and infrequent use of healthcare, long travel distances to obtain care, poverty and financial tradeoffs, trusting relationships with healthcare providers, family members’ struggles with diabetes, anxiety about diabetes complications, and the burden of diabetes management. Conclusions Significant barriers exist for rural patients that affect their ability to adhere with yearly diabetic eye screening. Many studies emphasize patient education to increase adherence, but current patient education strategies fail to address major environmental, social, and individual barriers. Addressing these factors, leveraging patient trust in their healthcare providers, and strategies targeted specifically to environmental barriers such as long travel distances (e.g. teleophthalmology) may fill crucial gaps in diabetic eye screening in rural communities."
https://openalex.org/W2898995234,"Despite consistent economic growth in the country, malnutrition remains one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. The prevalence of malnutrition and its associated factors are well studied among under-five children. However, there is a paucity of evidence among older children in developing countries including Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of stunting and thinness and their associated factors among school-age children.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 389 school-age children in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, Southern Ethiopia, during April and May 2017. Height for age and body mass index for age z scores were calculated using WHO Anthro Plus software as indicators of stunting and thinness respectively. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the association between independent and outcome variables.The prevalence of stunting and thinness were 41.9% (95% CI: 37-47) and 8.0% (95% CI: 5.4-10.8) respectively. The likelihood of stunting was significantly higher among children within the age group of 12-14 years old (AOR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.78-4.95); children who were male (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.21-3.10); children living in households with medium wealth terciles (AOR = 2.90, 95%CI: 1.39-6.04); and children who were non-enrolled in schools (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: (1.37-3.70). Moreover, thinness was 63% less common among children who had a dietary diversity score of <4 food groups (AOR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.16-0.89).The prevalence of thinness is low when compared to the prevalence reported by a single national school health and nutrition survey in Ethiopia. Stunting is a major public health concern. Therefore, this finding warrants the need to implement school health and nutrition programs to improve the nutritional status of school-age children in the study area. The interventions should focus towards both gender and special emphasis should also be given to increase the enrollment of children in schools. In addition, effort should be taken by stakeholders in different hierarchies to improve the family wealth status."
https://openalex.org/W2899324216,"This study explores the geographic dependencies of echo-chamber communication on Twitter during the Brexit campaign. We review the evidence positing that online interactions lead to filter bubbles to test whether echo chambers are restricted to online patterns of interaction or are associated with physical, in-person interaction. We identify the location of users, estimate their partisan affiliation, and finally calculate the distance between sender and receiver of @-mentions and retweets. We show that polarized online echo-chambers map onto geographically situated social networks. More specifically, our results reveal that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic proximity and that the reverse relationship holds true for the Remain campaign. The study concludes with a discussion of primary and secondary effects arising from the interaction between existing physical ties and online interactions and argues that the collapsing of distances brought by internet technologies may foreground the role of geography within one’s social network."
https://openalex.org/W2898787956,"Overfishing is a major threat to the survival of shark species, primarily driven by international trade in high-value fins, as well as meat, liver oil, skin and cartilage. The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) aims to ensure that commercial trade does not threaten wild species, and several shark species have recently been listed on CITES as part of international efforts to ensure that trade does not threaten their survival. However, as international trade regulations alone will be insufficient to reduce overexploitation of sharks, they must be accompanied by practical fisheries management measures to reduce fishing mortality. To examine which management measures might be practical in the context of a targeted shark fishery, we collected data from 52 vessels across 595 fishing trips from January 2014 to December 2015 at Tanjung Luar fishing port in East Lombok, Indonesia. We recorded 11,920 landed individuals across 42 species, a high proportion of which were threatened and regulated species. Catch per unit effort depended primarily on the number of hooks and type of fishing gear used, and to a lesser degree on month, boat engine power, number of sets and fishing ground. The most significant factors influencing the likelihood of catching threatened and regulated species were month, fishing ground, engine power and hook number. We observed significant negative relationships between standardised catch per unit effort and several indicators of fishing effort, suggesting diminishing returns above relatively low levels of fishing effort. Our results suggest that management measures focusing on fishing effort controls, gear restrictions and modifications and spatiotemporal closures could have significant benefits for the conservation of shark species, and may help to improve the overall sustainability of the Tanjung Luar shark fishery. These management measures may also be applicable to shark fisheries in other parts of Indonesia and beyond, as sharks increasingly become the focus of global conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2898831406,"Food safety is a global public health issue, which often arises from asymmetric information between consumers and suppliers. With the development of information technology in human life, building a food traceability information sharing platform is viewed as one of the best ways to overcome the trust crisis and resolve the problem of information asymmetry in China. However, among the myriad information available from the food supply chain, there is a lack of knowledge on consumer preference. Based on the best-worst scaling approach, this paper investigated consumer preferences for vegetable, pork, and dairy product traceability information. Specifically, this paper measured the relative importance that consumers place on the traceable information. The results indicate that consumers have varying priorities for information in different cases. ""Pesticide/veterinary use,"" ""picking/slaughtering date,"" and ""fertilizer/feed use"" are the most preferred traceable information for Chinese consumers in the case of vegetables, while ""picking/slaughtering date"" and ""history of illness and taking protective measures"" are the most preferred information in the case of pork. In the case of dairy products, consumers prefer ""processing information,"" ""environmental information of the origin,"" and ""traceable tag certification information"" most. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety information sharing system as following. First, given consumers' diverse preferences, different types of traceable information should be recorded into the information sharing platform depending on food types. Second, the government could promote the step-by-step construction of such a platform based on the priority of consumers' preferences. Third, new technology should be applied to guarantee the reliability of traceable information. Finally, local preferences in terms of the way consumers receive and understand information should be taken into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2898769372,"The demand for insect-pollinated crops is increasing. Conventional agricultural intensification heavily relies on increased input of fertilizers, which can have negative effects on local biodiversity. Such effects may be particularly accentuated in biodiversity hotspots that are naturally nutrient-poor. Ecological intensification of farming, i.e. practices that increase production through the increase of ecosystem services, emerges as an alternative to conventional intensification. For example, practices that boost abundance and diversity of crop pollinators can lead to substantial increases in cropland productivity. However, little is known about the synergisms and trade-offs between fertilizer input and such ecological intensification practices. Here we investigate interactive effects between fertilization practices and the provision of ecosystem services in a biodiversity hotspot where conventional agriculture is rapidly expanding (Brazilian savannas). We focus on a highly nitrogen-demanding crop species that benefits from pollinators (the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.), for which nitrogen input greatly varies in the study region. Our findings show that positive effects of native pollinators on crop yield are most accentuated under low inputs of nitrogen (e.g. equal to or below 72kg ha-1). This interactive effect could be due to changes in flower visitor community composition or behaviour. Our study also suggests that landscape management practices that minimize isolation from patches of natural vegetation and maximize its cover nearby (within 500 meters) of production areas can increase pollinator and biocontrol agent abundance and richness. Overall, these results suggest that ecological intensification is a valuable alternative for common bean production in Brazil, and potentially other regions of the world. Land productivity can be enhanced if an adequate balance of chemical inputs and landscape management is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2899336695,"Background Children are susceptible to severe influenza infections and facilitate community transmission. One potential strategy to improve vaccine immunogenicity in children against seasonal influenza involves a trivalent hemagglutinin DNA prime-trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) boost regimen. Methods Sites enrolled adolescents, followed by younger children, to receive DNA prime (1 mg or 4 mg) intramuscularly by needle-free jet injector (Biojector), followed by split virus 2012/13 seasonal IIV3 boost by needle and syringe approximately 18 weeks later. A comparator group received IIV3 prime and boost at similar intervals. Primary study objectives included evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimens, with secondary objectives of measuring antibody responses at four weeks post boost by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization assays. Results Seventy-five children ≥6 to ≤17 years old enrolled. Local reactogenicity was higher after DNA prime compared to IIV3 prime (p<0.001 for pain/tenderness, redness, or swelling), but symptoms were mild to moderate in severity. Systemic reactogenicity was similar between vaccines. Overall, antibody responses were similar among groups, although HAI antibodies revealed a trend towards higher responses following 4 mg DNA-IIV3 compared to IIV3-IIV3. The fold increase of HAI antibodies to A/California/07/2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09] was significantly greater following 4 mg DNA-IIV3 (10.12 fold, 5.60–18.27 95%CI) compared to IIV3-IIV3 (3.86 fold, 2.32–6.44 95%CI). Similar neutralizing titers were observed between regimens, with a trend towards increased response frequencies in 4 mg DNA-IIV3. However, significant differences in fold increase, reported as geometric mean fold ratios, were detected against the H1N1 viruses within the neutralization panel: A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (1.41 fold, 1.10–1.81 95%CI) and A/South Carolina/1/1918 (1.55 fold, 1.27–1.89 95%CI). Conclusions In this first pediatric DNA vaccine study conducted in the U.S., the DNA prime-IIV3 boost regimen was safe and well tolerated. In children, the 4 mg DNA-IIV3 regimen resulted in antibody responses comparable to the IIV3-IIV3 regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2898643962,"Sperm cells undergo a wide variety of swimming patterns by a beating flagellum to maintain high speed regardless of the rheological and physical properties of the background fluid. In this work, we develop and control a soft robotic sperm that undergoes controllable switching between swimming modes like biological sperm cells. The soft robotic sperm consists of a magnetic head and an ultra-thin flexible flagellum, and is actuated using external magnetic fields. We observe that out-of-plane wobbling of the head results in helical wave propagation along the flagellum, whereas in-plane wobbling achieves planar wave propagation. Our theoretical predictions and experimental results show the ability of the soft robotic sperm to change its swimming speed by tuning the beating frequency of its flagellum and the propulsion pattern. The average speed of the soft robotic sperm increases by factors of 2 and 1.2 in fluids with viscosity of 1 Pa.s and 5 Pa.s at relatively low actuation frequencies, respectively, when they switch between planar to helical flagellar propulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2899312999,"This paper uses text data mining to identify long-term developments in tourism academic research from the perspectives of thematic focus, geography, and gender of tourism authorship. Abstracts of papers published in the period of 1970-2017 in high-ranking tourist journals were extracted from the Scopus database and served as data source for the analysis. Fourteen subject areas were identified using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text mining approach. LDA integrated with GIS information allowed to obtain geography distribution and trends of scholarly output, while probabilistic methods of gender identification based on social network data mining were used to track gender dynamics with sufficient confidence. The findings indicate that, while all 14 topics have been prominent from the inception of tourism studies to the present day, the geography of scholarship has notably expanded and the share of female authorship has increased through time and currently almost equals that of male authorship."
https://openalex.org/W2899434229,"Rimicaris chacei Williams and Rona 1986, formerly named as Chorocaris chacei, is a caridean shrimp living in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems. This shrimp is endemic to the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and lives at the periphery of aggregates of its well-known congeneric R. exoculata Williams and Rona 1986. Contrasting with the very dense and mobile clusters formed by R. exoculata, R. chacei lives in small groups of several individuals that are not very mobile. Although devoid of the characteristic hypertrophied cephalothorax of R. exoculata, which harbors the ectosymbionts, a microbial community has also been reported in the cephalothorax of R. chacei. Previous data on morphology, behavior and isotopic values indicate a diet based on a combination of feeding on its epibiotic bacteria and scavenging or occasional predation. In this study, our objective was to describe, for the first time, the distribution, morphology and phylogeny of the microbial communities associated with R. chacei. This species is significantly less studied than R. exoculata, but nevertheless represents the only other known example of symbiosis in crustaceans of MAR hydrothermal vent sites. Microbial communities have been observed at the same locations as in R. exoculata (mouthparts, branchiostegites and digestive tract). However, in R. chacei, the surfaces occupied by the bacteria are smaller. The main lineages are affiliated to Epsilon and Gammaproteobacteria in the cephalothorax and to Deferribacteres, Mollicutes, Epsilon and Gammaproteobacteria in the digestive tract. Comparison with the well-described bacterial communities of R. exoculata and hypotheses about the role of these communities in R. chacei are discussed."

Although the condition is associated with severe adverse consequences for the mother and newborn, it remains a neglected problem. The purpose of this study was to describe the association between antenatal depressive symptoms and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestation age (SGA).The study was conducted in Dong Anh District, Hanoi, Vietnam, among pregnant women of less than 24 weeks of gestation. Information on socioeconomic characteristics and reproductive history was collected at enrollment and ADS and experiences of intimate partner violence were assessed at week 32. Birth outcomes were determined at delivery. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between ADS and PTB, LBW, and SGA.ADS was significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB (crude OR = 2.4; 95%; CI: 1.01-5.4 and adjusted OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.2, respectively) and a significantly increased risk for giving birth to an LBW infant (crude OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.4-7.0 and adjusted OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.6-7.6, respectively). In contrast, ADS was not statistically associated with small for gestation age.ADS is associated with an increased risk of PTB and LBW but not associated with SGA."
https://openalex.org/W2898763268,"The current study contributes to previous work on measuring the social phenotype in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by validating a multidimensional test of social competence developed for use with individuals with and without ASD. The “Multidimensional Social Competence Scale” (MSCS) was previously validated as a parent-rating scale with youth 11–18 years with ASD without intellectual disability and typically developing adolescents of comparable age. The current study presents a validation of a self-report version of the MSCS in a non-clinical young adult population (N = 1178, males = 360, females = 817, age range = 17–25 years). The MSCS consists of seven domains that represent social competence: social motivation, social inferencing, demonstrating empathic concern, social knowledge, verbal conversation skills, nonverbal sending skills, and emotion regulation. These domains are theorized to be indicative of the higher-order construct of social competence. A second higher-order theorization of the MSCS structure posits that 3 of these factors are indicative of social responsiveness, and the remaining 4 factors are indicative of social understanding and emotion regulation. Our findings indicated support for each of the theorized multidimensional factor structures. Reliability, optimal scoring, convergent and discriminant validity of the measure, as well as implications for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2898885042,"Background Little is known about alcohol consumption among Africans living in rural and urban Africa compared to African migrants in Europe. We compared the patterns of alcohol consumption in a group of Ghanaians living in different locations in Ghana and in Europe and examined the factors associated with drinking alcohol. Methods Data were from a cross-sectional study (RODAM) of Ghanaians aged 25–70 years living in rural and urban Ghana and in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. Information on how often participants consumed at least one standard alcoholic drink in the preceding 12 months, the type of alcoholic beverage and the average serving size was obtained using a food propensity questionnaire. The associations between drinking alcohol and socio-demographic variables, and frequency of attending religious services were investigated using logistic regression models stratified by site and sex. For Ghanaians living in Europe, the number of years since migration and acculturation were also included in the model as covariates. Results 4280 participants (62.2% women) were included in the analyses. In both men and women, the prevalence of drinking and amount of alcohol consumed per day was highest in Berlin (prevalence of drinking 71.0% and 61.7%) and lowest in urban Ghana (41.4% and 26.8%). After adjustment for age and education in both men and women in Europe, those attending religious services less frequently reported higher levels of drinking alcohol than non-attendants (never attend/no religion compared to attending service at least once a week men OR 4.60 95% CI 2.85, 7.44; women OR 1.80 95% CI 1.12, 2.90) p-trend with frequency <0.001 in men; 0.002 in women); this association was seen also in men in rural Ghana (p-trend = 0.001) and women in urban Ghana (p-trend = 0.02). The prevalence of drinking was positively associated with years since migration in both men and women in Europe ((OR per years increase in time lived in Europe 1.25 (95% CI 1.02,1.53) test for trend p = 0.03 in women; OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.03, 1.62 p = 0.03 in men) but no association was found with self-reported measures of acculturation (ethnic identity, cultural orientation or social networks). Conclusion There are marked differences in alcohol consumption between Ghanaians living in Europe and in Ghana suggesting migration has an important influence of drinking patterns and also suggesting the possibility of requiring different strategies in alcohol reduction campaigns among Ghanaians in different locations."
https://openalex.org/W2898879161,"Background and aim Awareness of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has gradually increased in Japan, therefore the characteristics of this disease in the Japanese patient population need to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the features of EoE in the Japanese population. Methods During a 2-year period, all gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed with maximum attention being paid to identify EoE through endoscopic findings. Clinical features and findings were analyzed among this population. Results Among a total of 8589 patients (general gastrointestinal endoscopy, performed for evaluation of symptoms or disease follow-up: 3669; medical check-up endoscopy, routinely performed in asymptomatic patients: 4920), 17 patients (0.20%) were diagnosed with esophageal eosinophilia (mean age ± standard deviation: 44±11.9 years; 1 female). Only 6 patients with esophageal eosinophilia were diagnosed by general gastrointestinal endoscopy; among them, 3 patients had dysphagia and 3 were asymptomatic. The remaining 11 patients were diagnosed by medical check-up endoscopy. All patients were treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI); 5 were diagnosed with EoE and 12 with PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia. Chronological endoscopy analysis showed that EoE findings could be observed for a mean of 6.1 years prior to diagnosis, and the disease did not significantly progress in severity. Conclusions Most Japanese patients with EoE have mild and slowly progressing disease, which can be diagnosed when close attention is paid to the endoscopic findings. Medical check-up endoscopy in Japan could be a great opportunity for the early diagnosis of EoE."
https://openalex.org/W2899468957,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand activated bHLH transcription factor that belongs to the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily of proteins involved in mediating responses to cellular environment regulating normal physiological and developmental pathways. The AHR binds a broad range of naturally derived and synthetic compounds, and plays a major role in mediating effects of certain environmental chemicals. Although our understanding of the physiological roles of the AHR in the immune system is evolving, there is little known about its role in hematopoiesis and hematopoietic diseases. Prior studies demonstrated that AHR null (AHR-KO) mice have impaired hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function; they develop myeloproliferative changes in peripheral blood cells, and alterations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations in the bone marrow. We hypothesized mice lacking AHR expression only within hematopoietic cells (AHRVav1 mice) would develop similar changes. However, we did not observe a complete phenocopy of AHR-KO and AHRVav1 animals at 2 or 18 months of age. To illuminate the signaling mechanisms underlying the alterations in hematopoiesis observed in these mice, we sorted a population of cells highly enriched for HSC function (LSK cells: CD34-CD48-CD150+) and performed microarray analyses. Ingenuity Pathway and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses revealed that that loss of AHR within HSCs alters several gene and signaling networks important for HSC function. Differences in gene expression networks among HSCs from AHR-KO and AHRVav1 mice suggest that AHR in bone marrow stromal cells also contributes to HSC function. In addition, numerous studies have suggested a role for AHR in both regulation of hematopoietic cells, and in the development of blood diseases. More work is needed to define what these signals are, and how they act upon HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2898641924,"Non-contributory pension programs in the developing world seek to provide older adults with an income that may improve their health and wellbeing in old age by enabling access to health care and better nutrition. There is no previous evidence of the effects of non-contributory pensions on frailty, a comprehensive measure of health and well-being of the oldest old. We aimed to estimate the effects of non-contributory pension programs on frailty of older adults in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. We use rich panel data, including objective markers and self-reported assessments of health and well-being, for 944 adults at least 70 years of age in two communities of Yucatan, Mexico. The first wave was collected in 2008; the second wave was collected in 2010, 18 months after implementation of a monthly state pension in one community and 12 months after a federal pension paid every two months in the other. We found the state pension led to a statistically significant decrease in the severity of frailty for women, but the federal pension was associated with an increase. We found no statistically significant change in the frailty index for men in either community. Among explanations for these findings are monthly payments being more likely to be spent on health care, medicines, and more regular food expenditures, enabling women who previously lacked independent means of support to increase their longer-term health. The federal program paid every two months led to irregular patterns of food expenditure and increased ownership of durable goods but had no effects on health care utilization, subsequently leading to deterioration in longer-term health for women."

We asked responders to share data from the last 5 cases they performed for each technique. Procedures were stratified according to stone size and the centres' surgical volume. Techniques were compared in terms of effectiveness and safety. Analyses were performed on the overall group and a subgroup of 1-2 cm stones.We collected data from a total of 420 procedures by 30, out of 78, urologists who received the survey (response rate 38%): 140 RIRS, 141 Regular-PCNL (>20 Ch), 67 Mini-PCNL (14-20 Ch), 28 UltraMini-PCNL (11-13 Ch) and 44 Micro-PCNL (4,8-8 Ch). Techniques choice was influenced by stone size and the centre's surgical volume. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were influenced by stone size, independently of the technique. The stone-free rate was significantly lower in Micro-PCNL compared to Regular-PCNL. This was not confirmed for 1-2 cm stones. All techniques presented a lower complication rate than Regular-PCNL, with Mini-PCNL being the most protective technique compared to Regular-PCNL.Stone size seems to drive treatment choice. Miniaturized PCNL techniques are widely employed for 1-2 cm stones, in particular in higher surgical volume centres. Mini-PCNL and RIRS are growing in popularity for stones > 2 cm. Mini-PCNL seems to be a good compromise, being the most effective and safe procedure among PCNL techniques. RIRS is characterized by satisfactory stone-free and low complication rates."
https://openalex.org/W2898850651,"There have been recent surges in the use of smokeless tobacco (SLT) and betel quid (BQ) chew among adolescents in South East Asian countries, with an increase, on average, of 7% to 15% between 2004 and 2013, necessitating interventional investigations to modify this behavior. The current intervention was aimed towards changing adolescents' perceptions regarding the harmful effects of SLT and BQ use and encouraging them to quit. This randomized control trial involved 2140 adolescents from 26 private and public-sector schools in Karachi, Pakistan. After randomization, 1185 individuals were placed in the intervention group and administered a behavior changing intervention (BCI), while 955 individuals constituted the control group. A generalized estimating equation was employed to measure differences in repeated measures for both groups. The beta coefficients were reported after adjusting the covariates with the 95% confidence interval, and the p-value was considered significant at <0.050. Cohen's d was employed to report the effect size of the intervention. The BCI resulted in a 0.176-unit (95% CI 0.078-0.274, p-value <0.001) increase in knowledge scores regarding the health hazards of SLT and BQ, a 0.141-unit (95% CI 0.090-0.192, p-value <0.001) increase in use perception scores, and a 0.067-unit (95% CI 0.006-0.129, p-value 0.031) increase in quit perception scores in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. A knowledge related module (p-value 0.024) and quit preparation module (p-value 0.005) were found to be helpful by adolescents in either changing their perceptions regarding SLT and/or BQ chew use or in quitting. The role of BCI is promising in improving adolescents' knowledge and changing their perceptions in a positive manner regarding their harmful SLT and BQ use. Convincing results may be achieved if interventions are tailored, with an emphasis on the identification of the products that are used by adolescents in addition to highlighting their ill effects and how students may manage to quit them. If included in the schools' curricula, this BCI method may help in developing schools that are free of SLT and BQ use. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03488095."
https://openalex.org/W2899092777,"Objective Fatalism has been shown to influence health behaviors and outcomes among different populations. Our study reports on the adaptation of the Religious Health Fatalism Questionnaire for a Muslim population (RHFQ-M). Design The original RHFQ wording was modified for a Muslim context and cognitively tested in 6 focus groups (FG). Items were revised by Muslim and non-Muslim healthcare researchers based on FG responses regarding the theological “accurateness” of the questions. The revised 9-item measure was administered to 58 English-speaking Muslim women (≥40 years old) recruited from two mosques in the Chicago area in order to assess psychometric properties. Main outcome measures Cronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analyses were used to assess internal consistency and measure dimensionality, respectively. Statistical correlations with several fatalism and religiosity measures were computed to assess convergent and discriminant validity. Results After testing with an ethnically and racially diverse group of Muslims, the RHFQ-M was found to be reliable (Cronbach’s α is 0.79), comprised of two distinct underlying subscales, and is correlated with, but distinct from, other measures of fatalism and Islamic religiosity. Conclusion Our adapted measure, RHFQ-M, appears to accurately assess Islamic dimensions of fatalism and is ready for use in the health literature."
https://openalex.org/W2899215587,"Introduction Anaemia in women during pregnancy and child bearing age is one of the most common global health problems. Reasons are numerous, but in many cases only minimal attempts are made to elucidate the underlying causes. In this study we aim to identify aetiology of anaemia in women of child bearing age and to determine the relative contributions, effects and interactions of α- and β-thalassaemia in a region of the world where thalassaemia is endemic. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital of Sri Lanka. The patient database of deliveries between January 2015 and September 2016 at University Obstetrics Unit was screened to identify women with anaemia during pregnancy and 253 anaemic females were randomly re-called for the study. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and haematological investigations were done to identify aetiologies. Results Out of the 253 females who were anaemic during pregnancy and were re-called, 8 were excluded due to being currently pregnant. Of the remaining 245 females, 117(47.8%) remained anaemic and another 22(9.0%) had non-anaemic microcytosis. Of anaemic females, 28(24.8%) were iron deficient, 40(35.4%) had low-normal serum ferritin without fulfilling the criteria for iron deficiency,18(15.3%) had β-haemoglobinopathy trait and 20(17.0%) had α-thalassaemia trait. Of females who had non-anaemic microcytosis, 14(66.0%) had α-thalassaemia trait. In 4 females, both α- and β-thalassaemia trait coexist. These females had higher levels of haemoglobin (p = 0.06), MCV (p<0.05) and MCH (p<0.01) compared to individuals with only β-thalassaemia trait. A significantly higher proportion of premature births (p<0.01) and lower mean birth weights (p<0.05) were observed in patients with α-thalassaemia trait. Conclusions Nearly one third of anaemic females in child bearing age had thalassaemia trait of which α-thalassemia contributes to a majority. Both α- and β-thalassaemia trait can co-exist and have ameliorating effects on red cell indices in heterozygous states. α-Thalassaemia trait was significantly associated with premature births and low birth weight. It is of paramount importance to investigate the causes of anaemia in women of child bearing age and during pregnancy in addition to providing universal iron supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2898810748,"For the optimum efficacy of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), patients need to be adherent to their medication regimen. To clarify the effects of medication adherence on disease activity in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we conducted a cohort study in patients with various stages of RA. Patients were enrolled from the Kyoto University RA Management Alliance cohort, and followed up prospectively for 12 months. In this study, a total of 475 patients were analyzed and divided into 9 groups according to their medication adherence and the RA disease duration. The primary outcomes were based on the rate of a disease flare. The secondary outcomes were the changes in disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28-ESR), simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and physical disability by health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ). The changes in DAS28-ESR, HAQ, and the risk of disease flare in the highly adherent patients were significantly lower than those of the less adherent patients among the groups with RA ≤ 4.6 years but not those among the other groups. Taken together, this study identified a significant association between medication adherence and the disease flare during early-stage RA or short disease duration. These results emphasize the need to pay more attention to medication adherence in preventing the disease progression of RA."
https://openalex.org/W2899381928,"This study investigated whether anterior placenta previa in the second trimester is associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The neonates delivered by 2067 women between 2007 and 2015 were evaluated for the presence of RDS through birth records. The location of the placenta and the presence of placenta previa during the second and third trimesters were assessed and recorded. Demographic, prenatal, and perinatal records were reviewed. Anterior placenta previa in the second and third trimesters was correlated with RDS. Infants with lower gestational ages and birth weights had higher rates of RDS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a significant association between anterior placenta previa in the second trimester and neonatal RDS. Anterior placenta previa in the second trimester is associated with neonatal RDS. Obstetricians should be aware that anterior placenta previa detected during the second trimester, irrespective of whether the placenta will migrate in the third trimester, may be an independent risk factor for neonatal RDS."
https://openalex.org/W2899305926,"The use of thermally treated biomass, including biochar, as soil amendments can improve soil fertility by providing nutrients, stable C and improving soil water-holding capacity. However, if the degree of carbonization is low, these soil amendments can lower crop productivity as a result of high salinity or organic compounds. The overall effect of these soil amendments is mediated by complex relationships between production conditions, soil properties and environmental conditions. This study aimed to 1) characterize the physiochemical properties and organic compounds released by three soil amendments (softwood biochar or pyrogenic carbonaceous biosolids), 2) determine the effects of these amendments on maize (Zea mays) seedling productivity, and 3) relate properties of these amendments to effects on maize seedling productivity under controlled environment conditions. Physicochemical properties and mobile organic compounds (water-soluble and volatile organic compounds were determined. The amendments were tested in maize germination and greenhouse experiments. Chemical fingerprinting of volatile and water-soluble compounds revealed over 100 mobile organic species. Increasing treatment temperature from 270 to 320°C reduces phytotoxicity of pyrogenic carbonaceous biosolids soil amendments. Water-soluble components of pyrogenic carbonaceous biosolids produced at 270°C (inorganic N, Na and/or organic compounds) were associated with reduced maize seedling productivity. Volatile components of pyrogenic carbonaceous biosolids produced at 320°C were associated with improved maize seedling productivity; nitrogen uptake was increased in spite of smaller root systems as a result of increased mineralization of soil or amendment N and/or uptake of organic N compounds. These results suggest that pyrogenic carbonaceous biosolids have potential benefits to provide plant nutrients when the amount of organic and inorganic species are limited during early growth stages, under greenhouse conditions. Future studies should examine these effects under field conditions to confirm whether controlled environment results translate into effects on yield."
https://openalex.org/W2898718253,"Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1), which is also known as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) is a TIM gene family member. In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression profile of HAVCR1 in GC, its prognostic value and the potential epigenetic mechanism leading to its dysregulation. Bioinformatic analysis was performed by using genomic, clinicopathological and survival data in the human protein atlas (HPA) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results showed that HAVCR1 was significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level in GC tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. In addition, HAVCR1 upregulation was an independent indicator of shorter OS (HR: 1.698, 95%CI: 1.221–2.361, p = 0.002), after adjustment of older age, differentiation status, pathological stages and the presence of residual tumor and was also an independent indicator of shorter RFS (HR: 2.577, 95%CI: 1.583–4.197, p<0.001), after adjustment of gender and histological grade. The methylation level of two CpG sites (cg11188031 and cg07320595) was negatively correlated with HAVCR1 expression. However, only high methylation level of cg07320595 was associated with significantly longer OS (p = 0.018) and RFS (p = 0.021). Based on these findings, we infer that HAVCR1 upregulation might serve as a valuable prognostic marker in terms of OS and RFS in GC patients. Cg07320595 might be a critical CpG site influencing HAVCR1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2899170277,"News media monitoring is an important scientific tool. By treating news reporters as data collectors and their reports as qualitative accounts of a fast changing public health landscape, researchers can glean many valuable insights. Yet, there have been surprisingly few innovations in public health media monitoring, with nearly all studies relying on labor-intensive content analyses limited to a small number of media reports. We propose to advance this subfield by using scalable machine learning. In potentially the largest contemporary public health media monitoring study to date, we systematically characterize global news reports surrounding electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) using natural language processing techniques. News reports including ENDS terms (e.g., “electronic cigarettes”) from over 100,000 sources (all sources archived on Google News or Bing News, as well as all news articles shared on Twitter) were monitored for 1 January 2013 through 31 July 2018. The geographic and subject (e.g., prevalence, bans, quitting, warnings, marketing, prices, age, flavor and industry) foci of news articles, their popularity among readers who share news on social media, and the sentiment behind news articles were assessed algorithmically. Globally there were 86,872 ENDS news reports with coverage increasing from 8 (standard deviation [SD] = 8) stories per day in 2013 to 75 (SD = 56) stories per day during 2018. The focus of ENDS news spanned 148 nations, with the plurality focusing on the United States (34% of all news). Potentially overlooked hotspots of ENDS media activity included China, Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, and Paraguay. The most common subject was warnings about ENDS (18%), followed by bans on using ENDS (13%) and ENDS prices (9%). Flavor and age restrictions were the least covered news subjects (~1% each). Among different subject foci, reports on quitting cigarettes using ENDS had the highest probability of scoring in the top three deciles of popularity rankings. Moreover, ENDS news on quitting and prices had a more positive sentiment on average than news with other subject foci. Public health leaders can use these trends to stay abreast of how ENDS are portrayed in the media, and potentially how the public perceives ENDS. Because our analytical strategies are updated in near real time, we aim to make media monitoring part of standard practice to support evidence-based tobacco control in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2899423957,"Clear-cutting alters natural ecosystem processes by reducing landscape heterogeneity. It is the dominant harvesting technique across the boreal zone, yet understanding of how environmental heterogeneity and beta diversity are structured in forest ecosystems and post-clear cut is lacking. We use ground-dwelling arthropods as models to determine how natural succession (progression from deciduous to mixed to coniferous cover types) and clear-cutting change boreal forests, exploring the role of environmental heterogeneity in shaping beta diversity across multiple spatial scales (between-cover types and between-stands of the same cover type (1600 to 8500 m), between-plots (100 to 400 m) and within-plots (20 to 40 m)). We characterise environmental heterogeneity as variability in combined structural, vegetational and soil parameters, and beta diversity, as variability in assemblage composition. Clear-cutting homogenised forest environments across all spatial scales, reducing total environmental heterogeneity by 35%. Arthropod beta diversity reflected these changes at larger scales suggesting that environmental heterogeneity is useful in explaining beta diversity both between-cover types and between-stands of the same cover type. However, at smaller scales, within- and between-plots spider beta diversity reflected the lower environmental heterogeneity in regenerating stands, whereas staphylinid and carabids assemblages were not homogenised 12 years post-harvest. Differences in environmental heterogeneity and staphylinid beta diversity between cover types were also important at small scales. In regenerating stands, we detected a subtle yet notable effect of pre-felling cover type on environmental heterogeneity and arthropods, where pre-felling cover type accounted for a significant amount of variance in beta diversity, indicating that biological legacies (e.g. soil pH reflecting pre-harvest conditions) may have a role in driving beta diversity even 12 years post-harvest. This study highlights the importance of understanding site history when predicting impacts of change in forest ecosystems. Further, to understand drivers of beta diversity we must identify biological legacies shaping community structure."
https://openalex.org/W2899424801,"Objective To evaluate initial reported willingness to participate in a hypothetical HIV vaccine clinical trial and actual participation of volunteers in a longitudinal observational study. Methods We recruited HIV negative male and female volunteers aged 18–45 years into a longitudinal observational study at KAVI–ICR Kangemi in Kenya, to serve as a pool from which to draw participants into a phase I HIV vaccine clinical trial. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information regarding willingness to join a HIV vaccine clinical trial in the future. Study follow-up visits were every 6 months. Results A total of 105 participants were screened and 100 (M46:F54) were enrolled into the observational study. Ninety- four per cent of those enrolled expressed willingness to participate in a future HIV vaccine trial. Altruism and desire to learn the body’s response to the vaccine were the most motivating factors at 40% and 25% respectively. At the onset of a 40-person phase I HIV vaccine trial, 86 observational study participants who had previously expressed willingness to participate were contacted but only 26 (30%) came for information. All 26 consented to participate and after screening for eligibility, 24 were eligible. Of the 24, 15 were enrolled. These numbers were not adequate; hence the vaccine trial employed other recruitment methods to meet the deficit. Conclusion Observational “pools” of cohorts may not provide adequate number of participants into vaccine clinical trials even if they report willingness; therefore supplementary recruitment methods such as direct community recruitment, passive approach, and snowballing need to be in place."
https://openalex.org/W2898720912,"Remitted patients with a history of several previous major depressive episodes have a higher risk of relapse/recurrence than patients with fewer previous episodes, and the probability of another episode increases progressively with each successive episode. This study examines the association between the number of previous episodes and modifiable vulnerability factors in remitted patients with recurrent depression.Patients with recurrent depression (DSM-IV-diagnosed) who were in remission (N = 214) were recruited between September 2011 and July 2016. The association was examined between the number of previous episodes and the following factors: i.e. interpersonal functioning, daily stress, sense of mastery, coping and dysfunctional beliefs.A history of more previous episodes was associated with higher levels of interpersonal problems (P < .001), daily stress (P = .04) and a lower sense of mastery (P = .05). Interpersonal problems were most strongly associated with more previous episodes in a Generalized Linear Regression model. In the domain of interpersonal problems, the subscales that showed the strongest relationship were domineering/controlling, vindictive/self-centred, socially inhibited and self-sacrificing.Patients with a history of more depressive episodes reported higher levels of interpersonal problems, daily stress and a lower sense of mastery. Future studies should examine these factors in a longitudinal cohort and look at whether the effect of interventions to prevent relapse can be explained by targeting these psychological factors.Netherlands Trial Register: 2599."
https://openalex.org/W2899305603,"Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (NIPP) is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was included in the national immunization program of children living in Portugal in 2015. Until then, PCV7 (since late 2001) and PCV13 (since early 2010) were given through the private market. We determined the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates causing adult NIPP in 2012–2015 and compared the results with previously published data (2007–2011). There were 50 serotypes among the 1435 isolates. The most common were serotypes: 3 (14%), 11A (8%), 19F (6%), 23A (5%), 6C (5%), 19A (4%), 23B (4%), 9N (4%) and non-typable isolates (4%). When considering data since the availability of PCV13 for children in the private market, the proportion of PCV13 serotypes declined from 44.0% in 2010 to 29.7% in 2015 (p < 0.001), mainly due to early decreases in the proportions of serotypes 3 and 19A. In contrast, during the same period, PCV7 serotypes (11.9% in 2012–2015) and the serotypes exclusive of the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (26.0% in 2012–2015), remained relatively stable, while non-vaccine types increased from 27.0% in 2010 to 41.9% in 2015 (p<0.001). According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, penicillin non-susceptible and erythromycin resistant isolates accounted for 1% and 21.7%, respectively, of the isolates recovered in 2012–2015, with no significant changes seen since 2007. Comparison of NIPP serotypes with contemporary invasive disease serotypes identified associations of 19 serotypes with either disease presentation. The introduction of PCV13 in the national immunization program for children from 2015 onwards may lead to reductions in the proportion of NIPP due to vaccine serotypes but continued NIPP surveillance is essential due to a different serotype distribution from invasive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899078269,"Background Increased weight gain during infancy is a risk factor for obesity and related diseases in later life. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and weight gain during infancy, and to identify the factors mediating the association between SES and infant weight gain. Methods Subjects were 2513 parent-child dyads participating in a cluster randomized controlled intervention study. Family SES was indexed by maternal education level. Weight gain in different time windows (infant age 0–3, 0–6, and 6–12 months) was calculated by subtracting the weight for age z-score (WAZ) between the two time-points. Path analysis was performed to examine the mediating pathways linking SES and infant weight gain. Results On average, infants of low-educated mothers had a lower birth weight and caught-up at approximately 6 months. In the period of 0–6 months, infants with low-educated mothers had an 0.42 (95% CI 0.27–0.57) higher gain in weight for age z-score compared to children with high-educated mothers. The association between maternal education level and increased infant weight gain in the period of 0–6 months can be explained by infant birth weight, gestational age at child birth, duration of breastfeeding, and age at introduction of complementary foods. After adjusting all the mediating factors, there was no association between maternal education level and infant weight gain. Conclusion Infants with lower SES had an increased weight gain during the first 6 months of infancy, and the effect can be explained by infant birth weight, gestational age at child birth, and infant feeding practices."
https://openalex.org/W2899083722,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are a prognostic factor in diffuse glioma. However, the mechanism by which these mutations improve prognosis are not clear. In a subset of IDH-mutant glioma, remodeling of the methylome results in the glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) and transcriptional reorganization. In this study, we focus on G0/G1 switch 2 (G0S2), which is highly downregulated in G-CIMP glioma. We found that G0S2 expression tended to increase as the WHO grade increased, and G0S2 knockdown inhibited glioma invasion. Additionally, we revealed that the overexpression of the DNA demethylase Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) in IDH1-plasmid transfected glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells restored G0S2 expression. These results indicate that G0S2 is epigenetically silenced in IDH1-mutant glioma. In addition, the stereotactic delivery of glioma cells with decreased G0S2 expression in the mouse brain resulted in prolonged survival. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis also indicated that survival is longer in the lower G0S2 expression group than in the higher G0S2 expression group. Moreover, G0S2 expression was higher in recurrent tumor specimens than at the initial diagnosis in the same patient. These results provide one explanation for the improved survival in IDH1-mutant glioma as well as a new epigenetic target for glioma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2899344446,"Introduction Lightweight (LW) polypropylene (PP) meshes better adapt to host tissue, causing less fibrosis and inflammatory responses than high-density meshes. Mesh fixation using tissue adhesives (TA) that replace conventional sutures may improve the process of hernia repair and tissue trauma. This preclinical study compares the behavior of different cyanoacrylate-based adhesives in the fixation of LW-PP meshes for hernia repair. Methods Partial abdominal wall defects were repaired using LW-PP Optilene meshes in New Zealand rabbits. The following groups were established according to the mesh fixation method: Suture (control), Glubran 2 (n-butyl), Ifabond (n-hexyl), SafetySeal (n-butyl) and Evobond (n-octyl). At 14, 90 and 180 days after surgery, the recovered implants were examined to assess the host tissue integration, the macrophage response and the biomechanical strength. Results All the groups showed optimal host tissue incorporation regardless of the fixation procedure. Significantly increased levels of collagen 1 and collagen 3 gene expression (p<0.001) were observed at 14 days compared to the medium- and long-term durations, where the Suture and Glubran groups showed the highest expression of collagen 1. All the adhesives increased the macrophage reaction (p<0.001) compared to sutures at all implant times. Maximal macrophage response was observed in the short-term Glubran group (p<0.01) compared to the rest of the groups. Although SafetySeal and Evobond did not reach the biomechanical resistance of sutures at 14 days, all the adhesives did reach this level in the medium- to long-term periods, providing significantly higher resistance (p<0.05). Conclusions All the cyanoacrylates, despite inducing a significantly increased macrophage response versus sutures, showed optimal host tissue integration and long-term mechanical behavior; thus, they might be good choices for LW-PP mesh hernia repairs."
https://openalex.org/W2899166464,"Background Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an important complication associated with several diseases that are rare and life-threatening. TMA is common to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TTP is defined by a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, and early treatment is associated with good prognosis. The diagnosis of HUS can be difficult due to the potential multiple etiologies, and the best treatment option in most cases is not well-established yet. The implementation of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) could decrease the time to diagnosis and treatment for HUS and may improve the outcomes of these patients. Objective To determine the impact of MDT on morbidity and mortality [death or chronic renal replacement therapy (CRRT) requirements], incidence and response time [(RT) defined as the period between hospital admission and the first day of direct therapy administration], length of stay at an intensive care unit (ICU-LOS) and total hospitalization (T-LOS) were also assessed. Methods We compared a pre-MDT implementation period (from January/2008 to May/2016) versus post-MDT period (from May/2016 to December/2016). The screening TMA diagnosis was made according the following criteria: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal damage and without ADAMTS13 deficiency. An online chat was implemented to provide instant medical information. Results Twenty-eight patients were included. The incidence changed from 2.3 cases/pre-MDT: (all cases: n = 18) to 10 cases/year post-MDT (all cases: n = 10). Two patients died in pre-MDT and post- MDT (11% versus 20%, P = 0.60). From pre-MDT, the number of patients who required CRRT by post-MDT decreased from 7 (39%) to 0, P = 0.03. Similarly, RT, ICU-LOS and T-LOS [median(p25-p75)] decreased from 10 (2–12) days to 0.5 (0–1.5) days, P = 0.04, from 16 (9–30) days to 10 (4–13) days, P = 0.01 and from 33 (22–53) days to 16 (12–32) days, P < 0.01, respectively. Conclusion MDT implementation was associated with a greater number of patients who meet TMA criteria. A decrease in the RT and T-LOS periods were observed and associated with better outcomes in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2899392966,"Bariatric surgery and other therapeutic options for obese patients are often evaluated by the loss of weight, reduction of comorbidities or improved quality of life. However, little is currently known about potential therapy-related changes in the adipose tissue of obese patients. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify fat fraction (FF) and T1 relaxation time by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and compare the resulting values with the preoperative ones. Corresponding MRI data were available from 23 patients (16 females and 7 males) that had undergone MRI before (M0) and one month after (M1) bariatric surgery. Patients were 22–59 years old (mean age 44.3 years) and their BMI ranged from 35.7–54.6 kg/m2 (mean BMI 44.6 kg/m2) at M0. Total visceral AT volumes (VVAT-T, in L) were measured by semi-automatic segmentation of axial MRI images acquired between diaphragm and femoral heads. MRI FF and T1 relaxation times were measured in well-defined regions of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue using two custom-made analysis tools. Average BMI values were 45.4 kg/m2 at time point M0 and 42.4 kg/m2 at M1. Corresponding VVAT-T values were 5.94 L and 5.33 L. Intraindividual differences in both BMI and VVAT-T were highly significant (p<0.001). Average relaxation times T1VAT were 303.7 ms at M0 and 316.9 ms at M1 (p<0.001). Corresponding T1SAT times were 283.2 ms and 280.7 ms (p = 0.137). Similarly, FFVAT differences (M0: 85.7%, M1: 83.4%) were significant (p <0.01) whereas FFSAT differences (M0: 86.1, M1: 85.9%) were not significant (p = 0.517). In conclusion, bariatric surgery is apparently not only related to a significant reduction in common parameters of adipose tissue distribution, here BMI and total visceral fat volume, but also significant changes in T1 relaxation time and fat fraction of visceral adipose tissue. Such quantitative MRI measures may potentially serve as independent biomarkers for longitudinal and cross-sectional measurements in obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2950394922,"Measles is a highly transmissible disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children under 5 globally. While the use of ongoing surveillance data and-recently-dynamic models offer insight on measles dynamics, both suffer notable shortcomings when applied to measles outbreak prediction. In this paper, we apply the Sequential Monte Carlo approach of particle filtering, incorporating reported measles incidence for Saskatchewan during the pre-vaccination era, using an adaptation of a previously contributed measles compartmental model. To secure further insight, we also perform particle filtering on an age structured adaptation of the model in which the population is divided into two interacting age groups-children and adults. The results indicate that, when used with a suitable dynamic model, particle filtering can offer high predictive capacity for measles dynamics and outbreak occurrence in a low vaccination context. We have investigated five particle filtering models in this project. Based on the most competitive model as evaluated by predictive accuracy, we have performed prediction and outbreak classification analysis. The prediction results demonstrate that this model could predict measles outbreak evolution and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.89). We conclude that anticipating the outbreak dynamics of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported case counts, is a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in estimating risk and magnitude of measles outbreaks. It is to be emphasized that particle filtering supports estimation of (via sampling from) the entire state of the dynamic model-both latent and observable-for each point in time. Such approach offers a particularly strong value proposition for other pathogens with little-known dynamics, critical latent drivers, and in the context of the growing number of high-velocity electronic data sources. Strong additional benefits are also likely to be realized from extending the application of this technique to highly vaccinated populations."
https://openalex.org/W2898710281,"Vocal signals often play an important role in synchronizing the activities of group members, coordinating decisions about when and where to travel, and facilitating social interactions in which there are potential conflicts of interest. Here, we show that when female olive baboons (Papio anubis) give low amplitude grunts after approaching other females, they are less likely to behave aggressively toward their partners and more likely to handle their partners' infants and interact affiliatively with them. In addition, females are more likely to grunt after they approach lower ranking females than after they approach higher ranking females and are less likely to grunt after they approach their own mothers and daughters than after they approach other females. These patterns, which are strikingly similar to patterns previously reported in chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) support the hypothesis that grunts function as signals of benign intent. Moreover, they suggest that actors' decisions about whether to grunt or remain silent are influenced by the social context, particularly their partners' likely response to their approach. Taken together, the patterning of grunts in olive and chacma baboon suggests that these vocalizations play an important in reducing uncertainty about actors' intentions and facilitate nonaggressive social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2899478481,"As the world's population ages, the number of people receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been on the rise. Although patients with diabetes mellitus are known to face greater risks of TKA postoperative infection and revision TKA owing to diabetic complications, studies on whether such patients' participation in pay for performance (P4P) programs influences the incidence rates of TKA postoperative infection or revision TKA are still lacking. This study examined the 2002-2012 data of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of diabetic patients over 50 years old who have received TKA. To reduce any selection bias between patients joining and not joining the P4P program, propensity score matching was applied. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the influence of the P4P program on TKA postoperative infection and revision TKA, and the results indicate that joining P4P lowered the risk of postoperative infection (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.77-1.08), however, which was not statistically significant, and significantly lowered the risk of revision TKA (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.72). Being younger and male, having multiple comorbid conditions or greater diabetic severity, receiving care at regional or public hospitals, and not having a diagnosis of degenerative or rheumatoid arthritis were identified as factors for higher risk of TKA postoperative infection for patients with diabetes. As for the risk of revision TKA, postoperative infection and being younger were identified as factors for a significantly higher risk (p < 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2898720493,"Interaction of medical students with the pharmaceutical industry is common. However, students are thought to be vulnerable to the influence of this interaction, and regulations to limit such interactions are required. The Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association revised its promotion code in 2013 and specified upper limits for promotional aids. We aimed to investigate whether Japanese medical students’ interactions with the pharmaceutical industry changed from 2012 to 2016. This study solicited the participation of all medical schools in Japan. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was administered to medical students from May 2016 to March 2017 to investigate their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. The results were compared with those of a previous study conducted in 2012. Forty of the 80 medical schools in Japan participated. The student response rate was 74.1%, with 6771 (3395 preclinical, 3376 clinical) evaluable responses. More than 98% of clinical students had previously accepted stationery, a brochure, or a lunch, and significantly higher percentages of clinical students had accepted these items in 2016 than in 2012 (p < .001). The interactions between clinical students and pharmaceutical companies increased slightly between 2012 and 2016. This study will hopefully promote discussion regarding the regulation of student–industry interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2899200404,"Valuable information about cardiovascular system can be derived from the shape of aortic pulse wave being the result of reciprocal interaction between heart and vasculature. Pressure profiles in ascending aorta were obtained from peripheral waveforms recorded non-invasively (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Australia) before, during and after hemodialysis sessions performed after 3-day and 2-day interdialytic intervals in 35 anuric, prevalent hemodialysis patients. Fluid status was assessed by Body Composition Monitor (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) and online hematocrit monitoring device (CritLine, HemaMetrics, Utah). Systolic pressure and ejection duration decreased during dialysis. Augmentation index remained stable at 30 ± 13% throughout hemodialysis session despite the decrease of augmented pressure and pulse height. Subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) determined after 3-day and 2-day interdialytic intervals increased during the sessions by 43.8 ± 26.6% and 26.1 ± 25.4%, respectively. Hemodialysis performed after 3-day and 2-day interdialytic periods reduced significantly overhydration by 2.4 ± 1.0 L and 1.8 ± 1.2 L and blood volume by 16.3 ± 9.7% and 13.7 ± 8.9%, respectively. Intradialytic increase of SEVR correlated with ultrafiltration rate (R = 0.39, p-value < 0.01), reduction in overhydration (R = -0.57, p-value < 0.001) and blood volume drop (R = -0.38, p-value < 0.01). The strong correlation between the decrease of overhydration during hemodialysis and increase in SEVR confirmed that careful fluid management is crucial for proper cardiac function. Hemodialysis affected cardiovascular system with the parameters derived from pulse-wave-analysis (systolic and augmented pressures, pulse height, ejection duration, SEVR) being significantly different at the end of dialysis from those before the session. Combination of pulse-wave-analysis with the monitoring of overhydration provides a new insight into the impact of hemodialysis on cardiovascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2898622761,"There are few studies examining the association between blood pressure (BP) and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in consideration of the new hypertension guidelines in China.Data were drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. 14 390 eligible participants (aged 45 years and older) were selected through four-stage, stratified, and cluster sampling. Hypertension was considered as a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 mm Hg (old definition: 140 mm Hg) or higher, a mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80 mm Hg (old definition: 90 mm Hg) or higher or taking anti-hypertensive medication. Cochran-Armitage trend test and logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the association between BP level and NCDs.The prevalence of hypertension based on the latest definition was 56.35% (while by old definition: 42.75%). The awareness, treatment, and control among hypertensive participants were 38.62% (51.18%), 43.10% (56.81%), and 9.91% (13.06%), respectively. An increasing rate of NCDs (diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and memory-related disease) among participants were found with the ascending of BP level. After adjusted for demographics and behavioral risks, the following 3 NCDs had been shown to correlate with hypertension: diabetes (adjusted OR 1.15, 0.91-1.45 for elevated BP; 1.20, 0.97-1.49 for hypertension stage 1; 1.55, 1.28-1.86 hypertension stage 2), heart disease (0.94, 0.79-1.12; 1.05, 0.90-1.22; 1.28, 1.12-1.47), and stroke (1.77, 1.25-2.51; 1.32, 0.93-1.87; 1.85, 1.37-2.49).The association between hypertension and the risk of NCDs is of concern in China. The combined efforts on NCDs prevention and lowered blood pressure should be made by nationally integrated strategies, especially in middle-aged and older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2898985870,"Carboxypeptidase O (CPO) is a member of the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases with a preference for the cleavage of C-terminal acidic amino acids. CPO is largely expressed in the small intestine, although it has been detected in other tissues such as the brain and ovaries. CPO does not contain a prodomain, nor is it strongly regulated by pH, and hence appears to exist as a constitutively active enzyme. The goal of this study was to investigate the intracellular distribution and activity of CPO in order to predict physiological substrates and function. The distribution of CPO, when expressed in MDCK cells, was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Soon after addition of nutrient-rich media, CPO was found to associate with lipid droplets, causing an increase in lipid droplet quantity. As media became depleted, CPO moved to a broader ER distribution, no longer impacting lipid droplet numbers. Membrane cholesterol levels played a role in the distribution and in vitro enzymatic activity of CPO, with cholesterol enrichment leading to decreased lipid droplet association and enzymatic activity. The ability of CPO to cleave C-terminal amino acids within the early secretory pathway (in vivo) was examined using Gaussia luciferase as a substrate, C-terminally tagged with variants of an ER retention signal. While no effect of cholesterol was observed, these data show that CPO does function as an active enzyme within the ER where it removes C-terminal glutamates and aspartates, as well as a number of polar amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2899063505,"The California Tobacco-Use Prevention Education (TUPE) program promotes the use of evidence-based tobacco-specific prevention and cessation programs for adolescents within the school setting. Through a competitive grant process, schools are funded to provide programs for grades 6-12. This research evaluates the association between TUPE funding and tobacco prevention activities and tobacco use prevalence.This study utilized two data sources: (1) 2016 California Educator Tobacco Survey (CETS), and (2) 2015-2016 California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS). The CETS collected data from educators about school prevention efforts, priority of tobacco prevention, and confidence in addressing tobacco issues with students. A total of 3,564 educators from 590 schools participated in CETS. The CSTS collected data from 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in California on their exposure to, attitudes about, and utilization of tobacco products. A total of 47,981 students from 117 schools participated in CSTS.This study found that TUPE-funded schools were more likely to provide tobacco-specific health education programs, to place a priority on tobacco-prevention efforts, and to prepare educators to address tobacco use than non-TUPE schools. Educators at both types of schools felt better prepared to talk with students about traditional tobacco products than about emerging products such as e-cigarettes. Overall, students at TUPE-funded schools were more likely to report receiving anti-tobacco messages from school-based programs than those at non-TUPE schools. The former were also less likely to use tobacco products, even when the analysis controlled for demographics and school-level characteristics (OR = 0.82 [95% CI = 0.70-0.96]).TUPE funding was associated with an increase in schools' tobacco-specific prevention activities and these enhanced activities were associated with lower tobacco use among students. This study also found that education and prevention efforts regarding emerging tobacco products need to be strengthened across all schools."
https://openalex.org/W2899214292,"The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of resistance training frequency on cognitive inhibitory control in young adults with previous experience in the modality. Male participants (N = 36) were randomly placed into one of three experimental groups. Participants performed resistance training 1 (F1), 2 (F2), and 3 (F3) times per week for 24 weeks. The three groups performed exercises of equal intensity, volume-load, and rest duration. Cognitive inhibitory control (via Stroop test) was tested 72 h before (pre-experiment) and 72 h after (post-experiment) the resistance training program. No time vs. group interaction effects were noted for accuracy (F(4, 29) = 3.57, p = 0.18) or response time (F(4, 29) = 2.61, p = 0.06) on the Stroop test. These results indicate that increased resistance training frequency, when volume-load is kept constant, does not appear to potentiate cognitive inhibitory control."
https://openalex.org/W2899193218,"International medical donation programs can help alleviate the burden of illness and serve as a safety net for the global health care system. However, to our knowledge no studies have assessed the number of individuals served through medical donation programs. As such, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Americares Foundation's (Americares) medical donation program in terms of the number of patients served.We conducted an outcome evaluation study in 34 health facilities in 10 countries that receive medical donations from Americares. Medical records were randomly sampled at each participating facility and evaluated for types of medications and number of courses of prescribed treatments. Facility level data and donation inventory data were also collected. We developed an algorithm for converting quantities of donated medicines into the number of individuals served at the facility level. These estimates were then extrapolated to the country and region levels to assess the total impact of medications donated in 2015. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to derive 95% credible ranges for projected estimates and to assess model uncertainty.Records of 3,205 unique patients were reviewed, encompassing 10,449 medical visits. The average number of medications and courses of treatments prescribed per visit were 2.63 and 2.68, respectively. The average medication destruction rate ranged from 0% to 24% at facilities, with a cross-country average of 7%. For the 10 countries included in the study, we project that 700,377 unique individuals were served through the program (95% credible range: 518,401-905,982). Scaled across all regions receiving Americares donations, we project that the program supported an estimated 5.1 million beneficiaries, including 484,188 chronic care and 4.65 million acute care patients.This study provides a novel methodology for medical donation programs seeking to estimate one of their key outcomes-patients served-and global reach. Rigorous assessments of program outcomes can provide important insights into the value of medical donation initiatives.Human subjects approval was received from the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (Approval #52316; 7/19/2016)."
