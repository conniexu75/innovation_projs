https://openalex.org/W2051863153,"ALTHOUGH the identification of Pseudomonas pyocyanea is generally very simple, the diagnosis of ‘atypical’ strains may take several days, and, as Schaub and Foley1 stress, “its identification may present a problem”. Yow and Townsend2, in their study on the sensitivity of Ps. pyocyanea to various antibiotics, limit the scope of their examinations: “Because of the difficulty in positively identifying the non-pigment-producing strains of Pseudomonas, only those producing either pyocyanin, fluorescin, or both, were included in this study”. However, apyocyanogenic strains are common. These strains are either primarily deficient in producing pigment or may have lost their ability to do so. Haynes3 therefore points out: “Strains not producing pyocyanin, from whatever source, cannot be dismissed from consideration as Ps. pyocyanea.”"

https://openalex.org/W2056053337,"THE introduction of n-butyl and methyl meth-acrylates as embedding media1 constituted an important development in the preparation of ultra-thin sections of biological material; but their use is attended by various major difficulties. Shrinkage occurs on polymerization, hard objects are not penetrated by the monomer so that the plastic shrinks away and does not provide sufficient support, and sometimes there is an unaccountable appearance of bubbles around the specimen. Moreover, the polymerization process is not uniform and sometimes causes severe damage. This is perhaps most strikingly seen in bacteria where often only empty remnants of cell walls remain."

https://openalex.org/W2024505912,"IT has recently been found1 that ferrets, normally anœstrous during winter, become œstrous in January and February within 3–4 weeks after electrolytic lesions have been made in the anterior hypothalamus. The hypothesis was advanced that some hypothalamic mechanism may normally inhibit the pituitary secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone in sexually quiescent individuals, for example, (a) during the anœstrum of seasonally breeding animals and (b) during infancy. Interference with such a mechanism by destruction of hypothalamic tissue might promote the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and so induce sexual activity. The suggestion that inhibition of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion is normally exerted during infancy has now been tested on a series of immature rats."

https://openalex.org/W2094200210,"X-RAY crystallographic studies by Engström and his collaborators1,2 have shown that the apatite crystallites of bone have linear dimensions of about 220 A. × 65 A. The crystals were aligned with their long axis parallel to the collagen fibre axis, and it was suggested that there may be three such inorganic crystals for each 640 A. period of the collagen fibril. In a recent communication, Fernández-Morán and Engström3 observed a “predominance of rod- or needle-shaped apatite particles 30–40 A. wide and about 200 A. long” in thin sections of bone by means of electron microscopy. This result is in reasonable agreement with those obtained by X-ray diffraction ; but no evidence is offered that the regions of higher density present in the micrographs (which appear to have reproduced badly) were in fact due to apatite. Nor is it clear whether electron microscopy has provided any further evidence as to the manner of alignment of the particles, for Robinson and Watson4 have identified apatite in thin sections of bone by means of electron diffraction, and have indicated that the particles were deposited on the ‘doublet’ band region of the period of the fibril."

https://openalex.org/W1974362733,"THE sheep ked is an obligate blood-sucking ectoparasite of sheep; its life-history is well known and has been described by various authors, notably Evans1. Hoare2 has described the life-history of Trypanosoma melophagium Flu. and its relation to the ked. The crithidial stage of the flagellate is a normal inhabitant of the midgut of the insect. Crithidia are attached by their flagella to the epithelium of the posterior half of the midgut, and small numbers may be found in the gut lumen. Small masses of the metacyclic, or infective, stage may be seen adhering to the wall of the iliac bulb (rectum) or free in the contents of the bulb."

https://openalex.org/W2001475798,"PONTECORVO and his co-workers1 have demonstrated that, by the use of appropriate selection techniques, heterozygous diploids can be secured from heterocaryons of Aspergillus nidulans. Further, these diploids produced, on cultivation, recombinants by both somatic crossing-over2 and somatic reduction. Later, similar results were obtained with the asexual strains, Aspergillus niger 3 and Penicillium chrysogenum 4. I have succeeded in producing heterozygous diploids in the asexual fungi A. sojae and A. oryzae by the use of similar methods. These diploids also showed somatic segregation and yielded recombinations of the original genotypes. First-order segregations showed further segregation upon cultivation. Only a few segregants have been analysed and all proved to be still diploid in having double the haploid amount of deoxyribonucleic acid per nucleus. Their occurrence can be explained by the same type of somatic crossing-over as that discussed by Pontecorvo5 and originally discovered by Stern6."
https://openalex.org/W1996865200,"IN a recent communication1 results were presented challenging the generally accepted theory that secretion-rate in the dairy cow declines with time in the interval between successive milkings. These Ruakura experiments showed that secretion-rate was constant up to 20–24 hr. It was suggested that, under a twice-a-day milking regime, unequal intervals of considerable magnitude might be employed without any significant difference in milk yield due to direct pressure effects."
https://openalex.org/W2021267049,"STUDIES in this laboratory1,2 have recently shown that orotic acid is a factor for growth and survival in rats depleted of the animal protein factor of casein. Also, vitamin B12 has a protective effect on the deficiency in animal protein factor3. This indicates a relationship, from a nutritional point of view, between vitamin B12 and orotic acid. In the present communication the direct influence of orotic acid upon the deficiency of vitamin B12 is reported."

https://openalex.org/W2062557455,"THE existence of a sex difference in the morphology of intermitotic nuclei may be of importance, not only anatomically and clinically, but also for its value as an additional method of sex determination in forensic medicine. We have already shown1,2 that the presence of sex chromatin in the female nucleus can be utilized to determine the sex of unfixed human tissues which have been immersed in water or exposed to atmospheres of varying humidity and temperature. This nuclear feature persists for a period of 2–3 weeks, depending on the nature of the environment in which the tissues decompose."

https://openalex.org/W2020059517,"TEN female rabbits were used in this experiment, three immature, three œstrous and four pseudopregnant. The rabbits were rendered pseudopregnant by electrical stimulation of the uterine cervix with a 4.5-V. tetanic current. They were then kept until the eighth day, when the corpus luteum is fully developed1. The reproductive state was confirmed by histological examination of the ovaries."

https://openalex.org/W2063039019,"WE have recently directed attention to the fact that citrate antagonizes reserpine inhibition of contractions induced in the guinea pig ileum by acetylcholine chloride, histamine acid phosphate, serotonin and barium chloride1. A consideration of the general pharmacology of reserpine has led us to believe that this substance may have a general non-specific depressant effect upon contractile tissue1,2."
https://openalex.org/W1967954005,"THERE have been many investigations of the bactericidal action of unsaturated fatty acids against tubercle bacilli1; but the mechanism of the effect still remains obscure. I have examined the action of oleic acid on Mycobacterium avium (Takeo strain) by Warburg and Thunberg's method, colony count and electron microscope."
https://openalex.org/W1972024602,"Very little is known about immunity in relation to malignant disease. In animals there is evidence that resistance develops to transplanted tumours. Lumsden1 and his co-workers were of the opinion that this resistance was due to the appearance in the serum of certain antibodies. They found that the serum of rats bearing the Jensen rat sarcoma contains a cytotoxin which is greatest in amount in those rats in which tumour regression afterwards occurs. In the human subject the development of humoral resistance to malignant tumours has not been proved conclusively. A number of workers have investigated the serum gamma-globulin-level in patients with malignant disease. Their results can be taken as a measure of the antibody-level since most antibodies are found in association with the gamma-globulin fraction of the serum protein. Petermann and Hogness2 found that the serum gamma-globulin-level, as estimated by electrophoresis at pH. 8.6, was normal in twenty-five patients with carcinoma of the stomach. Miller and Erf3, using a similar method, found that the serum gamma-globulin was raised in twenty-four patients with carcinoma of the gastro-intestinal tract or breast."
https://openalex.org/W2010282818,"CONSIDERABLE interest has been aroused in 1-phenazinol because of its relatively high antibiotic activity, as brought out in numerous reports, such as in that by Zweig1. The methods generally advocated for its preparation, however, are not very satisfactory. Thus the procedures of Surrey2, and of Hegedüs3, are time-consuming, while the preparation through pyocyanine obtained from Pseudomonas pyocyanea cultures suffers from low yield of the pyocyanine1. Poor yield, in this instance of the intermediate 1-methoxyphenazine, also hampers the preparation of 1-phenazinol given by Yoshioka4."
