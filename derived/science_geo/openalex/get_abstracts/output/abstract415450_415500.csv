https://openalex.org/W2062062519,"To identify somatic mutations in pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), we performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from seven DIPGs and matched germline tissue and targeted sequencing of an additional 43 DIPGs and 36 non-brainstem pediatric glioblastomas (non-BS-PGs). We found that 78% of DIPGs and 22% of non-BS-PGs contained a mutation in H3F3A, encoding histone H3.3, or in the related HIST1H3B, encoding histone H3.1, that caused a p.Lys27Met amino acid substitution in each protein. An additional 14% of non-BS-PGs had somatic mutations in H3F3A causing a p.Gly34Arg alteration."

We conducted influenza infection studies in healthy volunteers with no detectable antibodies to the challenge viruses H3N2 or H1N1. We mapped T cell responses to influenza before and during infection. We found a large increase in influenza-specific T cell responses by day 7, when virus was completely cleared from nasal samples and serum antibodies were still undetectable. Preexisting CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells responding to influenza internal proteins were associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness. These CD4+ cells also responded to pandemic H1N1 (A/CA/07/2009) peptides and showed evidence of cytotoxic activity. These cells are an important statistical correlate of homotypic and heterotypic response and may limit severity of influenza infection by new strains in the absence of specific antibody responses. Our results provide information that may aid the design of future vaccines against emerging influenza strains."

They identify five amino acid positions in HLA-DRβ1, HLA-B and HLA-DPβ1 that together can explain most of the MHC association to seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. The genetic association of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to rheumatoid arthritis risk has commonly been attributed to alleles in HLA-DRB1. However, debate persists about the identity of the causal variants in HLA-DRB1 and the presence of independent effects elsewhere in the MHC. Using existing genome-wide SNP data in 5,018 individuals with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (cases) and 14,974 unaffected controls, we imputed and tested classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms in HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, as well as 3,117 SNPs across the MHC. Conditional and haplotype analyses identified that three amino acid positions (11, 71 and 74) in HLA-DRβ1 and single–amino-acid polymorphisms in HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPβ1 (at position 9), which are all located in peptide-binding grooves, almost completely explain the MHC association to rheumatoid arthritis risk. This study shows how imputation of functional variation from large reference panels can help fine map association signals in the MHC."

https://openalex.org/W2034742459,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is central to research in molecular, cell and developmental biology, but nearly all of this research has been conducted on a single strain of C. elegans. Little is known about the population genomic and evolutionary history of this species. We characterized C. elegans genetic variation using high-throughput selective sequencing of a worldwide collection of 200 wild strains and identified 41,188 SNPs. Notably, C. elegans genome variation is dominated by a set of commonly shared haplotypes on four of its six chromosomes, each spanning many megabases. Population genetic modeling showed that this pattern was generated by chromosome-scale selective sweeps that have reduced variation worldwide; at least one of these sweeps probably occurred in the last few hundred years. These sweeps, which we hypothesize to be a result of human activity, have drastically reshaped the global C. elegans population in the recent past."
https://openalex.org/W1990739246,"MLL fusion genes often encode leukemogenic proteins that depend on interaction with menin, a component of the MLL SET1-like histone methyltransferase complex. MI-2 and MI-3 are the first small molecules that can block menin–MLL fusion protein interaction and their oncogenic effects in cells. Translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene result in human acute leukemias with very poor prognosis. The leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins is critically dependent on their direct interaction with menin, a product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) gene. Here we present what are to our knowledge the first small-molecule inhibitors of the menin–MLL fusion protein interaction that specifically bind menin with nanomolar affinities. These compounds effectively reverse MLL fusion protein–mediated leukemic transformation by downregulating the expression of target genes required for MLL fusion protein oncogenic activity. They also selectively block proliferation and induce both apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia cells harboring MLL translocations. Identification of these compounds provides a new tool for better understanding MLL-mediated leukemogenesis and represents a new approach for studying the role of menin as an oncogenic cofactor of MLL fusion proteins. Our findings also highlight a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive leukemias with MLL rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2066199795,"Genome-wide association studies have revealed that common noncoding variants in MTNR1B (encoding melatonin receptor 1B, also known as MT(2)) increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk(1,2). Although the strongest association signal was highly significant (P < 1 × 10(-20)), its contribution to T2D risk was modest (odds ratio (OR) of ∼1.10-1.15)(1-3). We performed large-scale exon resequencing in 7,632 Europeans, including 2,186 individuals with T2D, and identified 40 nonsynonymous variants, including 36 very rare variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1%), associated with T2D (OR = 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.78-6.18; P = 1.64 × 10(-4)). A four-tiered functional investigation of all 40 mutants revealed that 14 were non-functional and rare (MAF < 1%), and 4 were very rare with complete loss of melatonin binding and signaling capabilities. Among the very rare variants, the partial- or total-loss-of-function variants but not the neutral ones contributed to T2D (OR = 5.67, CI = 2.17-14.82; P = 4.09 × 10(-4)). Genotyping the four complete loss-of-function variants in 11,854 additional individuals revealed their association with T2D risk (8,153 individuals with T2D and 10,100 controls; OR = 3.88, CI = 1.49-10.07; P = 5.37 × 10(-3)). This study establishes a firm functional link between MTNR1B and T2D risk."
https://openalex.org/W1980679874,"Using direct recordings in monkeys, the authors find that theta-band synchronization between V4 and prefrontal cortex is likely to be important for the maintenance of short-term visual memory. These synchronizations provide a means for distant cortical areas to communicate with each other during the performance of a cognitive task. Short-term memory requires communication between multiple brain regions that collectively mediate the encoding and maintenance of sensory information. It has been suggested that oscillatory synchronization underlies intercortical communication. Yet, whether and how distant cortical areas cooperate during visual memory remains elusive. We examined neural interactions between visual area V4 and the lateral prefrontal cortex using simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings and single-unit activity (SUA) in monkeys performing a visual short-term memory task. During the memory period, we observed enhanced between-area phase synchronization in theta frequencies (3–9 Hz) of LFPs together with elevated phase locking of SUA to theta oscillations across regions. In addition, we found that the strength of intercortical locking was predictive of the animals' behavioral performance. This suggests that theta-band synchronization coordinates action potential communication between V4 and prefrontal cortex that may contribute to the maintenance of visual short-term memories."
https://openalex.org/W2137751769,"The role of TGF-β signaling in tumorigenesis is paradoxical: it can be tumor suppressive or tumor promotional, depending on context. The metastatic regulator, Six1, was recently shown to mediate this switch, providing a novel means to explain this elusive 'TGF-β paradox'. Herein, we identify a mechanism by which Six1 activates the tumor promotional arm of TGF-β signaling, via its ability to upregulate the miR-106b-25 microRNA cluster, and further identify a novel function for this cluster of microRNAs. Although expression of the miR-106b-25 cluster is known to overcome TGF-β-mediated growth suppression via targeting p21 and BIM, we demonstrate for the first time that this same cluster can additionally target the inhibitory Smad7 protein, resulting in increased levels of the TGF-β type I receptor and downstream activation of TGF-β signaling. We further show that the miR-106b-25 cluster is sufficient to induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and a tumor initiating cell phenotype, and that it is required downstream of Six1 to induce these phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate a significant correlation between miR-106b, Six1, and activated TGF-β signaling in human breast cancers, and further show that high levels of miR-106b and miR-93 in breast tumors significantly predicts shortened time to relapse. These findings expand the spectrum of oncogenic functions of miR-106b-25, and may provide a novel molecular explanation, through the Six1 regulated miR-106b-25 cluster, by which TGF-β signaling shifts from tumor suppressive to tumor promoting."
https://openalex.org/W2024145520,"There is enormous interest to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) for clinical treatment because these cells are highly tumorigenic and resistant to chemotherapy. Oct4 is expressed by CSC-like cells in different types of cancer. However, function of Oct4 in tumor cells is unclear. In this study, we showed that expression of Oct4 gene or transmembrane delivery of Oct4 protein promoted dedifferentiation of melanoma cells to CSC-like cells. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells showed significantly decreased expression of melanocytic markers and acquired the ability to form tumor spheroids. They showed markedly increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and hypoxic injury. In the subcutaneous xenograft and tail vein injection assays, these cells had significantly increased tumorigenic capacity. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells acquired features associated with CSCs such as multipotent differentiation capacity and expression of melanoma CSC markers such as ABCB5 and CD271. Mechanistically, Oct4-induced dedifferentiation was associated with increased expression of endogenous Oct4, Nanog and Klf4, and global gene expression changes that enriched for transcription factors. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Oct4 in dedifferentiated cells led to diminished CSC phenotypes. Oct4 expression in melanoma was regulated by hypoxia and its expression was detected in a sub-population of melanoma cells in clinical samples. Our data indicate that Oct4 is a positive regulator of tumor dedifferentiation. The results suggest that CSC phenotype is dynamic and may be acquired through dedifferentiation. Oct4-mediated tumor cell dedifferentiation may have an important role during tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1993320949,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) shows frequent inactivation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) –tumor-suppressor gene. Recent studies have documented that the Hippo signaling pathway, a downstream cascade of Merlin (a product of NF2), has a key role in organ size control and carcinogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. We previously reported that MMs show overexpression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator, the main downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which results from the inactivation of NF2, LATS2 and/or SAV1 genes (the latter two encoding core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway) or amplification of YAP itself. However, the detailed roles of YAP remain unclear, especially the target genes of YAP that enhance MM cell growth and survival. Here, we demonstrated that YAP-knockdown inhibited cell motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth as well as cell proliferation of MM cells in vitro. We analyzed genes commonly regulated by YAP in three MM cell lines with constitutive YAP-activation, and found that the major subsets of YAP-upregulating genes encode cell cycle regulators. Among them, YAP directly induced the transcription of CCND1 and FOXM1, in cooperation with TEAD transcription factor. We also found that knockdown of CCND1 and FOXM1 suppressed MM cell proliferation, although the inhibitory effects were less evident than those of YAP knockdown. These results indicate that constitutive YAP activation in MM cells promotes cell cycle progression giving more aggressive phenotypes to MM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075447540,"Aneuploidy--the state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes--is a hallmark of cancer and a feature identified in yeast from diverse habitats. Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions. Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly. Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Short-term exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress."
https://openalex.org/W2090139119,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from palm civets has twice evolved the capacity to infect humans by gaining binding affinity for human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets. Why these mutations were naturally selected or how SARS-CoV evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood, presenting evolutionary and epidemic conundrums. In this study, we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition, an important determinant of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, functional, and crystallographic approaches, we elucidated the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected RBD mutations. These mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce unfavorable interactions with two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2, and by doing so, they enhance viral interactions with either human (hACE2) or civet (cACE2) ACE2. Therefore, these mutations were viral adaptations to either hACE2 or cACE2. To corroborate the above analysis, we designed and characterized two optimized RBDs. The human-optimized RBD contains all of the hACE2-adapted residues (Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 but relative low affinity for cACE2. The civet-optimized RBD contains all of the cACE2-adapted residues (Tyr-442, Pro-472, Arg-479, Gly-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for cACE2 and also substantial affinity for hACE2. These results not only illustrate the detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation by SARS-CoV but also provide a molecular and structural basis for tracking future SARS-CoV evolution in animals.

https://openalex.org/W2074369549,"Slit and NTRK-like family member (Slitrk) proteins are known to have typical peptide signatures for synaptogenic cell adhesion. This study reveals a specific function of Slitrk3 and tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPδ transynaptic interaction in inhibitory synaptogenesis and excitatory and inhibitory balance. Balanced development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is required for normal brain function, and an imbalance in this development may underlie the pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Compared with the many identified trans-synaptic adhesion complexes that organize excitatory synapses, little is known about the organizers that are specific for inhibitory synapses. We found that Slit and NTRK-like family member 3 (Slitrk3) actS as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that selectively regulates inhibitory synapse development via trans-interaction with axonal tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPδ. When expressed in fibroblasts, Slitrk3 triggered only inhibitory presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of co-cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Recombinant Slitrk3 preferentially localized to inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Slitrk3-deficient mice exhibited decreases in inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapse number and function in hippocampal CA1 neurons and exhibited increased seizure susceptibility and spontaneous epileptiform activity. Slitrk3 required trans-interaction with axonal PTPδ to induce inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. These results identify Slitrk3-PTPδ as an inhibitory-specific trans-synaptic organizing complex that is required for normal functional GABAergic synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W2119745788,"Leprosy provides a model to investigate mechanisms of immune regulation in humans, given that the disease forms a spectrum of clinical presentations that correlate with host immune responses. Here we identified 13 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the lesions of subjects with progressive lepromatous (L-lep) versus the self-limited tuberculoid (T-lep) disease. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of L-lep-specific miRNAs that preferentially target key immune genes downregulated in L-lep versus T-lep lesions. The most differentially expressed miRNA in L-lep lesions, hsa-mir-21, was upregulated in Mycobacterium leprae-infected monocytes. By directly downregulating Toll-like receptor 2/1 heterodimer (TLR2/1)-induced CYP27B1 and IL1B expression as well as indirectly upregulating interleukin-10 (IL-10), hsa-mir-21 inhibited expression of the genes encoding two vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial peptides, CAMP and DEFB4A. Conversely, knockdown of hsa-mir-21 in M. leprae-infected monocytes enhanced expression of CAMP and DEFB4A and restored TLR2/1-mediated antimicrobial activity against M. leprae. Therefore, the ability of M. leprae to upregulate hsa-mir-21 targets multiple genes associated with the immunologically localized disease form, providing an effective mechanism to escape from the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2002287591,"Structures of the amino-terminal region of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 with and without InsP3 bound reveal two discrete interfaces between the InsP3-binding core and suppressor domain that are similar to and functionally interchangeable with those in the equivalent domains of ryanodine receptor 1. Almost all known responses to the stimuli that evoke Ca2+ release from intracellular stores are mediated by two families of intracellular Ca2+ channels: inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). The structures of the amino-terminal region of InsP3R1 have now been determined with and without IP3 bound. Two discrete inter-domain interfaces are present, a feature also seen in a previously published structure of RyR1. The physiological importance of one of these interfaces was confirmed by mutagenesis. This work has implications for the study of known disease-causing mutations in ryanodine receptors. Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are tetrameric intracellular Ca2+ channels1. In each of these receptor families, the pore, which is formed by carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains, is regulated by signals that are detected by large cytosolic structures. InsP3R gating is initiated by InsP3 binding to the InsP3-binding core (IBC, residues 224–604 of InsP3R1)2 and it requires the suppressor domain (SD, residues 1–223 of InsP3R1)2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we present structures of the amino-terminal region (NT, residues 1–604) of rat InsP3R1 with (3.6 Å) and without (3.0 Å) InsP3 bound. The arrangement of the three NT domains, SD, IBC-β and IBC-α, identifies two discrete interfaces (α and β) between the IBC and SD. Similar interfaces occur between equivalent domains (A, B and C) in RyR1 (ref. 9). The orientations of the three domains when docked into a tetrameric structure of InsP3R10 and of the ABC domains docked into RyR9 are remarkably similar. The importance of the α-interface for activation of InsP3R and RyR is confirmed by mutagenesis and, for RyR, by disease-causing mutations9,11,12. Binding of InsP3 causes partial closure of the clam-like IBC, disrupting the β-interface and pulling the SD towards the IBC. This reorients an exposed SD loop (‘hotspot’ (HS) loop) that is essential for InsP3R activation7. The loop is conserved in RyR and includes mutations that are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease9,11,12. The HS loop interacts with an adjacent NT, suggesting that activation re-arranges inter-subunit interactions. The A domain of RyR functionally replaced the SD in full-length InsP3R, and an InsP3R in which its C-terminal transmembrane region was replaced by that from RyR1 was gated by InsP3 and blocked by ryanodine. Activation mechanisms are conserved between InsP3R and RyR. Allosteric modulation of two similar domain interfaces within an N-terminal subunit reorients the first domain (SD or A domain), allowing it, through interactions of the second domain of an adjacent subunit (IBC-β or B domain), to gate the pore."

https://openalex.org/W2017814607,"Excess glucose and free fatty acids delivered to adipose tissue causes local inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance. Glucose and palmitate generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipocytes, leading to monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression. Docosahexaenoate (DHA) has the opposite effect. In this study, we evaluated the potential sources of ROS in the presence of excess nutrients. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to palmitate and DHA (250 μM) in either 5 or 25 mM glucose to evaluate the relative roles of mitochondrial electron transport and NADPH oxidases (NOX) as sources of ROS. Excess glucose and palmitate did not increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, glucose exposure increased glycolysis. Of the NOX family members, only NOX4 was expressed in adipocytes. Moreover, its activity was increased by excess glucose and palmitate and decreased by DHA. Silencing NOX4 inhibited palmitate- and glucose-stimulated ROS generation and monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression. NADPH, a substrate for NOX, and pentose phosphate pathway activity increased with glucose but not palmitate and decreased with DHA exposure. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors and siRNA suppressed ROS generation and monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression induced by both glucose and palmitate. Finally, both high glucose and palmitate induced NOX4 translocation into lipid rafts, effects that were blocked by DHA. Excess glucose and palmitate generate ROS via NOX4 rather than by mitochondrial oxidation in cultured adipocytes. NOX4 is regulated by both NADPH generated in the PPP and translocation of NOX4 into lipid rafts, leading to expression of monocyte chemotactic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1968389207,"The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) initiates mitotic exit by ubiquitylating cell-cycle regulators such as cyclin B1 and securin. Lys 48-linked ubiquitin chains represent the canonical signal targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but they are not required for the degradation of cyclin B1. Lys 11-linked ubiquitin chains have been implicated in degradation of APC/C substrates, but the Lys 11-chain-forming E2 UBE2S is not essential for mitotic exit, raising questions about the nature of the ubiquitin signal that targets APC/C substrates for degradation. Here we demonstrate that multiple monoubiquitylation of cyclin B1, catalysed by UBCH10 or UBC4/5, is sufficient to target cyclin B1 for destruction by the proteasome. When the number of ubiquitylatable lysines in cyclin B1 is restricted, Lys 11-linked ubiquitin polymers elaborated by UBE2S become increasingly important. We therefore explain how a substrate that contains multiple ubiquitin acceptor sites confers flexibility in the requirement for particular E2 enzymes in modulating the rate of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Cyclin B is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by the E3 ligase APC/C, which is thought to generate polyubiquitin chains for the degradation of mitotic substrates. King and colleagues now demonstrate in Xenopus laevis extracts that multiple monoubiquitylation events are sufficient to target cyclin B1 for degradation."

Immunofluorescence microscopy detected NOX5 protein in both the flagella/neck region and the acrosome. Functionally, spermatozoa exposed to calcium ionophore, phorbol ester, or H2O2 exhibited superoxide anion production, which was blocked by addition of superoxide dismutase, a Ca2+ chelator, or inhibitors of either flavoprotein oxidases (diphenylene iododonium) or NOX enzymes (GKT136901).

Despite evidence for both physiologic and pathologic effects of ROS in spermatozoa, the identity of the ROS-producing enzyme(s) remains uncertain. reactive oxygen species 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid diphenylene iodonium NADPH oxidase NADPH oxidase NOX5 superoxide dismutase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. Numerous studies showed similarity between the ROS-producing enzyme in spermatozoa and the enzymatic system expressed in phagocytes. In these cells, the major ROS precursor is the superoxide anion, which is generated by the single-electron reduction of molecular oxygen by the NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex. NOX5 is a novel isoform of the NOX family of NADPH oxidases that is activated by the binding of Ca2+ to its cytosolic N-terminal EF-hand domains (9.Bánfi B. Molnár G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedûs B.

It is suggested that Ca2+ binding induces a conformational change leading to the interaction of the N terminus of NOX5 with its C-terminal substrate-binding and flavin-containing domains, thereby inducing ROS production (9.Bánfi B.

Among the five splice variants identified, NOX5α, NOX5β, NOX5γ, and NOX5δ (all long forms of NOX5 designated collectively as NOX5L) differ in the N-terminal sequences of their Ca2+-binding domains, whereas the truncated NOX5S (short) variant lacks the Ca2+-binding domains altogether (11.Fulton D.J.

Ball B.A. Characterization of NADPH oxidase 5 in equine testis and spermatozoa.Reproduction. 2007; 134: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that spermatozoa might express NOX5, to date there are no reports that demonstrate NOX5 expression at the protein level in human spermatozoa. Herein, we present data documenting both the expression and function of NOX5 in human spermatozoa. Human semen samples were obtained from patient donors as a part of their clinical evaluation for fertility and reproductive health status. Portions of the samples not required for clinical analyses were de-identified and made available for the research protocols described herein. Under these conditions, the Institutional Review Board determined that the study is exempt from requirements for protocol approval and informed consent. Semen was collected by masturbation into sterile plastic containers and allowed to liquefy for at least 30 min before being processed. The samples were centrifuged (500 × g, 15 min) to separate the seminal plasma from spermatozoa, and the pellet washed twice in phosphate-buffered normal saline (pH 7) with 10 mm glucose (PBS-G). The spermatozoa were then counted in a hemocytometer chamber, resuspended in PBS-G at 109/ml, and used for superoxide assays. Sperm samples containing leukocytes detected by microscopic examination were excluded from the study. For selected experiments, motile spermatozoa were collected using the swim-up procedure (22.Vijayakumar R. Ndubisi B. Prien S. De Leon F. Heine W.

Briefly, the spermatozoa were sedimented by centrifugation (500 × g, 15 min) and the tube was then incubated upright for 60 min at 37 °C. Motile spermatozoa that progressed from the pellet into the supernatant (swim-up fraction) were collected by aspiration and counted. Spermatozoa resuspended in lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4 (orthovanadate), 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were sonicated 3 times for 5 s each (20 watts). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min). Aliquots containing 60–200 μg of protein were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The filters were incubated with antibodies directed against c-Abl (Sigma, clone Abl-148 catalog number A5844), phosphotyrosine 245 c-Abl (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA; catalog number 2861), NOX5 (kindly provided by William Nauseef, University of Iowa) (24.El Jamali A.

Immunoblotting with HV1 antibody was performed using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody that recognizes the intracellular N-terminal domain of the human HV1 protein (25.Petheo G.L. Orient A. Baráth M. Kovács I. Réthi B. Lányi A. Rajki A. Rajnavölgyi E. Geiszt M. Molecular and functional characterization of Hv1 proton channel in human granulocytes.PloS One. 2010; 5: e14081Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoblots using actin antibody (Sigma, catalog number A2066) were used to control for loading. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Total protein extracts of K562, K562/NOX5, or human sperm cells prepared in buffer A (250 μg of protein) were pre-cleared with rabbit IgG (Sigma) and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated overnight with anti-NOX5, anti-HV1, or nonspecific IgG antibody as a negative control, and precipitated with protein A/G-agarose for an additional 3 h. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer, separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The filters were incubated with anti-NOX5, anti-HV1, or anti-phosphotyrosine 245 c-Abl antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For immunohistological analyses, a drop of spermatozoa suspended in PBS-G was placed on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 15 min at 4 °C. Spermatozoa were then subjected to immunostaining using the antibodies described above against NOX5, c-Abl, and phospho-Tyr245-c-Abl along with CyTM 3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Protein expression was visualized on a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). For negative controls, cells were incubated with isotype-matched control antibodies with no known specificity. Superoxide generation was measured using a luminol-based chemiluminescence assay (Diogenes reagent, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). We have previously demonstrated the specificity of this assay for superoxide versus H2O2 (24.El Jamali A. Valente A.J. Lechleiter J.D. Gamez M.J. Pearson D.W. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Novel redox-dependent regulation of NOX5 by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 868-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were suspended at 109/ml in PBS-G. A 100-μl aliquot of the Diogenes reagent was mixed with 2 × 107 spermatozoa and incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 min. Superoxide generation was measured at baseline and after stimulation with ionomycin (1 μm), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 1 μg/ml), or H2O2 (100 μm and other concentrations as indicated). Chemiluminescence was measured every 30–60 s for up to 10–15 min using a ClarityTM BioTek luminometer and an integration time of 5 s. Spermatozoa were preincubated for 5 min prior to the superoxide assay with 400 units/ml of superoxide dismutase (SOD), 10 μm diphenylene iodonium (DPI), or 100 μm BAPTA. A preincubation time of 1 h was used for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (50 μm, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). In some experiments, cells were pre-exposed to the NOX inhibitor 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine-3,6(2H,5H)-dione (GKT136901, 0.5 μm and other concentrations as indicated) for 10 min before exposure to either H2O2 or PMA. This compound, kindly provided by GenKyoTex SA (Geneva, Switzerland), is a drug-like small molecule with high affinity and specificity for NOX1 and NOX4 (26.Laleu B. Gaggini F. Orchard M.

Spermatozoa suspended in PBS-G were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (2 × 105 cells/ml) in PBS-G and loaded with 6 μm fluo-4AM and 300 nm dihydroethidine (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) 10 min before imaging. Ca2+ influx and superoxide production were recorded using a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a ×63/1.4 NA plan-apochromat objective. Fluo-4 and dihydroethidine fluorescence emissions were excited with dual laser at 488/543 nm attenuated to avoid photobleaching and saturation. Detection was through a 545-nm long-pass dichroic mirror and a band-pass filter at 500–530 for fluo-4 and LP560 for dihydroethidine. Human leukemia cells stably transfected with an empty vector (K562 cells) or a vector encoding for NOX5 (K562/NOX5) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, plus 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and the appropriate selection antibiotic. Cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were transfected with a mixture of HV1 siRNA (Sigma) or with scrambled siRNA (Sigma) using the Neon system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were tested 48 h after transfection for superoxide production and down-regulation of HV1 protein was detected by immunoblot using the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal HV1 antibody raised against an N-terminal domain of HV1 human protein (25.Petheo G.L. Orient A. Baráth M. Kovács I. Réthi B. Lányi A. Rajki A. Rajnavölgyi E. Geiszt M.

Micropipettes were pulled in several stages using a Flaming-Brown automatic pipette puller (Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA) from 7052 glass (Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA), coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI), heat polished to a tip resistance between 2 and 10 megaohms. Electrical contact with the pipette solution was achieved by a chloride silver wire. The reference electrode was made from a Ag-AgCl wire connected to the bath through an agar bridge made with Ringer solution (160 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4). Current signal from the Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was recorded on a PC through a Lab View SCB-68 (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Further data analysis was made with Origin 7.5. Seals were formed in Ringer solution in the bath, and the potential was zeroed when the pipette was in contact with the cell. Most measurements were done between 21 and 25 °C. K562 cells were transferred on chips or pipette into the recording chamber. To leave internal signaling pathways undisturbed, the perforated patch configuration was used. Low access resistance was usually reached after 5–10 min. The perforated patch recording bath and pipette solution contained 50 mm NH4+ in the form of (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Bes or Pipes buffer, and 1 mm EGTA adjusted to pH 7.0 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Solubilized amphotericin B (500 μg/ml; ∼45% purity, Sigma) was added to the pipette solution, after first dipping the tip into amphotericin-free solution. To investigate the proton channels “enhanced gating mode,” 60 nm PMA was used to stimulate the cells. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X (GFX; 3 μm) was used to revert the enhanced gating mode. Holding potential for current families measurements was −60 mV. The holding potential for test pulses applied during application of either PMA or GFX was −30 mV. Natural log transformations were performed for clinical measures of sperm production and fertility (e.g. total number of motile spermatozoa, days of abstinence) and superoxide production prior to analysis. Sperm progression and pH were recoded into three-level categorical variables ≤2, 3, >3, and <8, 8–8.5, >8.5, respectively. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate the relationship between pH (<8, 8–8.5, and >8.5) and continuous measures of sperm characteristics including superoxide production, whereas Fisher exact tests were used when the comparison was made with categorical measures of sperm characteristics. Correlations between continuous sperm characteristics and superoxide production were assessed using Spearman rank order correlations. Regression analyses were performed with sperm characteristics as the response variable and each of the ROS measures as explanatory variables. The regression models were run controlling for pH and log abstinence. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 5%. SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used throughout. A Dunnett multiple comparison test was used for many of the in vitro experiments to adjust for multiple testing when comparing several means against the mean for a common control sample. A two-sided value of p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. A lysate of pooled spermatozoa from several donors was used for immunoblot analysis with antibody specific for NOX5 or NOX2. The NOX5 antibody detected two main immunoreactive species with apparent molecular masses of ∼80 and ∼65 kDa (Fig. 1A), whereas no bands were observed using NOX2 antibody (Fig. 1A). Conversely, human neutrophil (PMN) lysates analyzed in parallel exhibited the presence of NOX2 but not NOX5. In addition, immunoblot analysis of sperm lysates using NOX1 or NOX4 antibody resulted in no detectable signals, whereas appropriate immunoreactive bands were detected in lysates of CaCo2 and kidney cells (Fig. 1A), which are known to express NOX1 and NOX4, respectively. These results suggest that the predominant NOX enzyme expressed in human spermatozoa is NOX5. Because the NOX5 antibody was generated against a GST peptide corresponding to the N terminus of NOX5, including the EF-hand domains present in the long splice variants, such as NOX5β, it was possible that the antibody detected more than one long NOX5 variant. However, because the sequence of the peptide immunogen extended 10 amino acids into the predicted N-terminal domain of the short NOX5 variant, the more rapidly migrating band could have represented NOX5S. To test this possibility we performed immunoblot analysis using anti-NOX5 and anti-Myc on lysates of K562 cells stably overexpressing either NOX5β (24.El Jamali A. Valente A.J. Lechleiter J.D. Gamez M.J. Pearson D.W. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Novel redox-dependent regulation of NOX5 by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 868-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or Myc-tagged NOX5S (construct kindly provided by Guangjie Cheng, University of Alabama at Birmingham). The data show that the NOX5 antibody recognized only NOX5β, whereas anti-Myc detected only Myc-NOX5S (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Myc-NOX5S exhibited an apparent molecular mass of ∼55 kDa, which is substantially smaller than either of the bands detected in spermatozoa. We conclude that the species recognized by anti-NOX5 in sperm lysates represent EF-hand-containing NOX5L splice variants. However, because their apparent molecular sizes do not match precisely to the NOX5β expressed in K562 cells, the exact sequences remain to be determined to identify the predominant NOX5L variants present in human spermatozoa. Immunostaining experiments confirmed the presence of NOX5 in human spermatozoa and showed its localization in the sperm flagellum, neck, and acrosome regions (Fig. 1C). These immunoblotting and immunostaining results together demonstrate for the first time that NOX5 is expressed in human spermatozoa. Because the binding of Ca2+ to N-terminal EF-hand domains activates NOX5L forms, we assessed whether NOX5 was functional in human sperm by testing the ability of intact spermatozoa to produce superoxide upon exposure to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (Fig. 2A). Using the superoxide-specific luminol-based Diogenes® reagent chemiluminescence assay (24.El Jamali A. Valente A.J. Lechleiter J.D. Gamez M.J. Pearson D.W. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Novel redox-dependent regulation of NOX5 by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 868-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we found that ionomycin induced vigorous superoxide production by human spermatozoa. The chemiluminescence signal detected was blocked by addition of SOD, the flavoprotein oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI), or the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (Fig. 2A), indicating that under these conditions we were detecting generation of superoxide anion by a Ca2+-dependent flavoprotein oxidase, such as NOX5. Similar patterns of superoxide generation and blocking agent effects were observed when spermatozoa were exposed to PMA (Fig. 2B), a potent phorbol ester activator of PKC that is known to regulate NOX5 activity (28.Jagnandan D. Church J.E. Banfi B. Stuehr D.J. Marrero M.B. Fulton D.J. Novel mechanism of activation of NADPH oxidase 5. Calcium sensitization via phosphorylation.J. Biol.

We also tested the effect of a newly described NOX inhibitor, GKT136901, to further investigate whether NOX5 accounts for Ca2+-dependent superoxide production. This compound is a potent inhibitor of both NOX1 and NOX4 (Ki = 160 ± 10 and 165 ± 5 nm, respectively) with a ∼9-fold selectivity over NOX2 (Ki = 1530 ± 90 nm) (26.Laleu B. Gaggini F. Orchard M.

They characterize five independent instances of vaccine escape recombination through capsular switches, providing insight into the role of recombination in remodeling pneumococcal genomes under selective pressure and in the population dynamics of this pathogen. Streptococcus pneumoniae ('pneumococcus') causes an estimated 14.5 million cases of serious disease and 826,000 deaths annually in children under 5 years of age1. The highly effective introduction of the PCV7 pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 in the United States2,3 provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the response of an important pathogen to widespread, vaccine-induced selective pressure. Here, we use array-based sequencing of 62 isolates from a US national monitoring program to study five independent instances of vaccine escape recombination4, showing the simultaneous transfer of multiple and often large (up to at least 44 kb) DNA fragments. We show that one such new strain quickly became established, spreading from east to west across the United States. These observations clarify the roles of recombination and selection in the population genomics of pneumococcus and provide proof of principle of the considerable value of combining genomic and epidemiological information in the surveillance and enhanced understanding of infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1985733585,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has a major role in cancer progression, as well as normal organ development and human pathology such as organ fibrosis and wound healing. Here, we performed a gene expression array specialized in EMT of colorectal cancer (CRC). From a comprehensive gene expression analysis using epithelial- and mesenchymal-like CRC cell lines, and following the ontology (GO) analysis, SIX1 gene was identified to be an EMT-related gene in CRC. Using SW480 cells stably transfected with a SIX1 expression construct and their control counterparts, we demonstrated that SIX1 overexpression represses CDH1 expression and promotes EMT in CRC. SIX1-induced CDH1 repression and EMT in CRC cells were correlated at least in part with posttranscriptional ZEB1 activation and miR-200-family transcriptional repression. In primary tumors of CRC, in accord with the functional findings, aberrant expression of SIX1 in cancer cells was observed at the disruption of the basement membrane and at the tumor invasive front, where tumor cells underwent EMT in vivo. Taken together, SIX1 overexpression is suggested to occur in carcinogenesis, and contribute to repression of CDH1 expression and promotion of EMT partly through repression of miR-200-family expression and activation of ZEB1 in CRC."

A meta-analysis of neuroblastoma cases revealed that ALK mutations (49 of 709 cases) in relation to genomic subtype were most frequently observed in MYCN amplified tumours (8.9%), correlating with a poor clinical outcome. MYCN proteins target proliferation and apoptotic pathways, and have an important role in the progression of neuroblastoma. Here, we show that both wild-type and gain-of-function mutants in ALK are able to stimulate transcription at the MYCN promoter and initiate mRNA transcription of the MYCN gene in both neuronal and neuroblastoma cell lines. Further, this stimulation of MYCN gene transcription and de novo MYCN protein expression is abrogated by specific ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib (PF-2341066), NVP-TAE684, and by small interfering RNA to ALK resulting in a decrease in proliferation rate. Finally, co-transfection of ALK gain-of-function mutations together with MYCN leads to an increase in transformation potential. Taken together, our results indicate that ALK signalling regulates initiation of transcription of the MYCN gene providing a possible explanation for the poor clinical outcome observed when MYCN is amplified together with activated ALK."
https://openalex.org/W2036205797,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) inactivation has been identified as an important step in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, although the events involved have been partially clarified. UHRF1 is emerging as a cofactor that coordinates the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes, but its role in CRC remains elusive. Here, we report that UHRF1 negatively regulates PPARG and is associated with a higher proliferative, clonogenic and migration potential. Consistently, UHRF1 ectopic expression induces PPARG repression through its recruitment on the PPARG promoter fostering DNA methylation and histone repressive modifications. In agreement, UHRF1 knockdown elicits PPARG re-activation, accompanied by positive histone marks and DNA demethylation, corroborating its role in PPARG silencing. UHRF1 overexpression, as well as PPARG-silencing, imparts higher growth rate and phenotypic features resembling those occurring in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In our series of 110 sporadic CRCs, high UHRF1-expressing tumors are characterized by an undifferentiated phenotype, higher proliferation rate and poor clinical outcome only in advanced stages III-IV. In addition, the inverse relationship with PPARG found in vitro is detected in vivo and UHRF1 prognostic significance appears closely related to PPARG low expression, as remarkably validated in an independent dataset. The results demonstrate that UHRF1 regulates PPARG silencing and both genes appear to be part of a complex regulatory network. These findings suggest that the relationship between UHRF1 and PPARG may have a relevant role in CRC progression."
https://openalex.org/W1991674420,"Oxygen levels regulate the stability of the transcription factor HIF-1 through the action of prolyl hydroxylases and the VHL ubiquitin ligase. Sharp and colleagues now identify a protein complex in which the Ajuba LIM-domain protein LIMD1 brings together prolyl hydroxylases and VHL to ensure efficient degradation of HIF-1. There are three prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1, 2 and 3) that regulate the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the master transcriptional regulators that respond to changes in intracellular O2 tension1,2. In high O2 tension (normoxia) the PHDs hydroxylate two conserved proline residues on HIF-1α, which leads to binding of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor, the recognition component of a ubiquitin–ligase complex, initiating HIF-1α ubiquitylation and degradation3,4,5,6. However, it is not known whether PHDs and VHL act separately to exert their enzymatic activities on HIF-1α or as a multiprotein complex. Here we show that the tumour suppressor protein LIMD1 (LIM domain-containing protein) acts as a molecular scaffold, simultaneously binding the PHDs and VHL, thereby assembling a PHD–LIMD1–VHL protein complex and creating an enzymatic niche that enables efficient degradation of HIF-1α. Depletion of endogenous LIMD1 increases HIF-1α levels and transcriptional activity in both normoxia and hypoxia. Conversely, LIMD1 expression downregulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity in a manner depending on PHD and 26S proteasome activities. LIMD1 family member proteins Ajuba and WTIP also bind to VHL and PHDs 1 and 3, indicating that these LIM domain-containing proteins represent a previously unrecognized group of hypoxic regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1963483543,"Aberrant Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is one of the most prevalent oncogenic alterations and confers survival advantage to tumor cells. Inhibition of this pathway can effectively suppress tumor cell growth. For example, sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting c-Raf and other oncogenic kinases, has been used clinically for treating advanced liver and kidney tumors, and also has shown efficacy against other malignancies. However, how inhibition of oncogenic signaling by sorafenib and other drugs suppresses tumor cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we found that sorafenib kills cancer cells by activating PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a p53 target and a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein. Sorafenib treatment induces PUMA in a variety of cancer cells irrespective of their p53 status. Surprisingly, the induction of PUMA by sorafenib is mediated by IκB-independent activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which directly binds to the PUMA promoter to activate its transcription. NF-κB activation by sorafenib requires glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation, subsequent to ERK inhibition. Deficiency in PUMA abrogates sorafenib-induced apoptosis and caspase activation, and renders sorafenib resistance in colony formation and xenograft tumor assays. Furthermore, the chemosensitization effect of sorafenib is dependent on PUMA, and involves concurrent PUMA induction through different pathways. BH3 mimetics potentiate the anti-cancer effects of sorafenib, and restore sorafenib sensitivity in resistant cells. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of PUMA-dependent apoptosis in therapeutic inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. They provide a rationale for manipulating the apoptotic machinery to improve sensitivity and overcome resistance to the therapies that target oncogenic kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2039830942,"The 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is an important regulator of cell growth. Expression of S6K1 is often elevated in breast cancer cells. However, the transcriptional mechanism of S6K1 overexpression is not understood. In this report, we demonstrate that estrogen activates expression of S6K1 via estrogen receptor (ER)α in ER-positive breast cancer cells. We also show that estrogen acts on the proximal promoter of the S6K1 gene in a mechanism involving the transcriptional factor GATA-3. Finally, we provide data that support the importance of estrogenic regulation of S6K1 expression in breast cancer cell proliferation. S6K1 directly phosphorylates and regulates ligand-independent activity of ERα, while ERα upregulates S6K1 expression. This S6K1–ERα relationship creates a positive feed-forward loop in control of breast cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, the co-dependent association between S6K1 and ERα may be exploited in the development of targeted breast cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2120657441,"Fra-1 is aberrantly expressed in a large number of cancer cells and tissues, and emerging evidence suggests an important role for this Fos family protein in both oncogenesis and the progression or maintenance of many tumour types. Here, we show that the concentration of Fra-1 is high in invasive oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER-) breast cancer cell lines, regardless of their Ras pathway status. All of the ER- cells express high levels of activated PKCθ, and the inhibition of PKCθ activity using RNA interference or the expression of a dominant-negative mutant results in a dramatic reduction in Fra-1 abundance. Conversely, the ectopic expression of constitutively active PKCθ leads to Fra-1 phosphorylation and accumulation in poorly invasive ER+ cells. This accumulation is due to the stabilisation of the Fra-1 protein through PKCθ signalling, whereas other members of the PKC family are ineffective. Both Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and ERK1/2, whose activities are upregulated by PKCθ, participate in PKCθ-driven Fra-1 stabilisation. Interestingly, their relative contributions appear to be different depending on the cell line studied. ERK1/2 signalling has a major role in ER- MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas Fra-1 accumulation occurs mainly through SPAK signalling in ER- BT549 cells. Fra-1 mutational analysis shows that the phosphorylation of S265, T223 and T230 is critical for PKCθ-driven Fra-1 stabilisation. Phosphorylation of the protein was confirmed using specific antisera against Fra-1 phosphorylated on T223 or S265. In addition, Fra-1 participates in PKCθ-induced cell invasion and is necessary for PKCθ-induced cell migration. In summary, we identified PKCθ signalling as an important regulator of Fra-1 accumulation in ER- breast cancer cells. Moreover, our results suggest that PKCθ could participate in progression of some breast cancers and could be a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1965532883,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely reported to display strong efficacy for cancer chemoprevention, although their mechanism of action is poorly understood. The most well-documented effects of NSAIDs include inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, but their effect on tumor cell invasion has not been well studied. Here, we show that the NSAID, sulindac sulfide (SS) can potently inhibit the invasion of human MDA-MB-231 breast and HCT116 colon tumor cells in vitro at concentrations less than those required to inhibit tumor cell growth. To study the molecular basis for this activity, we investigated the involvement of microRNA (miRNA). A total of 132 miRNAs were found to be altered in response to SS treatment, including miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21 and miR-9, which have been previously implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We confirmed that these miRNA can stimulate tumor cell invasion and show that SS can attenuate their invasive effects by downregulating their expression. Employing luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, NF-κB was found to bind the promoters of all four miRNAs to suppress their expression at the transcriptional level. We show that SS can inhibit the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus by decreasing the phosphorylation of IKKβ and IκB. Analysis of the promoter sequences of the miRNAs suppressed by SS revealed that 81 of 115 sequences contained NF-κB-binding sites. These results show that SS can inhibit tumor cell invasion by suppressing NF-κB-mediated transcription of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2081746541,"The barrel-shaped caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) is a main virulence regulator in the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (SaClpP). It consists of two heptameric rings forming a homotetradecamer with an inner chamber that houses the 14 active sites. We recently showed that SaClpP is able to adopt a compressed, inactive conformation. We present here the 2.3 Å resolution structure of SaClpP in its closed, active conformation as well as the structure of the S98A mutant. Comprehensive mutational analysis aiming at destabilizing one or the other or both conformations was able to pinpoint key residues involved in this catalytic switch and in the heptamer-heptamer interaction. By probing the active site serine with a covalently modifying β-lactone probe, we could show that the tetradecameric organization is essential for a proper formation of the active site. Structural data suggest that a highly conserved hydrogen-bonding network links oligomerization to activity. A comparison of ClpP structures from different organisms provides suggestive evidence for the presence of a universal mechanism regulating ClpP activity in which binding of one subunit to the corresponding subunit on the other ring interface is necessary for the functional assembly of the catalytic triad and thus for protease function. This mechanism ensures controlled access to the active sites of a highly unspecific protease."
https://openalex.org/W2015891530,"RB+/− individuals develop retinoblastoma and, subsequently, many other tumors. The Rb relatives p107 and p130 protect the tumor-resistant Rb−/− mouse retina. Determining the mechanism underlying this tumor suppressor function may expose novel strategies to block Rb pathway cancers. p107/p130 are best known as E2f inhibitors, but here we implicate E2f-independent Cdk2 inhibition as the critical p107 tumor suppressor function in vivo. Like p107 loss, deleting p27 or inactivating its Cdk inhibitor (CKI) function (p27CK−) cooperated with Rb loss to induce retinoblastoma. Genetically, p107 behaved like a CKI because inactivating Rb and one allele each of p27 and p107 was tumorigenic. Although Rb loss induced canonical E2f targets, unexpectedly p107 loss did not further induce these genes, but instead caused post-transcriptional Skp2 induction and Cdk2 activation. Strikingly, Cdk2 activity correlated with tumor penetrance across all the retinoblastoma models. Therefore, Rb restrains E2f, but p107 inhibits cross talk to Cdk. While removing either E2f2 or E2f3 genes had little effect, removing only one E2f1 allele blocked tumorigenesis. More importantly, exposing retinoblastoma-prone fetuses to small molecule inhibitors of E2f (HLM006474) or Cdk (R547) for merely 1 week dramatically inhibited subsequent tumorigenesis in adult mice. Protection was achieved without disrupting normal proliferation. Thus, exquisite sensitivity of the cell-of-origin to E2f and Cdk activity can be exploited to prevent Rb pathway-induced cancer in vivo without perturbing normal cell division. These data suggest that E2f inhibitors, never before tested in vivo, or CKIs, largely disappointing as therapeutics, may be effective preventive agents."
https://openalex.org/W2033813635,"Monoamine transporters terminate synaptic neurotransmission and are molecular targets for antidepressants and psychostimulants. Fluorescent reporters can monitor real-time transport and are amenable for high-throughput screening. However, until now, their use has mostly been successful to study the catecholamine transporters but not the serotonin (5HT) transporter. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and molecular modeling to compare fluorescent analogs of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) as reporters for the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) in single cells. The fluorescent substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1-methylpyridinium (APP(+)) exhibits superior fluorescence uptake in hSERT-expressing HEK293 cells than other MPP(+) analogs tested. APP(+) uptake is Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, displaced by 5HT, and inhibited by fluoxetine, suggesting APP(+) specifically monitors hSERT activity. ASP(+), which was previously used to study catecholamine transporters, is 10 times less potent than APP(+) at inhibiting 5HT uptake and has minimal hSERT-mediated uptake. Furthermore, in hSERT-expressing oocytes voltage-clamped to -60 mV, APP(+) induced fluoxetine-sensitive hSERT-mediated inward currents, indicating APP(+) is a substrate, whereas ASP(+) induced hSERT-mediated outward currents and counteracted 5HT-induced hSERT currents, indicating ASP(+) possesses activity as an inhibitor. Extra-precise ligand receptor docking of APP(+) and ASP(+) in an hSERT homology model showed both ASP(+) and APP(+) docked favorably within the active region; accordingly, comparable concentrations are required to elicit their opposite electrophysiological responses. We conclude APP(+) is better suited than ASP(+) to study hSERT transport fluorometrically."

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14075-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, PFC brain slices (300 μm) from juvenile (3–5 weeks postnatal) Sprague-Dawley rat were used. Cells were visualized with a 40× water immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared (IR) light, and the image was detected with an IR-sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Tight seals (2–10 gigaohms) from visualized pyramidal neurons were obtained by the “blow and seal” technique. A MultiClamp 700A amplifier was used for these recordings. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 megaohms and were compensated 50–70%. A bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, Inc., Bowdoinham, ME) was positioned ∼100 μm from the neuron under recording. Evoked currents were generated with 50-μs pulses (delivered every 30 s) from a stimulation isolation unit controlled by an S48 pulse generator (Astro-Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI). For NMDAR-EPSC recording, stimuli were given 3 s after neurons (clamped at −70 mV) were depolarized to +60 mV to fully relieve the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of NMDAR channels. Acutely dissociated PFC pyramidal neurons from 4-week-old rats or PFC primary cultures from 17–18-day rat embryos were prepared using procedures described previously (30Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y.

Recordings of whole-cell NMDA-elicited currents employed similar techniques as described previously (30Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Yan Z.

Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments 200B patch clamp amplifier that was controlled and monitored with an IBM PC running pCLAMP with a DigiData 1320 series interface. Electrode resistances were typically 2–4 megaohms in the bath. After seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 megaohms) was compensated (70–90%) and periodically monitored. The cell membrane potential was held at −60 mV. NMDA (100 μm) was applied for 2 s every 30 s to minimize desensitization-induced decrease of current amplitude. Data analyses were performed with Clampfit (Axon instruments) and KaleidaGraph (Albeck Software, Reading, PA). ANOVA tests were performed to compare the differential degrees of current modulation between groups subjected to different treatments. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting mouse mGluR7 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The siRNA against β-arrestin1 (5′-GGCGAGUCUACGUGACACUtt-3′) and β-arrestin2 (5′-GGACCGGAASGUGUUUGUGtt-3′) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Cultured PFC neurons (11 days in vitro) were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cultures were used 2–3 days after transfection. PFC cultures from 3.5-cm dishes (1.2 × 106 cells) were collected and homogenized in 400 μl of modified radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 16,000 × g, and supernatant fractions were collected. After boiling in SDS sample buffer, samples were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was carried out using the ECL method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used include: anti-Thr202/Tyr204phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase, anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling, both 1:1000), anti-Ser3phospho-cofilin, and anti-cofilin (Cell Signaling, both 1:500). After treatment, PFC slices were homogenized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. The lysates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were collected and incubated with anti-NR1 (Millipore, 2 μg) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2000) or anti-PSD95 (Affinity BioReagents, 1:2000). Neurons grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. Neurons were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min followed by a 1-h incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block nonspecific staining. For the staining of surface NR1, neurons were fixed but not permeabilized. Neurons were incubated with the primary antibody (anti-MAP2, 1:500, Chemicon; or anti-NR1 extracellular domain, 1:100, Chemicon) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, neurons were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green)-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. For the staining of F-actin, neurons were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 (red)-conjugated phalloidin (1 unit/ml, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 min. After washing in PBS for three times, coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were obtained using a 100× objective with a cooled charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed using identical parameters with the ImageJ software. The surface NR1 clusters or F-actin clusters were measured. To define dendritic clusters, a single threshold was chosen manually so that clusters corresponded to puncta of at least 2-fold greater intensity than the diffuse fluorescence on the dendritic shaft. On each coverslip, the cluster density of 4–6 neurons (3–4 dendritic segments of 50 μm length per neuron) was measured. Three to four independent experiments for each of the treatments were performed. Quantitative analyses were conducted blindly (without knowledge of experimental treatment). The surface NMDA receptors were detected as described previously (31Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9852-9861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cortical cultures were incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Chemical Co.) for 20 min on ice. The cultures were then rinsed three times in TBS to quench the biotin reaction followed by homogenization in 0.5 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled. Quantitative Western blots were performed on both total and biotinylated (surface) proteins using anti-NR1 (1:1000; Upstate Biotech Millipore). To examine the potential impact of mGluRs on excitatory synaptic transmission in PFC pyramidal neurons, we examined the effect of l-AP4, a prototypical agonist for group III mGluRs (34Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 35Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Pharmacological agents acting at subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), on NMDAR-EPSC and AMPAR-EPSC in PFC slices. As shown in Fig. 1A, bath application of l-AP4 (200 μm) caused a strong reversible reduction of the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC (43.1 ± 6.8%, n = 18). A marked reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by l-AP4 (Fig. 1B, 58.3 ± 9.3%, n = 14) was also observed. To distinguish the presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanism underlying these effects of l-AP4, we measured the paired pulse ratio of NMDAR-EPSC and AMPAR-EPSC (evoked by paired pulses with a 100- or 40-ms interval, respectively), a readout sensitive to presynaptic glutamate release. As shown in Fig. 1C, l-AP4 did not alter the paired pulse ratio of NMDAR-EPSC (4.9 ± 0.6%, n = 8), but significantly increased the paired pulse ratio of AMPAR-EPSC (37.2 ± 4.2%, n = 8). This suggests that l-AP4 regulates NMDAR-EPSC mainly via a postsynaptic mechanism, whereas regulating AMPAR-EPSC through a presynaptic action. To verify the postsynaptic effect of l-AP4 on NMDARs, we measured the ionic current elicited by exogenous NMDA application (100 μm) in acutely dissociated PFC pyramidal neurons. As shown in Fig. 1D, bath application of l-AP4 (200 μm) reversibly reduced NMDAR currents (24.3 ± 3.6%, n = 12). In contrast, l-AP4 application did not have any significant effect on AMPA (100 μm)-elicited currents (2.6 ± 1.3%, n = 10). To further characterize the effect of l-AP4 on NMDAR currents, we carried out the dose-response experiments. As shown in Fig. 1E, l-AP4 started to inhibit NMDAR currents at the dose of 50–100 μm (50 μm: 8.5 ± 2.8%; 100 μm: 16.5 ± 3.1%; n = 8), and reached the saturating level at 200–400 μm (200 μm: 24.3 ± 3.6%; 400 μm: 27.5 ± 4.5%, n = 12), with an EC50 ∼100 μm. NMDAR functional properties are determined by subunit composition. The primary NMDARs in mature cortical synapses, which are composed of NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B, differ in deactivation kinetics and subcellular distribution. To determine which subpopulation(s) of NMDARs is targeted by l-AP4, we applied the selective inhibitor of NR2B subunit, ifenprodil. Blocking NR2B subunit-containing NMDARs with ifenprodil (10 μm) reduced the amplitude of NMDAR currents by 54.5 ± 2.1% (n = 9). In the presence of ifenprodil, l-AP4 (100 μm) had little effect on the remaining whole-cell NMDAR currents (Fig. 1, F and G, 2.2 ± 2.4%, n = 9), whereas the reducing effect of l-AP4 was restored after washing off ifenprodil (19.2 ± 1.9%, n = 9). This suggests that l-AP4 primarily targets NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors. To confirm that the effect of l-AP4 on NMDAR currents was mediated through group III mGluRs, we applied selective receptor agonists and antagonists. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the presence of mGluRIII antagonists CPPG (50 μm) or M-SOP (400 μm), the reducing effect of l-AP4 on NMDAR currents was significantly diminished (CPPG: 5.1 ± 0.8%, n = 8; M-SOP: 6.3 ± 0.9%, n = 8; Fig. 2B). Another selective group III mGluR agonist, l-SOP (400 μm), also reduced NMDAR currents (Fig. 2B, 20.4 ± 2.8%, n = 10), and the effect of l-SOP was largely blocked by the antagonist CPPG (4.8 ± 0.8%, n = 8) and M-SOP (6.7 ± 1.0%, n = 8). Using cell lines that express specific mGluR subtypes, it has been determined that neither l-AP4 nor l-SOP possesses activity at group I or II mGluRs at concentrations below 1000 μm, whereas l-AP4 has EC50 of 160–500 μm to mGluR7 and 0.4–1.2 μm to other members in group III (mGluR4,6,8) (34Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 35Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Pharmacological agents acting at subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Similarly, l-SOP has EC50 of ∼200 μm to mGluR7 and 2–5 μm to other members in group III (34Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Pharmacology and functions of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 35Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Pharmacological agents acting at subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Because of the pharmacological profile of mGluRs, previous physiological studies on the role of group III mGluRs, especially mGluR7, in synaptic transmission have commonly used high doses (500–1000 μm) of l-AP4 (19Pelkey K.A.

Group III mGluR regulation of synaptic transmission at the SC-CA1 synapse is developmentally regulated.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our dose-response studies suggest that mGluR7 is the receptor mediating the effect of l-AP4 on NMDAR currents. To confirm this, we carried out a cellular knockdown experiment with mGluR7 siRNA transfection in PFC cultures. As shown in Fig. 2C, the reducing effect of l-AP4 on NMDAR currents was abolished in mGluR7 siRNA-transfected neurons (control: 22.3 ± 3.1%, n = 8; mGluR7 siRNA: 5.5 ± 1.1%, n = 6). Taken together, these results suggest that activation of mGluR7 suppresses NMDAR currents via a postsynaptic mechanism in PFC pyramidal neurons. We then investigated the signaling mechanisms underlying mGluR7 reduction of NMDAR currents. Group III mGluRs are thought to be primarily coupled to Gi/o proteins to inhibit cAMP formation and PKA activation (39Okamoto N. Hori S. Akazawa C. Hayashi Y. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Molecular characterization of a new metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7 coupled to inhibitory cyclic AMP signal transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we first tested the involvement of PKA. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, the l-AP4 reduction of NMDAR currents in dissociated PFC pyramidal neurons was not significantly changed by either PKA activator cpt-cAMP (21.6 ± 3.8%, n = 8) or PKA inhibitor PKI14–22 (22.2 ± 3.5%, n = 8). Other than the PKA signaling pathway, previous studies have shown that l-AP4 can activate PI3K and ERK pathways in cultured cerebellar granule cells (21Iacovelli"
https://openalex.org/W2002914764,"The metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is overexpressed in various human cancers and is closely connected with aggressive phenotypes; however, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the MTA1 gene. This study identified the MTA1 gene as a target of p53-mediated transrepression. The MTA1 promoter contains two putative p53 response elements (p53REs), which were repressed by the p53-inducing drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Notably, 5-FU treatment decreased MTA1 expression only in p53 wild-type cells. p53 and histone deacetylases 1/2 were recruited, and acetylation of H3K9 was decreased on the promoter region including the p53REs after 5-FU treatment. Proteomics analysis of the p53 repressor complex, which was pulled down by the MTA1 promoter, revealed that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) was part of the complex. Interestingly, p53 was poly(ADP-ribose)ylated by PARP-1, and the p53-mediated transrepression of the MTA1 gene required poly(ADP-ribose)ylation of p53. In summary, we report a novel function for poly(ADP-ribose)ylation of p53 in the gene-specific regulation of the transcriptional mode of p53 on the promoter of MTA1."

The C. albicans cell wall expresses β-1,2-linked mannosides (β-Mans), promoting its adherence to host cells and tissues. Because β-Mans are also present in C. glabrata, their role in C. glabrata colonization and virulence was investigated in a murine model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Five clustered genes of C. glabrata encoding β-mannosyltransferases, BMT2-BMT6, were deleted simultaneously. β-Man expression was studied by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and NMR analysis. Mortality, clinical, histologic, and colonization scores were determined in mice receiving DSS and different C. glabrata strains. The results show that C. glabrata bmt2-6 strains had a significant reduction in β-1,2-Man expression and a disappearance of β-1,2-mannobiose in the acid-stable domain. A single gavage of C. glabrata wild-type strain in mice with DSS-induced colitis caused a loss of body weight, colonic inflammation, and mortality. Mice receiving C. glabrata bmt2-6 mutant strains had normal body weight and reduced colonic inflammation. Lower numbers of colonies of C. glabrata bmt2-6 were recovered from stools and different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Histopathologic examination revealed that the wild-type strain had a greater ability to colonize tissue and cause tissue damage. These results showed that C. glabrata has a high pathogenic potential in DSS-induced colitis, where β-Mans contribute to colonization and virulence."

Resolving the dynamic transcriptional profiles that underlie these patterning processes is essential for understanding embryogenesis at the molecular level.

As a proof of principle, we have dynamically profiled No tail a (Ntla)-dependent genes at different stages of axial mesoderm development in zebrafish, discovering discrete sets of transcripts that are coincident with either notochord cell fate commitment or differentiation. Our studies reveal new regulators of notochord development and the sequential activation of distinct transcriptomes within a cell lineage by a single transcriptional factor and demonstrate how optically controlled chemical tools can dissect developmental processes with spatiotemporal precision."
https://openalex.org/W2037902454,"The interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment is a vicious cycle that enhances the survival and progression of cancer, resulting in metastasis. This study is the first to indicate that lung cancer-derived galectin-1 secretion is responsible for stimulating tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADCs) production of mature heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which, in turn, increases cancer progression. Treatment of galectin-1, present in large amounts in lung cancer conditioned medium and lung cancer patient sera, mimicked the inductive effect of lung cancer conditioned medium on the expression and ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF by TNFα-converting enzyme/a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9 (ADAM9) and ADAM17. Significant up-regulation of HB-EGF has been seen in tumor-infiltrating CD11c(+) dendritic cells in human lung cancer samples. Active cleavage of HB-EGF in TADCs by ADAM9 and ADAM17 is associated with increased protein kinase C δ and Lyn signaling. Enhancement of HB-EGF production in TADCs increased the proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition abilities of lung cancer. In contrast, inhibiting HB-EGF by siRNA suppressed TADC-mediated cancer progression. Moreover, mice injected with galectin-1 knockdown Lewis lung carcinoma showed decreased expression and ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF and reduced incidence of cancer development, resulting in increased survival rates. We demonstrate here for the first time that human and mouse DCs are a source of HB-EGF, an EGFR ligand with tumorigenic properties. Antagonists of the effect of lung cancer-derived galectin-1 on DCs and anti-HB-EGF blocking antibodies could, therefore, have therapeutic potential as antitumor agents."
https://openalex.org/W2139840454,"Because tau aggregation likely plays a role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the processes that affect tau aggregation is of considerable importance. One factor that has been shown to influence the aggregation propensity is the oxidation state of the protein itself. Tau protein, which contains two naturally occurring cysteine residues, can form both intermolecular disulfide bonds and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Several studies suggest that intermolecular disulfide bonds can promote tau aggregation in vitro. By contrast, although there are data to suggest that intramolecular disulfide bond formation retards tau aggregation in vitro, the precise mechanism underlying this observation remains unclear. While it has been hypothesized that a single intramolecular disulfide bond in tau leads to compact conformations that cannot form extended structure consistent with tau fibrils, there are few data to support this conjecture. In the present study we generate oxidized forms of the truncation mutant, K18, which contains all four microtubule binding repeats, and isolate the monomeric fraction, which corresponds to K18 monomers that have a single intramolecular disulfide bond. We study the aggregation propensity of the oxidized monomeric fraction and relate these data to an atomistic model of the K18 unfolded ensemble. Our results argue that the main effect of intramolecular disulfide bond formation is to preferentially stabilize conformers within the unfolded ensemble that place the aggregation-prone tau subsequences, PHF6* and PHF6, in conformations that are inconsistent with the formation of cross-β-structure.

Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Although tau normally serves as a modulator of neuronal stability (2.Paglini G. Peris L. Mascotti F. Quiroga S. Caceres A. Tau protein function in axonal formation.Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it can form insoluble aggregates, called neurofibrillary tangles, that are rich in cross-β-structure (3.Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K.

Moreover, there are data to suggest that neurofibrillary tangle formation is correlated with the loss of microtubules and the interruption of organelle transport along the neuron leading to neuronal dysfunction and death (4.Terry R.D.

In addition, it has also been argued that soluble oligomeric tau aggregates are neurotoxic. Several indirect lines of evidence are consistent with this hypothesis. For example, this conjecture is consistent with a comparison of cases of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) with cases of early onset Alzheimer disease. FTDP-17 is thought to be caused by mutations in tau and is characterized by neuronal loss (8.Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A.

In this paradigm, the formed aggregates may be an attempt by the cell to sequester the more toxic oligomeric species (11.Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Sengupta U. Clos A.L. Jackson G.R.

Nevertheless, regardless of the precise form of toxic species, it seems clear that aggregated forms of tau protein play a role in disease pathogenesis. intrinsically disordered protein Bayesian weighting frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 four microtubule-binding repeats thioflavin T residual dipolar coupling. Deciphering the process underlying the formation of ordered tau aggregates is problematic because tau is intrinsically disordered in solution (14.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D.

Although folded proteins typically sample a relatively small and homogeneous set of thermally accessible states, IDPs sample a relatively heterogeneous set of conformations during their biological lifetime (15.Fisher C.K. Stultz C.M. Protein structure along the order-disorder continuum.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a result, unlike folded proteins, experimental measurements on IDPs are typically more difficult to interpret. Because IDPs adopt many different conformations in solution, most experimental measurements on IDPs correspond to ensemble averages over a relatively large set of dissimilar conformations (16.Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M. Hipps K.W. Ausio J. Nissen M.S. Reeves R. Kang C. Kissinger C.R. Bailey R.W. Griswold M.D. Chiu W. Garner E.C.

Constructing ensembles for intrinsically disordered proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Hence, techniques that are typically used to characterize folded proteins are of limited use when applied to disordered proteins. Nonetheless, any comprehensive description of an IDP requires one to enumerate its thermodynamically accessible conformations and their relative stabilities. It is only with such data that one can develop a comprehensive understanding of the aggregation process. Indeed, knowledge of the thermally accessible states of the protein can facilitate the interpretation of experimental observations on IDPs. The results of disulfide-trapping experiments combined with recently constructed atomistic models of the unfolded state of tau protein provide a unique opportunity to probe structural features that affect the propensity of tau to aggregate (18.Di Noto L.

As we explain below, oxidation of tau leads to conformers that have aggregation properties that differ from the wild-type protein. Therefore, although the precise role that disulfide bonded forms of tau play in vivo is not clear, we can use these data to deduce general structural features of the unfolded ensemble that affect tau aggregation. Isoforms of tau that contain all four microtubule-binding repeats (4R) contain two naturally occurring cysteines at positions 291 and 322 (numbering based on the longest isoform) (22.Mo Z.Y. Zhu Y.Z. Zhu H.L. Fan J.B. Chen J. Liang Y. Low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human tau via bridging of Cys-291 and Cys-322.J. Biol.

When tau is exposed to oxidizing conditions, a series of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed (20.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Nukina N.

To probe the role that intermolecular disulfide-bonded species play in the aggregation process, tau mutants that only contain one cysteine residue have been studied. Oxidized forms of this protein are necessarily constrained to form intermolecular disulfide bonds and therefore serve as a vehicle to probe the role that intermolecular disulfide bonds play in fibril formation. Aggregation studies with these species suggest that intermolecular disulfide bond formation facilitates entry into the aggregation cascade (18.Di Noto L. DeTure M.A. Purich D.L.

Commun. 2009; 385: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additional aggregation experiments using wild-type tau protein, which contains two cysteine residues, have been less straightforward to interpret because the wild-type protein can form both intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furukawa and co-workers attempted to separate monomer peaks (corresponding to conformers with an intramolecular disulfide bond) and dimer peaks (corresponding to species with intermolecular disulfide bonds) from the oxidized wild-type protein using gel filtration chromatography; however, these efforts were unsuccessful (20.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Nukina N. Tau protein assembles into isoform- and disulfide-dependent polymorphic fibrils with distinct structural properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27236-27246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Some experiments suggest that the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds between the two naturally occurring cysteines leads to conformations that are relatively aggregation-resistant (19.Barghorn S. Mandelkow E. Toward a unified scheme for the aggregation of tau into Alzheimer paired helical filaments.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14885-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28.Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Oxidation of cysteine 322 in the repeat domain of microtubule-associated protein tau controls the in vitro assembly of paired helical filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these results is that the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds is important for tau self-association. Because conformers that have an intramolecular disulfide bond cannot form intermolecular disulfide bonds (i.e. tau only has 2 cysteines), they do not aggregate. In other words, it may be that the only role of intramolecular disulfide bonds is to stabilize (monomeric) forms of the protein that cannot form intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, recent studies demonstrate that tau (4R) mutants, which do not contain any cysteine residues, still aggregate and form some fibrils over the course of a day (24.Sahara N. Maeda S. Murayama M. Suzuki T. Dohmae N. Yen S.H. Takashima A. Assembly of two distinct dimers and higher-order oligomers from full-length tau.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 3020-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consequently, aggregation can occur in the absence of intermolecular disulfide bond formation. In light of this, the role of intramolecular disulfide bonds is more complex than simply stabilizing protein monomers. Others have hypothesized that intramolecular disulfide bonds lead to the formation of “compact monomers” that cannot form extended structures capable of forming paired helical filaments (19.Barghorn S.

Nevertheless, there are few if any data to support the notion that compaction alone fully explains the effect of intramolecular disulfide bonds have on tau aggregation kinetics. Moreover, in contrast to the previous studies, it has recently been argued that fibrils can form from structures that contain intramolecular disulfide bonds (20.Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Nukina N. Tau protein assembles into isoform- and disulfide-dependent polymorphic fibrils with distinct structural properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27236-27246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consequently, the precise effect that intramolecular disulfide bonds have on the conformational preferences of tau has yet to be elucidated. In the present study we generate oxidized forms of a 4R truncation mutant of tau protein, K18, isolate the monomeric fraction that contains only intramolecular disulfide bonds, and quantitatively assess its aggregation potential. These observations are then interpreted in light of an atomistic ensemble for the unfolded state of K18 (21.Fisher C.K. Huang A. Stultz C.M. Modeling intrinsically disordered proteins with bayesian statistics.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 14919-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The combination of disulfide trapping experiments and the existence of an atomistic conformational ensemble for K18 provide new insights into how intramolecular disulfide bonds influence the conformational distribution of states, leading to a new ensemble with distinct aggregation properties. Low molecular weight heparin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Thioflavin T (ThT) was purchased from Acros Organics. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, BD Biosciences, or Sigma. K18 was expressed as described below using a technique modified from that of Barghorn et al. (32.Barghorn S. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Sigurdsson E.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 35-51Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 214 nm. DNA coding K18 was cloned in a pRK172 plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) strain (Agilent Technologies) for expression. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium (33.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4121) Google Scholar) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 225 rpm. After a 12-h incubation the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3900 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine), and the cells were subsequently reharvested by centrifugation. The washed cell pellet was then resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer and sonicated using an S-4000 Ultrasonic Processor (Misonix). The cells were sonicated in 3-s bursts followed by 10-s pauses under ice-cold conditions. This was carried out until the cells had received ∼10,000 J. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 3900 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was made up to 500 mm NaCl, boiled for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 3900 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was dialyzed into 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF. A large scale purification of recombinant K18 was performed at 25 °C on a Bio-Rad DuoFlow work station. The cell lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP FF cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The column was then washed with 15 ml of 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF until the A280 base line became stable. The K18 protein was eluted with a salt gradient (50-1000 mm NaCl over 25 ml) in the same buffer. One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing K18 were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF) and stored at −20 °C. Further purification was carried out by size exclusion chromatography. This involved 0.5 ml of sample being injected onto a Superdex 75 30/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein sample was eluted with PBS, pH 7.4, over 2 column volumes. One-milliliter fractions were collected, and those containing K18 species were stored at −20 °C. The purity of the resulting protein was established by SDS-PAGE, and subsequent densitometry was carried out using Molecular Imaging software version 4.0 (Kodak). Purified K18 was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris, pH 8.4, in the presence of 2 μm CuSO4, which acted as an oxidizing agent. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 8 h with shaking at 150 rpm (following the protocols described in Ref. 34.Jiang C. Chang J.Y. Isomers of human α-synuclein stabilized by disulfide bonds exhibit distinct structural and aggregative properties.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and mass spectroscopy. Mass spectroscopy was carried out on samples in 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamic (in 70% ACN and 30% 0.1% TFA) on a AB Sciex 480 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF in linear mode with 6500 laser intensity. The spectra were then calibrated using an external calibration file and confirmed the presence of the disulfide bond in the oxidized K18 monomer. Aggregation was induced by incubating K18 at a concentration of 50 μm in PBS, pH 7.4, in the presence of 12 μm heparin and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). 200-μl aliquots were incubated in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 120 rpm. The aggregation time course was monitored using the conditions described above with the addition of 25 μm ThT. Fluorescence was monitored every 20 min over the course of 8 days using a Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Scientific) with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. Dynamic light scattering experiments were carried out using a DynaPro Nanostar (Wyatt Technology). Base-line measurements with the buffer alone (without protein) did not show any scatter. Samples of K18 (concentration 50 mm in PBS, pH 7.4, 12 μm heparin, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture), containing intermolecular disulfide bond and K18 solution containing a mixture of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for 5 h. Every hour a sample was taken and assessed by dynamic light scattering. The samples (50 μl) were placed in a disposable UV cuvette and measured using a function that accumulated 10 measurements/sample. The size distribution plots, the x axis showing a distribution of estimated particle radius (nanometers), and the y axis showing the relative intensity of the scattered light (percentage of mass) were analyzed and prepared with the software Dynamics V7.0.0.94 (Wyatt Technology). Because we have previously described our method for the construction of an ensemble for K18 in detail (21.Fisher C.K. Huang A. Stultz C.M. Modeling intrinsically disordered proteins with bayesian statistics.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 14919-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we only repeat the salient features of the Bayesian weighting (BW) method here. The BW method can be divided into two steps: (i) generation of a structural library that represents energetically favorable conformations of the protein; (ii) estimating the weights of these conformations and calculating their uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner. We generated a set of energetically favorable structures for K18 by first dividing the protein into overlapping segments eight residues long. A local sequence size of eight residues was chosen for the size of the peptides used in the segment simulations, which is approximately the size of the average persistence length of a polypeptide (35.Jha A.K. Colubri A. Freed K.F. Sosnick T.R. Statistical coil model of the unfolded state: resolving the reconciliation problem.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The sequence of K18 was divided into 26 peptides of eight residues each, with an overlap of three residues between adjacent segments. A structural library for K18 was obtained by independently sampling and joining peptide conformations of local segments of the K18 sequence. This scheme is comparable with the structure generation methods in statistical coil algorithms. However, instead of building sequence structures one residue at a time, the sequence is extended by independently sampling and adding one peptide segment at a time. Starting with the N-terminal segment, each subsequent segment structure is sampled independently from the replica exchange molecular dynamics trajectory and aligned by the backbone atoms of the three overlapping residues. An individual K18 conformation is constructed as a Protein Data Bank file, created with duplicate atoms erased and residues renumbered. Structures were minimized to remove bad contacts using 1000 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 1000 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson minimization. In the end a conformational library of 30,000 structures was constructed. To reduce the size of the structural library to a number that could be easily run with the BW algorithm, we used a simple pruning algorithm that reduced the number of struct"

We identified a hexapeptide motif in the anticodon recognition domain that is critical for nuclear import of the synthetase.

This expectation was confirmed by RNAi knockdown of tRNATyr expression, which led to robust nuclear import of TyrRS. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that to have nuclear import of TyrRS directly controlled by tRNATyr in higher organisms, the NLS of lower eukaryotes was abandoned, whereas the new NLS was evolved from an anticodon-binding hexapeptide motif. Thus, higher organisms developed a strategy to make tRNA a regulator of the nuclear trafficking of its cognate synthetase.

https://openalex.org/W2027631153,"Aberrant promoter methylation of different DNA repair genes has a critical role in the development and progression of various cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). A systematic analysis of known human repair genes for promoter methylation is however missing. We generated quantitative promoter methylation profiles in single CpG units of 160 human DNA repair genes in a set of DNAs isolated from fresh frozen HNSCC and normal tissues using MassARRAY technology. Ninety-eight percent of these genes contained CpG islands (CGIs) in their promoter region; thus, DNA methylation is a potential regulatory mechanism. Methylation data were obtained for 145 genes, from which 15 genes exhibited more than a 20% difference in methylation levels between tumor and normal tissues, manifested either as hypermethylation or as hypomethylation. Analyses of promoter methylation with mRNA expression identified the DNA glycosylase NEIL1 (nei endonuclease VIII-like 1) as the most prominent candidate gene. NEIL1 promoter hypermethylation was confirmed in additional fresh frozen HNSCC samples, normal mucosa, HNSCC cell lines and primary human skin keratinocytes. The investigation of laser-microdissected tissues further substantiated increased methylation levels in tumor versus matched non-tumor cells. Immunohistological analysis revealed significantly less NEIL1 protein expression in tumor tissues. 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment and DNMT1 knockdown resulted in the re-expression of NEIL1 in HNSCC cell lines, which initially carried hypermethylated promoter regions. In conclusion, our results suggest that DNA methylation contributes to the downregulation of NEIL1 expression and might thus have a role in modulating the response to therapies of HNSCC."

These oxidases harbor a low spin heme b558 that donates electrons to a binuclear heme b595/heme d center. The reaction with O2 and subsequent catalytic steps of the Escherichia coli cytochrome bd-I oxidase were investigated by means of ultra-fast freeze-quench trapping followed by EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy. After the initial binding of O2, the O–O bond is heterolytically cleaved to yield a kinetically competent heme d oxoferryl porphyrin π-cation radical intermediate (compound I) magnetically interacting with heme b595. Compound I accumulates to 0.75–0.85 per enzyme in agreement with its much higher rate of formation (∼20,000 s−1) compared with its rate of decay (∼1,900 s−1). Compound I is next converted to a short lived heme d oxoferryl intermediate (compound II) in a phase kinetically matched to the oxidation of heme b558 before completion of the reaction. The results indicate that cytochrome bd oxidases like the heme-copper oxidases break the O–O bond in a single four-electron transfer without a peroxide intermediate. However, in cytochrome bd oxidases, the fourth electron is donated by the porphyrin moiety rather than by a nearby amino acid. The production of reactive oxygen species by the cytochrome bd oxidase was below the detection level of 1 per 1000 turnovers. We propose that the two classes of terminal oxidases have mechanistically converged to enzymes in which the O–O bond is broken in a single four-electron transfer reaction to safeguard the cell from the formation of reactive oxygen species.

However, in cytochrome bd oxidases, the fourth electron is donated by the porphyrin moiety rather than by a nearby amino acid. The production of reactive oxygen species by the cytochrome bd oxidase was below the detection level of 1 per 1000 turnovers. We propose that the two classes of terminal oxidases have mechanistically converged to enzymes in which the O–O bond is broken in a single four-electron transfer reaction to safeguard the cell from the formation of reactive oxygen species. Cytochrome bd oxidases are membrane-bound heterodimeric terminal oxidases consisting of CydA (57 kDa) and CydB (43 kDa) (1.Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Sequence analysis of cytochrome bd oxidase suggests a revised topology for subunit I.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 32-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These oxidases occur in bacteria and archaea and catalyze the oxidation of ubiquinol or menaquinol (2.Schröder I. de Vries S. Blum P. Archaea: New Models for Prokaryotic Biology.

This reaction is coupled to the generation of a protonmotive force because the four chemical protons consumed per O2 are taken from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, whereas the QH2 2The abbreviations used are:QH2ubiquinolROSreactive oxygen speciesCpdI or CpdIIcompound II or CpdII, oxoferryl porphyrin π-cation radical; oxoferrylMHQmicrosecond freeze-hyperquenchingDEPMPO(5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide)dQH2decylubiquinolHRPhorse radish peroxidase.-substrate protons are ejected into the periplasm (3.Puustinen A.

Oxy3 is subsequently converted to a peroxy intermediate, P, with heme b595 and heme d oxidized to their ferric states, while heme b558 remains reduced. In the next step (P → F) electron transfer from heme b558 and heme d leads to scission of the O–O bond followed by H2O release (29.Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Verkhovsky M.I.

The further donation of one electron and a proton to the active site would restore the enzyme to its fully oxidized form O0, with a hydroxo-bound heme d iron. However, this form of the enzyme is probably not part of the normal catalytic cycle (31.Yang K. Borisov V.B. Konstantinov A.A. Gennis R.B.

Instead, and under physiological conditions, it is more likely that the two-electron donor QH2 reduces F to Oxy1 (heme d2+-O2) followed by reduction by a second QH2 (yielding Oxy3) to provide the necessary electrons to enter the next catalytic cycle. The as isolated or resting enzyme is usually a mixture of F and heme d2+-O2 (26.Kahlow M.A. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M.

According to the mechanism described above, the O–O bond is broken in two sequential two-electron transfer steps via a peroxy intermediate. This mechanism differs fundamentally from that of the functionally equivalent heme-copper oxidases, which catalyze a single four-electron O–O bond splitting without a peroxy intermediate (32.Babcock G.T. Wikström M. Oxygen activation and the conservation of energy in cell respiration.Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The physiological advantage of the latter mechanism is the possible prevention of ROS. Indeed the production of ROS by the heme-copper oxidases has been found to be undetectably low (33.Boveris A.

If they do so, how much ROS is produced and would this be due in consequence to the formation of a peroxy intermediate? The assignment of a catalytic peroxy intermediate was based solely on the UV-visible spectrum (29.Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Verkhovsky M.I. Discovery of the true peroxy intermediate in the catalytic cycle of terminal oxidases by real time measurement.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28514-28519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and lacks a solid biophysical underpinning further preventing conclusions about its possible structure as a side-on, end-on, or heme-bridged peroxy species. To characterize the structure of P, the catalytic mechanism of the cytochrome bd-I oxidase from Escherichia coli was investigated using an ultrafast mixing and freeze-quenching technique (MHQ) that in addition to UV-visible enables EPR spectroscopic analyses (38.Cherepanov A.V. De Vries S. Microsecond freeze-hyperquenching. Development of a new ultrafast micro-mixing and sampling technology and application to enzyme catalysis.Biochim. Biophys.

Our results indicate that cytochrome bd oxidases split the O–O bond like the heme-copper oxidases in a single four-electron transfer reaction. However, in cytochrome bd oxidases a compound I intermediate is formed, unlike the heme-copper oxidases. The amount of ROS produced by cytochrome bd oxidase was below the detection level of 1 per 1000 turnovers. We propose that both classes of terminal oxidases have convergently evolved to enzymes in which the O–O bond is broken in a single four-electron transfer reaction to minimize the cellular production of ROS. The cytochrome bo and bd-II knock-out strain MB30 was a donation by M. Bekker (40.Bekker M. de Vries S. Ter Beek A. Hellingwerf K.J. de Mattos M.J. Respiration of Escherichia coli can be fully uncoupled via the nonelectrogenic terminal cytochrome bd-II oxidase.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MB30 was transformed with plasmid pACYC177 containing the E. coli CydAB operon overproducing cytochrome bd-I. Precultures were grown aerobically in LB medium with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) in a shaking incubator at 37 °C (∼175 rpm). Liter flasks of basal glycerol/fumarate minimal medium (41.Spencer M.E. Guest J.R. Proteins of the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Changes in composition associated with anaerobic growth and fumarate reductase amber mutation.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 954-959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) were inoculated with 5% of the LB culture, filled to the rim, and closed, creating semi-anaerobic conditions. Cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for ∼20 h. These starter cultures were used to inoculate (4%) four 25-liter glass vessels with basal glycerol/fumarate medium and ampicillin (5 μg/ml). Cells were grown under hypo-aerobic conditions after nitrogen flushing, while stirring at 30 °C for ∼65 h. After a 25-fold concentration of the cell cultures in a cross-flow filtration system, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 9000 × g) and washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. The washed cell pellets were resuspended in the same buffer prior to cell disruption at 1.8 kbar. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (4 °C, 10 min, 3000 × g) to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (4 °C, 1 h, 100,000 × g) to spin down the cell membranes containing the bd-I oxidase. Membranes were resuspended in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA and washed once or twice. The enzyme was extracted from the E. coli membranes by addition of 1% lauryl maltoside to the solution and incubating while stirring on ice for 15 min. Purification of the membrane-extracted enzyme consisted of a single column chromatography step (Q-Sepharose FastFlow) with 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.8, as the running buffer. Diluted fractions were pooled by activity, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. MHQ, EPR, UV-visible experiments, and kinetic simulations were performed as described previously (38.Cherepanov A.V. De Vries S. Microsecond freeze-hyperquenching. Development of a new ultrafast micro-mixing and sampling technology and application to enzyme catalysis.Biochim. Biophys.

The MHQ setup was modified just before the mixer entry with a stainless steel tubing extension immersed in ethylene glycol at −5 °C to bring the reaction temperature to 1 ± 1 °C. For kinetic experiments, purified enzyme (150 or 300 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% lauryl maltoside was made anaerobic, reduced with 2 mm sodium dithionite, and subsequently mixed with the same buffer saturated with O2. EPR spectra were normalized at the intensity of heme b595 and in separate experiments using an internal CuClO4 (0.1 mm) standard in the oxygenated buffer before mixing. Data in Fig. 5 represent the average of four independent experiments. UV-visible averaged spectra were corrected for scatter and base line as described previously (38.Cherepanov A.V. De Vries S.

Normalization is necessary because for the UV-visible experiments, the amounts of cold freeze-quenched powder in the low temperature cuvette is variable. Low temperature reference spectra (not prepared by MHQ) of fully reduced and “as isolated” enzyme (10 μm) were recorded in buffer, and the Soret band maxima relative to 490 nm were determined (1.0 and 0.46, respectively). The major difference in the measured maximal amplitude of the Soret band absorbance is due to the relatively sharp peak of reduced heme b558, in particular for samples after 100 μs. The relatively broad Soret peaks of the oxidized hemes contribute mainly to the difference 450–490 nm, in particular for samples after 100 μs. With these two parameters, the relative intensities of the spectra shown in Fig. 4 were calculated. From these, the fractional amount of reduced heme b558 was calculated from the spectra in the α-band region. The error in this calculation amounts to ∼0.1 heme b558 per enzyme. For the absorbance at 680 nm, the error was 0.35 per enzyme. The maximal absorbance at 680 nm was taken the same as that of oxidized heme d (cf. Ref. 29.Belevich I. Borisov V.B. Verkhovsky M.I.

https://openalex.org/W2156405606,"The branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase phosphatase (BDP) component of the human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in the soluble form. The monomeric BDP shows a strict dependence on Mn2+ ions for phosphatase activity, whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions do not support catalysis. Metal binding constants for BDP, determined by competition isothermal titration calorimetry, are 2.4 nm and 10 μm for Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions, respectively. Using the phosphorylated decarboxylase component (p-E1b) of BCKDC as a substrate, BDP shows a specific activity of 68 nmol/min/mg. The Ca2+-independent binding of BDP to the 24-meric transacylase (dihydrolipoyl transacylase; E2b) core of BCKDC results in a 3-fold increase in the dephosphorylation rate of p-E1b. However, the lipoyl prosthetic group on E2b is not essential for BDP binding or E2b-stimulated phosphatase activity. Acidic residues in the C-terminal linker of the E2b lipoyl domain are essential for the interaction between BDP and E2b. The BDP structure was determined by x-ray crystallography to 2.4 Å resolution. The BDP structure is dominated by a central β-sandwich. There are two protrusions forming a narrow cleft ∼10 Å wide, which constitutes the active site. The carboxylate moieties of acidic residues Asp-109, Asp-207, Asp-298, and Asp-337 in the active-site cleft participate in binding two metal ions. Substitutions of these residues with alanine nullify BDP phosphatase activity. Alteration of the nearby Arg-104 increases the Km for p-E1b peptide by 60-fold, suggesting that this residue is critical for the recognition of the native p-E1b protein.

https://openalex.org/W2015568829,"α-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is believed to facilitate adult Hemoglobin A assembly and protect against toxic free α-globin subunits. Recombinant AHSP binds multiple forms of free α-globin to stabilize their structures and inhibit precipitation. However, AHSP also stimulates autooxidation of αO(2) subunit and its rapid conversion to a partially unfolded bishistidyl hemichrome structure. To investigate these biochemical properties, we altered the evolutionarily conserved AHSP proline 30 in recombinantly expressed proteins and introduced identical mutations into the endogenous murine Ahsp gene. In vitro, the P30W AHSP variant bound oxygenated α chains with 30-fold increased affinity. Both P30W and P30A mutant proteins also caused decreased rates of αO(2) autooxidation as compared with wild-type AHSP. Despite these abnormalities, mice harboring P30A or P30W Ahsp mutations exhibited no detectable defects in erythropoiesis at steady state or during induced stresses. Further biochemical studies revealed that the AHSP P30A and P30W substitutions had minimal effects on AHSP interactions with ferric α subunits. Together, our findings indicate that the ability of AHSP to stabilize nascent α chain folding intermediates prior to hemin reduction and incorporation into adult Hemoglobin A is physiologically more important than AHSP interactions with ferrous αO(2) subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2043374442,"The ShcA adapter protein transmits activating signals downstream of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases through the establishment of phosphotyrosine-dependent complexes. In this regard, ShcA possesses both a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and Src homology 2 domain (SH2), which bind phosphotyrosine residues in a sequence-specific manner. Although the majority of receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in breast cancer cells bind the PTB domain, very little is known regarding the biological importance of SH2-driven ShcA signaling during mammary tumorigenesis. To address this, we employed transgenic mice expressing a mutant ShcA allele harboring a non-functional SH2 domain (ShcR397K) under the transcriptional control of the endogenous ShcA promoter. Using transplantation approaches, we demonstrate that SH2-dependent ShcA signaling within the mammary epithelial compartment is essential for breast tumor outgrowth, survival and the development of lung metastases. We further show that the ShcA SH2 domain activates the AKT pathway, potentially through a novel SH2-mediated complex between ShcA, 14-3-3ζ and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3') kinase. This study is the first to demonstrate that the SH2 domain of ShcA is critical for tumor survival during mammary tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2134100566,"Herein we present the cloning and molecular characterization of CD300d, a member of the human CD300 family of immune receptors. CD300d cDNA was cloned from RNA obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and RT-PCR revealed the gene to be expressed in cells of myeloid lineage. The cloned cDNA encoded for a type I protein with a single extracellular Ig V-type domain and a predicted molecular mass of 21.5 kDa. The short cytoplasmic tail is lacking in any known signaling motif, but there is a negatively charged residue (glutamic acid) within the transmembrane domain. CD300d forms complexes with the CD300 family members, with the exception of CD300c. Contrary to other activating members of the CD300 family of receptors, surface expression of CD300d in COS-7-transfected cells required the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif-bearing adaptor (FcεRγ). Accordingly, we found that CD300d was able to recruit FcεRγ. Unexpectedly, we could not detect CD300d on the surface of cells expressing FcεRγ, suggesting the existence of unknown mechanisms regulating the trafficking of this molecule. The presence of other CD300 molecules also did not modify the intracellular expression of CD300d. In fact, the presence of CD300d decreased the levels of surface expression of CD300f but not CD300c. Our data suggest that the function of CD300d would be related to the regulation of the expression of other CD300 molecules and the composition of CD300 complexes on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2044762887,"The superfamily of cation/Ca(2+) exchangers includes both Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs) and Na(+)/Ca(2+),K(+) exchangers (NCKX) as the families characterized in most detail. These Ca(2+) transporters have prominent physiological roles. For example, NCX and NCKX are important in regulation of cardiac contractility and visual processes, respectively. The superfamily also has a large number of members of the YrbG family expressed in prokaryotes. However, no members of this family have been functionally expressed, and their transport properties are unknown. We have expressed, purified, and characterized a member of the YrbG family, MaX1 from Methanosarcina acetivorans. MaX1 catalyzes Ca(2+) uptake into membrane vesicles. The Ca(2+) uptake requires intravesicular Na(+) and is stimulated by an inside positive membrane potential. Despite very limited sequence similarity, MaX1 is a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger with kinetic properties similar to those of NCX. The availability of a prokaryotic Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger should facilitate structural and mechanistic investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1984652979,"Angiotensin II (AngII), the main effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), participates in multiple biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling. Since AngII activates, in different cell types, signal transducing pathways that are critical for mammary gland postlactational regression, we investigated the role of the RAS during this process. We found that exogenous administration of AngII in mammary glands of lactating Balb/c mice induced epithelium apoptosis [2.9±0.5% (control) vs. 9.6±1.1% (AngII); P < 0.001] and activation of the proapoptotic factor STAT3, an effect inhibited by irbesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Subsequently, we studied the expression kinetics of RAS components during involution. We found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA expression peaked 6 h after weaning (5.7-fold; P<0.01), while induction of angiotensinogen and AT1 and AT2 receptors expression was detected 96 h after weaning (6.2-, 10-, and 6.2-fold increase, respectively; P<0.01). To assess the role of endogenously generated AngII, mice were treated with losartan, an AT1 receptor blocker, during mammary involution. Mammary glands from losartan-treated mice showed activation of the survival factors AKT and BCL-XL, significantly lower LIF and TNF-α mRNA expression (P<0.05), reduced apoptosis [12.1±2.1% (control) vs. 4.8±0.7% (losartan); P<0.001] and shedding of epithelial cells, inhibition of MMP-9 activity in a dose-dependent manner (80%; P<0.05; with losartan IC50 value of 6.9 mg/kg/d] and lower collagen deposition and adipocyte invasion causing a delayed involution compared to vehicle-treated mice. Furthermore, mammary glands of forced weaned AT1A- and/or AT1B-deficient mice exhibited retarded apoptosis of epithelial cells [6.3±0.95% (WT) vs. 3.3±0.56% (AT1A/AT1B DKO); P<0.05] with remarkable delayed postlactational regression compared to wild-type animals. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AngII, via the AT1 receptor, plays a major role in mouse mammary gland involution identifying a novel role for the RAS.—Nahmod, K.
