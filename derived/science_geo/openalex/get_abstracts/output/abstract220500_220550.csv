https://openalex.org/W2018692481,"Increasing evidence suggests that lysosomal proteases are actively involved in apoptosis. Using HeLa cells as the model system, we show that selective lysosome disruption with l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester results in apoptosis, characterized by translocation of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol and by the cleavage of a proapoptotic Bcl-2-family member Bid. Apoptosis and Bid cleavage, but not translocation of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol, could be prevented by 15 μml-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide, an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Incubation of cells with 15 μmN-benzoyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone prevented apoptosis but not Bid cleavage, suggesting that cathepsin-mediated apoptosis in this system is caspase-dependent. In vitro experiments performed at neutral pH showed that papain-like cathepsins B, H, L, S, and K cleave Bid predominantly at Arg65 or Arg71. No Bid cleavage was observed with cathepsins C and X or the aspartic protease cathepsin D. Incubation of full-length Bid treated with cathepsins B, H, L, and S resulted in rapid cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Thus, Bid may be an important mediator of apoptosis induced by lysosomal disruption. Increasing evidence suggests that lysosomal proteases are actively involved in apoptosis.

Thus, Bid may be an important mediator of apoptosis induced by lysosomal disruption. Apoptosis is the major mechanism by which multicellular organisms remove superfluous, infected, damaged, or potentially dangerous cells (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that reside in an inactive zymogen form in the cytosol of virtually every cell, play a major role in apoptotic execution. Caspase activation, a critical event in apoptosis progression, can be achieved in several ways, including the extrinsic pathway, characterized by death receptor-mediated recruitment and activation of apical caspase-8, and the intrinsic pathway, characterized by assembly of cytosolic (APAF-1) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c) factors with subsequent activation of apical caspase-9 (2Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Google Scholar). These two pathways converge at the level of activation of executioner caspases-3 and -7 (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar). The extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways are connected through Bid, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. In certain cell types, caspase-8 has been shown to cleave Bid after Asp59, thereby removing the two N-terminal helices and converting Bid from a latent to a strongly proapoptotic molecule, capable of inducing cytochrome c release through the action of Bax or Bak and subsequent activation of caspase-9 (3Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Google Scholar). Bid is also cleaved during apoptosis by granzyme B, a serine protease from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (4Heibein J.A. Gopsing I.S. Barry M. Pinkoski M.J.

Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Google Scholar). Although all of the cleavage sites differ from the caspase-8 cleavage site, they map to the same region of Bid, corresponding to a loop between α-helices 2 and 3. In addition to caspases, increasing evidence suggests a role for lysosomal proteases in apoptosis, including clearance of infected cells and various pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration (reviewed in Refs. 10Turk B.

Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Google Scholar). Lysosomes contain a number of proteases, among them the aspartic protease cathepsin D and the cysteine protease cathepsin B, which are the most abundant and have most often been reported to be involved in apoptosis induction (12Roberg K. Öllinger K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1151-1156Google Scholar, 13Kågedal K. Zhao M. Svensson I. Brunk U.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 335-343Google Scholar, 14Roberg K. Kågedal K. Öllinger K. Am. J.

Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jäättelä M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Google Scholar). The other abundant lysosomal proteases are the family of papain-like cathepsins related to cathepsin B (cathepsins H, L, K, S, C, X, V, W, F, and O; Refs. 18Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Google Scholar and 19Turk V. Turk B. Turk D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4629-4633Google Scholar). During apoptosis induced by sphingosine and lysosomotropic reagents, cathepsins were found to be translocated to cytosol prior to mitochondrial damage and cytochrome c release, thereby inducing apoptosis by mechanisms that have not yet been clarified (reviewed in Refs. 10Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungerčar J. Cirman T. Droga Mazovec. G. Orešić K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Google Scholar and 11Leist M. Jäättelä M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Google Scholar). In some of the models, cathepsins have been suggested to act independently of caspases, whereas in other models apoptosis was suggested to be caspase-mediated (reviewed in Refs. 10Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungerčar J. Cirman T. Droga Mazovec. G. Orešić K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Google Scholar and 11Leist M. Jäättelä M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Google Scholar). Direct caspase activation by the cathepsins is unlikely because a number of the cathepsins failed to activate proapoptotic caspases-3 and -7 (9Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brömme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 379-387Google Scholar). Therefore, additional cytosolic factor(s) were suggested to be involved (15Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1127-1137Google Scholar). One of the most attractive cytosolic targets of the cathepsins is Bid, which has already been suggested to be an important mediator of lysosomal protease-mediated apoptosis (9Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brömme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Google Scholar, 21Reiners Jr., J.J. Caruso J.A. Mathieu P. Chelladurai B. Yin X.-M. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 934-944Google Scholar). However, the lysosomal protease(s) performing the cleavage have yet to be identified. Our studies were therefore aimed toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which lysosomal proteases induce apoptosis with the major focus on Bid. Using the lysosomotropic agent LeuLeuOMe, 1The abbreviations used are: LeuLeuOMel-leucyl-l-leucine methyl esterAC27Pacetyl-calpastatin 27-peptideE-64l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-amido-(4-guanidino) butaneE-64dl-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamideZN-benzoyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketonePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulphonate.1The abbreviations used are: LeuLeuOMel-leucyl-l-leucine methyl esterAC27Pacetyl-calpastatin 27-peptideE-64l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-amido-(4-guanidino) butaneE-64dl-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamideZN-benzoyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketonePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulphonate. we show that disruption of lysosomes results in translocation of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol and induction of apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism, involving Bid cleavage by papain-like cysteine proteases. To identify the cleaving protease(s), a detailed investigation has been performed using cathepsins B, H, L, S, K, X, C, and D. l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester acetyl-calpastatin 27-peptide l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-amido-(4-guanidino) butane l-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide N-benzoyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulphonate. l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester acetyl-calpastatin 27-peptide l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-amido-(4-guanidino) butane l-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide N-benzoyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulphonate. Proteins—Recombinant human cathepsins B, L, and K, human caspase-8, and mouse Bid were prepared according to published procedures (22Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Pungerčar J. Turk V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 533-539Google Scholar, 23Barlič-Maganja D. Dolinar M. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1449-1452Google Scholar, 24D'Alessio K.J. McQueney M.S. Brun K.A. Orsini M.J. Debouck C.M.

Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Google Scholar), whereas cathepsins H, X, and C were purified from porcine liver (27Gunčar G. Podobnik M. Pungerčar J. Strukelj B. Turk V. Turk D. Structure. 1998; 6: 51-61Google Scholar), human liver (28Klemenčič I. Karaoglanovic-Carmona A. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Gunčar G. Turk D. Krizaj I. Turk V. Turk B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5404-5412Google Scholar), and human kidney (29Dolenc I. Turk B. Kos J. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 277-280Google Scholar), respectively. All of the cathepsins were active site-titrated as described elsewhere (30Rozman-Pungerčar J. Kopitar-Jerala N. Bogyo M. Turk D. Vasiljeva O. Stefe I. Vandenabeele P. Brömme D. Puizdar V. Fonovič M. Trstenjak-Prebanda M. Dolenc I. Turk V. Turk B. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 881-888Google Scholar). Materials—Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 and human adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa were purchased from ATCC. Polyclonal anti-Bid and anti-cathepsin L antibodies were prepared using standard protocols. Monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing the cleaved form of PARP were from Promega, and cytochrome c antibodies were from PharMingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies, fetal calf serum, Percoll, p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-dexy-d-glucopyranoside, cytochrome c, E-64, E-64d, and pepstatin A were obtained from Sigma. The caspase substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluorometylcoumarin, the calpain-specific inhibitor AC27P, and the lysosomotropic reagent LeuLeuOMe were purchased from Bachem. All of the nucleotide primers were purchased from MWG Biotech AG. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Culture and Apoptosis Triggering—HEK 293 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, streptomycin, and penicillin in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HeLa cells from confluent 10-cm dishes were split in a 1:6 ratio to yield 6 × 106/well of 6-well plates. After 10 h E-64d or Z-VAD-fmk was added to a final concentration of 15 μm, followed by overnight incubation. The next day LeuLeuOMe was added in a negligible volume to a final concentration of 400-500 μm. After 24 h the cells were viewed by light microscopy (Olympus M021, magnification 40) and harvested by trypsinization. In control experiments, Me2SO was added in a volume corresponding to the volume of E-64d. Because E-64 and its derivatives also inhibit calpain (30Rozman-Pungerčar J. Kopitar-Jerala N. Bogyo M. Turk D. Vasiljeva O. Stefe I. Vandenabeele P. Brömme D. Puizdar V. Fonovič M. Trstenjak-Prebanda M. Dolenc I. Turk V. Turk B. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 881-888Google Scholar), an additional experiment was performed using 50 μm specific calpain inhibitor AC27P (8Gil-Parrado S. Fernández-Montalván A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27217-27226Google Scholar). Cell Extracts—Initially, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After this step, the procedures for preparing cytosolic or total cell extracts differed. To prepare cytosolic extracts, the cells were washed twice in the isotonic buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES) containing a protease inhibitor mixture including pepstatin A, aprotinin, leupeptin, E-64, and bestatin (Sigma). The cells were homogenized by 20 passages through a 25 G (0.5 × 16) needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, followed by two consecutive centrifugation steps, the first at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the second at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Use of the inhibitors ensured that any unwanted proteolysis, especially the proteolysis by papain-like cathepsins, was prevented during the preparation of the extracts. Total cell extracts were prepared from cells by lysing them in 50 μlof RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA). Following 10 min of incubation on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. In both cases, the supernatants were transferred to fresh test tubes and either used immediately or stored at -80 °C. Total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunodetections—After treatment, aliquots of cell lysates (80 μg of protein based on the Bradford assay) were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Bid, tBid, cathepsin L, the cleaved form of PARP, and cytochrome c were then determined by Western blotting and development with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—To measure phosphatidylserine exposure, 106 HeLa cells were labeled with annexinV-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Measurement of DEVD-ase Activity—Cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were transferred into the 96-well plate and filled to the final volume of 90 μl with the caspase buffer (100 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS, 20% (w/v) sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0). Following 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluorometylcoumarin was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and DEVD-ase activity was measured continuously in an LS50B fluorimeter with plate reader attachment (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively. Isolation of Mouse Liver Lysosomes—Lysosomes were isolated from mouse liver essentially as described previously (9Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brömme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Google Scholar). The fractions collected were assayed for mitochondrial and lysosomal contents using p-iodonitrotetrazolium reductase and β-hexosaminidase as markers (31Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Google Scholar, 32Mehta D.P. Ichikawa M. Salimath P.V. Etchison J.R. Haak R. Manzi A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10897-10903Google Scholar), respectively. The fractions containing pure lysosomes were pooled and washed twice in an equal volume of lysosomal buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The lysosomes were then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for further use. Lysosomal extracts were prepared from lysosomes by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Pellets containing lysosomal membranes were removed by 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was kept on ice and used freshly. In Vitro Cleavage of Bid and Analysis of Cleavage Products—To prevent unwanted inactivation, the enzymes were kept in their normal storage buffers (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for lysosomal extract and cathepsins B and C; 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for cathepsin H; 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for cathepsin S; 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.1, for cathepsin X; 340 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for cathepsins L and K; and 340 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2, for cathepsin D) containing 1 mm EDTA. Cathepsins and lysosomal extracts were then added in a small volume (≤5 μl) to the same buffers with pH raised to pH 7.2, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) and 20 μm Bid to a final volume of 35 μl. As verified in separate experiments, this ensured that the final pH (7.2) remained unchanged. Caspase-8 incubated in caspase buffer (see above) was used as a positive control. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol and SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. In another experiment, the lysosomal extracts were pretreated with E-64 (final concentration, 20-300 μm) and/or pepstatin A (500 μm) for 30 min prior to addition of Bid. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or, alternatively, transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained for 1 min with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad), destained, and washed overnight with distilled water. The appropriate bands were then excised, and the N-terminal sequences of the Bid cleavage products were determined by Applied Biosystems 492 amino acid sequencer. Isolation of Mouse Heart Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from murine hearts using the modified procedure of Ott et al. (33Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orreius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 599: 1259-1263Google Scholar). The mitochondria were resuspended in an equal volume of MSH buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mm MgCl2), pH 7.5, kept on ice, and used within 30 min to minimize the risk of disruption. In Vitro Assay for Cytochrome c Release from Purified Mitochondria— Recombinant Bid (7 μg) was incubated with cathepsins B, L, H, S, and K (final concentrations, 50 nm to 3 μm) in 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 5 mm dithiothreitol, in a final volume of 30 μl for 40 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of fresh murine mitochondria (20 μg of protein). Following an additional 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were separated from mitochondria by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cytochrome c was then detected by Western blotting. In a control experiment, a pellet containing mitochondria was treated with 2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Preparation of Bid Variants in pcDNA3—Full-length Bid (flBid) was excised from pGEX4Ti vector using EcoRI and XhoI sites and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector at the same sites. Truncated Bid variants were generated by PCR using primers that bound to flBid DNA. The following primers were used: 5′-AGCGAATTCATGTGGGAGGCAGA-3′ for tBid-Tyr47, 5′-TTGGAATTCATGACAGACGGCAGC-3′ for tBid-Gln57, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGGGCAGCCAGGC-3′ for tBid-Asp59, 5′-TCCGAATTCATGTCCTTCAACC-3′ for tBid-Arg65, and 5′-TCGGAATTCATGATAGAGCCAGA-3′ for tBid-Arg71. The reverse primer was always 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTCCATC-3′. All of the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing using an Abi Prism 310 automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fragments were then inserted into pcDNA3 using EcoRI and XhoI sites. To check whether the new constructs generate functional protein, tBid and flBid proteins were expressed in vitro using the Promega TnT-coupled transcription-translation system and radiolabeling with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The efficiency of expression was monitored by analyzing the translate by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transfections of Cells with tBid Variants—Transfections of HEK 293 cells were performed in 12-well plates. The cells were transfected with equal amounts of pcDNA3/tBid constructs using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. pcDNA3 and pcDNA3/flBid were used as negative controls, whereas the pcDNA3/caspase-8 construct was used as a positive control. Transfection efficacy was controlled by cotransfections with EGFP. Characterization of LeuLeuOMe-triggered Cell Death in HeLa Cells—LeuLeuOMe has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells, including natural killer cells and macrophages, by selective disruption of lysosomes. The compound enters lysosomes by endocytosis. LeuLeuOMe accumulates in lysosomes followed by conversion to its membranolytic form (LeuLeu)n-OMe (n ≥ 3) by the transesterase activity of another lysosomal protease, cathepsin C (dipeptidyl peptidase I) (34Thiele D.L. Lipsky P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 83-87Google Scholar). Finally, lysosomal membrane integrity is lost, resulting in caspase activation and apoptosis (35Uchimoto T. Nohara H. Kamehara R. Iwamura M. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 357-362Google Scholar). Various cells exhibit different sensitivity toward LeuLeuOMe, the most sensitive being the cytotoxic lymphocytes (36Thiele D.L. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3950-3957Google Scholar, 37Kobayashi Y. Takasaki A. Kurosaka K. Sakurai Y. Iwamura M. Watanabe N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 687-690Google Scholar). Because of their reasonably high content of Bid and various cathepsins including cathepsin C, we chose HeLa cells as a cellular model to investigate this process. Initially, LeuLeuOMe in the concentration range 50-1000 μm was tested for its ability to induce cell death. The majority of cells died in an apoptotic manner at LeuLeuOMe concentrations of ≥300 μm with an optimum at 400-500 μm. This is in agreement with previous results on human myeloma tumor cell lines U937, HL60, and THP-1 (200-500 μm; Refs. 35Uchimoto T. Nohara H. Kamehara R. Iwamura M. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 357-362Google Scholar and 36Thiele D.L. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3950-3957Google Scholar). However, at LeuLeuOMe concentrations ≥750 μm, the cells died with necrotic morphology without any increase in caspase activity (not shown). Therefore, all further experiments were performed at LeuLeuOMe concentrations of 400-500 μm. Treatment of HeLa cells with 500 μm LeuLeuOMe for 24 h resulted in detachment of cells from the culture dishes and major morphological changes, such as considerable cell shrinkage and rounding (Fig. 1A). All of the morphological changes were substantially prevented by pretreatment of cells with a general inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins E-64d at 15 μm or with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, also at 15 μm (Fig. 1A), suggesting involvement of both cysteine cathepsins and caspases in the process. In the next step, the cells were tested for the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, another marker of apoptosis, by flow cytometry. Following LeuLeuOMe treatment 62.5% of cells were apoptotic, which could be prevented by pretreating cells with 15 μm E-64d (11.8% apoptotic cells) or with 15 μm Z-VAD-fmk (16.9% apoptotic cells). In a control experiment 10.8% of cells were apoptotic, similar to the result in the presence of E-64d (11.5%) or Z-VAD-fmk (7.5%) alone, which were used as negative controls (Fig. 1B). Similarly, DEVD-ase activity (a reporter of general caspase activation) was highly elevated in LeuLeuOMe-treated cells (Fig. 1C), in agreement with a major role of caspases in this type of cell death (35Uchimoto T. Nohara H. Kamehara R. Iwamura M. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 357-362Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activation was confirmed by immunodetection of cleaved PARP using the antibodies that specifically recognize the caspase-3-generated truncated form of PARP in LeuLeuOMe-treated cells only (Fig. 1D). However, caspase activity could be ablated by pretreating cells either with 15 μm E-64d or 15 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1, C and D) but not by AC27P (Fig. 1C), thereby suggesting that calpains are not implicated in this apoptosis model. Finally, translocation of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol was confirmed by Western blot analysis, demonstrating the presence of active cathepsin L in the cytosolic extract of HeLa cells treated with LeuLeuOMe (Fig. 1E). Significantly, none of the inhibitors used (E-64d or Z-VAD-fmk) prevented translocation of cathepsin L to the cytosol, strongly suggesting that active cathepsins are required in the cytosol to activate caspases (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, in all of the control cells but not in LeuLeuOMe-treated cells, a small band with a slightly higher molecular mass (∼33 kDa), probably corresponding to the inactive zymogen form of cathepsin L, was observed (Fig. 1E). LeuLeuOMe-triggered Apoptosis in HeLa Cells Is Accompanied by Bid Cleavage—The finding that cathepsins act upstream of caspases in HeLa cells, where apoptosis was triggered by selective lysosome disruption, raised the question about the molecular mechanism of caspase activation in this model. We focused our studies on Bid, which has been suggested to be a sensor of lysosomal proteases (9Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brömme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Google Scholar, 21Reiners Jr., J.J. Caruso J.A. Mathieu P. Chelladurai B. Yin X.-M. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 934-944Google Scholar). First, the presence of Bid in untreated HeLa cells was confirmed, and Bid was found as a full-length form migrating at ∼22 kDa (Fig. 2). Next, HeLa cells were treated for 24 h with LeuLeuOMe (200-400 μm), which resulted in partial cleavage of Bid and appearance of another band migrating at ∼15 kDa. Generation of this truncated (tBid) variant was completely abolished in the presence of E-64d but not Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that papain-like cathepsins were directly or indirectly responsible for the cleavage. In Vitro Cleavage of Recombinant Bid—Although inhibition of cathepsins blocked Bid cleavage induced by lysosomotropic agents in HeLa cells, this does not necessary indicate that cathepsins directly cleave Bid. To address this question, in vitro experiments were performed using recombinant mouse Bid. First, recombinant Bid was incubated at neutral pH with lysosomal extracts, containing 2.3 μm cathepsins as judged on the basis of E-64 titration, resulting in complete Bid degradation (Fig. 3A). Bid degradation was prevented by preincubation with E-64 (≥15 μm), suggesting that papain-like cathepsins are responsible for the cleavage, in agreement with results in our cellular model. In contrast, preincubation of the extracts with pepstatin (500 μm) only partially protected Bid against degradation, suggesting a minor role, if any, for the cathepsin D and related aspartic proteases. Second, to identify Bid cleavage sites by the lysosomal proteases, the experiment was repeated with a lower concentration of lysosomal extracts (not shown). A single cleavage product was found and analyzed by electroblotting and N-terminal"

Here we report that SGT1 and Rar1 associate with the molecular chaperone Hsp90.

Suppression of Hsp90 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants shows that it plays an important role in plant growth and development.

In their natural environment plants are subject to attack by a variety of microbial pathogens and by insect and nematode pests. Plants have therefore evolved a diverse repertoire of defense mechanisms that allow them to evade these assaults.

Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1971; 9: 275-296Crossref Google Scholar). Recognition of pathogen avirulence products by plant R proteins initiates a signaling cascade leading to a type of localized cell death at the site of pathogen entry known as the hypersensitive response, rapid oxidative burst, ion fluxes, strengthening of cell walls, protein phosphorylation, and the activation of various defense response genes (2.Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar).In recent years a number of R genes have been cloned, providing insight into their structure and the nature of hostpathogen interactions (2.Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Much progress has been made in deciphering the signaling pathways involved in R gene-mediated resistance (3.Hammond-Kosack K.E. Parker J.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that most known R genes require two signaling components, Rar1 and/or SGT1. Rar1 is present in all eukaryotes examined so far except yeast and possesses a pair of 60-amino acid zinc finger motifs termed CHORD-I and CHORD-II (cysteine- and histidine-rich domains) (4.Shirasu K. Lahaye T. Tan M.-W. Schulze-Lefert P. Cell. 1999; 99: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Metazoan Rar1 has an additional C-terminal domain called the CS domain, which is found in yeast and plant SGT1 and human SIP proteins (5.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol.

Interestingly, Rar1 interacts directly with SGT1 in plants (8.Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Frelaldenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In yeast, plants, and mammals SGT1/SIP associates with the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex (5.Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 6.Matsuzawa S.-I. Reed J.C. Mol.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Components of the SCF complex are also known to interact with the COP9 signalosome (11.Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsude T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), which functions in protein degradation via the 26 S proteasome (12.Wei N. Deng X.-W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Accordingly, plant SGT1 and Rar1 associate with subunits of the COP9 signalosome (8.Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Frelaldenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, silencing of CSN3 and -8, two components of the COP9 signalosome, compromises N gene-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Association of SGT1 with the SCF ubiquitin ligase and the COP9 signalosome suggests that plant SGT1 and Rar1 might play some role in ubiquitination of resistance-regulating proteins via a specific SCF complex.The CS domain of SGT1 is similar to the human p23 protein, which is known to interact with heat shock protein 90-kDa (Hsp90) and to participate in the folding of different regulatory proteins (13.Garcia-Ranea J.A. Mirey G. Camonis J. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SGT1 proteins also contain a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is an Hsp90-binding domain in co-chaperones (14.Picard D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). SGT1 and Rar1 might associate with Hsp90 to play a chaperone-like function in the assembly or the conformational regulation of diverse multiprotein complexes (15.Stemmann O. Neidig A. Kocher T. Wilm M. Lechner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in a yeast two-hybrid screen with Nicotiana benthamiana Rar1 (NbRar1) as bait, NbSGT1 and NbHsp90 were identified as interacting proteins (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Very recently, a screen with barley Rar1 (HvRar1) has also identified a cytosolic Hsp90 as an interacting protein (16.Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).Hsp90 is an abundant, highly conserved, ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that is essential for eukaryotic cell viability (see review, Ref. 14.Picard D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Studies, primarily with animals, have revealed that Hsp90 plays roles in a diverse array of cellular processes including protein folding, stress responses, signal transduction, and genomic silencing. Recent studies show that Hsp90 also plays a critical role in the ATP-dependent assembly of the 26 S proteasome (17.Imai J. Maruya M. Yashiroda H. Yahara I. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3557-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that Hsp90 acts as a buffer against genetic variation as a capacitor of phenotypic variation in plants as in fruit flies (18.Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 19.Queitsch C. Sangster T.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 2002; 417: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Although Hsp90 genes have been isolated from several plant species (see review, Ref. 20.Krishna P. Gloor G. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 238-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), understanding of the function and regulation of Hsp90 in plants is limited. Furthermore, the role of Hsp90 in plant defense remains obscure, although there has been recent progress in this area (16.Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21.Kanzaki H. Saitoh H. Ito A. Fujisawa S. Kamoun S. Katou S. Yoshioka H. Terauchi R. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2003; 4: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Here we report that the Hsp90 that interacts with NbRar1 also interacts with the TIR-NB-LRR protein N that mediates resistance to TMV (22.Whitham S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Choi D. Hehl R. Corr C. Baker B. Cell. 1994; 78: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). We show that N, NbRar1, and NbSGT1 interact with Hsp90 in yeast two-hybrid and in in vitro pulldown assays. In addition, we show that Hsp90 forms a complex with N, NbRar1, and NbSGT1 in vivo. Knockdown of Hsp90 expression using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) suggests that it is required for plant survival. Moreover, the suppression of Hsp90 compromises N-mediated resistance to TMV. Our results suggest that SGT1 and Rar1 associate with Hsp90 as co-chaperones in the assembly or the conformational regulation of R protein recognition complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—NbSGT1 and NbRar1 fusion to LexA-BD are described in Ref. 9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar. NbRar1 CHORD-I and N-LRR domain fusions to LexA-BD were generated by cloning cDNA PCR products into pTBS1 downstream of the LexA-BD. pTBS1 is a derivative of pESC-His (Stratagene) and contains a NLS-LexA-BD under the control of the GAL10 promoter. The NLS-p50 PCR product was cloned into pTBS1 downstream of the GAL1 promoter. NbHsp90-1 fusion to AD was generated by cloning the full-length PCR product of NbHsp90-1 into pJG4-5 (23.Finley R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Probes: A Practical Approach.

A tomato Hsp90 cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1-717) was inserted into pTRV2.The vector pYL436, contains the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag consisting of MYC9-His6-3C protease cleavage site-IgG2 binding domain. 2Y. Liu and S. P. Dinesh-Kumar, unpublished material. The tag was fused to the C terminus of the N coding sequence upstream of the 3′-untranslated region. The entire genomic clone, consisting of the 5′-regulatory sequence, the N coding sequence with the TAP tag, and the 3′-untranslated region was then placed into pCAM-BIA2300 (GenBank™ accession number AF234315) to generate pTBS21, N-TAP. GFP PCR product was cloned into pYL436 upstream of the TAP tag to generate 35 S::GFP-TAP.Yeast Two- and Three-hybrid Screens and Interaction Assays—The yeast two-hybrid library used has been described (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Yeast two- and three-hybrid screens and interaction assays were performed as described (23.Finley R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Probes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 169-201Google Scholar).GST Pull-down Assay—GST-NbSGT1, GST-NbRar1, and GST-N-LRR fusion proteins were produced in BL21 (DE3) codon plus RIL cells (Stratagene) and affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Approximately 1 μg of purified GST fusion proteins and GST alone as control were used to pull down [35S]Met-labeled in vitro translated (TnT, Promega) NbHsp90-1 as described in Ref. 9.Liu Y.

Schiff M. Marathe R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant J. 2002; 30: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) were generated in rabbits and affinity purified using custom service from Invitrogen.Co-immunoprecipitation—Total protein was extracted from N. benthamiana plants containing the N gene (NN plants) using the protocol described in Ref. 9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, and immunoprecipitations were performed using the ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Anti-NbRar1, anti-NbSGT1 antibodies, and respective preimmune serum were coupled to AminoLink Plus gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immune complexes were eluted from the resin, and 20-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using plant specific anti-Hsp90 antibodies (the kind gift of Priti Krishna, University of Western Ontario).N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pTBS21 and 35 S::GFP-TAP. The expression of N- and GFP-TAP was verified 6 days after infiltration by Western blot with anti-MYC antibodies. Protein extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared using 0.4 g of tissue and 0.8 ml of buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor). Extracts were incubated with washed IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then spun down and washed three times in extraction buffer. SDS sample buffer was added, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and NbHsp90 was detected using anti-Hsp90 antibodies.VIGS Assay, Virus Infection, and GFP Imaging—VIGS assay was performed as described in Ref. 24.Liu Y. Schiff M. Marathe R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant J. 2002; 30: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar. A. tumefaciens containing pTRV1 and -2 or its derivatives and pPVX and pPVX-NbHsp90-1 cultures (A600 = 1.0) were infiltrated into the lower leaves of four-leaf-stage plants using a 1-ml needleless syringe. To analyze the effect of silencing on TMV resistance, 4 days after infiltration the upper leaves of plants were infiltrated with A. tumefaciens GV2260 culture (A600 = 1.0) containing the TMV-GFP T-DNA vector pSPDK661 (24.Liu Y. Schiff M. Marathe R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant J. 2002; 30: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Each silencing experiment was repeated three times, and each experiment included at least four independent plants. GFP imaging was performed using UV illumination, and photographs were taken using an Olympus Camedia E10 digital camera (Tokyo, Japan).RT-PCR Analysis—To analyze the transcript levels of NbHsp90-1 in silenced and non-silenced plants, RT-PCR was performed as described in Ref. 24.Liu Y. Schiff M. Marathe R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant J. 2002; 30: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar. Primers that anneal outside the region of the VIGS target sequence were used. PCR was performed for 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 cycles for EF-1α internal control analysis and cycles 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 for NbHsp90-1 analysis. Control PCR (using RNA without RT) was performed for 30 cycles for EF-1α and 22 cycles for NbHsp90-1. The intensities of the PCR bands were analyzed and quantified using Gel Doc 2000 and Quantity One version 4.2.1 (Bio-Rad).To detect the presence of TMV, total RNA was extracted from upper uninoculated leaves and used to generate the first-strand cDNA using a primer that anneals to the movement protein gene of TMV. This first-strand cDNA was used in PCRs, and the resulting PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.Northern Analysis—Transgenic SR1 tobacco plants carrying N (22.Whitham S.

The plants were kept at 32 °C for 3 days, then placed at room temperature, and samples collected at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h. RNA was extracted from samples using RNAwiz (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Samples were then analyzed by Northern blot using standard molecular biology protocols. The probe used was derived from NbHsp90-1 using the same primers used in RT-PCR analysis.RESULTSIdentification of NbHSP90 as NbRar1-interacting Partner—Previous studies from our laboratory had identified 13 clones that represented the ATPase domain of two classes of tomato Hsp90, LeHsp90-1 and LeHsp90-2, as an NbRar1-interacting partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although Rar1 possesses two N-terminal CHORD domains, the CHORD-II domain of Rar1 is responsible for interaction with SGT1 (8.Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Frelaldenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in determining the proteins interacting with the CHORD-I domain of Rar1. We used this domain as bait to screen a tomato cDNA library and identified several interacting proteins including LeHsp90-1 and the smaller chaperones Hsp70 and -40.We cloned full-length Hsp90 cDNAs from tomato and N. benthamiana by reverse transcription with primers based on the LeHsp90-1 sequence followed by PCR (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis of six independent cDNA clones suggests that there are two sequences showing high similarity to LeHsp90-1 in N. benthamiana (NbHsp90-1 and -2). Both encode open reading frames of 669 amino acids and are highly homologous (Fig. 1). NbHsp90-1 and -2 possess the C-terminal MEEVD pentapeptide that is characteristic of cytoplasmic Hsp90 proteins (20.Krishna P. Gloor G. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 238-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these proteins with Arabidopsis and human cytoplasmic Hsp90 proteins revealed very high homology (Fig. 1). Because NbHsp90-1 and -2 were almost identical to one another, we chose to use NbHsp90-1 for all further analysis.NbHsp90-1 Interacts Directly with NbSGT1 and NbRar1—NbRar1 interacts with NbSGT1 both in vitro and in vivo (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and silencing of NbSGT1 leads to loss of N-mediated resistance to TMV (9.Liu Y. Schiff M. Serino G. Deng X.-W. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 10.Peart J.R. Lu R. Sadanandom A. Malcuit I. Moffet P. Brice D.C. Schauser L. Jaggard D.A. Xiao S.

We tested the direct interaction between Nb-SGT1 and full-length NbHsp90-1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. NbSGT1 was expressed as a fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain ((LexA-BD) LexA-NbSGT1). NbHsp90-1 was expressed as a fusion to the B42 activation domain ((AD) AD-NbHsp90-1). Expression of both constructs was under the control of galactose-inducible promoters. Yeast transformed with LexA-NbSGT1 and AD-NbHsp90-1 grew on Leu- selection media and turned blue on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) plates containing galactose but not glucose (Fig. 2A, top panels). Control yeast containing LexA-BD or AD alone was not able to grow on selection plates or turn X-gal blue on glucose or galactose (Fig. 2A, bottom panels). NbSGT1 therefore interacts directly with NbHsp90-1.Fig. 2NbRar1, NbSGT1, and N-LRR interact directly with NbHsp90 in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro. A, yeast strains transformed with bait LexA-BD-NbSGT1 (first row, top and bottom panels) or NLS-LexA-NbRar1 (second row, top and bottom panels) and prey AD-NbHsp90-1 grew on Leu- selection medium containing galactose and turned blue on X-gal plates containing galactose. Control strains transformed with LexA-BD and AD only showed no growth on Leu- selection medium containing galactose and remained white on X-gal plates. Glucose-containing media were used as a control. Interactions were carried out at 28 °C for 4 days. B, for in vitro binding assays, 1 μg of GST-NbSGT1 (lane 2), GST-NbRar1 (lane 3), or GST (lane 4) was incubated with 35S-labeled NbHsp90-1. Beads were washed and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. As a control, 10% of input 35S-labeled NbHsp90-1 was loaded directly onto the same gel (lane 1). C, yeast strains transformed with bait LexA-BD-N-LRR+p50 (first row, top and bottom panels) or LexA-BD-N-LRR (second row, top and bottom panels) and prey AD-NbHsp90-1 grew on Leu- selection medium containing galactose and turned blue on X-gal plates containing galactose. Control strains transformed with LexA-BD and AD only showed no growth on Leu- selection medium containing galactose and remained white on X-gal plates. Glucose-containing media was used as a control. Interactions were carried out at 28 °C for 4 days. D, for in vitro interaction, 1 μg of GST-N-LRR (lane 2) or GST (lane 3) was incubated with 35S-labeled NbHsp90-1. Beads were washed and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. 10% of input 35S-labeled NbHsp90-1 was loaded directly onto the same gel as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using a similar assay, we examined the interaction between full-length NbHsp90-1 and NbRar1. Yeast transformed with LexA-NbRar1 and AD-NbHsp90-1 was able to grow on selection media containing galactose but not on glucose, whereas control yeast grew on neither (Fig. 2A). This demonstrated that NbRar1 is able to directly interact with full-length NbHsp90-1 also.We confirmed these interactions in vitro by GST pull-down assays. NbRar1 and NbSGT1 were individually expressed in E. coli as GST fusions and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The identity of these proteins was confirmed by Western blot with GST antibodies (data not shown). 35S-Radiolabeled NbHsp90-1 was in vitro translated and mixed with GST fusions proteins. Analysis of the bound fraction by fluorography indicates that NbHsp90-1 binds directly to GST-NbRar1 and GST-NbSGT1 (Fig. 2B). GST alone control did not interact with in vitro translated NbHsp90-1 (Fig. 2B).The LRR Domain of N Interacts with Hsp90-1—The LRR domain of R proteins has been implicated in recognition of pathogens and downstream signaling (2.Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify protein factors that may interact with the LRR domain of N (N-LRR), we performed a three-hybrid screen using N-LRR as bait in the presence of its avirulence determinant, TMV-p50. In this screen full-length LeHsp90-1, protein phosphatase 5, and plant-specific transcription factors were identified.Interaction of NbHsp90-1 with N-LRR was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis and GST pull-down assay. Yeast containing both LexA-N-LRR+TMV-p50 and AD-NbHsp90-1 grew on Leu- selection media containing galactose but not glucose (Fig. 2C). They turned blue on media containing X-gal and galactose but remained white on media with glucose (Fig. 2C). We then tested the interaction between N-LRR and NbHsp90-1 in the absence of TMV-p50. Our results indicate that the interaction between N-LRR and NbHsp90-1 is independent of TMV-p50 (Fig. 2C). Control yeast expressing LexA-BD and AD alone was unable to activate transcription of reporter genes on media containing either glucose or galactose (Fig. 2C).For in vitro pull-down assays, N-LRR was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion (GST-N-LRR) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. 35S-Radiolabeled NbHsp90-1 was in vitro translated and mixed with GST-N-LRR fusion protein. Analysis of the bound fraction indicates that GST-N-LRR binds directly to NbHsp90-1 (Fig. 2D). A GST alone control fails to interact with in vitro translated NbHsp90-1 (Fig. 2D). The association of Hsp90-1 with N protein in addition to its interaction with NbRar1 and NbSGT1 suggested that this protein is critical in N-mediated resistance signaling.NbHsp90 Interacts Directly with N, NbRar1, and NbSGT1 in Vivo—We tested whether NbHsp90 physically associates with N, NbRar1, and NbSGT1 in vivo. Wild type N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with A. tumefaciens containing an N-TAP construct. In this construct, N is fused to a tandem affinity purification tag that contains the MYC epitope. In addition, expression of the N-TAP fusion is under the control of its native N promoter and N-3′ sequence. N. benthamiana tissue infiltrated with this functional N-TAP was collected 6 days postinfiltration. Immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts from the N-TAP-transfected tissue detected a single protein band of the expected N-TAP fusion size (Fig. 3A, lane 3) compared with the control non-transfected tissue (Fig. 3A, lane 2). To test whether N associates with Hsp90, we incubated total protein extracts from the N-TAP and control GFP-TAP-transfected tissue with IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads. Bound fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Hsp90 antibodies (25.Krishna P. Reddy R.K. Sacco M. Frappier J.R. Felsheim R.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that immunoreact with NbHsp90 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that N exists in a complex with Hsp90 (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Control immunoprecipitations with a GFP-TAP fusion did not detect Hsp90 (Fig. 3C, lane 3).Fig. 3Hsp90 association with N, NbRar1, and NbSGT1 in vivo. A-C, wild type N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium carrying the N- or GFP-TAP constructs. Expression of N-TAP fusion was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-MYC antibodies (A, lane 3). Tissue from wild type plants was used as control (A, lane 2).

Here we investigate the mechanism underlying Notch-1-mediated anti-apoptotic function in T cells using model cell lines as the experimental system. Ectopic expression of the intracellular domain of Notch-1/activated Notch (AcN1) increases expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family, the Bcl-2 family, and the FLICE-like inhibitor protein (FLIP) and inhibits death triggered by multiple stimuli that activate intrinsic or extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in human and murine T cell lines. Numb inhibited the AcN1-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic function. Using pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative approaches, we describe a functional role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt/PKB in the regulation of AcN1-mediated anti-apoptotic function and the expression of FLIP and IAP family proteins. Using a cell line deficient for the T cell-specific, Src family protein, the tyrosine kinase p56lck and by reconstitution approaches we demonstrate that p56lck is required for the Notch-1-mediated activation of Akt/PKB function. Furthermore, the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, abrogated ectopically expressed AcN1-mediated anti-apoptotic function and phosphorylation of p56lck. We present evidence that endogenous Notch-1 associates with p56lck and PI3K but that Akt/PKB does not co-immunoprecipitate with the Notch1·p56lck·PI3K complex. Finally, we demonstrate that the Notch1·p56lck·PI3K complex is present in primary T cells that have been activated in vitro and sustained in culture with the cytokine interleukin-2.

The Notch family of transmembrane receptors are important regulators of cell fate determination events in different cell types. Upon activation by ligands usually located on the surface of neighboring cells, Notch undergoes intramembrane proteolysis and release of an intracellular region resulting in signaling (1.Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4856) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Notch-1 signaling is incompletely understood even in well characterized genetic models like Drosophila or the worm. There is recent evidence of the interaction of Notch together with T cell antigen receptor in determination of cell fate within the T cell lineage (2.Robey E. Chang D. Itano A. Cado D. Alexander H.

Furthermore, Notch-1 has been shown to protect against anoikis (apoptosis induced by matrix withdrawal) or p53-mediated apoptosis in immortalized epithelial cells (4.Rangarajan A. Syal R.

Caspase-induced apoptosis is regulated by endogenous antagonists like FLICE-like inhibitor protein (FLIP) that prevent processing and anti-apoptotic proteins of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that block function (11.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). The release of intermediates from the mitochondrial intermembrane space that occurs as an initial step is blocked by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (12.Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Mature T cells develop from immature precursors through complex but ordered processes (13.Goldrath A.W. Bevan M.J. Nature. 1999; 402: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that Notch signaling regulates the earliest stages of T cell commitment and promotes differentiation in the T cell lineage (14.Izon D.J. Punt J.A. Pear W.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15.Radtke F. Wilson A. Ernst B. MacDonald H.R. Immunol.

During T cell development, negative selection ensures deletion of autoreactive thymocytes and allows maturation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (13.Goldrath A.W. Bevan M.J. Nature. 1999; 402: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Notch involvement in Bcl-2-dependent survival signaling in immature T cells was first reported in this model (7.Deftos M.L. He Y.W. Ojala E.W. Bevan M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thymic maturation into CD4+ or CD8+ subsets of mature T cells is accompanied by the emigration of these cells to peripheral lymphoid organs. Mature T cells remain susceptible to varied apoptotic stimuli, many of which are regulated via pathways distinct from those in thymocytes (17.Boehme S.A. Lenardo M.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4075-4078PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

In this study we ask if Notch-1 regulates apoptosis in model T cell lines and have attempted to identify the molecular mechanism of Notch-1 dependent anti-apoptotic function.We show that ectopic expression of the intracellular domain of Notch-1 (AcN1) confers protection against diverse stimuli that trigger intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of death in model T cell lines. This anti-apoptotic function, we suggest, can result from the AcN1-induced elevated expression of IAP-2, Bcl-xL and FLIP, which represent three major families of anti-apoptotic proteins. The protective effect of AcN1 was attenuated by the Notch antagonist Numb and disruption of Akt/PKB-dependent signaling. Furthermore, we show that loss of function of the T cell-specific, Src family, non-receptor tyrosine kinase p56lck compromised Akt/PKB phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic function. This allows us to propose a functional hierarchy of interactions between Notch-1, PI3K, and p56lck that might operate in T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Jurkat, a T lymphoblastoid cell line of human origin, and 2B4, a murine T cell hybridoma, were used in all experiments. The J.CaM1.6 mutant was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Activated T cells were generated by stimulation in vitro as described before and sustained in interleukin-2 (20.Sarin A. Wu M.L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Activated T cells were used on day 5 after stimulation. All reagents were obtained from Calbiochem unless specified otherwise. The mitochondrial dye JC-1 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant TNF, TRAIL, and antibodies to Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and FLIP were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies to Akt, BIM, IAP-1, IAP-2, Jagged, p38MAPK, p56lck, PI3K, and GFP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), antibodies to phosphorylated p56lck or Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and the monoclonal antibody to GFP was from Clontech, BD Biosciences. Antibodies to the various domains of Notch and their sources are as follows: Notch-1 intracellular domain referred to as NICDHB (clone C17.9C6) and to Notch-1 intracellular domain nucleotides 6658–7131 (clone bTan 20) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA); Notch-1 carboxyl terminus referred to as NICDSC (M-20) and to the Notch-1 extracellular domain, residues 20–150, referred to as Notch-1 ECSC (H-131), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and to residues 1299–1492 in the extracellular domain of Notch-1, referred to as Notch-1 ECUB (clone 8G10), was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).Plasmids and Transfections—The AcN encoding plasmid pcDNA3-ICTX (AcN1; Ref. 21.Aster J.C.

Aster (Harvard Medical School, Boston). This construct was used to generate stable transfectants. AcN-IRES-GFP was a gift from Annapoorni Rangarajan (White-head Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA). In addition, we generated the AcN1-GFP construct for which the AcN1 region (spanning amino acids 1759–2556) was amplified using the following specific primers: FP, 5′-GGAATTCATGCGCAAGCGCCGG-3′ and RP, 5′-CGGGATCCTCACACGTCTGCCTG-3′) and cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFPN1. All three constructs, which principally comprise the intracellular domain of Notch-1, yielded the same results in biochemical and functional assays. The dominant-negative mutant of Akt, AH-Akt, was obtained from Julian Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK). The Bcl-2 plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. S. Perwez Hussain (NCI, National Institutes of Health). The construct for Numb (22.Zhong W. Feder J.N. Jiang M.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) was obtained from Weimin Zhong (Yale University). The mouse Lck clone NT-18 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The open reading frame of Lck was PCR-amplified and cloned into the ScaI and KpnI sites of the pCruz Myc expression vector (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sequences of the primers used for the PCR are 5′-AAAAGTACTATGGGCTGTGTCTGC-3′ (FP) and 5′-GGGGTACCTCAAGGCTGGGGCTG-3′ (RP). The sequence of all constructs was verified by automated sequencing.Stable cell lines expressing neo, AcN1 or Bcl-2 were generated by transfection with 2 μg of DNA of appropriate plasmids by electroporation. After 48 h, cells were cultured for 10–14 days in complete medium supplemented with 80 μg/ml G418 for selective growth of transfected cells. Selected cells were not subcloned further. A minimum of two separate sets of stable transfectants have been tested in these experiments. Electroporations were performed as described previously (23.Sade H. Sarin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electroporation usually resulted in transfection efficiencies ranging from 20–25% and were higher in some experiments. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times unless indicated otherwise.Assays of Apoptotic Damage—Apoptotic nuclear morphology, phosphatidylserine exposure, cell lysis, and mitochondrial damage were assessed as described previously (23.Sade H. Sarin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD Biosciences FACS® (BD Biosciences). Apoptotic nuclear damage was assessed in GFP-transfected cells as described before (23.Sade H. Sarin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were performed in transiently transfected populations. 107 cell pellets were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 450 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was divided into 2 aliquots, one aliquot incubated overnight with Sepharose G beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) preincubated for 1 h with specific antibody and the other aliquot with beads similarly incubated but with an isotype-matched antibody as a control. Lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by gentle rocking, and then beads with bound proteins (immune complex) were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Immune complexes were washed in lysis buffer, resolved on SDS gels, and the proteins detected by Western blot analysis. In immunoprecipitations using p56lck, a polyclonal antibody to Akt (raised in rabbit) from the same company was used as negative control. In experiments where the polyclonal antibody (goat) to Notch intracellular domain was used, a polyclonal antibody (raised in goat) recognizing Bim and from the same company was used as the control group. In other experiments, purified rabbit and goat Ig have been used as negative controls with identical results. In experiments where GFP was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal to GFP, purified monoclonal mouse Ig (Sigma) was used as a control.Western Blot Analysis of Proteins—Cell lysates of 0.2–0.5 × 106 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and protocols recommended by the manufacturers were used for Western blot analysis of BID, Bcl-xL, FLIP, and Notch. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence using Super Signal (Pierce). p38MAPK was used to establish parity of loading in 10–12% SDS gels, and Akt or spectrin was used as the loading control (LC) for 8–10% SDS gels. The term LC has been used to indicate these proteins in the various Western blots.RESULTSThe murine T cell hybridoma 2B4 and the human lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat have been used in all experiments. All experiments have been performed using both the stable and transient expression of AcN1 in these cell lines. Stable transfectants of Jurkat and 2B4 were derived as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For clarity of presentation, the data presented in the figures were derived from either transient or stable transfections in different experiments.AcN1 Blocks Apoptosis and Induces Expression of Anti-apoptotic Proteins—The 2B4 T cell hybridoma has been used in many studies as a model system to examine the regulation of apoptosis in mature T cells (24.Yang Y. Liu Z.H. Ware C.F. Ashwell J.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 550-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Sarin A. Adams D.H. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants of 2B4 cells constitutively expressing the intracellular domain of Notch-1 (AcN1) (hereafter referred to as 2B4-AcN1S) had significantly increased levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, FLIPL, and IAP-2 (Fig. 1A). Bcl-2 expression is relatively high in 2B4 cells and was not substantially increased in 2B4-AcN1S cells in comparison with cells transfected with the neomycin gene alone. To test whether elevated levels of these proteins correlated with functional outcomes, apoptotic damage was assessed in 2B4-AcN1S cells (closed symbols or filled bars) or 2B4-neoS cells (open symbols or open bars) treated with dexamethasone, etoposide, or cultured on anti-CD3-coated plates to trigger Fas-ligand-Fas signaling (Fig. 1, B–D). In all cases 2B4-AcN1S-expressing cells were protected from apoptotic damage, albeit to varying extents. Similar results were obtained on transient transfection of AcN1 (data not shown).AcN1 Blocks Apoptosis in Jurkat Cells—To confirm that the results described above were not a peculiarity of the 2B4 hybridoma, we ectopically expressed AcN1 in Jurkat, a human lymphoblastoid T cell line. This resulted in elevated levels of Bcl-xL and IAP-2 proteins in Jurkat cells stably transfected with AcN1 (J-AcN1S) as compared with Jurkat cells transfected with the control plasmid (J-neoS) (Fig. 2A). Endogenous FLIP expression is higher in Jurkat than in 2B4 cells; however, the increase in protein expression induced by AcN1 was significant in both cell lines. Bcl-2 on the other hand was not detectable in untransfected Jurkat cells, and its expression could not be induced by AcN1. We established that our assay could detect Bcl-2 protein by detecting the protein in Jurkat cells that stably express bcl-2 (Fig. 2A, third lane).Fig. 2AcN1 up-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins and blocks apoptosis in Jurkat cells. A, J-neo, J-AcN1S, or JBcl-2S cells were analyzed for the expression of proteins by WBA. p38MAPK was the LC. B, J-neo or J-AcN1S cells were cultured untreated or with 50 ng/ml TNF + 100 ng/ml cycloheximide for 18 h. Apoptotic nuclear damage in the presence (black bars) or absence (white bars) of TNF, and the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in the presence (dark, hatched bars) or absence (light, hatched bars) of TNF was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, J-neo (open squares) or J-AcN1S (filled circles) or J-Bcl-2S (filled triangles) cells were cultured with indicated concentrations of TRAIL for 12–15 h and analyzed for apoptotic nuclear damage. D and E, Jurkat cells transiently transfected with 1.8 μg neo-GFP (open squares)or5 μg of AcN1GFP (filled squares) were cultured for 14 h to allow expression of transfected genes. Cells were then cultured as such or with the indicated concentrations of etoposide (D) or staurosporine (STS, E). After an additional 12 h of culture with the apoptotic stimuli, GFP-positive cells in the two transfection groups were scored for apoptotic nuclear damage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The experiments with the 2B4 cell line indicated that AcN1 modulated mitochondrially regulated apoptotic signaling. Since many apoptotic signaling pathways have been characterized in the Jurkat cell line, we used the cell line to test whether AcN1 regulated apoptosis triggered by extrinsic pathways of death as well. J-neoS and J-AcN1S cells were assessed for susceptibility to apoptosis induced by the death receptor ligands TNF or TRAIL. Apoptosis was triggered by treatment with TNF and cycloheximide (the combination referred to as TNF) in all analysis. J-AcN1S cells were protected from TNF-induced apoptotic nuclear damage (Fig. 2B, solid bars), loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which is a measure of mitochondrial integrity (Fig. 2B, dark, hatched bars) or cell lysis (data not shown). AcN1 also protected cells from different concentrations of TRAIL-induced apoptosis at a level equivalent to that achieved by overexpressing Bcl-2 in these cells (Fig. 2C).Furthermore, on transient transfection with AcN1-GFP, Jurkat cells were protected from apoptosis triggered by etoposide (Fig. 2D) or the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, at 20 ng/ml staurosporine but not at the higher concentration of staurosporine (Fig. 2E). In Fig. 2, D and E, J-AcN1-GFP-transfected cells are represented by filled symbols and cells transfected with GFP alone by open symbols. Thus, ectopic expression of AcN1 resulted in increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and protection from diverse apoptotic stimuli. We then attempted to identify the mechanism by which AcN1 could initiate these events.AcN1 Activates PI3K-mediated Signaling—Previous experiments have shown that Notch-1 acts through the PI3K pathway to trigger survival in epithelial cells (4.Rangarajan A. Syal R. Selvarajah S. Chakrabarti O. Sarin A. Krishna S. Virology. 2001; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If a similar mechanism operated in T cells, modifications in intermediates of this pathway would, in principle, be detected upon AcN1 ectopic expression. We used pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and a dominant-negative inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase Akt (AH-Akt) to test the functional interactions between Notch signaling and the PI3K pathway in T cells. We detected increased phosphorylation Akt-Thr308 with no change in levels of total Akt in either 2B4 or Jurkat cell lines transiently transfected with AcN1 (Fig. 3A). In functional assays of apoptosis, LY294002 a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K (26.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reversed the anti-apoptotic function of AcN1 in 2B4 cells (Fig. 3B). TNF-induced apoptosis is substantially lower in J-AcN1S cells (Fig. 3C, hatched bars) as compared with TNF-induced apoptosis in J-neoS cells (Fig. 3C, black bars). Both LY294002 and the structurally distinct inhibitor wortmannin (27.Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) attenuated AcN1 inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). In the same experiment, UO126, a cell-permeable inhibitor of MEK-1/2, was without effect. Similarly, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also lower in cells that stably express AcN1S (Fig. 3D, closed circles) and in Bcl-2 expressing cells (Fig. 3D, closed triangles) as compared with cells that were transfected with neomycin alone (Fig. 3D, closed squares). Expectedly, LY294002 reversed the protective effect of AcN1 but not Bcl-2 inhibition of TRAIL-induced death (Fig. 3D, filled symbols). We verified that LY294002 was not toxic to cells (Fig. 3, C and D, open symbols). In subsequent experiments we used a dominant-negative form of Akt (AH-Akt) to test the outcome of more specific disruption of Akt signaling on AcN1-inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by TRAIL is substantially reduced in cells that express AcN1 (Fig. 3E, AcN1) when compared with those expressing neomycin (Fig. 3E, neo). In this assay, the co-expression of AH-Akt attenuated the anti-apoptotic effect of AcN1 (Fig. 3E, AcN1+AH-Akt), indicating that disrupting Akt signaling interfered with the anti-apoptotic function of AcN1.Fig. 3AcN1-mediated antiapoptotic function requires PI3K dependent activation of Akt/PKB. A, phosphorylated Akt expression was assessed in 2B4 (upper two panels) or Jurkat (lower two panels) cells transiently transfected with GFP (neo, first lane) or AcN1 (AcN1, second lane) by WBA. B, 2B4 cells transfected with GFP (gray bars) or AcN1-GFP (black bars) cells were allowed to express the transfected genes for 12 h. Each transfection group was continued in culture in the following conditions: as such (medium) or 10 μm LY294002 or 50 nm dexamethasone (dex) or dexamethasone + LY294002 (dex+LY). Apoptotic nuclear damage was scored in GFP cells in each condition after 14 h. C, J-neo (gray and black bars) or J-AcN1S (open and hatched bars) cells were pretreated with 25 μm LY294002 or 100 nm Wortmannin or 10 μm UO126 for 30 min and then continued in culture as such (gray and white bars for neo and AcN1, respectively) or with TNF (black and hatched bars for neo and AcN1 cells, respectively). After 18 h the cells were analyzed for apoptotic nuclear damage. D, J-neo (squares), J-AcN1S (circles), or J-Bcl-2S (triangles) was treated with the indicated concentrations of LY294002 in the presence (closed symbols) or absence (open symbols) of 50 ng/ml TNF. Cells were assessed for nuclear damage after 12 h in culture. E, Jurkat cells that had been transfected with 5 μg of GFP (squares) or 5 μg AcN1-GFP (circles) or 5 μg of AcN1-GFP + 2.5 μg of AH-Akt (hatched squares) prior to the initiation of the assay were cultured with indicated concentrations of TRAIL for 18 h. At this time, GFP-positive cells were scored for apoptotic nuclear damage. Results from two experiments are shown. F, 2B4 cells transfected with 1.8 μgof GFP (neo, first lane) or 5 μg of AcN1GFP (AcN1, second lane) or 5 μg of AcN1GFP + 2.5 μg AH-Akt (+AH-Akt, third lane) was analyzed after 12 h in culture for the expression of proteins shown in the figure. G, J-AcN1S cells were cultured in 1% serum in complete medium for 12 h and then transferred to complete medium (5% serum) in the absence (AcN1, first lane) or presence of 25 μm LY294002 (+LY294002, second lane). After 6 h, cell lysates were assessed for the phosphorylated form of Akt and expression of various proteins shown in the panel by WBA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ectopic expression of AH-Akt in 2B4 cells also blocked AcN1-mediated induction of IAP-2 and FLIP but did not affect the up-regulation of Bcl-xL (Fig. 3F). J-AcN1S cells treated with 20 μm LY294002 for 6–8 h were assessed for the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. LY294002 blocked Akt phosphorylation and expression of IAP-2 (Fig. 3G). Again, Bcl-xL expression was not modified by LY294002. Taken together, these experiments using genetic and pharmacological approaches suggest that AcN1 triggered activation of a PI3K signaling pathway that culminated in the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins FLIP and IAP. However, Bcl-xL expression appeared to be regulated independent of Akt signaling.Numb Blocks AcN1-induced Signaling in T Cells—We used the Notch antagonist Numb to confirm that the observations in the preceding set of experiments were specifically initiated by Notch signaling. As shown in Fig. 4A, co-transfection of Numb disrupted AcN1 inhibition of dexamethasone or etoposide in the 2B4 cell line. Ectopic expression of Numb alone enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis (triggered by cross-linking the TcRCD3 complex) in the 2B4 cell line (Fig. 4B) and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, Numb blocked AcN1-mediated induction of Bcl-xL, IAP-2, and FLIP in both cell lines (Fig. 4, D and E) and substantially reduced the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4F). Using the GFP-tagged construct of AcN1 (AcN1-GFP) we could determine that AcN1 is principally localized to the nucl"

The plant SOS2 protein kinase and its associated Ca2+ sensor, SOS3, have been demonstrated to modulate the plasma membrane H+/Na+ antiporter SOS1; however, how these regulators modulate Ca2+ levels within cells is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that SOS2 regulates the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter CAX1. Using a yeast growth assay, co-expression of SOS2 specifically activated CAX1, whereas SOS3 did not. CAX1-like chimeric transporters were activated by SOS2 if the chimeric proteins contained the N terminus of CAX1. Vacuolar membranes from CAX1-expressing cells were made to be H+/Ca2+-competent by the addition of SOS2 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, SOS2 interacted with the N terminus of CAX1. In each of these yeast assays, the activation of CAX1 by SOS2 was SOS3-independent. In planta, the high level of expression of a deregulated version of CAX1 caused salt sensitivity. These findings suggest multiple functions for SOS2 and provide a mechanistic link between Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis in plants.

These findings suggest multiple functions for SOS2 and provide a mechanistic link between Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis in plants. In eukaryotes, transporters on both the plasma membrane and endomembranes play an important role in specifying the precise concentration of various ions within the cytosol. However, how organisms balance the concentration of ions and how multiple transporters are coordinately regulated on different membranes is poorly understood. In plants, the balance of Ca2+ and Na+ ions is an important component in salt tolerance (1.Lauchli A. Leonard R.T. Hepler P.K. Calcium in Plant Growth and Development. American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, MD1990: 26-35Google Scholar). It has been well documented that Ca2+ has at least two roles in salt tolerance, a signaling function leading to adaptation and a direct inhibitory effect on Na+ entry into the cell (2.Bressen R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 411-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Three genetically linked Arabidopsis loci (SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3) are components of a pathway that controls ion homeostasis and salt tolerance (3.Zhu J-K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). SOS3 encodes a Ca2+-binding protein with sequence similarity to the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (4.Liu J. Zhu J-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). SOS2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase whose function is essential for salt tolerance (5.Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 6.Zhu J-K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). SOS2 physically interacts with SOS3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner to modulate activity of the plasma membrane H+/Na+ antiporter SOS1 (7.Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 8.Qiu Q-S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Although SOS2 has been well studied as a regulator of Na+ extrusion from the cells, it is not known whether SOS2 modulates cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and if so, nothing is known regarding the mechanism by which it does this. In yeast, calcineurin is a key intermediate in signaling salt stress, controlling both cytosolic Na+ and Ca2+ levels (9.Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For example, calcineurin regulates the transcription of ENA1, which encodes a plasma membrane Na+ efflux transporter. Calcineurin also negatively regulates the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter VCX1 (10.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). VCX1 is an important transporter that regulates the amplitude and duration of cytosolic Ca2+ levels (11.Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis orthologs of VCX1 are the cation exchanger (CAX) 1The abbreviations used are: CAX, cation exchanger; sCAX, N-terminal truncated CAX; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SCaBP, SOS3-like Ca2+-binding protein. transporters. Arabidopsis thaliana appears to have up to 12 putative CAX transporters (CAX1-CAX11, and MHX) (12.Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Initially, CAX genes were cloned by their ability to suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitive phenotype of a S. cerevisiae mutant (13.Hirschi K.D. Zhen R. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The activity of CAX1 appears to be regulated by an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that was absent from the initial clone characterized by heterologous expression in yeast (14.Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of deregulated CAX1 (termed sCAX1, missing the N-terminal autoinhibitor) in tobacco causes numerous stress sensitivity phenotypes (15.Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); however, little is known regarding how any CAX transporter is regulated and how this regulation is synchronized with the mechanisms that mediate salt tolerance (16.Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the integration between vacuolar Ca2+ transport and signal transduction, particularly those signaling components involved in salt tolerance, we investigated the regulation of CAX1 by SOS2. Using a yeast assay, we show that SOS2 specifically activates CAX1. We then determined the nature of this regulation using chimeric and mutant CAX constructs, yeast vacuolar transport assays, and yeast two-hybrid analysis. We also demonstrated that high level expression of deregulated CAX1 causes salt sensitivity. These results (i) demonstrate that SOS2 regulates CAX1 activity and (ii) provide insights into the coordinated regulation of Na+ and Ca2+ transporters in plants. Yeast Strains and Transformation—S. cerevisiae strain K667 (MATa cnb1::LEU1 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ) was used for the expression of CAX proteins.

Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Protein in Escherichia coli—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SOS2 and GST-SOS3 were produced as described previously (7.Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J-K. Proc.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To measure Ca2+ transport in the presence of GST-SOS2 or GST-SOS3 fusion proteins, membrane vesicles were incubated with or without the fusion protein for 15 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of 1 mm Mg2+-ATP. The reactions were equilibrated at 25 °C for a further 5 min then uptake was initiated by the addition of 10 μm45CaCl2. Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assay—Yeast strain Y190 MATa (gal4-gal180-his3-trp1-901-ade2-101-ura3-52-leu2-3,-112-+ URA3::GAL→lacZ, LYS2::GAL(UAS)→HIS3 cyhr) was used in the yeast two-hybrid assay (23.Harper J.W.

SOS2 Activates CAX1—Full-length CAX1 expressed in a pmc1vcx1cnb1 S. cerevisiae strain (K667), which is hypersensitive to Ca2+, grows well in standard media but not in media containing high levels (200 mm) of Ca2+ because of the absence of endogenous vacuolar Ca2+ transporters and the lack of activity of full-length CAX1 in yeast (Fig. 1A) (22.Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). H+/Ca2+ antiport activity of CAX1 is regulated through a hydrophilic N-terminal tail (14.Pittman J.K.

Only deregulated CAX1 (sCAX1), lacking the first 36 amino acids at the N terminus, can suppress the yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport defect (Fig. 1A) (13.Hirschi K.D. Zhen R. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A.

We tested whether SOS2 could allow full-length CAX1-expressing pmc1vcx1cnb strains to grow in media containing high levels of Ca2+. Indeed, strains expressing both CAX1 and SOS2 grew in a manner similar to sCAX1 (Fig. 1A). Given that SOS2 activated CAX1, we were interested in determining if SOS2 could activate other plant CAX transporters. As shown in Fig. 1A, in this yeast assay, SOS2 could not activate full-length CAX2, CAX3, or CAX4. We were also interested in determining whether SOS3, one of the other components in the SOS pathway that is required for the activation of the H+/Na+ antiporter SOS1, could also activate CAX1 in yeast. As shown in Fig. 2, co-expression of SOS3 and CAX1 was unable to suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitivity phenotype.Fig. 2SOS3 was unable to activate CAX1 Ca2+ transport activity. K667 cells expressing full-length CAX1 with or without SOS3 as indicated were grown as described in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A purified GST-SOS2 fusion protein added directly to vacuolar membrane preparations from CAX1-expressing yeast cells caused a dose-dependent activation of H+/Ca2+ antiport (Fig. 1B). This activation was dependent on CAX1 because the addition of GST-SOS2 to membrane vesicles isolated from yeast expressing vector alone could not induce Ca2+ transport (data not shown). This activation was also independent of SOS3 or the GST fusion protein, because GST-SOS2/GST-SOS3 activated CAX1 in a manner similar to the addition of only GST-SOS2, and purified GST-SOS3 alone did not activate CAX1-mediated H+/Ca2+ transport (data not shown). Moreover, other CAX transporters could not be activated by purified GST-SOS2. The kinase activity of SOS2 has a preference for Mn2+ (24.Gong D. Guo Y. Jagendorf A.T. Zhu J-K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but the addition of various concentrations of Mn2+ had no effect on the GST-SOS2 activation of H+/Ca2+ antiport activity mediated by CAX1 (data not shown). Properties of SOS2 Activation of CAX1—As an initial step toward deducing the specificity and mechanism of SOS2 activation of full-length CAX1, we tested whether SOS2 could activate chimeric sCAX constructs. A CAX1 homolog called CAX3 is unable to suppress the K667 Ca2+ sensitivity phenotype, even if its N terminus is truncated to give sCAX3 (17.Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25.Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Neither sCAX3 alone nor sCAX3 co-expressed with SOS2 was able to suppress the yeast Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 3A). We have previously generated various chimeric constructs between sCAX1 and sCAX3, some of which retain the sCAX1-like property of being able to transport Ca2+ whereas others, such as sCAX3, are inactive despite all chimeras having equivalent protein stability (17.Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SOS2 co-expressed with an inactive sCAX3/sCAX1 chimeric construct that contained the central region and C terminus of CAX1 (construct sCAX1-α) was also unable to suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 3B). However, when another inactive chimeric construct was used that contains 36 amino acids of the N-terminal region of CAX1 (Met37-Leu73) fused to the central region and C terminus of CAX3 (construct sCAX3-α1), SOS2 could activate this chimeric construct (Fig. 3B). We have previously shown that particular mutations within the N terminus (residues 1-36) of CAX1 can activate H+/Ca2+ transport whereas other point mutations cause CAX1 to remain autoinhibited (14.Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We expressed SOS2 in K667 yeast expressing these various CAX1 mutants. Particular CAX1 mutants that remain autoinhibited, such as CAX1-S10A, CAX1-S25T, and CAX1-S25A, remained autoinhibited following co-expression with SOS2 (Fig. 3C, data not shown). However, the CAX1 double-point mutants CAX1-E7A/E13A and CAX1-R26A/E27A that retain autoinhibition were activated following co-expression with SOS2 (Fig. 3C). SOS2 did not appear to alter the activity of any of the deregulated (active) CAX1 constructs, such as the single-point mutants CAX1-S25D and CAX1-T33A or the double-point mutant CAX1-R29A/R32A (Fig. 3C; data not shown). In a similar manner, we analyzed how various SOS2 mutants (Fig. 4A) altered the activation of CAX1 by observing the growth of K667 yeast containing CAX1 and SOS2 (Fig. 4B). In these assays, we have increased the level of CaCl2 in the media to accentuate differences between the levels of activation mediated by the SOS2 variants (250 mm CaCl2 versus 200 mm CaCl2) (Fig. 4B). An SOS2 mutant that is inactive for kinase activity due to a point mutation Lys40-Asn (construct SOS2A) (5.Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) could activate CAX1, although to a slightly weaker degree to wild-type SOS2 (Fig. 4B); however, a deletion in the entire kinase domain of SOS2 (construct SOS2T1) is not capable of strongly activating CAX1 but gives only very weak yeast growth. A constitutively active SOS2 kinase can be generated by a Thr168-Asp change in the activation loop of SOS2 or by a deletion of the C-terminal portion of the protein (18.Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Combining the Thr168-Asp mutation with an SOS2 truncation in the regulatory domain resulted in a kinase (construct T/DSOS2/308) that is more active than the previous single mutant version (18.Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); however, the activation of CAX1 by this kinase mutant was much weaker than full-length SOS2 (Fig. 4B). An SOS2 mutation that is without the domain for SOS3 binding, the FISL domain (construct SOS2D1), also is capable of activating CAX1, as strongly as wild-type SOS2. SOS2 Associates with the N Terminus of CAX1 in Yeast—To determine whether this activation was caused by a physical interaction between SOS2 and the CAX1 N terminus, a yeast two-hybrid experiment was performed. SOS2 co-expressed with the N terminus of CAX1 (Met37-Leu73 or Met1-Asn65) activated the β-galactosidase reporter, suggesting a direct interaction between SOS2 and the CAX1 N terminus (Fig. 5). Expression of CAX1 and Salt Stress—Disruption of CAX1 by a transposon insertion (cax1-1) did not significantly affect sensitivity to salt stress (21.Cheng N.-H. Pittman J. Barkla B. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). When sCAX1 was expressed at high levels under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in a cax1 mutant, the plants were saltsensitive (Fig. 6). However, this sensitivity is not as severe as the growth defects seen in sos2 and sos3 mutants. When plants are challenged with salinity stress, an increase in the concentration of Ca2+ often can ameliorate the inhibitory effect on growth (1.Lauchli A. Leonard R.T. Hepler P.K. Calcium in Plant Growth and Development. American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, MD1990: 26-35Google Scholar, 2.Bressen R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 411-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unexplained. Using a yeast-based approach, we have identified SOS2, an important regulator of Na+ transporters, also as a regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 1). Previously, the components of the SOS pathway (SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3) were shown to be Ca2+-activated (3.Zhu J-K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). When the regulatory protein SOS3 binds Ca2+, SOS3 binds SOS2 and activates the kinase to modulate the plasma membrane H+/Na+ transporter SOS1. An important conclusion from this work is that SOS2 may have functions in plant signaling that are independent of SOS3 and SOS1 because we demonstrate that SOS2 may also act in an SOS3-independent manner to directly regulate the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter CAX1. In yeast, hyperosmotic stress caused by NaCl and other stresses induce an immediate increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels that activate the phosphatase calcineurin to mediate ion homeostasis and salt tolerance (26.Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Matsumoto T.K. Ellsmore A.J. Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33075-33080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is composed of a regulatory and catalytic subunit that is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (28.Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to regulate many transporters including the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transporter VCX1 (10.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). VCX1 functions in Ca2+ sequestration much more efficiently when calcineurin is inactivated, which may be important for the production of Ca2+ signals (10.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This work helps further establish that the SOS pathway of Arabidopsis is the functional equivalent of the yeast calcineurin pathway. Like calcineurin, SOS2 may directly participate in the regulation of both Na+ transporters (SOS1) and Ca2+ transporters (CAX1). The inability of SOS2 to activate CAX2, CAX3, and CAX4 suggests specificity in the SOS2/CAX1 interaction. Three different experimental approaches suggest this specificity depends on multiple domains within the N terminus of CAX1. The first approach utilized chimeric sCAX3/sCAX1 constructs. Constructs that contain the N terminus of CAX1 (Met37-Leu73) fused to CAX3 fail to transport Ca2+ when expressed in yeast, despite this construct lacking amino acids 1-36 encoding the putative autoinhibitory domain, but the co-expression of SOS2 in these strains allowed some growth on high Ca2+-containing media (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the N terminus of CAX1, at least amino acids 37-73 but not the equivalent region of CAX3, is required for the activation of Ca2+ transport by SOS2. In the second approach, alterations in the N terminus of CAX1, which do not perturb autoinhibition, were still activated by expression of SOS2 (Fig. 3C). Finally, two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SOS2 and the N terminus of CAX1, demonstrating that amino acids 1-73 of CAX1 are involved in the interaction with SOS2 (Fig. 5). Further work will be needed to address the complexities of the SOS2/CAX1 interaction. For example, further yeast two-hybrid analysis with the CAX1 N terminus and different regions of SOS2 will identify the domains of SOS2 involved in this interaction. Our initial studies suggest multiple regions of the CAX1 N terminus interact with SOS2. For example, the significance of Ser10 and Ser25 in the CAX1 N terminus for SOS2 activation is evident by the inability of SOS2 to activate CAX1 when these residues have been mutated (Fig. 3C). At the same time, the two-hybrid data demonstrate the potential for a physical interaction between these two proteins when the region containing both Ser10 and Ser25 were deleted (Fig. 5). The independence for the SOS2 kinase activity in this interaction was reinforced by the ability of mutant forms of SOS2 to activate CAX1 (Fig. 4). The 446 amino acid kinase contains a 267-amino acid N-terminal catalytic domain that is similar in sequence to the yeast sucrose nonfermenting 1 kinase and the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (5.Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 6.Zhu J-K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory domain interacts with the kinase domain to cause autoinhibition. Mutants that abolish SOS2 kinase activity (SOS2A) still activated CAX1 (Fig. 4). Likewise, SOS2 mutants that do not contain the kinase domain (SOS2T1) also activated CAX1, albeit very weakly. That the activation of CAX1 Ca2+ transport activity by GST-SOS2 did not require Mn2+, previously demonstrated to be preferential for kinase activity by SOS2, further suggests kinase independence. Further studies are required to determine whether the SOS2/CAX1 interaction is Ca2+-dependent. This work also demonstrates that SOS2 is not always dependent on SOS3 for all of its functions. The SOS3 independence of this SOS2 activation of CAX1 was demonstrated with regulatory domain mutants that do not interact with SOS3 (SOS2D1) but still activated CAX1. Similarly, the GST-SOS2 activation of Ca2+ transport did not require GST-SOS3 (Fig. 1B, data not shown). The addition of a fusion protein to SOS2 and SOS3 does not affect SOS2/SOS3 interaction or function (7.Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); therefore the apparent lack of further activation or inhibition by GST-SOS3 was not due to GST. Because SOS3 targets SOS2 to the plasma membrane to allow activation of the SOS1 H+/Na+ antiporter (29.Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H.-Z. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and SOS2 must be recruited to the tonoplast to activate CAX1, it is not unexpected that this CAX1 activation is SOS3-independent. Arabidopsis has a number of SOS3 homologs, and it is conceivable that one of these may interact with SOS2 in this CAX1 pathway (see below). Although SOS2 clearly interacts with CAX1 at the N terminus in our yeast assays, we cannot discriminate between gene products that activate or repress CAX1 transport in plants. Previously, we have shown that minor modification to the N terminus of CAX1 or CAX4 activates these Ca2+ transporters in yeast (30.Cheng N-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains a formal possibility that SOS2 negatively regulates CAX1 in planta. The physiological significance of the interaction between SOS2 and CAX1 thus requires further investigation. Here we have demonstrated that if CAX1 is deregulated, such as by ectopic expression of sCAX1, the elevation of salt stress induced in cytosolic Ca2+ may be buffered by sCAX1, thereby partially disrupting the SOS salt tolerance pathway (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that CAX1 may be autoinhibited during salt stress. In sos2 lines, there does not appear to be a significant alteration in CAX1-mediated Ca2+transport (data not shown); however, recent work suggests multiple factors regulate CAX1, and other CAX1 activators (16.Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) may be able to compensate for loss of SOS2. An important question is whether the various roles of SOS2 are coordinately regulated. One possibility is that the Ca2+-dependent binding of SOS2 to another SOS3-like Ca2+-binding protein (SCaBP) different from SOS3 could counteract the interaction of SOS2 and CAX1 in planta, thereby permitting autoinhibition of the transporter during the salt-induced Ca2+ transient. Multiple SCaBPs (SOS3 and SCaBP1-SCaBP6) have been identified in Arabidopsis (18.Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and future work will focus on the biological significance of the interactions between various SCaBPs and SOS2. The application of purified GST-SOS2 fusion protein activated H+/Ca2+ transport in tonoplast preparations from CAX1-expressing yeast cells but not vesicles expressing other CAX transporters (Fig. 1B, data not shown). We have previously identified other proteins that can interact with the N terminus of CAX1 and alter CAX1 function, CAX interacting proteins (16.Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent nature of SOS2 activation portends the ability to quantify the amount of H+/Ca2+ transport per μg of protein among different CAX interacting proteins and to more precisely determine which domains within SOS2 mediate this activation. SOS2 is a member of a large gene family in Arabidopsis composed of 25 protein kinases (SOS2 and PKS1 to PKS24) that are related to sucrose nonfermenting 1 from yeast (SnRK3 family) (31.Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W.M. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudla J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G. Sussman M.R. Thomas M. Walker-Simmons K. Zhu J.K. Harmon A.C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 666-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). SOS2 is not by itself a membrane-associated protein and may be localized to the plasma membrane through its interaction with SOS3 (29.Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H.-Z. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Our model is that SOS2 or a closely related SnRK interacts with an SOS3-like protein (SCaBP) to target the kinase to the tonoplast to regulate CAX1 activity. Our working hypothesis is that the kinase-independent SOS2 regulation of CAX transport may be occurring in the absence of a salt stress. In summary, these studies have identified SOS2 as a direct regulator of the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ transporter CAX1. We postulate that SOS2 responds to environmental cues to differentially regulate both Na+ transporters (SOS1) and Ca2+ transporters (CAX1). These findings therefore provide a mechanistic link between Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis in plants. In the future, we plan to further characterize the nature of CAX regulation to elucidate the role of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration in stress responses. We thank Brad Porter for his initial studies."

By disruption of the Elovl3 gene by homologous recombination in mouse, we show that ELOVL3 participates in the formation of specific neutral lipids that are necessary for the function of the skin. The Elovl3-ablated mice displayed a sparse hair coat, the pilosebaceous system was hyperplastic, and the hair lipid content was disturbed with exceptionally high levels of eicosenoic acid (20:1). This was most prominent within the triglyceride fraction where fatty acids longer than 20 carbon atoms were almost undetectable. A functional consequence of this is that Elovl3-ablated mice exhibited a severe defect in water repulsion and increased trans-epidermal water loss.

The ELOVL3 protein has been suggested to be involved in the formation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains containing up to 24 carbon atoms (9Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Elovl3 gene expression has only been detected in brown adipose tissue, liver, and skin (7Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To assess the in vivo role of ELOVL3, we disrupted the Elovl3 gene by homologous recombination in mouse. Here we describe the characterization of Elovl3 expression in skin and present evidence that ELOVL3 participates in the formation of certain VLCFA and triglycerides in certain cells of the hair follicles and the sebaceous glands and that these lipid compounds are essential for function of the skin.MATERIALS AND METHODSElovl3 Gene Targeting Construct—A genomic liver DNA library from mouse strain 129/Sv cloned into the Lambda FIXII vector was used to isolate a DNA fragment containing the entire Elovl3 gene (15Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nuglozeh E. Parente F. Nedergaard J. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26387-26392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A 2.75-kb fragment between SacI and SalI upstream of the first exon was subcloned into the polylinker of the pBluescript SK plasmid in order to become the left arm (LA) in the Elovl3 gene targeting construct (Fig. 1A). The SacI site was blunt ended by T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolab) and turned into a NotI site by ligation of NotI primers (BioSource International). A 1.2-kb fragment containing a neomycin resistance gene (neor) was inserted into the compatible SalI site of the plasmid containing the 2.75-kb left arm fragment. The ligation between SalI and XhoI ends consequently destroyed the recognition site for respective digestion enzymes. A 5.30-kb SalI/SalI fragment downstream of the second exon of the Elovl3 gene was ligated into the pBluescript SK plasmid and further digested with SalI and XhoI to receive a 2.77-kb fragment corresponding to the right arm (RA) in the Elovl3 gene-targeting construct. This fragment was subcloned into the XhoI site of the vector containing the 2.75-kb left arm fragment and the neor gene. The NotI/XhoI fragment from the resulting plasmid was ligated into a vector flanked by the thymidine kinase (tk) gene at the 3′-end.Gene-targeting in ES Cells and Blastocyst Injection—The Elovl3-targeted construct was linearized by NotI and electroporated into the R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from male 129/Sv agouti mice (16Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). ES cells were cultured as earlier described and subjected to positive/negative selection using G418 and FIAU as previously described (17Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar, 18Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). ES cell DNA was prepared according to standard procedures (16Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). Probes as indicated in Fig. 1 and for the neor gene (not shown) were used to confirm ES cell clones heterozygous for the mutant Elovl3 allele.Elovl3-ablated ES cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and implanted into foster mothers (F1, CBAxC57BL6) according to standard procedures (19Gossler A. Doetschman T. Korn R. Serfling E. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9065-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The male offspring being the most chimeric, ∼80% agouti and 20% black in the coat color, were bred with C57BL/6J females to generate offspring heterozygous for the mutation. Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tails by the simplified mammalian DNA isolation as described earlier (20Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Tail biopsies were collected from 3-week-old mice and used directly for DNA isolation.The Elovl3-ablated mice were back-crossed with C57BL/6 (B&K Universal, Stockholm, Sweden) in the animal facility of the Institute. As control mice, we used heterozygote littermates or age-matched C57BL/6 mice that were bred under the same conditions as the Elovl3-ablated mice. Animals were fed ad libitum (rat and mouse standard diet No.1, BeeKay Feeds; B&K Universal, Stockholm, Sweden), had free access to water, and were kept on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle in single cages. Wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice were bred in room temperature. Before exposing the animals to the cold, the mice were housed at 30 °C (thermoneutrality) for 10 days. Mice were placed in the cold (4 °C) for the times indicated.Southern Blot Analysis of DNA from ES Cells and Mouse Tails—The DNA for the probes were purified according to the Jetsorb gel extraction kit (Genomed Inc.) and were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Ten μg digested DNA from mouse tails and ES cells was separated on 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. The membrane was prehybridized with a solution containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50% formamide, and 100 mg/ml degraded DNA from herring sperm (Sigma) at 45 °C. After prehybridization, the membrane was transferred to a similar solution containing the denatured probe. The hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C. Hybond-N membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 30 °C for 20 min each and then once in 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The filters were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified with the ImageQuant program.RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec (Biotech Lab) from 50-100 mg (w/w) of each tissue as described earlier (7Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg total RNA was separated on a 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. The hybridization procedure was identical to that for Southern blot analysis, except that hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C. The membrane was then washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 30 °C for 20-30 min each and then twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50 °C for 45 min. A corresponding cDNA fragment of Elovl3 (895-bp open reading frame) was used as a probe as previously described (7Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The filters were analyzed by phosphorimaging as for Southern analysis.Histology—Skin biopsies of age- and sex-matched animals were taken from similar body sites. Skin samples were fixed overnight at 4 °C in a phosphate-buffered, pH 7.4, 4% formaldehyde solution. Semithin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy.For electron microscopy analysis, skin samples were taken at autopsy of 10-week-old mice and processed for electron microscopy. Samples were fixed overnight in Karnovsky's fixative, washed two times with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, and post-fixed in either 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, or in ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) as described previously (21Madison K.C.

Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 215-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). After fixation, samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in an Epon/epoxy mixture. Ultrathin sections were examined both with and without further contrasting with lead citrate in an electron microscope (Zeiss 1A; Carl Zewiss, Thornwood, NY) operated at 60 kV.In Situ Hybridization—RNA probes were prepared from Elovl3 open reading frame mouse cDNA. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (23Nilsson M. Unden A.B. Krause D. Malmqwist U. Raza K. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3438-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 895-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 162-1056 in the Elovl3 cDNA was cloned into a pCI-neo vector (Promega), appropriately linearized, and in vitro transcribed to obtain antisense and sense probes. Sections were treated with proteinase K (Sigma) and washed in 0.1 m triethanolamine buffer containing 0.25% acetic anhydride. Subsequently, sections were hybridized overnight with 2.5 × 106 cpm of labeled antisense or sense probe at 55 °C. Autography was carried out for 14 days. After development of the photographic emulsion, slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The labeled sense strand served as negative control and did not show any labeling of cellular localization.Epidermal Lipid Analysis—Hair was removed from the back of the mice, and skin was isolated by punching. After subcutaneous tissue was removed by scraping on ice, skin pieces were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 60 °C for 30 s, and epidermis was isolated by scraping on ice. Lipids were extracted using chloroform:methanol:water (2:4:1,6) overnight, and skin precipitates were stored for further extraction. Four ml chloroform:water (1:1) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (2000 rpm). The water phase was discarded, and the organic phase was washed with chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:9). Non-extracted lipids from the original skin precipitates were sequentially extracted using chloroform:methanol (2:1, 1:1, 1:2). Extracts were pooled and evaporated under nitrogen.TLC analysis was performed as described earlier (37Uchida Y. Hara M. Nishio H. Sidransky E. Inoue S. Otsuka F. Suzuki A. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. Hamanaka S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2071-2082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total epidermal lipids were separated by HPTLC (Merck) with the following solvent sequence: 1) chloroform to 1.5 cm; 2) chloroform:methanol: acetone 76:16:8 (v/v) to 1 cm; 3) chloroform:methanol:hexyl acetate:acetone 86:4:1:10 (v/v) to 7 cm; 4) chloroform:methanol:acetone 76:20:4 (v/v) to 2 cm; 5) chloroform:methanol:diethyl ether:ethyl acetate:hexyl acetate:acetone 72:4:4:1:4:16 (v/v) to 7,5 cm; 6) n-hexane: diethyl ether:ethyl acetate 80:16:4 (v/v), and 7) n-hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid 65:35:1 (v/v) to the top of the plate. Lipids were visualized after treatment with cupric acetate-phosphoric acid and heating to 160 °C for 15 min.Hair Lipid Analysis—Hair from adult mice was extracted and filtered twice with 20 ml acetone for 15 min. The two extracts were combined and allowed to evaporate to dryness in glass vials. The amount of dry lipids was calculated by subtracting the weight of empty vials. Equal amounts of lipids (120 μg) were dissolved in acetone and applied to each lane on a Whatman HPTLC silica G plate and separated according to Downing (24Downing D.T. J. Chromatogr. 1968; 38: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plate was previously run with chloroform, placed in an oven at 105 °C for 30 min, and then immediately cooled down to room temperature. The samples were spotted onto the plate and resolved in hexane. The plates were removed and air dried for 15 min. The plates were then run in toluene until the solvent front reached the end of the plate. After the plates were air dried for 15 min, a third phase containing hexane:ether:acetic acid (70:30:1) was run. The TLC plates were stained with sulfuric acid:ethanol (1:1) and charred at 150 °C. Lipids were analyzed by scanning densitometry of digital pictures taken from the TLC plate by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) with the ImageQuant program.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—For the fatty acid determinations, 2 ml chloroform:methanol:water (60:30:4.5) extract of hair lipids was evaporated and dissolved in 2 ml 2.5% sulfuric acid in methanol. Acidic methanolysis was performed at 80 °C for 16 h. Formed fatty acid methyl esters were purified by preparative TLC in dichloromethane. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on Fison MD 800 equipment with on-column injection. A DB 1 (J&W) capillary column 30 m × 0.32 mm was used for the separation.Water Retention Assay and Temperature Measurement—Weight or colonic temperature was measured (RET-3 rectal thermometer; Physitemp Instruments Inc.) once for each adult mouse prior to swimming. Mice were allowed to swim in water at 30 °C for 2 min. Excessive water was eliminated by allowing the mice to walk on paper towels for a few seconds. Weight or colonic temperature was recorded every 5 min at 22 °C. Between each measurement the mice were kept individually in empty plastic cages. The hair water content was calculated by subtracting the preswim weight from the postswim weight.Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Analysis—Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin by intraperitoneal injection at a concentration of 0.014 ml/g body weight. The evaporimeter (EP 1C; Servomed, Göteborg, Sweden) was run for at least 15 min prior to use. The evaporimeter was placed on 1 cm2 of shaved skin on the back of the animal in an open chamber. During the measurement, the evaporimeter was allowed to stabilize for 30 s before the value was recorded. All measurements were performed according to the guidelines from the standardization group of contact dermatitis (25Pinnagoda J. Tupker R.A. Agner T. Serup J. Contact Dermatitis. 1990; 22: 164-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar).RESULTSGeneration of Elovl3-ablated Mice—A SalI fragment, including the transcription start site, exon 1 and 2 of the Elovl3 gene, was deleted by homologous recombination in R1 ES cells due to insertion of a neor gene (Fig. 1A). Targeted ES cells were microinjected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Two independent chimeric lines were found to transmit the Elovl3 disruption through the germline, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The 5.6-kb ScaI genomic fragment representing the wild-type Elovl3 allele is absent in Elovl3-ablated mice and replaced by a 11.6-kb fragment that hybridizes to the probe (Fig. 1, A and B).To determine the Elovl3 expression, Northern blot analyses were performed with total RNA isolated from brown adipose tissue, skin, and liver, i.e. organs that have been shown to express Elovl3 (7Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), from wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice (Fig. 1C). The gene disruption was particularly clear upon cold stimulation, where no Elovl3 mRNA was detected in brown adipose tissue from Elovl3-ablated mice, a site with the highest reported Elovl3 expression (7Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Phenotype Characteristics—Interestingly, the Elovl3-ablated mice did not show any indications of impaired liver or brown adipose tissue function. The striking feature that distinguished Elovl3-ablated mice from wild-type or heterozygous littermates was a tousled and reduced fur content over the whole body (Fig. 1D) that was noticeable within 2 weeks of age when the hair was formed and sustained throughout the life span. In addition, mice older than approximately six months showed irritated skin and distinctive scratch marks on the chin that resembled eczematous skin. The mice grew normally and were fertile. Offspring genotypes obtained from heterozygous F1 intercrosses showed normal Mendelian distribution.Microscopic Distinctions of the Skin in Elovl3-ablated Mice— Grossly, the epidermis of the Elovl3-ablated mice appeared normal, but parts of the epidermis were thicker with observed hypergranulation (Fig. 2, A and B). The nuclei of the hair follicle cells seemed irregularly shaped, especially within the cells in the inner layer of the outer root sheath (Fig. 2, C and D), and as in the epidermis scattered hypergranulation was seen (Fig. 2, A and C). In many of the hair follicles, normal hair was missing in the upper part, though the hair seemed normal in the lower parts of the follicles. However, the most evident finding was a general hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands (Fig. 2E).Fig. 2Histological analysis of the skin from Elovl3-ablated mice and cell-specific expression of Elovl3 mRNA in hair follicles and sebaceous glands in wild-type skin. Microscopic overview of the skin from the back of an Elovl3-ablated mouse (A-E) and wild-type mouse (F-J) at the age of 9 weeks showing epidermis, hair follicles, and dermis. A, in the Elovl3-ablated mouse, the normal hair is missing in the upper part of several hair follicles though the hair seems normal in the lower parts. B, in higher magnification, an increased thickness of the epidermis and hypergranulation is seen both in epidermis and in the hair follicle. C, transverse section of a hair follicle shows abnormal epithelial cells. D, the inner cell layer of the outer root sheath appears abnormal with irregularly shaped nuclei (arrows). E, hyperplastic and enlarged sebocytes are seen in the sebaceous glands. G, by in situ hybridization very low Elovl3 expression is seen in a cross-section of epidermis of wild-type skin. H, horizontal section showing specific expression of Elovl3 in the epithelial cells of a hair follicle (arrow, black grains). I, a higher magnification of the epithelial cells of the hair follicle showing abundant Elovl3 mRNA signal in the cells of the inner layer of the outer root sheath (ORS) of the hair follicle (arrows). IRS, inner root sheath. J, a strong Elovl3 mRNA signal (black grains) was detected in normal sebocytes. A-E, no Elovl3 mRNA signal was detected in Elovl3-ablated mice. (All sections are counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell-specific Expression of Elovl3 in the Skin—Under normal conditions, Elovl3 is sparsely expressed in the skin. To delineate this expression, we performed in situ hybridization analysis. In the wild-type mice, a strong Elovl3 mRNA signal was seen in the cells of the inner layer of the outer root sheath (Fig. 2, H and I) of the hair follicles and in the sebocytes of the sebaceous glands (Fig. 2J). In epidermis the Elovl3 mRNA signal was very low (Fig. 2G), and in fibroblasts no detectable signal was seen. In the Elovl3-ablated mouse, there was no detectable Elovl3 mRNA signal in any cell type (Fig. 2, A-E). No signal was detected in tissues hybridized with the sense probe (data not shown).Disturbed Epidermal Skin Lipid Content of Elovl3-ablated Mice—Regarding the restricted Elovl3 expression in the skin and the abnormal morphology of the hair follicles and pilosebaceous system in the Elovl3-ablated mice, we suspected the lipid composition of the secreted sebum to be affected. Because the sebaceous glands are appendages of the epidermis connected to hair follicles and secrete the sebum onto the skin surface, we analyzed the lipid content of the epidermis, including the outermost part, stratum corneum, by thin layer chromatography. From this it was clear that the major difference between wild-type and Elovl3-ablated mice was observed in the most mobile fractions, which were a mixture of neutral lipids, such as triglycerides and wax and sterol esters, which are normal constituents of the sebum (Fig. 3). In contrast, there was no major difference between the more polar fractions where the different sphingolipid-based ceramide moieties migrate. A similar pattern was also seen when total skin was analyzed (not shown), suggesting a selective unbalance in the neutral lipids of the epidermis and hair.Fig. 3Abnormal content of neutral skin lipids of Elovl3-ablated mice. Equal amounts of epidermal lipids (120 μg) from wild-type (+/+) and Elovl3-ablated (-/-) mice were separated by HPTLC. The arrows and vertical line indicate the transfer area of triglycerides and sterol and wax esters, diacylglycerols and free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides, respectively, according to lipid standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Disturbed Lipid Content in the Hair of Elovl3-ablated Mice— Although there was a general tendency toward more acetone-extractable lipids in the hair of Elovl-ablated mice, the total amount of hair lipids did not significantly differ from the wild-type mice (Fig. 4A). When we analyzed the hair lipids by TLC, the fractions containing triglycerides, wax esters, diol esters, and sterol esters formed a different TLC pattern between the two strains of mice (Fig. 4B). The most obvious difference was a shift in the amount of specific lipid components in the area where the triglycerides were localized (Fig. 4B). Densitometric analysis displayed a 10-fold decrease in a relatively more hydrophilic component, which was counteracted by a 10-fold increase in a relatively more hydrophobic component.Fig. 4Abnormal content of hair lipids of Elovl3-ablated mice.A, normal and mutated mice had similar total hair lipid production. Lipid content in the hair was determined in 10 wild-type (+/+) and 8 Elovl3-ablated (-/-) mice, respectively, with values expressed as m"

Without ERK activation, interleukin-1β induces only acute and transient NF-κB activation. The present study examined whether the temporal control of NF-κB activation by ERK could differentially regulate the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). Treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells with interleukin-1β induced the expression of iNOS, COX-2, VCAM-1, and Mn-SOD in a time-dependent manner, but with different patterns. Either PD98059 or U0126, selective inhibitors of MEK, or overexpression of a dominant negative MEK-1 inhibited interleukin-1β- induced ERK activation and the expression of iNOS and COX-2 but had essentially no effect on the expression of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD. The expression of these genes was inhibited when NF-κB activation was down-regulated by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or by overexpression of an I-κBα mutant that prevented both the transient and the persistent activation of NF-κB. Inhibition of ERK did not affect interleukin-1β-induced I-κBα phosphorylation and degradation but attenuated I-κBβ degradation. Thus, although NF-κB activation was essential for interleukin-1β induction of each of the proteins studied, gene expression was differentially regulated by ERK and by the duration of NF-κB activation. These results reveal a novel functional role for ERK as an important temporal regulator of NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous inducible genes involved in inflammation, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (1.Baldwin A.S.

NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitors of NF-κB, designated I-κB, that exist as several isoforms (e.g. I-κBα and I-κBβ). Cell activation by cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEK1dn, dominant negative MEK-1; Adv, adenoviral; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IFNγ, interferon-γ; RT, reverse transcription. and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) leads to the phosphorylation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of I-κB, accompanied by NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to consensus sequences in the promoter region of target genes and activates transcription (1.Baldwin A.S.

I-κBα is rapidly degraded after cytokine stimulation and rapidly resynthesized because of the presence of NF-κB-binding motifs in the I-κBα gene promoter (8.Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This autoregulatory loop has been suggested to limit NF-κB activation in a transient manner (8.Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9.Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In contrast, I-κBβ slowly decreases after cytokine stimulation, a process that has been suggested to contribute to persistent activation of NF-κB (9.Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Recently, the temporal control of NF-κB activation by the coordinated degradation and synthesis of I-κB proteins has been clearly revealed by using gene knock-out cell lines where NF-κB activation was controlled by a single I-κB isoform (10.Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). TNFα stimulation of fibroblasts that contained only the I-κBα isoform resulted in an oscillatory pattern of NF-κB activation, whereas stimulation of cells harboring only I-κBβ resulted in sustained NF-κB activation. Importantly, it was shown that the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes may be differentially regulated by controlling the duration of NF-κB activation (10.Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of differential control by which I-κBα and I-κBβ mediate NF-κB activation following cytokine treatment remain unclear. We have recently demonstrated in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) was required for IL-1β to induce persistent activation of NF-κB that in turn was required for the subsequent expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (11.Jiang B. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12.Jiang B. Xu S. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK activation, either by the selective chemical inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126, or by antisense phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides that down-regulated ERK synthesis, selectively inhibited IL-1β-induced prolonged activation of NF-κB and iNOS expression. Interestingly, inhibition of ERK activation had no effect on early transient NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β. This suggested that an important ERK-dependent signaling mechanism may temporally control the activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. The present study was performed to test this hypothesis, using iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) as gene products representative of those controlled by either persistent or acute activation of NF-κB. The results indicate that inhibition of ERK activation differentially regulates the expression of these NF-κB-dependent genes in response to IL-1β stimulation by specifically down-regulating the persistent activation of NF-κB. Materials—DMEM/Ham's F12 medium (DMEM/F12) and fetal calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant human IL-1β (specific activity: 1.9 × 107 units/mg) was kindly provided by Dr. Aurigemma, the Biological Resources Branch Preclinical Repository, National Cancer Institute. Recombinant rat interferon-γ (IFNγ) was purchased from R&D Systems. Recombinant human TNFα, PD98059, U0126, and MG132 were from Calbiochem. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against iNOS and COX-2 were from Transduction Laboratories. Antibody against Mn-SOD was from Stressgen Biotechnologies. Antibodies against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Try-204), p44/42 MAPK, phospho-I-κBα (Ser-32/Ser-36), and I-κBα were from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against VCAM-1, I-κBβ, and NF-κB p65 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was from Promega. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other materials used were commercial products of the highest grade available. Cell Culture—Rat VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta and cultured as described previously (13.Jiang B. Brecher P. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were used between passages 5 and 9. When confluent, the cells were washed with serum-free medium and then maintained in DMEM/F12 with 0.1% BSA for 24-48 h. The medium was refreshed before treatment. The cells were then incubated with or without additions (cytokines, inhibitors, or vehicle) for designated times as indicated under “Results.” Adenoviral Constructs—To generate adenoviral I-κBα mutant (AdvIκBαM), an I-κBα mutant (S32A/S36A) cDNA (HindIII/DraI) from pCMV-IκBαM (Clontech) was inserted into pShuttle-CMV vector between HindIII and EcoRV sites and then transferred into pAdEasy-1 by homologous recombination in BJ5183 bacterial cells. The recombinant adenoviral construct was linearized with PacI and transfected into Hek293 cells to produce viral particles. To generate adenoviral dominant negative MEK-1 (AdvMEK1dn), pCMV-MEK1 (Clontech) was mutated by PCR with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primer pairs 5′-GCT CAT CGA CGC CAT GGC CAA CGC CTT CGT GGG-3′ and 5′-CCC ACG AAG GCG TTG GCC ATG GCG TCG ATG AGC-3′ (the underlining indicates the mutation from T to G or from A to C), which made the mutation of MEK-1 Ser-218 and Ser-222 to Ala-218 and Ala-222. MEK1dn cDNA (XhoI/HindIII) from the pCMV-MEK1dn was then inserted into pShuttle-CMV vector. The adenovirus was generated by the same method as mentioned above. Adenoviruses were purified through two steps of ultracentrifugation, with discontinuous and continuous CsCl gradients, respectively. After dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 4% sucrose, viral particles in solution were evaluated based on DNA content. DNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 1012 viral particles/OD unit. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared, and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein content of the cell lysates was determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), with BSA used as a standard. The images were obtained and analyzed by using Model GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells by using TRIzol reagent as described previously (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT)20-M4 adaptor primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Shuzo Co.). Synthetic gene-specific primer sets used in PCR were: 1) iNOS forward 20-mer, 5′-GCT ACA CTT CCA ACG CAA CA-3′, and reverse 20-mer, 5′-TGG GTG GGA GGG GTA GTG AT-3′, which amplified a 430-bp sequence between +2081 and +2510 of rat iNOS cDNA; 2) COX-2 forward 22-mer, 5′-CCA ACC TCT CCT ACT ACA CCA G-3′, and reverse 20-mer, 5′-TAC ACC TCT CCA CCG ATG AC-3′, which amplified a 358-bp sequence between +386 and +743 of rat COX-2 cDNA; 3) VCAM-1 forward 21-mer, 5′-ACA CCT CCC CCA AGA ATA CAG-3′, and reverse 21-mer, 5′-GCT CAT CCT CAA CAC CCA CAG-3′, which amplified a 477-bp sequence between +659 and +1135 of rat VCAM-1 cDNA; 4) Mn-SOD forward 21-mer, 5′-TGA CCT GCC TTA CGA CTA TGG-3′, and reverse 20-mer, 5′-GCG ACC TTG CTC CTT ATT GA-3′, which amplified a 388-bp sequence between +87 and +474 of rat Mn-SOD cDNA; and 5) GAPDH forward 20-mer, 5′-GCC ATC AAC GAC CCC TTC AT-3′, and reverse 20-mer, 5′-CGC CTG CTT CAC CAC CTT CT-3′, which amplified a 702-bp sequence between +88 and +789 of rat GAPDH cDNA. PCR was performed using the following schedule: denaturation, annealing, and extension at 94, 57, and 72 °C for 40 s, 30 s, and 1 min, respectively, for 26 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV-induced fluorescence. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared, and DNA binding activity was assessed by EMSA using NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide as described previously (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—VSMCs were cultured on 4-well Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) under the same conditions described above. After treatment, the cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed for 8 min in methanol at -20 °C, and air-dried at room temperature. The staining was performed by incubating with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min followed by incubating with primary antibody (5 μg/ml NF-κB p65 polyclonal antibody (C-20), sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for2hinPBS with 1.0% BSA, washing three times with PBS, incubating for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1/100 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS with 1.0% BSA, washing three times with PBS, and finally mounting with aqueous mounting medium. The images observed under a fluorescence microscope were recorded on a linked computer using Openlab software (version 2.2.5, Improvision). ERK Activation Is Required for iNOS and COX-2 Induction, but Not for VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD Induction—In cultured rat VSMCs, there was basal expression of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD that could be detected by Western blot analysis, whereas iNOS and COX-2 were not detectable without cytokine treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). IL-1β increased the expression of these genes, but temporal differences were observed. After IL-1β stimulation, VCAM-1 was clearly increased by 3 h, and high levels were maintained between 6 and 24 h (4.9-, 12.4-, and 13.9-fold greater than basal levels, respectively). In contrast, iNOS protein was undetectable at 3 and 6 h but readily detectable 16 h after IL-1β addition. The induction of COX-2 and Mn-SOD by IL-1β occurred in a temporal pattern similar to that of iNOS, expression being delayed as compared with that of VCAM-1. Treatment of the cells with IL-1β also caused a sustained increase of ERK phosphorylation. Notably, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by either PD98059 or U0126, specific inhibitors of ERK kinases, dramatically reduced the expression of both iNOS and COX-2 but did not prevent the induction of VCAM-1 as well as Mn-SOD by IL-1β (Fig. 1, A and B). RT-PCR (Fig. 1C) showed that the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD98059 influenced IL-1β induction of iNOS and COX-2 at the transcriptional level. At 6 and 9 h after IL-1β addition, iNOS mRNA was detectable in the absence of PD98059 but was not detectable in the presence of PD98059. COX-2 mRNA showed a biphasic increase during IL-1β treatment, with an increase at 1 h followed by a reduction at 3 h and then another increase that reached the maximum between 6 and 9 h. The reduction of COX-2 mRNA at 3 h was not due to artifactual RNA degradation during RNA preparation or the reverse transcription reaction because the result was reproducible, and there was no decrease in GAPDH mRNA levels. In the presence of PD98059, IL-1β still induced an increase in COX-2 mRNA at 1 h but failed to induce the second phase increase at 6 and 9 h. Both VCAM-1 mRNA and Mn-SOD mRNA gradually increased during the IL-1β treatment and remained at high levels for up to 6 and 9 h. PD98059 had no effect on the enhancement of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD mRNA levels induced by IL-1β. To further confirm that the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression by the chemical inhibitors was due to the specific inhibition of ERK signaling, the effect of adenoviral mediated expression of MEK1dn was determined. Consistent with the results obtained using chemical inhibitors, Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of MEK1dn reduced IL-1β-induced ERK phosphorylation and selectively reduced the induction of iNOS and COX-2 without significantly influencing the induction of VCAM-1 or Mn-SOD by IL-1β (Fig. 2). The control adenovirus expressing LacZ showed no effect on these processes. The Duration of NF-κB Activation Is Responsible for the Differential Regulation of IL-1β-induced Gene Expression—As shown using EMSA (Fig. 3), at 30 min after IL-1β addition, the major DNA-bound form of NF-κB was the p65/p50 heterodimer, whereas the p50/p50 homodimer showed a relatively weak signal. However, at 6 h, when p65/p50 DNA binding was still obvious, the DNA binding of the p50/p50 homodimer was increased. Inhibition of ERK by PD98059 reduced the prolonged activation of NF-κB as evidenced by reduced binding of both p65/p50 and p50/p50 at 6 h, without having a significant effect on the early activation as evidenced by p65/p50 binding at 30 min (Fig. 3) (11.Jiang B. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12.Jiang B. Xu S. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of ERK activation selectively inhibits prolonged NF-κB activation, we tested the possibility that the expression of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD induced by IL-1β might be dependent solely on the earlier and transient NF-κB activation. We therefore treated the cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that inhibits I-κB degradation. In contrast to PD98059, pretreatment of the cells with MG132 reduced both early and prolonged NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β, decreasing p65/p50 DNA binding to 56 ± 5% at 30 min and to 9 ± 1% at 6 h, as compared with those without MG132 treatment. In addition, MG132 reduced p50/p50 DNA binding at 6 h. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A) showed that phosphorylated I-κBα was detected after IL-1β addition, and the abundance increased in the cells pretreated with MG132. Phosphorylated I-κBα was not detectable in untreated cells but was observed in the cells treated with MG132 alone (lane 3), suggesting an accumulation of basal levels due to reduced degradation. The expression of iNOS, COX-2, VCAM-1, and Mn-SOD induced by IL-1β was obviously inhibited in cells pretreated with MG132, indicating the involvement of NF-κB in the expression of all four proteins. MG132 had no effect on the sustained phosphorylation of ERK that was observed after IL-1β addition. The ability of MG132 to prevent iNOS and COX-2 induction was apparent if the inhibitor was added at any time from 1 h preceding IL-1β addition up to 6 h after the cytokine was added (Fig. 4B). However, MG132 did show a lesser effect on inhibition of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD induction if the inhibitor was added at 6 h after IL-1β addition. To confirm that the inhibitory effect of MG132 on IL-1β-induced gene expression was due to its influence on components of NF-κB, the cells were infected with AdvIκBαM (S32A/S36A). Similar to MG132, the adenoviral-mediated overexpression of the degradation-resistant IκBα mutant (S32A/S36A) prevented the IL-1β-induced increase in iNOS, COX-2, VCAM-1, and Mn-SOD seen after treatment for 24 h (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescent staining of the NF-κB p65 subunit was performed to determine whether the I-κBα mutant prevented the nuclear translocation of the predominant heterodimeric form of NF-κB. The images (Fig. 5B) show clearly that IL-1β induced nuclear translocation of p65 by 1 h and that this persisted up to 16 h. Overexpression of the I-κBα mutant inhibited IL-1β-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 at both time points, consistent with the inhibitory effect of the I-κBα mutant on IL-1β-induced gene expression shown in Fig. 5A. Inhibition of ERK Activation Attenuates IL-1β-induced I-κBβ Degradation—We further determined whether the ability of the ERK signaling cascade to regulate the persistent activation of NF-κB might relate to temporal changes in I-κB levels. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, IL-1β induced I-κBα phosphorylation during the entire period observed. The total I-κBα levels were dramatically reduced at 30 min and then gradually approached basal levels thereafter. Inhibition of ERK activation by either PD98059 (Fig. 6A) or overexpression of MEK1dn (Fig. 6B) did not prevent IL-1β-induced I-κBα phosphorylation or degradation at 30 min. IL-1β stimulation also reduced I-κBβ levels (Fig. 6, C and D). The reduction of I-κBβ was not as pronounced as that of I-κBα at 30 min, but the reduction of I-κBβ at 6 h was obvious. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 attenuated the reduction in I-κBβ induced by IL-1β, although the effect of PD98059 on I-κBβ degradation was less marked than that of MG132, suggesting that ERK might be involved in the regulation of I-κBβ degradation. Effects of ERK Signaling on NF-κB-dependent Gene Expression Induced by a Combination of Cytokines—Although treatment of rat VSMCs with IFNγ or TNFα alone does not induce iNOS, either IFNγ or TNFα does enhance iNOS expression induced by IL-1β (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether or not ERK signaling could similarly regulate IL-1β-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression in the presence of IFNγ or TNFα. As shown in Fig. 7A, both IFNγ and TNFα enhanced IL-1β-induced iNOS, COX-2, and VCAM-1, but not Mn-SOD expression, although the synergistic effect was more pronounced when TNFα was added with IL-1β. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 dramatically reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression but not that of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD induced by IL-1β alone or in combination with IFNγ or TNFα. In addition, although TNFα alone did not induce iNOS and COX-2 expression, it did increase VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD levels, and these were by a mechanism not inhibited by PD98059. To examine whether TNFα could activate ERK and NF-κB in a manner similar to IL-1β, we determined the changes in both I-κB levels and the phosphorylation of ERK at different time points after TNFα addition (Fig. 7B). Upon TNFα stimulation, I-κBα levels rapidly decreased by 30 min and then returned to basal levels by 3 h, whereas I-κBβ decreased gradually and remained at a lower level at later time points (3 and 9 h). TNFα activated ERK with a strong phosphorylation observed at 15 min and then returned to basal levels at 1 h. There was a second phase of ERK phosphorylation persisting from 3 to 9 h after TNFα addition. These effects of TNFα on I-κB degradation and ERK phosphorylation were similar to those observed with IL-1β (11.Jiang B. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We further tested whether ERK activation was still required for IL-1β to induce persistent activation of NF-κB in the presence of TNFα. As shown by EMSA (Fig. 7C), although PD98059 had essentially no effect on NF-κB activation at 1 h after cytokine addition, it dramatically reduced the prolonged activation of NF-κB induced by either IL-1β alone or IL-1β plus TNFα as documented by the data shown at the 16-h treatment time. The prolonged NF-κB activation induced by TNFα alone, like that caused by IL-1β alone, was also reduced by inhibition of ERK with PD98059. In many cell types, NF-κB activation is essential for the expression of numerous genes such as iNOS, COX-2, VCAM-1, and Mn-SOD in response to inflammatory stimuli, including IL-1β (16.Iademarco M.F.

Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The present studies clearly show that IL-1β induces all of the genes mentioned above in cultured rat VSMCs but that the expression of these genes occurs in a temporally distinct manner. This temporal control is dependent upon the temporal activation of both ERK and NF-κB, and ERK phosphorylation is a requirement for the persistent activation of NF-κB. Neither iNOS nor COX-2 mRNA or protein was detectable in the cells without IL-1β stimulation. After IL-1β stimulation, iNOS and COX-2 expression was delayed in comparison with changes in VCAM-1 or Mn-SOD. Unlike VCAM-1 or Mn-SOD, iNOS and COX-2 accumulation was entirely dependent on the prolonged activation of both ERK and NF-κB. The decrease in p65/p50 caused by ERK inhibition likely was I-κBα-independent as shown by persistent I-κBα phosphorylation and early I-κBα degradation that was unchanged by PD98059. Rather, as suggested previously, prolonged NF-κB activation may be mediated by I-κBβ (9.Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 21.Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility is also supported by the fact that in this study, inhibition of ERK attenuated IL-1β-induced I-κBβ degradation. It is known that I-κB kinases (IKKs) can phosphorylate I-κBβ at Ser-19 and Ser-23, two phosphorylation sites similar to those in I-κBα and responsible for its subsequent degradation (22.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 23.May M.J. Ghosh S. Science. 1999; 284: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because activation of ERK alone does not induce NF-κB activation, as we reported previously (12.Jiang B. Xu S. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and inhibition of ERK does not affect I-κBα phosphorylation induced by IL-1β, the influence of the ERK signaling cascade on IL-1β-induced I-κBβ degradation may be mediated by mechanisms other than influencing IKK activity. Further studies are required to elucidate whether or not the ERK signaling cascade influences the susceptibility of I-κBβ to phosphorylation by IKKs or to degradation by the proteasome. Although the requirement of ERK activation for iNOS and COX-2 induction might relate to multiple mechanisms, one role for ERK signaling apparently is to maintain the persistent activation of NF-κB. TNFα alone was unable to induce iNOS expression (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although TNFα induced ERK activation and NF-κB activation in a pattern similar to that induced by IL-1β, suggesting the involvement of other signaling pathway(s) that may either induce or suppress iNOS expression. IFNγ alone did not activate NF-κB and was unable to induce iNOS expression in VSMCs (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it is known that both TNFα and IFNγ potentiate IL-1β-induced gene expression, probably due to the involvement of other signaling pathways. For example, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 is activated by IFNγ (14.Jiang B. Haverty M. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Teng X. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and this transcription factor has been shown to promote iNOS expression (24.Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29266-29273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although IL-1β-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression was enhanced by either TNFα or IFNγ, the expression of these two genes was dramatically suppressed by inhibition of ERK activation, whereas the induction of VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD by the combination of cytokines was not affected. These data further demonstrated that the ERK signaling pathway has a major role in regulating the expression of certain NF-κB-dependent genes even when multiple cytokines coexist. VCAM-1 and Mn-SOD were constitutively expressed at relatively low levels but were detectable by either Western blot for the proteins or RT-PCR for mRNA in rat VSMCs under basal conditions. A low basal turnover of I-κB proteins is supported by evidence obtained from treating cells for 25 h with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, which inhibited I-κBα degradation in the absence of added cytokine and led to an accumulation of phosphorylated I-κBα. The I-κBα-mediated NF-κB activation was acutely and dramatically enhanced by IL-1β stimulation, which was accompanied by increased expression of VCAM-1. Consistent with previous reports by others, one of the NF-κB-dependent genes is I-κBα itself (8.Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), which is activated in a similar time frame to VCAM-1 (protein levels increased within 3 h after IL-1β addition). Interestingly, the newly synthesized I-κBα could not prevent the activation of NF-κB by IL-1β, possibly due to the fact that newly synthesized I-κBα underwent constitutive and rapid phosphorylation and degradation during IL-1β stimulation. Because inhibition of I-κBα degradation by MG132 reduced NF-κB activation without influencing I-κBα phosphorylation, the activation of VCAM-1 gene transcription may be dependent on the turnover rate of I-κBα. Neither PD98059 nor MEK1dn affected IL-1β-induced I-κBα phosphorylation at Ser-32/Ser-36. Considering that inhibition of ERK showed no effect on I-κBα phosphorylation and degradation, and also had no obvious effect on VCAM-1 expression, it is apparent that I-κBα-mediated NF-κB activation in response to IL-1β is ERK-independent and responsible for triggering VCAM-1 gene expression. The regulation of Mn-SOD gene expression appears to be similar to that of VCAM-1, with respect to not requiring the persistent activation of both ERK and NF-κB. The differential regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression could be important in determining the nature of the inflammatory response. The duration of NF-κB activation might determine the course of the inflammatory response with regard to the local reactions and resulting morphologic changes, the destruction or removal of the injurious material, and the responses that lead to repair and healing (1.Baldwin A.S.

Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for NF-κB in the resolution of inflammation has been reported recently (26.Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Because activation of NF-κB may regulate the expression of numerous genes encoding either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines, growth factors, and inducible enzymes such as iNOS, COX-2, and Mn-SOD, each of which may play critical roles during different stages of the inflammation, our findings demonstrating a role for ERK in the temporal control of NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent gene expression provides new insight into the mechanisms regulating NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W1984870795,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to reduce endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression through post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability. The current study documented an independent effect of the cytokine on the eNOS gene promoter. TNF-α effected a time- and dose-dependent reduction in activity of a transiently transfected human –1197 eNOS-luciferase reporter. This reduction was inhibited by co-transfection of dominant negative IKKβ as well as a nonphosphorylatable constitutively suppressive mutant of IκB implying involvement of the NFκB cascade in the inhibitory effect. The locus of the TNF-α-dependent inhibition was traced to two Sp1-binding sites positioned between –109 and –95 and –81 and –67 relative to the transcription start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and immunoperturbation studies showed evidence for Sp1 and Sp3 binding to each element. TNF-α treatment had no effect on the binding pattern to the downstream (–81 to –67) site but did suppress association of Sp1 and Sp3 to the upstream (–109 to –95) site. Collectively, these data indicate that TNF-α exerts transcriptional, as well as post-transcriptional, effects on eNOS gene expression and suggest a potential mechanism to account for the endothelial dysfunction that accompanies disorders such as diabetes mellitus and heart failure.

Macrovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and death in diabetes mellitus. Although a portion of this increased risk can be attributed to the dyslipidemia that occurs in diabetes, it has become clear that in a significant number of patients the presence of insulin resistance per se (a hallmark of type II diabetes) is a major contributor. The mechanism(s) linking insulin resistance to vascular disease remain(s) unknown. Similarly, the factor or factors responsible for the generation of insulin resistance remain(s) only incompletely understood.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4651-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Disruption of endothelial function, including interference with NO production, is thought to contribute to the vasomotor dysregulation and the prothrombotic and hyperproliferative states that exist in the vasculature of patients with atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes.Several studies have linked endothelial dysfunction and reduced NO bioactivity to insulin resistance (10.Rizzoni D.

This is thought to reflect a combination of decreased production and increased inactivation of NO, the latter through interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (12.Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence to indicate that ROS play a major role in diminishing NO bioactivity in diabetics (13.Channon K.M. Guzik T.J. J. Physiol.

When 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin is lacking, as is the case with diabetes mellitus (14.Meininger C.J. Marinos R.S. Hatakeyama K. Martinez-Zaguilan R. Rojas J.D. Kelly K.A. Wu G. Biochem.

Losordo D.W. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1754-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, in vivo administration of TNF-α depresses endothelium-dependent relaxation (30.Wang P. Ba Z.F. Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2535-H2541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and reduces NO levels in endothelial cells (31.Johnson A. Phelps D.T. Ferro T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L318-L325PubMed Google Scholar) particularly in response to vasodilators such as bradykinin (32.Zhang D.X. Yi F.X. Zou A.P. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1785-H1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TNF-α has the ability to increase arterial ROS generation likely accounting for some of the reduction in NO levels (33.Corda S. Laplace C. Vicaut E. Duranteau J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

In addition, a number of groups have shown that TNF-α suppresses expression of eNOS, although predominantly through destabilization of eNOS mRNA (35.Michel T. Lamas S. J. Cardiovasc.

We have established that at physiological concentrations, TNF-α inhibits eNOS promoter activity. This repressive effect of TNF-α is dependent on activation of the transcription factor NFκB and subsequent reduction in the association of Sp1/Sp3-containing complexes with the eNOS promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Bio-Whittaker, Inc.

Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo™ Cell Viability assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blotting—Following treatment with TNF-α, as indicated in the figure legends, cells were harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged briefly, lysed under denaturing conditions (50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 10 min. 20 μg of supernatant protein was electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-eNOS antibody (1:2500 dilution) or polyclonal anti-IκBα (1:250 dilution) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk) overnight at 4 °C and then washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer. Membranes were later incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody or donkey anti-rabbit antibody, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature and washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween. Blots were immersed for 1 min in ECL Detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and then exposed to film. Signals were quantified using a Kodak Image Station (440CF).NOS Activity Assay—NOS activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline (43.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cell extracts were added to 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 μCi of [3H]arginine, 3 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μm FAD, 1 μm FMN, 100 nm calmodulin, and 1 mm NADPH. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, reactions were terminated with 4 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 5.5, and 5 mm EDTA and applied to Dowex 50-X8-400 1-ml columns (Sigma-Aldrich). [3H]Citrulline was quantified by liquid scintillation of the flow-through.Transfection and Luciferase Assay—BAEC were cultured as described above and then transiently co-transfected with 0.5 μg of –1197 human eNOS-luciferase (wild-type or mutant) and 0.05 μg of actin-β-galactosidase using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were treated as described in the individual figure legends, after which cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using the Galactolight Plus chemiluminescence assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For each well, luciferase levels were normalized for β-galactosidase activity.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Endothelial cells were cultured and treated with vehicle or TNF-α as described above. Cells were harvested and lysed with buffer A (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. Particulates were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol and the above protease inhibitors) and kept on ice for 30 min. Nuclear suspensions were centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were stored at –80 °C until use.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as follows (sequence represents sense strand with mutagenized bases in lowercase): Sp1-like –81/–67, wild-type 5′-GCCAGCACTGGAGAGCCCCCTCCCACTG-3′, mutant 5′-GCCAGCACTaagaAGCCCCCTtttACTG-3′; Sp1 –109/–95, wild-type 5′-CATTGTGTATGGGATAGGGGCGGGGCGAGGGCCAG-3′, mutant 5′-CATTGTGTATGGtAgAGtGtCtGtGCGAGGGCCAG-3′. Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were incubated in binding reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 32P-end-labeled double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotide at room temperature for 30 min. For immunoperturbation experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice for 2 h with 1 μg of polyclonal antibody directed against Sp1, Sp3, p50, or p65. All samples were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Student-Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni Multiple Comparison post hoc tests as applicable.RESULTSTreatment of cultured BAEC with increasing concentrations of TNF-α resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS protein levels after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). Maximal reduction in eNOS levels (∼40%) was seen at 1,000 pg/ml. This was accompanied by a reduction in NOS activity, assessed using a conventional enzymatic assay (43.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, TNF-α effected a dose-dependent reduction in NOS activity, which was maximal (∼50% inhibition) at 3,000 pg/ml. To assess the potential of TNF-α to reduce transcription of the eNOS gene, we examined the effects of the cytokine on a transiently transfected human eNOS promoter. As shown in Fig. 1C, TNF-α treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in eNOS promoter-dependent luciferase activity that was statistically significant at 100 pg/ml (∼40% reduction) and maximal (60%) at 1,000 pg/ml cytokine.TNF-α had no significant effect on readily detectable (∼15,000–20,000 arbitrary light units) luciferase activity (control = 100 ± 0% versus TNF-α = 101 ± 12%, p > 0.05) associated with the background vector.The suppression by TNF-α of eNOS expression was time-dependent with reductions in both eNOS protein levels (Fig. 2A) and eNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2B) seen after 8 h of TNF-α exposure. Interestingly, although the effect on protein levels appeared to plateau between 8 and 48 h, the reduction in promoter activity required the full 48 h to achieve maximal inhibition.Fig. 2Time course of TNF-α-dependent reduction of eNOS protein levels and human eNOS promoter activity. A, BAEC were treated with TNF-α (100 pg/ml) for 0–48 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for eNOS protein using Western blot analysis; n = 6. B, BAEC were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of –1197 human eNOS-luciferase and 0.05 μg of actin β-galactosidase. 18 –24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α (100 pg/ml) for 0–48 h and then processed and assayed for luciferase activity (n = 4).

Han M. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 1376-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The effect of TNF-α on iNOS expression in endothelial cells and, in particular, bovine endothelial cells is reportedly negligible (44.Wen J.K. Han M.

Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in these cells, we questioned whether increased NO in our BAEC cultures (through enhanced activity of iNOS or other NOS isoforms) might account for the TNF-α-dependent repression of the eNOS promoter. As shown in Fig. 3, inhibiting the activity of all NOS isoforms using the nonselective NOS inhibitor l-NAME (1 mm) had no effect on the TNF-α-dependent suppression of eNOS promoter activity. This suggests that NO generation does not mediate the inhibitory effect of TNF-α.Fig. 3Effect of NOS inhibition on TNF-α-dependent reduction of eNOS promoter activity. BAEC were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of –1197 human eNOS-luciferase and 0.05 μg of actin β-galactosidase. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were pre-treated with l-NAME (1 mm for 1 h) and then treated with TNF-α (100 pg/ml) for 48 h.

Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the NFκB pathway involves activation of one or more upstream kinases called IκB kinases or IKKs. The IKKs phosphorylate IκB, an inhibitory protein that complexes with NFκB in the cytoplasm, thereby blocking its entry into the nuclear compartment. This phosphorylation targets IκB for degradation through the ubiquitin-sensitive proteasome pathway (49.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), resulting in increased nuclear localization of NFκB and activation or suppression of NFκB-regulated genes. Treatment of BAEC with TNF-α resulted in a time-dependent reduction in levels of IκBα in these cells between 15 and 30 min (Fig. 4), reflecting increased degradation of the inhibitor and, inferentially, activation of the NFκB signaling pathway. By 60 min, levels of the protein began to increase toward control levels, a finding that presumably results from increased synthesis of IκB (50.Rothwarf, D. M., and Karin, M.

As shown in Fig. 5A, the 2N mutant completely reversed the TNF-α-dependent inhibition. Co-transfection of wild-type IκB led to partial reversal of the inhibition (Fig. 5B), whereas an IκB mutant (3C) that was altered at phosphorylation sites that are not involved in IκB turnover (51.Beauparlant P. Kwon H. Clarke M. Lin R. Sonenberg N. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5777-5785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was devoid of activity. A third mutant that combined mutations at both types of phosphorylation sites (2N + 3C) also reversed the inhibition.Fig. 5Nondegradable IκBα mutants prevent TNF-α-dependent reduction of eNOS promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2036362283,"Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) suppresses metastasis of multiple human and murine cancer cells without inhibiting tumorigenicity. By yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation, BRMS1 interacts with retinoblastoma binding protein 1 and at least seven members of the mSin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex in human breast and melanoma cell lines. BRMS1 co-immunoprecipitates enzymatically active HDAC proteins and represses transcription when recruited to a Gal4 promoter in vivo. BRMS1 exists in large mSin3 complex(es) of ∼1.4-1.9 MDa, but also forms smaller complexes with HDAC1. Deletion analyses show that the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids of BRMS1 are not critical for interaction with much of the mSin3 complex and that BRMS1 appears to have more than one binding point to the complex. These results further show that BRMS1 may participate in transcriptional regulation via interaction with the mSin3·HDAC complex and suggest a novel mechanism by which BRMS1 might suppress cancer metastasis."

A number of reports have identified different DUBs that can hydrolyze ubiquitin from substrates bound to the proteasome. We measured deubiquitination by both isolated lid and base-core particle subcomplexes, suggesting that at least two different DUBs are intrinsic components of 26 S proteasome holoenzymes. In agreement, we find that highly purified proteasomes contain both Rpn11 and Ubp6, situated within the lid and base subcomplexes, respectively. To study their relative contributions, we purified proteasomes from a mutant in the putative metalloprotease domain of Rpn11 and from a ubp6 null. Interestingly, in both preparations we observed slower deubiquitination rates, suggesting that Rpn11 and Ubp6 serve complementary roles. In accord, the double mutant is synthetically lethal. In contrast to WT proteasomes, proteasomes lacking the lid subcomplex or those purified from the rpn11 mutant are less sensitive to metal chelators, supporting the prediction that Rpn11 may be a metalloprotein. Treatment of proteasomes with ubiquitin-aldehyde or with cysteine modifiers also inhibited deubiquitination but simultaneously promoted degradation of a monoubiquitinated substrate along with the ubiquitin tag. Degradation is unique to 26 S proteasome holoenzymes; we could not detect degradation of a ubiquitinated protein by “lidless” proteasomes, although they were competent for deubiquitination. The fascinating observation that a single ubiquitin moiety is sufficient for targeting an otherwise stable substrate to proteasomes exposes how rapid deubiquitination of poorly ubiquitinated substrates may counteract degradation.

The fascinating observation that a single ubiquitin moiety is sufficient for targeting an otherwise stable substrate to proteasomes exposes how rapid deubiquitination of poorly ubiquitinated substrates may counteract degradation. The 26 S proteasome is the protease responsible for most regulatory intracellular proteolysis in eukaryotes (1.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev.

Elimination of proteins by the proteasome usually requires covalent attachment of the carboxyl terminus of polyubiquitin chains to an amino group on the substrate (5.Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 6.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 7.Glickman M.H.

This process is reversible by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs 1The abbreviations used are: DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; CP, core particle; RP, regulatory particle; Ub, ubiquitin; UBP, ubiquitin-specific protease; UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase; NEM, N-ethyl maleimide; Ubal, ubiquitin aldehyde; GFP, green fluorescent protein; OPA, o-phenanthroline; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.; reviewed in Refs. 8.Wing S.

The 26 S proteasome can be divided into two subcomplexes, the 670-kDa 20 S proteolytic core particle (CP) where proteolysis occurs, and the 900-kDa 19 S regulatory particle (RP), which in turn is composed of a lid and a base (12.Glickman M.H.

Attachment of the substrate to polyubiquitin chains presumably serves to anchor the substrate to the base while it is unfolded and translocated through a gated channel into the 20 S CP for proteolysis. The lid attaches to the base and is required for proteolysis of polyubiquitin-protein conjugates (12.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). During this process, ubiquitin (Ub) is hydrolyzed from the substrate by proteasome-associated DUBs, enabling recycling of ubiquitin even as the substrate is degraded (11.Guterman, A., and Glickman, M. H. (2004) Curr. Protein Pept. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). Almost all known DUBs are cysteine proteases that specifically hydrolyze an amide bond following the carboxyl terminus of the ubiquitin moiety (glycine 76), usually a peptide bond between this carboxyl group and an amino group on the substrate: either a lysine residue or the N terminus itself (7.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 13.Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Other types of amide bonds such as those linking ubiquitin to small organic molecules (e.g. Ub-AMC) can also be cleaved, a property often used to design substrates for the study of deubiquitinases in vitro (14.Lee J.I. Woo S.K. Kim K.I. Park K.C. Baek S.H. Yoo Y.J. Chung C.H. Biol. Proc. Online. 1998; 1: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on their size, sequence homology, and active sites, DUBs have classically been categorized as ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) or ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs). For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are at least 17 different DUBs, 16 of which are UBPs and one that is a UCH (15.Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 9–10: 981-992Google Scholar). Other organisms have a greater number of DUBs from both of these classes. The MPN+ or JAMM family comprises a novel and unrelated third class of DUBs. These enzymes contain a consensus motif, EX(7)HXHX(7)SX(2)D that bears some resemblance to the active site of zinc metalloproteases and may function as tightly regulated metalloproteases (16.Maytal-Kivity V. Reis N. Hofmann K. Glickman M.H. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17.Yao T. Cohen R.E.

While this manuscript was under final preparation for publication, the three-dimensional structure of an archaeal MPN+ protein related to Rpn11 was reported (20.Tran H.J. Allen M.D. Lowe J. Bycroft M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11460-11465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This extremely important advancement strongly supports the MPN+/JAMM motif as a metal-binding site with a zinc-coordinated water ligand serving as the active site nucleophile in this novel class of enzymes. In addition to hydrolyzing the amide bond C-terminal to ubiquitin, certain members of the above families can cleave Ub-like domains. Thus, the UCH Yuh1 (21.Linghu B. Callis J. Goebl M.G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or the MPN+ protein Csn5 may process the Ub-like domains of Rub1/Nedd8 (22.Wee S. Hetfeld B. Dubiel W. Wolf D.A.

Thus, members of the ovarian tumor superfamily of proteins (OTU) may constitute a new DUB family carrying a cysteine active site (28.Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 50-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29.Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23180-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since they bind to ubiquitin-aldehyde, this family is also called otubains (for OTU domain ubiquitin-aldehyde-binding proteins). Josephines group together spinocerebellar ataxias such as ataxin-3 and Josephine-type proteins (31.Scheel H. Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2845-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on their sequence, members of this family are predicted to be active against ubiquitin chains or related substrates. In yet another example, cylindromatosis proteins may represent a novel class of deubiquitinating enzymes that are highly divergent from UBPs (32.Wilkinson K.D. Nature. 2003; 424: 738-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, a novel family of Ub-like proteases was identified as specific for removal of various Ub-like domains from their targets (33.Gan-Erdene T. Nagamalleswari K. Yin L. Wu K. Pan Z.-Q. Wilkinson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28892-28900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 34.Mendoza H.M. Shen L.-n. Botting C. Lewis A. Chen J. Ink B. Hay R.T. J.

Although they are all cysteine proteases, UBPs, UCHs, otubains, Josephines, and Ub-like proteases do not share overall sequence homology with one another. The ongoing identification of unrelated families of proteases for removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like domains and their diverse mechanisms of action raises the possibility that additional novel deubiquitinating enzymes have yet to be discovered, some possibly even relating to proteasome function. A number of reports indicate that the proteasome, and more specifically the 19 S RP, possesses intrinsic deubiquitinating activity (17.Yao T. Cohen R.E.

Furthermore, proteasomes exhibit a broad spectrum of intrinsic and associated deubiquitinating activities. For example, in some studies, this activity is ATP-dependent (17.Yao T. Cohen R.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not surprising, therefore, that these activities have been matched with different proteasome components. For instance, Rpn11, the most conserved subunit among the lid subunits, is an MPN+ protein responsible for deubiquitination of certain substrates (17.Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 18.Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, single site mutants in the MPN+/JAMM catalytic site are viable (16.Maytal-Kivity V. Reis N. Hofmann K. Glickman M.H. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and no deubiquitination by isolated lid or recombinant Rpn11 has been reported. Thus, if deubiquitination is a fundamental property of proteasomes, it would be expected to be performed by complementary subunits. Separately, Ubp6 and its human homolog USP14 have been shown to bind to proteasomes and may be responsible for removal of the proximal ubiquitin at the base of the anchoring polyubiquitin chain (40.Borodovsky A.

In addition, the UCH p37a (Dm) or its homologs UCH37 (Hs) and Uch2 (Sp) can attach to the 19 S RP and may be responsible for polyubiquitin chain editing (37.Lam Y.A. DeMartino G.N. Pickart C.M.

Commun. 2000; 272: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A clear ortholog of p37a has not been identified in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that these functions are complemented by another component. An unrelated DUB, Ubp4/Doa4, has been proposed to trim short residual polyubiquitin chains from proteasome-bound substrates in this organism (43.Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The exact role that deubiquitination plays in proteasome function is far from clear. Why, for example, are proteasome-associated DUBs necessary when numerous “free” ones abound? By removing the polyubiquitin anchor, can proteasome-associated DUBs provide one last proofreading attempt, a chance to salvage substrates before they are irreversibly proteolyzed? Or must the polyubiquitin chain be removed in order to facilitate translocation of the substrate via the narrow gated channel into the proteolytic chamber of the 20 S CP? Alternatively, the emphasis may be on recycling ubiquitin and preventing it from following in the substrate's wake. In this study, we characterized the intrinsic deubiquitinating activity of highly purified 26 S proteasomes from yeast and attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which deubiquitination intertwines with the proteasome's main function, proteolysis. We mapped deubiquitination to both the lid and base subcomplexes of the regulatory particle. By comparing purified proteasomes from rpn11D122A and Δubp6 strains, our results point to similar contributions of Rpn11 and Ubp6, each within their respective subcomplex, with possibly yet a third unidentified proteasome-bound DUB. Surprisingly, inhibition of proteasome deubiquitinating activity promoted degradation of the monoubiquitinated test substrate along with the Ub moiety by 26 S proteasome holoenzymes but not by base-CP preparations. SUB62—SUB62 (MATa his3-Δ200 lys2-801 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-52) was used as wild type for proteasome purifications used in Figs. 1, 6, and 7. Lid and base subcomplexes were purified from a Δrpn10 strain derived from SUB62 and described previously (12.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A.

Δubp6 (MY138) and its isogenic WT strain BY471 were obtained from EUROSCARF and were used in proteasome purification described in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Single site mutants in RPN11 were carried out in a strain derived from BY4741 and were described previously (16.Maytal-Kivity V. Reis N. Hofmann K. Glickman M.H. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Purified proteasomes used in the remaining figures were purified from WT BY4741, Δubp6, and rpn11D122A.Fig. 6Monitoring degradation of Ub-GFP conjugates. A, GFP fluorescence upon the addition of proteasomes. 700 nm Ub-GFP was incubated with 6 nm purified 26 S proteasomes, and changes in GFP fluorescence were recorded. Despite being deubiquitinated throughout the course of this reaction (see Fig. 1), fluorescence intensity of Ub-GFP remained unchanged, pointing to constant levels of total GFP (left panel). The reaction was repeated under similar conditions but with a proteasome sample that was preincubated with 10 mm NEM before the addition of substrate (right). A steady decrease in GFP fluorescence is observed, corroborating the observation that GFP is hydrolyzed by proteasomes (as in Fig. 5). Note that untagged GFP is not degraded under similar conditions (see Supplemental Material). B, GFP is inert to the addition of purified 26 S proteasomes in the presence or absence of NEM. 500 nm purified GFP was incubated with 6 nm purified 26 S proteasomes in the presence (right) or absence (left) of 10 mm NEM. No changes in real time fluorescence of GFP were measured. C, 500 nm GFP was incubated with 8 nm untreated (right) or NEM-treated (left) purified 26 S proteasomes. Reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GFP. No degradation of GFP was detected under these conditions either by untreated or by NEM-treated proteasomes. The fate of GFP can be compared with degradation of Ub-GFP that was measured under similar conditions by NEM-treated 26 S proteasomes (Fig. 5). These results confirm results presented in the Supplemental Material showing that degradation of Ub-GFP is dependent on the ubiquitin tag. Untagged GFP is not a substrate for the proteasome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Partitioning of deubiquitinating activity between lid and base subcomplexes. A, deubiquitinating activity is mapped to both lid and base subcomplexes. Equimolar amounts (estimated at roughly 8 nm each) of purified 26 S holoenzyme, lid, base-CP, and 20 S CP were incubated for 30 min with 900 nm Ub-GFP. Aliquots at start and end time points were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GFP. Both lid and base-CP are similarly competent to deubiquitinate Ub-GFP, but at a lower specific activity compared with 26 S holoenzyme (left). Importantly, no deubiquitination or degradation activity is detected for purified 20 S CP under these conditions (right). B, the ability to degrade Ub-GFP is a property of intact DUB-inhibited 26 S proteasome holoenzyme. The reaction was carried out as in A but in the presence of 10 mm OPA (top) or 10 mm NEM (bottom). Both 26 S holoenzyme and free lid preparations are partially, but not absolutely, inhibited by OPA. Deubiquitination by base-CP is insensitive to treatment with OPA. Upon treatment with the cysteine modifier NEM, deubiquitination by both 26 S holoenzymes and base-CP is significantly inhibited. The outcome of this inhibition in each case is different; inhibition of 26 S holoenzymes promotes proteolysis of the entire substrate (along with the Ub moiety; see also Fig. 5); however, no degradation is observed with base-CP preparations. Notably, lid exhibits no sensitivity to NEM under these conditions. C, Ubp6 is localized to the base subcomplex. Immunoblotting proteasome subcomplexes with anti-Ubp6 reveals the presence of Ubp6 in purified proteasome holoenzymes as well as in purified base-CP preparations. No Ubp6 is detected in lid or 20 S CP alone, indicating that Ubp6 is localized to the base subcomplex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Additive contributions of Ubp6 and Rpn11 to deubiquitination by the proteasome. A, deubiquitinating activity of mutant proteasomes. 8 nm WT or mutant proteasomes was incubated with 500 nm Ub-GFP. Reaction products taken at designated time points were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GFP. As can be estimated from rates of reaction, the specific deubiquitinating activities of proteasomes purified from ubp6 and rpn11 mutants are similar to each other and lower than that of WT. B, sensitivity to the metal chelator OPA. The reaction was carried out as in A but in the presence of 10 mm OPA. Deubiquitination rate by proteasomes purified from WT or Δubp6 is sensitive to the addition of OPA. The addition of OPA does not further inhibit proteasomes that were purified from rpn11D122A and that already exhibit lower deubiquitination rates, in agreement with a proteasome-bound metalloprotein being inactivated in this mutant strain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Synthetic phenotype for ubp6 and rpn11 double mutants. A double deletion of Δubp6 and Δrpn11 strain was sustained with a URA3-marked plasmid expressing a natural abundance of WT RPN11 (in order to complement the rpn11 null, which is inviable; Δubp6 alone is viable). This strain was transformed with LEU2-marked plasmids expressing natural abundance RPN11 or rpn11 single-site mutations in the putative catalytic MPN+ motif. Transformants were streaked onto 5-fluoroorotic acid Ura+ medium and allowed to grow for 5 days at 25 °C. Since 5-fluoroorotic acid is toxic to URA3 cells, only strains able to lose the URA3-marked plasmids while retaining the LEU2-containing plasmid were viable. All three substitutions in the MPN+ motif of Rpn11 were synthetically lethal with Δubp6, pointing to complementary functions of the two gene products. Transformations with WT RPN11 or with rpn11C116A were viable in conjunction with Δubp6Δrpn11 and are shown for control, indicating that the double deletion requires a functional Rpn11. In an identical procedure, all of these mutations were shown to complement deletion of rpn11 alone (16.Maytal-Kivity V. Reis N. Hofmann K. Glickman M.H. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the single site substitutions H111A, S119A, or D122A in Rpn11 all resulted in viable albeit slowly growing and thermosensitive strains (16.Maytal-Kivity V. Reis N. Hofmann K.

A, effect of Ubal. 8 nm conventionally purified 26 S proteasome preparations were pretreated with 5 μm Ubal, followed by the addition of Ub-GFP to a final concentration of 500 nm; products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GFP. In contrast to the reaction with untreated proteasomes (Fig. 1), Ub-GFP was degraded, and no free GFP was released. B, effect of NEM; similar reaction as in A but in the presence of 10 mm NEM. Reaction products were monitored by blotting with anti-GFP. C, fate of Ub; same as in B, but products were resolved by 18% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Ub.

Continuous monitoring of dynamic changes in gene expression from living cells in response to various stimuli provides important information about cell physiology. For this purpose bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters have been introduced as tools for sensitive and convenient monitoring of gene expression.

The gene expression is monitored simply by measuring light emitted through an enzymatic reaction or fluorescence.

Although time course studies of gene expression have been determined by real time imaging with these reporter genes, intracellular assays present difficulties for continuous measurements in some cases. For instance, it is not easy to keep an intracellular concentration of luciferin at a constant level in the case of application of firefly and Renilla luciferases. In the case of FL, additional methods may be required to facilitate the passage of the substrate across the cell membrane. In addition, the intensity and stability of the bioluminescent response of FL in living cells are reported to be affected by concentrations of ATP, luciferin, and luciferin-luciferase complex (15Gandelman O. Allue I. Bowers K. Cobbold P. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1994; 9: 363-371Google Scholar, 16Lembert N. Idahl L.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 929-933Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the GFP possesses excellent properties as a reporter, it has some shortcomings (toxicity for living cells (for review, see Ref. 17Duisit G. Conrath H. Saleun S. Folliot S.

Sanchez-Bueno A. Tsuji F.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 659-662Google Scholar) they have one disadvantage. To measure the photoprotein activity the synthesized apophotoprotein needs to be charged with coelenterazine substrate over periods of several h, and this delays answering the question about gene activity. To circumvent these limitations and difficulties, fusion proteins of luciferases and of GFP were created possessing sequences that induce secretion of the protein into the culture medium (21Liu J. Wang Y. Szalay A.A. Escher A. Luminescence. 2000; 15: 45-49Google Scholar, 22Liu S. Bugos R.C. Dharmasiri N. Su W.W. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 87: 1-16Google Scholar).

There are bioluminescent organisms with naturally occurring secreted luciferases, and the cDNAs encoding some of them have been cloned. These include the marine ostracod Vargula hilgendorfii (23Thompson E.M. Nagata S. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For instance, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with a plasmid bearing the cDNA for Vargula luciferase it was demonstrated that the secretory process could be monitored in real time from individual cells (26Inouye S. Ohmiya Y. Toya Y. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9584-9587Google Scholar). The attractiveness of secreted luciferases as reporters is a strong stimulus for the investigation and exploitation of new bioluminescent systems. Metridia longa is a small (∼1.5 mm) luminous marine copepod. The bioluminescence originates as a secretion from epidermal glands located in the head part and abdomen in response to mechanical, electrical, or chemical stimuli (29Evstigneev P.V. Bitukov E.P. Greze, B.N. Bioluminescence of Marine Copepods. Naukova Dumka, Kiev, Ukraine1990Google Scholar). Bioluminescence in M. longa may well serve as a defense mechanism against predators; the release of a luminous bolus from the animal is accompanied by rapid swimming that displaces the copepod away from its “glowing phantom.” Although the bioluminescence of M. longa was described many years ago (30Clarke G.L. Conover R.J. David C.N. Nicol J.A. J. Mar. Biolog. Assoc. U. K. 1962; 42: 541-564Google Scholar) no studies concerning the properties of the bioluminescent system were carried out until now. The present study provides information on the substrate specificity of Metridia luciferase (MLuc) and reports cloning, nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA encoding Metridia luciferase, expression of MLuc cDNA in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells, and verification of the suitability of MLuc for use as a reporter for monitoring gene expression. Collection of the Copepod M. longa—We collected the animals in Chupa Bay in the region of the White Sea biological station Kartesh from aboard the research vessel “Professor Kuznetsov” using a shutting plankton net at a depth of 100–50 m where this species dominates. Plankton were sorted with a transfer pipette under a stereomicroscope, and the M. longa specimens at stages IV–VI of development (0.3–1.5 mm in size) were transferred into a tank containing continuously aerated seawater at 4 °C, which was the temperature of the natural habitat of the copepod. The accumulated animals were filtered and quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen. Determination of Metridia Luciferase Substrate—For studies of the substrate specificity of Metridia luciferase about 30 freshly collected copepods were homogenized in 2 ml of 50 mm Hepes pH 7.2 at 0 °C. The suspension was centrifuged, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant immediately was used for measurements. The luminescence was initiated by injection of 10 μl of either coelenterazine or Vargula luciferin in methanol into 0.5 ml of the supernatant of M. longa extract. Preparation of the Expression cDNA Library and Screening—Total RNA was isolated from frozen whole copepods by the guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified on poly(U)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 μg of this was employed to synthesize cDNA. The expression cDNA library was constructed in a λTriplEx2 phagemid vector with the SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech) according to the protocol supplied with the kit. The cDNA-vector ligation mixture obtained was then packaged with Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene), yielding about 106 independent recombinant plaques. The phage and bacterial culture plating was carried out according to the protocol for the SMART cDNA library construction kit. For screening the unamplified phage a cDNA library was plated at low density. An imprint of the plaque pattern was obtained by applying a dry nitrocellulose filter impregnated with bacteria to the primary plate. The filter was then turned over, applied to a fresh sterile agar plate, and left on the plate for the bacteria to grow. The replica filters were grown until a bacterial lawn with clearly visible plaques appeared. Then the bacterial lawn with plaques was scraped off the filter with a sterile glass spreader into LB medium supplemented with 10 mm MgSO4 and 0.2% maltose. The suspension was poured into a culture tube, and gene expression was induced with 20 μm IPTG for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell pellet from 3 ml of suspension was sonicated in 0.3 ml of SM buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.01% gelatin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 0 °C. The crude cell lysate was assayed for bioluminescence activity with coelenterazine (PJK GmbH, Kleinblittersdorf, Germany) (final concentration, ∼10–6m). The next replica from a positive primary plate was cut into sectors that were analyzed as above. Then the individual plaques from the positive sectors were isolated and assayed for bioluminescence activity after IPTG induction. For the subsequent analysis of the isolated cDNAs, the positive plaques were converted to the corresponding pTriplEx2 plasmid subclones in the E. coli BM25.8 strain according to the protocol supplied with the SMART cDNA library construction kit. The isolated cDNA was cycle-sequenced with the DNA cycle-sequencing kit (Medigen, Novosibirsk, Russia). [α-32P]dATP was used as a label. The computer program ClustalW, version 1.81, was used for sequence comparison and alignment. Expression of Metridia Luciferase in E. coli—Analysis of the MLuc sequence revealed a putative internal translation initiation site for bacterial expression near the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2). To remove it we made two replacements in the nucleotide sequence with amino acid sequence conservation using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pTriplEx2-MLuc plasmid with the wild-type luciferase gene was used as the template for mutagenesis. All natural secreted proteins lose their signal peptide during secretion. It is reasonable to assume that this also occurs when secreted proteins are used as reporters in mammalian cells. In that case, the properties of the reporter protein without the signal peptide need to be known if the results are to be interpreted correctly. The cDNA encoding the translated part of the luciferase gene without signal peptide was amplified with a high fidelity polymerase PfuTurbo (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For this we used the MLuc gene after removal of the putative internal site of translation initiation as template. The final volume of 50 μl contained 0.1 μg of DNA with 2.5 units of polymerase. The isolated PCR fragment was cloned in the correct reading frame into the pET22b+ expression vector (Novagen) in NdeI/XhoI sites. The new restriction sites for direct inframe cloning were generated by design of the primers. The NdeI restriction site was introduced into the forward primer, and the XhoI restriction site was introduced into the reverse primer. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and inserted into a similarly digested, dephosphorylated, and agarose gel-purified pET22b+ expression vector. The resulting plasmid was named pET22-MLuc. After verification of the nucleotide sequence, the pET22-MLuc plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL for expression of luciferase. For protein production, the transformed E. coli was cultivated with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 1 mm IPTG when the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.5–0.6. After addition of IPTG, the cultivation was continued for 3 h. For activity measurements on the expressed MLuc, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of the SM buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.01% gelatin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and sonicated at 0 °C. The bioluminescence was measured by rapid injection of 10 μl of 1–3 × 10–4m coelenterazine in methanol into a luminometer cell containing 0.5 ml of sonicated cell lysate in SM buffer at room temperature. The bioluminescence spectra were measured with an AMINCO luminescent spectrometer (Thermo Spectronic, Madison, WI). Emission spectra were corrected with the computer program supplied with the instrument. Expression of MLuc and FL in CHO Cells—The pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pASM (Bayer) plasmids harboring a neomycin resistance and a cAMP-sensitive mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, respectively, were used for expression. The pcDNA3-MLuc and pASM-MLuc plasmids were constructed by subcloning the full-length Metridia cDNA sequence from pTriplEx2-MLuc into the EcoRV/NotI site of pcDNA3 and pASM. To produce the pcDNA3-FL plasmid, the FL (GenBank™/EBI accession number AB062786) sequence (Promega) was subcloned from the pASM-FL plasmid (Bayer) in the same cloning site. CHO-K1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were used both for transient and for stable transfections. The transfection of CHO-K1 cells with recombinant plasmids was performed with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pASM plasmid was co-transfected with pcDNA3 for neomycin selection. The transfected cells were selected in medium with 2 mg/ml geneticin. The positive clones were verified by luminescence measurement of the medium for MLuc or cell lysates for FL. Secretion Time Course of Metridia Luciferase—The CHO cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3-MLuc, pcDNA3-FL, or pcDNA3 and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The MLuc and FL were assayed at regular time intervals of 1 h with 20-μl aliquots of medium. The aliquots were taken from 96-(5000 cells/well) or 384-well (300 cells/well) microtiter plates. The aliquots were transferred to 96-well white microtiter plates. 5 μl of coelenterazine (1 × 10–4m in phosphate-buffered saline) or 5 μl of FL assay buffer (final concentrations in the mixture: 150 μm firefly luciferin, 90 μm coenzyme A, 170 μl of ATP, 6 mm Tricine, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 30 μm EDTA, and 11 mm dithiothreitol) were added. The bioluminescence was assayed by integration over a time interval of 30 s with a special robotic Bayer camera system. To determine the intracellular MLuc and FL activities, ∼500 cells were harvested and disrupted with 0.5% Triton X-100. The assay was performed by mixing 50 μl of the cell lysate in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates with 5 μl of 1 × 10–4m coelenterazine in phosphate-buffered saline or with 5 μl of the FL assay buffer. The bioluminescence was assayed as described above. Activation of A2a and NPY2 G-protein-coupled Receptors—The pcDNA3-A2a and pcDNA3-NPY2 plasmids were constructed by cloning the human adenosine receptor A2a cDNA into the BamHI/EcoRV site and the human neuropeptide Y receptor NPY2 cDNA into the BamHI/EcoR1 site of pcDNA3.1(+), respectively. The cDNAs encoding A2a (GenBank™/EBI accession number X68486) and NPY2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_000910) were cloned from human brain genomic DNA using standard PCR and cloning protocols. Both plasmids were transiently expressed in CHO-pASM-MLuc cells. CHO-pASM-MLuc is a stable cell line containing the pASM-MLuc plasmid. The cells harboring pcDNA3-A2a plasmid were activated with 5′-N-ethylcarboxaminoadenosine (1 × 10–7m) for 4 h. The cells with pcDNA3-NPY2 were activated by neuropeptide Y (1 × 10–9m) for 4 h in the presence of 1 × 10–6m forskolin. In these experiments adenylate cyclase was prestimulated by forskolin to reveal NPY2-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition. Substrate Specificity of Metridia Luciferase—The substrate specificity of Metridia luciferase was studied with a crude extract of Metridia. The addition of Vargula luciferin to a crude extract of copepods did not produce any detected luminescence, whereas the addition of coelenterazine produced a flash of light with fast decay of luminescence and intensity depending on the quantity of added crude extract (data not shown). A repeated injection of coelenterazine gives rise to a new luminescence flash. The bioluminescence of the extract is blue with maximum at 480 nm (Fig. 1). The color of the light emitted by the extract correlates well with the bioluminescence color observed visually from the copepods on mechanical stimulation. Isolation of a Positive Clone, cDNA Structure, and Sequence—The M. longa cDNA library yielded ∼106 independent recombinant plaques. After about 10,000 plaques had been screened, several positive clones revealing luminescent activity were isolated. The isolated cDNA is an 897-bp fragment (excluding poly(A) tail) with a 56-bp 5′-untranslated region upstream from the first start codon (Fig. 2). The open reading frame contains 656 bp, which encode a 219-amino acid polypeptide with calculated Mr of 23,885. After the stop codon there is a 181-bp untranslated region followed by a terminal poly(A). MLuc encodes for 10 cysteine residues. This number of Cys residues indicates that cloned luciferase may contain disulfide bonds, which may be necessary for bioluminescent activity or for supporting a stable protein conformation. But unlike other coelenterazine-dependent luciferases that use coelenterazine as a substrate or the Ca2+-regulated photoproteins (32Lorenz W.W. McCann R.O. Longiaru M. Cormier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4438-4442Google Scholar, 33Tsuji F.I. Ohmiya Y. Fagan T.F. Toh H. Inouye S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 657-661Google Scholar, 34Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Blinks J.R. Burakova L.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2227-2236Google Scholar), Metridia luciferase has only two Trp and two Tyr residues. A homology search of the non-redundant protein data bases with the gapped Blast program and the MLuc sequence as query produced only one hit, the luciferase from another copepod, G. princeps. The degree of identity of the Gaussia luciferase sequence relative to the MLuc sequence is 60 and 68% for nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. As the copepods G. princeps and M. longa belong to the same family (Metridinidae), this could account for the great similarity between the Gaussia and Metridia luciferase sequences. In contrast, the luciferase cloned from a representative of the third genus of the family Metridinidae (Pleuromamma) (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY015994) does not resemble the Metridia and Gaussia luciferases. This suggests that there is a possibility of high diversity of primary structures of luciferases among the luminous copepods, the luminous species of which are found in various genera and families (29Evstigneev P.V. Bitukov E.P. Greze, B.N. Bioluminescence of Marine Copepods. Naukova Dumka, Kiev, Ukraine1990Google Scholar). To date primary sequences have been determined for several luciferases (Renilla (32Lorenz W.W. McCann R.O. Longiaru M. Cormier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4438-4442Google Scholar), Oplophorus (24Inouye S. Watanabe K. Nakamura H. Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 19-25Google Scholar), Pleuromamma, and Gaussia luciferases) and for several Ca2+-regulated photoproteins (33Tsuji F.I. Ohmiya Y. Fagan T.F. Toh H. Inouye S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 657-661Google Scholar, 34Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Blinks J.R. Burakova L.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2227-2236Google Scholar), all of which catalyze the luminescent oxidation of the same substrate, coelenterazine (35Campbell A.K. Herring P.J. Mar. Biol. 1990; 104: 219-225Google Scholar). Despite the fact that all of them use the same substrate, it is very intriguing and possibly significant to find no sequence similarity among these bioluminescent proteins. Also unrelated are the primary structures of Metridia luciferase and Vargula luciferase (23Thompson E.M. Nagata S. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6567-6571Google Scholar) that catalyze the oxidation of a structurally similar imidazopyrazinone substrate. A “neural network” trained to identify the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in protein sequences (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) suggests the existence of an N-terminal signal peptide of 17 amino acids with the putative cleavage site VQA-KS (Fig. 2) with probability close to 100%. Evidently, the cloned cDNA encodes the secreted luciferase, and this is in good agreement with the observed phenomenon of secreted bioluminescence. The Metridia luciferase sequence analysis reveals the presence of repeats (www.ebi.ac.uk/Radar/) consisting of 31 residues (Fig. 2) having high identity (41.9%). This would suggest that the MLuc gene could have arisen by duplication of one precursor gene. No potential glycosylation sites having the canonical sequence Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) were found in the MLuc sequence. The MLuc nucleotide sequence analysis also reveals that within the coding sequence there is an internal sequence (Fig. 2) that is identical to the highly efficient ribosome binding site (AAGGAGA) from the phage T7 major capsid protein and that is used in pET expression vectors. This internal site of translation initiation, the putative internal ribosome binding site, occurs with the appropriate spacing upstream of the ATG codon. For bacterial expression the putative internal site of translation initiation was eliminated from the coding sequence with amino acid sequence conservation to avoid the synthesis of additional truncated product. To isolate cDNA encoding Metridia luciferase, we applied the expression cloning approach that we used for cloning the cDNAs encoding Ca2+-regulated photoproteins from Obelia longissima (36Illarionov B.A. Markova S.V. Bondar V.S. Vysotski E.S. Gitelson J.I. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1992; 326: 911-913Google Scholar) and Obelia geniculata (34Markova S.V. Vysotski E.S. Blinks J.R. Burakova L.P. Wang B.-C. Lee J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2227-2236Google Scholar). This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage of expression cloning is the difficulty (if it is even possible) in isolating cDNAs for proteins consisting of two or more subunits when activity requires all subunits folded together. In addition, the in vitro assay has to be very sensitive. The advantage of expression cloning occurs when the protein of interest consists of only one polypeptide and can be assayed with high specificity and sensitivity. Then the expression cloning approach can be applied with high efficiency. This approach allows isolation of cDNA for completely uncharacterized proteins because only an in vitro assay needs to be developed. Another advantage is that only the cDNA encoding a functional protein is cloned, and this eliminates some laborious procedures arising on application of conventional methods. The cDNAs for the majority of uncharacterized luciferases and photoproteins, especially those derived from rare organisms, may be good candidates for applying the expression cloning approach. Expression in E. coli and Purification of Metridia Luciferase—SDS-PAGE analysis of the induced E. coli BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL cells harboring the pET22-MLuc plasmid reveals an additional protein band with a molecular mass (22.0 kDa) approximately corresponding to that predicted for Metridia luciferase (Fig. 3). Crude cell lysate obtained from induced cells reveals only weak activity with coelenterazine in comparison with the total amount of recombinant protein in these cells. Evidently, most of the synthesized protein is accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies. For purification of luciferase the cell paste was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (1:5, w/v) and disrupted with ultrasound (20 s × 6) at 0 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed sequentially with 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. All the washing procedures were performed with centrifugation at 4 °C. According to measurements of luminescent activity, the total loss of MLuc during the washing steps was no more than 3%. The final pellet was resuspended in 6 m urea for 5 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged. The 6 m urea extract contained most of the total luminescence activity, 70–75%. The 6 m urea extract was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated previously with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer) (Fig. 3). During this chromatography step the folding of luciferase takes place simultaneously with protein separation. The bioluminescent spectrum from the reaction catalyzed with high purity MLuc has a maximum at 485 nm that is in good agreement with that observed for native luciferase (λmax = 480 nm) (Fig. 1). This clearly indicates that Metridia luciferase can be correctly folded from the denatured state. Expression of MLuc and FL in CHO Cells—Stable CHO cell lines expressing MLuc and FL were constructed to compare the secreted and non-secreted reporters. Cells were transfected with pcDNA-MLuc, pASM-MLuc, or pcDNA3 (without insert), respectively. No differences in cell morphology or cell growth between cells transfected with these plasmids or in comparison with untransfected cells were observed. This result clearly shows that Metridia luciferase is non-toxic for mammalian cells. During cell growth, MLuc and FL activities were measured both in cell lysates and in the medium. The cells expressing FL showed activity with the corresponding firefly luciferin only in the cell lysates. The cells expressing MLuc showed luciferase activity with coelenterazine both in the cell lysate and in the medium. The transfected cells secreted luciferase continuously, and it accumulated in the medium. To determine the time course of the secretion the medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added at the beginning of the time course experiment. The MLuc luciferase activity can be detected within 1 h after the medium is changed (Fig. 4). The CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 without cDNA inserts displayed no luciferase activity with either substrate. These results evidently indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes secreted luciferase. Monitoring of Activity of A2a and NPY2 G-protein-coupled Receptors with MLuc as a Reporter—G-protein-coupled receptors constitute a superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning proteins that respond to a diverse array of sensory and chemical stimuli (37Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 317-331Google Scholar). Over the past 15 years, nearly 350 therapeutic agents targeting seven transmembrane receptors have been successfully introduced for medical treatment. To identify compounds that modify the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors, it may be necessary to use ultrahigh throughput screening technologies to screen chemical libraries. The secreted Metridia luciferase has very good prospects for development of ultrahigh throughput screening protocols. Fig. 5 demonstrates the capability of this novel luciferase for monitoring expression of genes encoding the A2a and NPY2 receptors belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptors superfamily. The receptor A2a is a Gs-coupled receptor that increases the intracellular cAMP concentration through activation of adenylate cyclase. The receptor NPY2 is a GI-coupled receptor that decreases the intracellular cAMP concentration through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The plasmids pcDNA3-A2a and pcDNA3-NPY2 were transiently transfected into stable CHO cells expressing MLuc under the control of a cAMP-sensitive promoter. After 24 h of cell growth the genes encoding receptors were activated with the corresponding agonist for 4 h, and MLuc activity was measured in the culture medium (Fig. 5). The medium of the A2a receptor-expressing cells stimulated by agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxaminoadenosine reveals a high MLuc bioluminescent response. The medium of the A2a receptor-expressing cells that were not stimulated with agonist shows a very low level of bioluminescence similar to that observed for the medium from cells transfected with the pcDNA3 control plasmid. The MLuc activity determined in the medium of the NPY2 receptor-expressing cells prestimulated with forskolin is obviously lower than for the medium of the cells stimulated by neuropeptide Y. The activation of the NPY2 receptor results in a 90% decrease of the MLuc bioluminescence. Monitoring transcription activity provides important information about cell function. The application of secreted bioluminescent reporters is a powerful tool for this monitoring because it allows display of gene expression extracellularly without destroying the cells or tissues. Naturally occurring secreted luciferases are very suitable for this purpose, and this idea stimulates investigation of new bioluminescent systems. To date the cDNAs encoding several secreted luciferases have been cloned (23Thompson E.M. Nagata S. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6567-6571Google Scholar, 24Inouye S. Watanabe K. Nakamura H. Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 19-25Google Scholar). Vargula luciferase has been expressed in mammalian cells and has shown promising properties as a reporter enzyme (25Thompson E.M. Nagata S. Tsuji F.I. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 257-262Google Scholar, 26Inouye S. Ohmiya Y. Toya Y. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9584-9587Google Scholar, 27Thompson E.M. Adenot P. Tsuji F.I. Renard J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1317-1321Google Scholar, 28Tanahashi Y. Ohmiya Y. Honma S. Katsuno Y. Ohta H. Nakamura H. Honma K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 260-266Google Scholar). However, its large size (62.2 kDa) probably limits the value of Vargula luciferase as a reporter. Another secreted luciferase tested as a reporter is from the deep sea shrimp O. gracilorostris (24Inouye S. Watanabe K. Nakamura H. Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 19-25Google Scholar). This luciferase is a complex composed of 35- and 19-kDa proteins, and only the smaller one catalyzes the luminescent oxidation of coelenterazine. The cDNA encoding the 19-kDa protein was expressed in COS7 cells, and although the sequence included a natural putative signal for secretion at the N terminus, the culture medium showed very little luminescent activity. The luciferase isolated from the marine copepod G. princeps also possesses a naturally occurring putative signal for secretion, but there are no studies of it as a reporter in mammalian cells. The cloned secreted Metridia luciferase possesses very promising properties as a reporter because the bioluminescent reaction catalyzed by this luciferase is (a) simple, involving only coelenterazine and molecular oxygen, and (b) highly specific in the sense that coelenterazine does not cross-react with any other mammalian proteins to produce background luminescence. Additionally, the assay is very sensitive because light can be detected with high sensitivity by modern devices. The low molecular mass of Metridia luciferase (23.9 kDa), 2.5 times less than for Vargula luciferase, for example, is also an advantage. Altogether, these properties clearly suggest that Metridia luciferase may find wide application both for biomedical studies and in particular for the development of novel ultrahigh throughput screening technologies.

https://openalex.org/W1966050211,"Reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, have been recognized as intracellular messengers involved in several cell functions. Here we report the activation of the tyrosine kinase pp60src by H2O2, a mechanism required for the activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE) in human platelets. Treatment of platelets with H2O2 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent activation of pp60src. Incubation with GF 109203X, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, prevented H2O2-induced pp60src activation. In contrast, dimethyl-BAPTA loading did not affect this response, suggesting that activation of pp60src by H2O2 is independent of increases in [Ca2+]i. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, significantly reduced H2O2-induced pp60src activation. We found that platelet stimulation with thapsigargin (TG) plus ionomycin (Iono) or thrombin induced rapid H2O2 production, a mechanism independent of elevations in [Ca2+]i. Treatment of platelets with catalase attenuated TG plus Iono- and thrombin-induced activation of pp60src. In addition, catalase as well as the pp60src inhibitor, PP1, reduced both the activation of SMCE and the coupling between the hTrp1 and the IP3R type II without having any effect on the maintenance of SMCE. Consistent with the role of PKC in the activation of pp60src by H2O2, the PKC inhibitors GF 109202X and Ro-31-8220 were found to reduced SMCE in platelets. This study suggests that platelet activation with TG plus Iono or thrombin is associated with H2O2 production, which acts as a second messenger by stimulating pp60src by a PKC-dependent pathway and is involved in the activation of SMCE in these cells.

Stimulation of platelets and other non-excitable cells with agonists results in an increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which consists of two components: Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels (1.Rink T.J.

In human platelets we have recently provided evidence of coupling between the type II IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum and hTRP1 channels in the plasma membrane, stimulated by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores and reversed by their refilling (9.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have reported the involvement of several proteins in the secretion-like coupling-mediated Ca2+ entry in platelets and other non-excitable cells, including Ras proteins and tyrosine kinases, such as the cytoplasmic protein pp60src (6.Redondo P.C. Lajas A.I. Salido G.M. González A. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10.Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem.

It is well known that platelet activation results in a dramatic increase in tyrosine kinase activity. Especially important is the activation of proteins of the Src family, which are highly expressed in human platelets (12.Golden A. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for these kinases in response to stimulation events. A role for pp60src in the activation of SMCE has been proposed on the basis of the reduction of SMCE observed in transgenic mice with no expression of this protein (13.Babnigg G. Bowersox S.R. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29434-29437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the correlation between store depletion and pp60src activation, as well as the effect of pp60src inhibitors, such as PP1 (6.Redondo P.C.

J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, store depletion induces pp60src translocation to the newly polymerized actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation in different cell types (6.Redondo P.C. Lajas A.I. Salido G.M. González A. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10.Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a process that has been shown to be important for interaction with its possible substrates (14.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2, have recently been presented as intracellular messengers required for the activation of a large number of signal transduction mechanisms, especially those mediated by tyrosine kinases (15.Yada T. Shimokawa H. Hiramatsu O. Kajita T. Shigeto F. Goto M. Ogasawara Y. Kajiya F. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16.Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Ronks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In this context, a large number of physiological agonists have been reported to stimulate H2O2 production in several cell types (17.Kimura T. Okajima F. Sho K. Kobayashi I. Kondo Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18.Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), including human platelets (19.Pignatelli P. Pulcinelli F.M. Lenti L. Gazzaniga P.P. Violi F. Blood. 1998; 91: 484-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Seno T. Inoue N. Gao D. Okuda M. Sumi Y. Matsui K. Yamada S. Hirata K. Kawashima S. Tawa R. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Sakurai H. Yokoyama M. Thromb. Res. 2001; 103: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ROS stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation by the activation of several kinases, such as proteins of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, JAK, and proteins of the Src family (21.Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 22.Abe J.I. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); however, the nature of the mechanism involved in this process remains unknown. We report here that depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by TG plus Iono or platelet activation with thrombin results in H2O2 production. This mechanism is responsible for the activation of pp60src by a PKC-dependent pathway, which is independent of rises in [Ca2+]i. H2O2 production and subsequent pp60src activation are required for agonist- and store depletion-induced activation of SMCE but not for its maintenance in human platelets. Animals and Materials—Adult male Swiss mice were obtained from the Animal Farm, Faculty of Veterinary, UEX, Spain. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM), 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) and calcein AM were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Apyrase (grade VII), aspirin, bovine serum albumin, thrombin, HISTOPAQUE-1119, HISTOPAQUE-1077, dimethyl bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N, N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA) acetoxymethyl ester, catalase, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, benzamidine, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, thapsigargin (TG) and ionomycin (Iono) were from Sigma. Collagenase CLSPA was obtained from Worthington Biochemicals. GF 109203X, Ro-31-8220, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB), mannitol, trolox and cytochalasin D (Cyt D) were from Calbiochem (Madrid, Spain). 4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP1) was from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK). Anti-phospho-c-Src (Tyr416) antibody, anti-IP3R type II polyclonal antibody (C-20), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hTrp1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Protein A-agarose was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Madrid, Spain). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Pierce (Cheshire, UK). All other reagents were purchased from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). Inactive catalase was denatured by treatment with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole as previously described (23.Díaz A. Rangel P. Montes de Oca Y. Lledías F. Hansberg W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Platelet Preparation—Fura-2-loaded platelets were prepared as described previously (8.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and mixed with one-sixth volume of acid/citrate dextrose anticoagulant containing (in mm): 85 sodium citrate, 78 citric acid, and 111 d-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) added. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min. For loading with dimethyl BAPTA, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm dimethyl BAPTA AM. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, pH 7.45 and supplemented with 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Cell viability was assessed using calcein and trypan blue. For calcein loading, cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm calcein-AM at 37 °C, centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh HBS. Fluorescence was recorded from 2 ml aliquots using a Shimadzu Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Samples were excited at 494 nm and the resulting fluorescence was measured at 535 nm. After treatment for 5 min with 10 μm H2O2 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh HBS. The calcein fluorescence remaining in the cells was the same as in control, suggesting that under our conditions there was no cellular damage. The results obtained with calcein were confirmed using the trypan blue exclusion technique. 95% of cells were viable after treatment with 10 μm H2O2, similar to that observed in our resting platelet suspensions, at least during the performance of the experiments. Treatment with catalase had no effect on cell viability. Preparation of Isolated Pancreatic Acinar Cells and Leukocyte Separation—Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the pancreas was rapidly removed and the acinar cells were isolated as described previously (6.Redondo P.C. Lajas A.I. Salido G.M. González A. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreas was incubated in the presence of collagenase for 5–10 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. The enzymatic digestion of the tissue was followed by gently pipetting the cell suspension through tips of decreasing diameter for mechanical dissociation of the acinar cells. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in HBS supplemented with 1% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor, 1% (v/v) vitamin mixture, and 1% (v/v) amino acid mixture. In experiments performed in Ca2+-free medium cells were resuspended in HBS containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 and 500 μm EGTA was added at the time of experiment. Peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained by gradient density centrifugation using HISTOPAQUE-1119 and -1077 Medium (63.Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 9-29PubMed Google Scholar) and cells were then resuspended in HBS. Cell viability, monitored with trypan blue, was always greater than 95%, and this was not significantly reduced by drugs at least for the duration of these experiments. Intracellular ROS Production through the Oxidation of CM-H2DCFDA—CM-H2DCFDA is a ROS-sensitive probe that can be used to detect ROS production in living cells. It passively diffuses into cells, where its acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases, releasing the corresponding dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative. CM-H2DCFDA oxidation yields a fluorescent adduct, dichlorofluorescein (DCF) that is trapped inside the cell (24.Zhang Y. Han H. Wang J. Wang H. Yang B. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10417-10426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA acetyl ester for 30 min, then centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in fresh HBS. Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots using a Shimadzu Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Samples were excited at 488 nm, and the resulting fluorescence was measured at 530 nm. ROS production after treatment of cells with different agents was quantified as the integral of the rise in DCF fluorescence for 5 min after the addition of the agent. Immunoprecipitation—500-μl aliquots of platelet suspension (2 × 109 cell/ml) were lysed with an equal volume of lysis buffer, pH 7.2, containing 316 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% SDS, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm benzamidine. Aliquots (1 ml) were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 μg of anti-hTrp1 polyclonal antibody and protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described in the next section. Western Blotting—Platelet stimulation was terminated by mixing with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli's buffer (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) with 10% dithiothreitol followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. One-dimensional SDS electrophoresis was performed with 10% SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred, for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2, in a semidry blotter (Hoefer Scientific, Newcastle, Staffs, UK) onto nitrocellulose for subsequent probing. Blots were incubated overnight with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) to block residual protein binding sites. Blocked membranes were then incubated with the anti-phospho-c-Src (Tyr416) antibody diluted 1:1500 in TBST for 1 h or with anti-hTrp1 antibody diluted 1:200 in TBST or anti-IP3RII diluted 1:500 in TBST for 3 h. The primary antibody was removed and blots washed six times for 5 min each with TBST. To detect the primary antibody, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody, diluted 1:10000 in TBST, washed six times in TBST, and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 1 min. Blots were then exposed to photographic films and the optical density was estimated using scanning densitometry. Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]i)— Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred cell suspensions (108 cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 505 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (26.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry in TG plus Iono- or thrombin-treated cells was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after addition of CaCl2 (8.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TG plus Iono- and thrombin-induced Ca2+ release were estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 5 min after its addition. Measurement of F-actin Content—The F-actin content of resting and activated platelets was determined according to a previously published procedure (10.Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed platelets (2 × 108 cells/ml) were activated in HEPES-buffered saline. Samples of platelet suspension (200 μl) were transferred to 200 μl of ice-cold 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. Fixed platelets were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.025% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 detergent dissolved in PBS. Platelets were then incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (1 μm) in PBS supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation the platelets were collected by centrifugation for 60 s at 3000 × g and resuspended in PBS. Staining of 2 × 107 cells/ml was measured using a Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. Samples were excited at 496 nm and emission was at 516 nm. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Dunnett test was used. Kinetics and Concentration Dependence of the Ability of Hydrogen Peroxide to Activate pp60src in Human Platelets— pp60src activation was analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Src (Tyr416) antibody, which only detects pp60src phosphorylated at Tyr416, a process indicative of pp60src activation (27.Osusky M. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25729-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets with 10 μm H2O2 caused rapid activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase pp60src. As shown in Fig. 1A, pp60src activation was detectable 1 min after treatment with H2O2 and reached a maximum within 2 min with an increase of 2.19 ± 0.15-fold and was maintained for 5 min. At later exposure times pp60src activation decreased such that it was closer to basal values 10 min after H2O2 addition (Fig. 1A, n = 4). In addition, the effect of H2O2 on pp60src activation was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B). After treatment of platelets for 5 min with H2O2 a detectable increase in pp60src activity was observed at 1 μm, the effect was half maximal at 1.98 μm and maximal at 100 μm (Fig. 1B, n = 5). Intracellular Mechanisms Involved in H2O2-induced Activation of pp60src—H2O2 has been shown to induce activation of PKC and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in different cell types, including platelets (18.Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19.Pignatelli P. Pulcinelli F.M. Lenti L. Gazzaniga P.P. Violi F.

To determine whether PKC activation might be involved in mediating H2O2-induced pp60src activation, we examined the effect of the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (31.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boisin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of human platelets with 5 μm GF 109203X for 30 min did not significantly modify basal pp60src activity (data not shown), but abolished pp60src activation induced by 10 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2; p < 0.01; n = 5). To examine the effect of changes in [Ca2+]i on H2O2-evoked pp60src activation human platelets were loaded with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator dimethyl BAPTA. Dimethyl BAPTA loading prevented the elevations in [Ca2+]i induced by 0.5 units/ml thrombin (data not shown); however, BAPTA loading did not modify either basal pp60src activity (no shown) or H2O2-induced activation (Fig, 2), suggesting that this phenomenon is independent of increases in [Ca2+]i. Consistent with the above, the combination of dimethyl BAPTA loading and treatment with GF 109203X had similar effects to GF 109203X alone (Fig. 2) Effect of Cytochalasin D on H2O2-evoked pp60src Activation—Recent studies have reported that proteins of the Src family of tyrosine kinases associate with the actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation, an event that is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of their substrates (14.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32.Bertagnolli M.E. Hudson L.A. Stetsenko G.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous studies in platelets have shown that pp60src association with the actin cytoskeleton depends on actin filament polymerization (10.Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets for 5 min at 37 °C with 10 μm H2O2 increases the actin filament content by 7% (n = 10). To investigate whether actin polymerization is required for pp60src activation by H2O2 we tested the effect of Cyt D, a widely utilized membrane-permeant inhibitor of actin polymerization, which binds to the barbed end of actin filaments (33.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of platelets for 40 min with 10 μm Cyt D, conditions that abolish actin polymerization in platelets (34.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited H2O2-induced pp60src activation by 85% (p < 0.01; n = 6), which confirms previous studies suggesting that association with the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the activity of pp60src (6.Redondo P.C. Lajas A.I. Salido G.M. González A. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35.Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

ROS Generation Induced by Thrombin or Store Depletion by TG + Iono—The amount of intracellular ROS was estimated using CM-H2DCFDA, which is sensitive to H2O2 generation (24.Zhang Y. Han H. Wang J. Wang H. Yang B. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10417-10426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of human platelets with 0.5 units/ml thrombin resulted in a rapid increase in the DCF fluorescence, reaching a maximum after 2 min of treatment. To investigate whether Ca2+ release through the IP3 receptors is necessary for H2O2 production by thrombin we examined the effect of 2-APB, a functional antagonist of IP3 receptors that has been shown to inhibit thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in platelets (36.Diver J.M. Sage S.O. Rosado J.A. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets with 2-APB (100 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C reduced thrombin-induced H2O2 production. In cells treated with 2-APB, thrombin-evoked increases in DCF fluorescence was reduced by 16.1 ± 3.8% (p < 0.05; n = 5). These findings suggest that Ca2+ release by thrombin might be involved in H2O2 production. As with thrombin, depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by treatment with 1 μm TG, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase of internal stores (SERCA) (37.Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Sugimura T. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) plus a low concentration of Iono (50 nm, needed for extensive depletion of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pools in platelets where two stores, with high and low Ca2+ leakage rates, have been reported; Ref. 38.Doni M.G. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) increased DCF fluorescence (Fig. 4A). The effect of the amount of ROS generated by thrombin or TG + Iono on the DCF fluorescence was similar to that induced by 100 μm of H2O2, which is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that physiologically relevant H2O2 concentrations are around 5–200 μm (39.Atmane N. Dairou J. Paul A. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35086-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of human platelets for 10 min at 37 °C with 300 or 1000 units/ml catalase prevented any increase in the DCF fluorescence induced by the addition of 1 mm H2O2 and inhibited both thrombin- and TG + Iono-induced H2O2 generation (Fig. 4B). In order to investigate whether elevations in [Ca2+]i mediated by platelet treatment with TG + Iono or thrombin are required for the increase in DCF fluorescence we loaded platelets with dimethyl BAPTA. Dimethyl BAPTA loading prevented both TG + Iono and thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i elevations in a Ca2+-free medium (data not shown) but it did not significantly affect TG + Iono- or thrombin-evoked increases in DCF fluorescence (92.1 ± 18.4 and 112.6 ± 20.3% of control, respectively), suggesting that [Ca2+]i elevation is not necessary for thrombin- and TG + Iono-induced H2O2 producti"
https://openalex.org/W2022765542,"Survivin is a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis gene family that has been implicated in cell division and suppression of apoptosis. Here, we show that preferential ablation of the nuclear pool of survivin by RNA interference produces a mitotic arrest followed by re-entry into the cell cycle and polyploidy. Survivin ablation causes multiple centrosomal defects, aberrant multipolar spindle formation, and chromatin missegregation, and these phenotypes are exacerbated by loss of the cell cycle regulator, p21Waf1/Cip1 in p21-/- cells. The mitotic checkpoint activated by loss of survivin is mediated by induction of p53 and associated with increased expression of its downstream target, p21Waf1/Cip1. Accordingly, p53-/- cells exhibit reduced mitotic arrest and enhanced polyploidy upon survivin ablation as compared with their p53+/+ counterparts. Partial reduction of the cytosolic pool of survivin by RNA interference sensitizes cells to ultraviolet B-mediated apoptosis and results in enhanced caspase-9 proteolytic cleavage, whereas complete ablation of cytosolic survivin causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and spontaneous apoptosis. These data demonstrate that survivin has separable checkpoint functions at multiple phases of mitosis and in the control of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.

Partial reduction of the cytosolic pool of survivin by RNA interference sensitizes cells to ultraviolet B-mediated apoptosis and results in enhanced caspase-9 proteolytic cleavage, whereas complete ablation of cytosolic survivin causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and spontaneous apoptosis. These data demonstrate that survivin has separable checkpoint functions at multiple phases of mitosis and in the control of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is essential for embryonic development and the homeostasis of adult organisms (1.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). This involves a dynamic coupling of apoptotic pathways to checkpoint mechanisms that survey cell cycle transitions and eliminate potentially dangerous cells before they progress through mitosis (2.Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2747) Google Scholar). Molecules functioning at the checkpoint interface between cell proliferation and cell survival, such as p53 (3.McDonald 3rd, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), are essential to preserve genomic integrity, and their deregulation is a hallmark of cancer (4.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). Survivin is a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double strand RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; UVB, ultraviolet B; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Cdk2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2. gene family (5.Salvesen G.S.

Fearon E.R. Altieri D.C. Lancet. 2003; 362: 205-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and frequently heralds unfavorable disease outcome (10.Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Although the function of survivin has been dubbed as controversial in the past (11.Silke J. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1821-1827PubMed Google Scholar), available published evidence has shown remarkable agreement in assigning a dual role of this protein in mitotic control and inhibition of apoptosis. As early as 1998, studies of antisense inhibition of survivin provided clear evidence for separate defects in mitotic progression and cell death (12.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Sirugo G. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11177-11182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), an observation independently confirmed by several groups using different gene targeting strategies and validated in transgenic animals, in vivo (10.Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of information accumulated on survivin, precisely how this pathway couples to the cell death and cell division machineries has not been completely elucidated. Structural data and analysis of caspase catalytic activity indicate that the cytoprotective function of survivin may not conform to the paradigm of other IAP family proteins as endogenous caspase inhibitors (13.Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Similarly, a proposed evolutionary conserved role of survivin in late stage mitosis, or cytokinesis (14.Uren A.G. Wong L. Pakusch M. Fowler K.J. Burrows F.J. Vaux D.L. Choo K.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1319-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 15.Fraser A.G. James C. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), has been contrasted by data suggesting a broader role at cell division, involving centrosome function (16.Jiang X. Wilford C. Duensing S. Munger K. Jones G. Jones D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), spindle checkpoint (17.Giodini A. Kallio M. Wall N.R. Gorbsky G.J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Symons M. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar), and microtubule dynamics (17.Giodini A. Kallio M. Wall N.R. Gorbsky G.J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Symons M. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar). Adding further complexity, survivin has been shown to exist in immunochemically distinct subcellular pools that may exert different cellular functions (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar), and two alternatively spliced survivin isoforms have been described (19.Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to position more accurately the survivin pathway in mitotic control and cell death, we have now taken an RNA interference (RNAi) approach (20.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) to acutely knock down survivin expression in genetically defined tumor cell types. We obtained clear evidence that survivin is embedded in a p53-dependent mitotic checkpoint (3.McDonald 3rd, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that affects multiple phases of mitosis and directly couples to upstream events in mitochondrial-dependent cell death. dsRNA Design—Two different dsRNA were identified in the survivin mRNA to selectively target exon 1 (GGACCACCGCAUCUCUACA, sequence S1) or exon 3 (GAGCCAAGAACAAAAUUGC, sequence S4). The S1 and S4 dsRNA oligonucleotides as well as a control dsRNA sequence (VIII) were purchased from Dharmacon. The S1 sequence is identical to the dsRNA oligonucleotide recently reported by Carvalho et al. (21.Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—Cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 p21+/+ or p21-/- or p53+/+ or p53-/- were the kind gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University) and were maintained in culture in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37°C. For Western blotting or flow cytometry experiments, HeLa or HCT-116 cells were seeded in complete medium in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected after 24 h with the various dsRNA sequences (50 nm final concentration) using Oligofectamine (3 μl/well) reagent in 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium (both from Invitrogen). 4 h after transfection, 500 μl of DMEM or McCoy's medium containing 30% FCS, 300 units/ml penicillin, and 300 μg/ml streptomycin were added to each well. For double transfection experiments, HeLa cells were loaded twice with the dsRNA at 48-h intervals between each transfection, and analyzed for survivin expression by Western blotting and induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were seeded on gelatin-coated coverslips (Sigma and Fisher Scientific, respectively) in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. Cells were transfected after 2 days using Oligofectamine (0.75 μl/well) in Opti-MEM (250 μl). 4 h after transfection, 125 μl of DMEM or McCoy's medium containing 30% FCS, 300 units/ml penicillin, and 300 μg/ml streptomycin was added to each well. For co-sedimentation experiments, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with control GFP or GFP-survivin (pEGFP, Clontech) cDNAs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as previously described (22.Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Western Blot and Subcellular Fractionation—Cells transfected with the various dsRNA sequences were collected, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and washed in PBS, pH 7.2. The cell pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing proteases inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min, and protein concentration was evaluated using BCA assay (Pierce). Samples (20 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and incubated with the following primary antibodies to survivin (Novus Biologicals), XIAP (BD Transduction Laboratories), β-actin (Sigma), caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology), Bcl-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), p53 (Oncogene Research Products), p21 (Oncogene), GFP (Clontech), or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, Sigma). Binding of the primary antibodies was determined by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular fractionation experiments with isolation of individual nuclear or cytosolic fractions (20 μg) in RNAi-treated cultures were carried and characterized as described previously (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed for changes in survivin expression by Western blotting. Survivin-Microtubule Interaction—Co-sedimentation experiments were carried out as described previously (23.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated HeLa cells or HeLa cells transiently transfected with control GFP or GFP-survivin cDNAs were suspended in MES buffer (0.1 m MES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.6) and lysed by multiple strokes through a 27-gauge needle. The extract was precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was further spun at 164,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting cytosolic fraction was dialyzed in MES buffer for 3 h at 4 °C, and aliquots of the extract (200 μl at 4 mg/ml) were used for microtubule assembly studies. Microtubules were polymerized in vitro in taxol-free MES buffer by four sequential cycles of polymerization for 30 min at 37 °C and depolymerization for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were loaded on a 10% sucrose cushion in MES buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 30 °C. Supernatants (50% of the incubation reaction) and pellets (polymerized microtubules) were analyzed for the presence of co-associated survivin by Western blotting. Samples obtained from non-polymerized microtubules were loaded as negative controls. Analysis of Apoptosis, Cell Cycle, and Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization—Changes in apoptosis and cell cycle progression following interference with survivin expression were assessed by DNA content evaluation by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as previously described (22.Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The peaks associated with apoptotic (hypodiploid, sub-G1), G2/M (4N), and multinucleated (>4N) cells were quantified using cell cycle data analysis software (FlowJo). For enhancement of apoptosis-inducing stimuli by survivin knockdown, HeLa cells were transfected with VIII or S4 dsRNA sequences, incubated for 36 h, and exposed to UVB irradiation at 100 J/m2. After an additional 16 h culture at 37 °C, HeLa cells were stained with a fluorescein-conjugated caspase inhibitor (carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone) and propidium iodide (CaspaTag, Intergen) for simultaneous detection of caspase activity and loss of plasma membrane integrity. The dot blots under the various conditions tested were analyzed using FlowJo flow cytometry software. In separate experiments, HeLa cells transfected with VIII and S4 dsRNA sequences and exposed to UVB were analyzed for proteolytic processing of caspase-9, by Western blotting. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in RNAi-transfected HeLa cells were monitored using the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye JC-1 and flow cytometry. Briefly, HeLa cells were doubly transfected with control VIII or survivin-specific S4 dsRNA sequences, harvested after 24 h, and incubated for 10 min in the dark with JC-1 (10 μg/ml in PBS, Molecular Probes). After washes in PBS, pH 7.2, samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to monitor decreases in the red/green (Fl-2/Fl-1) fluorescence ratio (index of mitochondrial membrane depolarization). Cultures treated with staurosporine (3 μm, Sigma) for 24 h and stained with JC-1 served as positive control for these experiments. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa or HCT-116 cells grown on gelatin-coated coverslips were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% triton in PBS) for 20 min and permeabilized in cold (-20 °C) methanol for 10 min. Cells were incubated for 10 min in PBS/glycine 20 mm and for 20 min in PBS/BSA 3% and further incubated with an antibody to β-tubulin (Sigma) for microtubule staining or an antibody to γ-tubulin (Sigma) for centrosomal staining. For localization of survivin to different aspects of the mitotic apparatus, HeLa cells were fixed in microtubule-stabilizing buffer as described in details in our previously published protocols (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were simultaneously incubated with a polyclonal antibody detecting the various subcellular pools of survivin (Novus) as described previously (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) and with an antibody to β-tubulin. After washes, binding of the primary antibodies was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red or rhodamine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.)-conjugated secondary antibodies of appropriate specificities. To reveal chromatin, following incubation with the secondary antibody, cells were washed twice in PBS, pH 7.2, and once in water, and stained for 5 min with DAPI (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml in water). Coverslips were then mounted on glass slides (Fisher) and observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (Olympus, IX71). Pictures were taken using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) connected to a PC-compatible computer through a camera. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the unpaired t test on a GraphPad software package for Windows (Prism). A p value of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Acute Ablation of Survivin by RNAi Induces Mitotic Arrest and Polyploidy—Preliminary experiments analyzed two survivin-derived dsRNA sequences for their ability to suppress survivin expression in model cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Transfection of HeLa cells with survivin-specific S1 or S4 dsRNA oligonucleotides resulted in reduction in survivin levels, by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1A). In contrast, expression of other anti-apoptotic regulators, XIAP or Bcl-2 was unaffected (Fig. 1A). Similarly, transfection of a control unrelated dsRNA sequence (VIII) did not reduce the expression of Bcl-2, XIAP or survivin in HeLa cells, by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). By 72 h after transfection, endogenous survivin levels had largely recovered in S1-transfected cultures, whereas transfection with the S4 sequence resulted in a more prominent and sustained suppression of survivin at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1A). Cell cycle analysis revealed that transfection of HeLa cells with the S4, but not the VIII sequence resulted in a significant increase in the G2/M fraction, suggestive of cell cycle arrest, and appearance of polyploid cells with >4N DNA content (Fig. 1, B and C), in agreement with recent observations (21.Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24.Lens S.M. Wolthuis R.M. Klompmaker R. Kauw J. Agami R. Brummelkamp T. Kops G. Medema R.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2934-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, S4-transfected cultures contained large, multinucleated cells, as compared with VIII-transfectants (54.4 ± 7.2% versus 1.1 ± 0.8%, n = 4) (Fig. 1D). Consistent with its reduced ability to affect survivin levels in whole extracts (Fig. 1A), the survivin S1 sequence (21.Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) produced only a modest G2/M arrest, and negligible polyploidy (Fig. 1, B and C). Loss of Survivin Induces Multiple Mitotic Defects—The nature of the cell division defect induced by RNAi suppression of survivin was next investigated. Transfection of HeLa cells with the S4 sequence revealed a striking increase in the number of multipolar mitoses, as compared with VIII-transfected cultures (50 ± 7% versus 4 ± 7%, n = 4) (Fig. 2A). With respect to the kinetics of appearance of multipolar spindle defects and multinucleation, 45% of S4-treated HeLa cells exhibited spindle defects as opposed to 20% of the population with multiple nuclei 36 h after transfection. By 48 h, the number of multinucleated cells had increased to 54%, whereas the percentage of cells with multipolar spindles increased only slightly (50%). In addition, HeLa cell transfection with S4 resulted in profound defects in chromosome congression (Fig. 2A), with cell cycle arrest at prometaphase and reduction/loss of all subsequent mitotic phases, whereas VIII-transfected cultures had normal distribution of mitotic phases, by fluorescence microscopy (not shown). The potential effect of RNAi targeting of survivin on centrosome number/organization (16.Jiang X. Wilford C. Duensing S. Munger K. Jones G. Jones D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22.Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) was next investigated. By immunofluorescence staining with an antibody to centrosome-associated γ-tubulin, suppression of survivin by the S4 sequence resulted in a host of centrosomal defects, including appearance of supernumerary centrosomes, aberrantly small centrosomes and centrosomal fragments (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, no centrosomal defects were observed in cells transfected with the VIII sequence, by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, B and C). Centrosome duplication is coordinated by a kinase cascade contributed by Cdk2-cyclin E (25.Tarapore P. Horn H.F. Tokuyama Y. Fukasawa K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3173-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of homozygous deletion of the cyclin-dependent kinase antagonist and p53 transcriptional target, p21Waf1/Cip1, on centrosomal deregulation induced by RNAi suppression of survivin. Transfection of HCT-116 p21+/+ or p21-/- cells with the S4 sequence suppressed endogenous survivin levels, as compared with control VIII sequence, by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Transfection of p21+/+ or p21-/- cells with the VIII sequence did not affect mitotic spindle formation, and metaphase cells exhibited normal, bipolar mitotic spindles with full complement of microtubules and proper chromosome alignment, by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, transfection of the S4 sequence in p21-/- cells severely exacerbated the multiple cell division defects associated with survivin loss and resulted in the appearance of shortened, flattened spindles severely depleted of microtubules, monopolar, and multipolar spindles (Fig. 3, C and D), and abnormalities of chromosome congression, by DAPI staining (Fig. 3C). Coupling of the Survivin Mitotic Checkpoint to p53—Because loss of the p53 transcriptional target, p21, exaggerated the mitotic defects associated with survivin suppression, we next tested a potential link between survivin and p53. Transfection of p53+/+ or p53-/- HCT-116 cells with survivin dsRNA sequences, but not the control VIII sequence, resulted in a partial (S1) or complete (S4) ablation of survivin expression, by Western blotting of whole cell extracts (not shown). Under these experimental conditions, RNAi targeting of survivin resulted in time-dependent increased expression of p53 by Western blotting, compared with VIII-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Double transfection of HCT-116 cells with S1 or S4 sequences at a 48-h interval resulted in maximal p53 induction (Fig. 4A). Induction of p53 after partial (S1) or complete (S4) survivin ablation was associated with increased expression of its transcriptional target, p21Waf1/Cip1, by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). When analyzed for cell cycle defects, transfection of the S4 sequence in p53+/+ cells resulted in a sustained G2/M arrest and appearance of a small population with >4N DNA content (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the G2/M arrest induced by survivin ablation was lost in p53-/- cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, p53-/- cells continued to progress through mitosis despite the absence of survivin as revealed by the appearance of polyploid populations with >4N and >8N DNA content, as compared with S4-transfected p53+/+ cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1B, transfection of the S1 sequence was minimally effective at inducing G2/M arrest in p53+/+ HCT-116 cells (Fig. 4B). Survivin-Microtubule Interaction, in Vivo—The possibility that the p53-regulated mitotic checkpoint functions of survivin could reflect its direct association with the mitotic apparatus was next investigated. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes all the various subcellular pools of survivin (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) labeled metaphase spindle microtubules and prominently co-localized with β-tubulin, by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5A). The same antibody to survivin also simultaneously labeled the pool of survivin localized to kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 5A), in agreement with previous observations (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar). At anaphase, survivin was concentrated in the central spindle midzone (Fig. 5B) and accumulated in midbodies at telophase (Fig. 5C), consistent with the dynamic subcellular localization of immunochemically distinct survivin pools (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we revisited a potential association of survivin with microtubules, in vivo. In co-sedimentation experiments, endogenous survivin became strongly associated with microtubules assembled in vitro from HeLa cell extracts by sequential cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization/depolymerization and was entirely depleted from the supernatant of polymerized samples by Western blotting (Fig. 5D). In contrast, little if any survivin was found associated with non-polymerized microtubules (Fig. 5D), in agreement with previous observations (23.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). In addition, GFP-survivin transfected in HeLa cells also associated primarily with microtubules assembled by temperature-dependent polymerization, as compared with non-polymerized microtubules (Fig. 5E). Differential RNAi Targeting of Survivin Pools Influences Mitochondrial Cell Death—A differential ability of RNAi to affect the individual subcellular pools of survivin (18.Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) was next investigated. Transfection of HeLa cells with the S4 sequence resulted in nearly complete ablation of survivin in isolated nuclear fractions (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the S4 sequence only partially reduced by ∼40% the cytosolic pool of survivin, by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). To test whether a partial reduction in cytosolic survivin was sufficient to sensitize HeLa cells to apoptotic stimuli, we combined RNAi targeting of survivin with UVB irradiation. Exposure of VIII-transfected HeLa cells to UVB irradiation resulted in the appearance of caspase-3/7 catalytic activity and cell death, by multiparametric flow cytometry (Fig. 6B), and was associated with proteolytic cleavage of upstream caspase-9, by Western blotting (Fig. 6C). Under these experimental conditions, transfection of HeLa cells with the S4 sequence followed by UVB irradiation resulted in a 5-fold enhancement of caspase-dependent cell death in HeLa cells, from 7% to 36%, and a more modest (17%) increase in caspase-independent cell death (Fig. 6B). This was associated with enhanced caspase-9 cleavage and near disappearance of ∼46 kDa proform caspase-9 in S4-transfected HeLa cells exposed to UVB, as compared with UVB-irradiated control cultures (Fig. 6C). To more effectively ablate the cytosolic pool of survivin, successive RNAi transfection experiments were carried out. HeLa cells doubly transfected with the S4 sequence at 48-h intervals exhibited complete ablation of endogenous survivin levels, by Western blotting of whole cell extracts (Fig. 7A). When tested in isolated subcellular fractions, double transfection of the S4 sequence resulted in complete suppression of both cytosolic and nuclear survivin, by Western blotting (Fig. 7A). Under these experimental conditions, HeLa cells doubly transfected with the S4, but not the VIII sequence exhibited dramatic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as determined by JC-1 staining and multiparametric flow cytometry (Fig. 7B). In addition, HeLa cells doubly transfected with the S4 sequence exhibited an increase in spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of other cell death stimuli, as compared with control VIII-transfected cultures, b"

However, the precise role of PABP remains largely unknown in higher eukaryotes. Here we identified and characterized a human PABP-dependent poly(A) nuclease (hPAN) complex consisting of catalytic hPan2 and regulatory hPan3 subunits. hPan2 has intrinsically a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease activity and requires Mg2+ for the enzyme activity. On the other hand, hPan3 interacts with PABP to simulate hPan2 nuclease activity. Interestingly, the hPAN nuclease complex has a higher substrate specificity to poly(A) RNA upon its association with PABP. Consistent with the roles of hPan2 and hPan3 in mRNA decay, the two subunits exhibit cytoplasmic co-localization. Thus, the human PAN complex is a poly(A)-specific exoribonuclease that is stimulated by PABP in the cytoplasm.

Eukaryotic mRNAs have two major features, a 5′-terminal cap and a 3′-terminal poly(A) tail. Both of them play important roles in eukaryotic gene expression, especially in translation and mRNA decay processes. mRNAs are synergistically translated in the presence of both the 5′-cap and the 3′-poly(A) tail (1.Gallie D.R.

The removal of the poly(A) tail from mRNA leads to translation inhibition and is used as a strategy to silence certain maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. On the other hand, both the 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) tail are also involved in the regulation of mRNA decay (12.Jacobson A. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 451-480Google Scholar). The removal of the poly(A) tail is the first rate-limiting step in the degradation of most mRNAs (13.Decker C.J.

This step is followed by the removal of the 5′-cap and exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA body. Thus, deadenylation greatly affects gene expression in regard to abundance as well as the translation of mRNA. Many factors involved in mRNA decay have been identified. The 5′-cap is removed by decapping enzymes termed Dcps. Dcp1, Dcp2, and DcpS were identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans (16.Beelman C.A. Parker R.

On the other hand, the 3′-poly(A) tail is degraded by deadenylases, and the Ccr4/Pop2 and PAN nuclease (consisting of Pan2 and Pan3) were identified as the two major mRNA deadenylases in S. cerevisiae (23.Lowell J.E.

Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Yeast PAN nuclease is characterized by the requirement of Pab1, the yeast PABP, for its deadenylating activity. In addition, two other deadenylases in metazoans were reported, namely the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease PARN (28.Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29.Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 13: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PARN is the most extensively investigated deadenylase in higher eukaryotes and is related to the enzyme activity involved in default deadenylation during Xenopus oocyte meiotic maturation (31.Korner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The most prominent feature of PARN is that its deadenylating activity is stimulated by the 5′-cap on mRNA (32.Dehlin E. Wormington M. Korner C.G. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33.Gao M. Fritz D.T. Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Mol.

Nocturnin is a novel gene that is rhythmically expressed in the cytoplasm of retinal photoreceptor cells in a circadian clock-dependent manner (35.Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and is structurally related to the C-terminal deadenylase domain of Ccr4 (36.Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the orthologues of PARN and nocturnin are not present in S. cerevisiae. The roles of PABP in mRNA decay are enigmatic. Biochemical experiments showed that PABP can protect the poly(A) tail from degradation (37.Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 38.Wilusz C.J. Gao M. Jones C.L. Wilusz J. Peltz S.W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1416-1424PubMed Google Scholar) and that, in higher eukaryotes, PABP inhibits the deadenylating activity of PARN under physiological conditions (28.Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 31.Korner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). On the other hand, genetic approaches indicate that poly(A) tail shortening rates of mRNA are significantly reduced in S. cerevisiae strains lacking the Pab1 (39.Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 40.Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 41.Chekanova J.A. Shaw R.J. Belostotsky D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1207-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we cloned the full-length human Pan2 (hPan2) and Pan3 (hPan3) cDNAs from HeLa cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that hPan2 is a Mg2+-dependent exoribonuclease and that hPan3 interacts with both hPan2 and PABP simultaneously. The intrinsic deadenylating activity of hPan2 is stimulated by PABP in the presence of hPan3, and the hPAN complex has a higher substrate specificity to poly(A) RNA when it associates with PABP. hPan2 and hPan3 exhibit cytoplasmic co-localization, consistent with their role in mRNA decay. Plasmids—To express hPan2 in mammalian cells, the full-length hPan2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription PCR using total RNA from HeLa cells and inserted between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) to produce pFLAG-hPan2. pHA-hPan2, which contains an HA tag instead of FLAG, was also constructed. To express the deletion mutants of hPan2, cDNA fragments encoding the indicated amino acid sequences of hPan2 were inserted in pFLAG-CMV2 to construct pFLAG-hPan2 1-1028, 1-330, 311-1198, 311-1028, and 841-1198. pFLAG-hPan2 D1083A was generated by converting the corresponding GAC codon (Asp-1083) of pFLAG-hPan2 to GCC (alanine). To clone the full-length hPan3 cDNA, the 5′-end of XP170737 was amplified using the 5′-Full RACE core set (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) and the total RNA derived from HeLa cells. The obtained full-length hPan3 cDNA was inserted between the HindIII and PstI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 to construct pFLAG-hPan3; pHA-hPan3, which contains an HA tag instead of FLAG, was also constructed. pFLAG-hPan3ΔN contains the cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 291-688 of hPan3. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—COS-7 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—The transfected cells were lysed in buffer A consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA-sodium (pH 8), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin with 10 μg/ml boiled RNase A. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with anti-FLAG IgG agarose (Sigma), and then the resin was washed with buffer A. When necessary, recombinant proteins were added, and the resin was further incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. After washing with buffer A, proteins retained on the resin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum on a polylysine-coated cover glass. The transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After a 15-min quenching with 100 mm glycine, the fixed cells were incubated for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with an appropriate primary antibody for 1 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rat IgG) with or without Pico Green (Molecular Probe). After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Production of Recombinant Proteins—The purification of N-terminally GST-fused human PABP (PCBPC1) was described previously (42.Hoshino S. Imai M. Kobayashi T. Uchida N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16677-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant PABP was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h to the Escherichia coli JM109 culture. The cells were resuspended in buffer B consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. After incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme at 4 °C for 30 min, the cells were lysed by sonication for 3 min on ice, and the resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was subjected to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Nuclease Assay—The production of internally 32P-radiolabeled poly(A) RNA was described previously (26.Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A) RNA (23-mers) was extended using [α-32P]ATP and yeast poly(A) polymerase (USB Corp.). The probe was purified by gel filtration using S-400HR (Amersham Bioscience) and ethanol precipitation. For the production of 32P-5′-radiolabeled poly(A) RNA and poly(dA) DNA, the nonlabeled nucleotides (Amersham Bioscience) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.) and then purified by elution from polyacrylamide gel and ethanol precipitation. For the immunopurification of recombinant proteins, extracts prepared from COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged hPan2 with or without HA-tagged hPan3 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody in buffer A. After three washes with buffer A, the precipitated proteins were eluted with buffer C consisting of 10 mm HEPES-sodium (pH 7.5) and 2 mm MgCl2 with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptides (Sigma). The immunopurified proteins were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times in buffer C containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), and 1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled poly(A) RNA or poly(dA) DNA in the presence or absence of 1 mm spermidine. When necessary, recombinant GST-fused PABP at the indicated concentrations was added to the reactions with or without poly(A) or poly(C) RNA (Amersham Bioscience). The extent of nucleolysis was measured as follows. 1) Aliquots were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, and the radioactivity of soluble nucleotide was measured using a liquid scintillation counter as described previously (26.Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 43.Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 2) The liberated reaction product was analyzed by TLC on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose F plate (Merck, number 5579) using 0.75 m KH2PO4-H3PO4 (pH 3.5) as the solvent (34.Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Nilsson P. Ehrenberg M. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The positions of the unlabeled 5′-AMP and 3′-AMP (Sigma) were determined using UV light. 3) Aliquots were analyzed on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The radioactive molecules were visualized by autoradiography. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers—The sequence data of hPan2 and hPan3 have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ databases under accession numbers AB107584 and AB107585, respectively. Molecular Cloning of Human Pan2—To identify mammalian PAN nuclease, we first searched for the human homologue of the yeast Pan2 protein in nucleotide databases. The sequence of KIAA0710 in the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was used to design reverse transcription PCRs for isolating the full-length hPAN2 cDNA from HeLa cells. As schematized in Fig. 1A, the deduced hPan2 contains 1198 amino acids and shows sequence similarities to putative Pan2 homologues from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and S. cerevisiae (43.6, 25.2, and 23.3%, respectively). hPan2 contains RNase D motifs within its C-terminal 180-amino acid region, which is conserved among the RNase D family of 3′ to 5′ exoribonucleases (Fig. 1, A and B), and this domain shows the highest degree of conservation among several species (compared with human, 71.7, 44.2, and 48% similarity in the order of D. melanogaster, C. elegans and S. cerevisiae, respectively). The invariant amino acid residues common to the family members are all conserved in hPan2 (Fig. 1B). Identification of hPan2 as a Mg2+-dependent 3′ to 5′ Exoribonuclease—To examine whether hPan2 has nuclease activity, we measured the RNase activity of immunopurified hPan2 from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. The N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length hPan2 and its C-terminally deleted mutant, ΔC170, whose exoribonuclease domain was expected to have been damaged (Fig. 2A), were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitated beads were washed with NaCl at high concentrations, and the precipitated proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Fig. 2B). Because a previous study showed that spermidine enabled yeast PAN nuclease to degrade poly(A) RNA even in the absence of Pab1 (23.Lowell J.E. Rudner D.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2088-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), RNase activity of hPan2 was first measured in the presence of the polyamine. As indexed by the release of 32P-radioactivity from the internally 32P-radiolabeled poly(A) RNA, the full-length hPan2 was co-purified with RNase activity (Fig. 2C). In sharp contrast, ΔC170 had no significant RNase activity compared with the mock transfectant. To confirm that the observed RNase activity is derived from the immunopurified hPan2 rather than from a co-purifying unknown factor, we also prepared a hPan2 mutant in which a key conserved catalytic residue (Asp) in the RNase D domain had been replace by Ala (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2E, the single point mutation (D1083A) completely abolished the RNase activity of hPan2. We next analyzed ribonucleolytic products released by hPan2 by means of thin-layer chromatography analysis. Fig. 2F shows that 5′-AMP but not 3′-AMP was detected, consistent with the reported characteristics of members of the RNase D family. In addition, this family is also characterized by a requirement of Mg2+ for its activity (29.Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2G, RNase activity of hPan2 is completely inhibited in the presence of EDTA but not of EGTA, indicating that hPan2 is also a Mg2+-dependent RNase. Next, we analyzed the reaction mode of hPan2 using 5′-terminally 32P-radiolabeled poly(A) as a substrate. There was a progressive decrease in the length of the 5′-labeled poly(A) as the incubation time of the substrate with the full-length hPan2 was prolonged (Fig. 3A). However, such poly(A) shortening activity was not observed in ΔC170. Thus, hPan2 was suggested to be a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease as assumed from the characteristics of the RNase D family. Generally, the actions of exoribonucleases are classified as either processive or distributive in terms of their catalytic mode (44.Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To determine which mode is responsible for the hPan2 action, we performed an experiment in which a constant amount of poly(A) was incubated with varying amount of hPan2. As shown in Fig. 3B, the poly(A) RNA was more rapidly shortened from the 3′-end with increasing amounts of hPan2, suggesting that hPan2 is a distributive type of exoribonuclease. Under the present assay conditions, there was a non-degraded fraction (∼30%) in the 5′-labeled poly(A) substrate (see Fig. 3, A and B). This might be due to the 3′-end blocking of the RNA substrate. A previous study reported that some proportions of a commercially available poly(A) RNA are blocked at its 3′-end, which leads to resistance to a poly(A) nuclease (28.Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the poly(A) substrate used in this study was incubated with yeast poly(A) polymerase and ATP under conditions for unspecific polyadenylation. As a result, ∼35% of the poly(A) RNA was not elongated by the polyadenylation reaction (data not shown). Because the polymerase reaction requires 3′-OH group in the RNA substrate, this result indicates that a proportion of the poly(A) RNA used was blocked at its 3′-end. Thus, the resistance of the poly(A) substrate to hPAN is explainable by the 3′-end blocking of the RNA. Several RNases also exhibit DNase activity (44.Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether hPan2 is capable of acting on poly(dA) DNA. The 5′-terminally 32P-radiolabeled poly(dA) DNA was incubated with hPan2, and the reaction products were analyzed. However, poly(dA) DNA did not serve as the substrate of hPan2 (Fig. 3C). Cloning of Human Pan3—Next, we searched and identified the partial cDNA fragment (XP170737) of hPan3 in the expressed sequence tag data base. To clone the full-length hPAN3 cDNA, both 5′-RACE and reverse transcription PCR were performed. The deduced hPan3 contains 688 amino acids and shows sequence similarities to putative Pan3 homologues from D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae (43.4, 39.3, and 22.4%, respectively) as shown in Fig. 4. hPan3 contains a C-terminal region in the segment of amino acids 552-676, which is highly conserved among several species (64.8, 52.1, and 41.6% similarity in order of D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae relative to the human homologue). Interestingly, motif analysis by RPS-BLAST revealed the presence of a kinase domain, which is conserved between human and fly (51% sequence similarity) but not in worm and yeast, although the functional significance of this domain is not yet clear at present. Human PAN Complex Associates with PABP through Its hPan3 Subunit—To examine whether hPan2 and hPan3 form a complex similar to yeast PAN nuclease (25.Boeck R. Tarun Jr., S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Muller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26.Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), FLAG-tagged hPan2 and HA-tagged hPan3 were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, HA-hPan3 co-precipitated with FLAG-hPan2, and, at the same time, endogenous PABP was also detected in the precipitated fraction (lane 2). On the other hand, HA-hPan3 and PABP were not detected when COS-7 cells were mock transfected only with HA-hPan3 (lane 1). These results show that hPan2 and hPan3 form a complex, hPAN, and the hPAN complex also interacts with PABP. In addition, a comparative analysis of the deletion mutants of hPan2 revealed that FLAG-hPan2 mutants, which are capable of interacting with hPan3, also precipitate PABP (lanes 3-7). These results prompted us to hypothesize that hPan3 may function as a PABP-binding subunit for hPAN nuclease. To test this hypothesis, FLAG-tagged full-length hPan3 and its mutant lacking the N-terminal 290 amino acids (FLAG-hPan3ΔN) were co-expressed with HA-hPan2, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5B, FLAG-hPan3 co-precipitated with HA-hPan2 as well as PABP; however, FLAG-hPan3ΔN could interact with hPan2 but not with PABP. These results suggest that hPan3 interacts with hPan2 and PABP through its C- and N-terminal regions, respectively. That is, hPan3 is the PABP-binding subunit of hPAN nuclease. PABP Stimulates RNase Activity of hPAN2 in Its Associated Form with hPan3—To investigate whether the RNase activity of hPAN is stimulated by PABP, we prepared an hPAN complex consisting of hPan2 and hPan3. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-hPan2 and pHA-hPan3, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG IgG beads. To deplete the co-purified PABP, the precipitated beads were washed with 200 mm NaCl. This washing markedly attenuated the interaction between hPan3 and PABP without affecting the interaction between hPan2 and hPan3 (Fig. 5C). Thus, >80% of PABP could be removed from the immunopurified preparation as compared with that prepared without high salt wash. As shown in Fig. 6A, hPan3 was co-purified with hPan2 as a complex (hPAN complex). For comparison, we also used the nuclease-deficient ΔC170 mutant of hPan2, which was also co-purified with HA-hPan3 (ΔC170 complex). The RNase activities of the purified proteins were examined in the presence or absence of spermidine. Fig. 6B shows that the purified hPAN complex (lane 3) and hPan2 (lane 2) could degrade poly(A) RNA in the presence of spermidine, whereas the ΔC170 complex had no RNase activity (lane 4). However, in the absence of spermidine, none of the proteins exhibited any detectable RNase activity. Under the same assay conditions, the effect of PABP on RNase activity was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6C, the recombinant GST-fused PABP prepared from E. coli could markedly stimulate the RNase activity of the hPAN complex. In sharp contrast, GST-PABP could not stimulate the RNase activity of the hPan2 subunit or the ΔC170 complex. These results indicate that PABP stimulates hPan2 nuclease activity through its association with hPan3, consistent with the above finding that hPan3 is the PABP-binding subunit. PABP Enhances Substrate Specificity of hPAN Nuclease to Poly(A) RNA—The substrate specificity of the hPAN nuclease complex was investigated by measuring the extent of inhibition of the catalytic activity in the presence of increasing unlabeled polyribonucleotides, poly(A) and poly(C), in a reaction containing a constant level of radiolabeled poly(A) as described previously (43.Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, both poly(A) and poly(C) inhibited the spermidine-stimulated RNase activity of hPAN. Poly(A) showed stronger inhibition than poly(C); the apparent Ki values were ∼0.07 and >2 μg/ml for poly(A) and poly(C), respectively. On the other hand, the PABP-stimulated RNase activity of hPAN was inhibited strongly by poly(A), although only slightly by poly(C) (Fig. 7B). Thus, hPAN appears to be intrinsically specific for poly(A) RNA, and its substrate specificity for poly(A) is enhanced by its interaction with PABP. Because the RNA binding by PABP is highly specific for poly(A) RNA, of which the Kd for poly(A) is two to three orders of magnitude lower than those for other polynucleotides (45.Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the binding specificity of PABP might contribute to the substrate specificity of hPAN. Cytoplasmic Localization of hPAN Nuclease—The physical interaction of hPAN with cytoplasmic PABP suggests that the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease has a role in cytoplasmic mRNA degradation. Consistent with this view, the hPAN nuclease complex appeared to be present in the cytoplasm. HeLa cells expressing FLAG-hPan2 or FLAG-hPan3 were immunostained using anti-FLAG antibodies with concomitant staining of nuclei using Pico Green. As shown in Fig. 8A, FLAG-hPan2 and FLAG-hPan3 were detected exclusively in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. When HA-Pan2 and FLAG-Pan3 were co-expressed in HeLa cells, they exhibited cytoplasmic co-localization (Fig. 8B), which is consistent with the physical interaction between Pan2 and Pan3 (Fig. 5B). Identification of Human PAN Nuclease—In this study, we have identified novel human cDNAs encoding an hPAN nuclease complex and analyzed its biochemical properties in terms of its regulation by PABP and substrate specificity. The catalytic subunit of human PAN nuclease, hPan2, is a Mg2+-dependent 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease that functions in a distributive manner. On the other hand, hPan3 is a regulatory subunit that interacts with both hPan2 and PABP. Furthermore, the deadenylating activity of hPAN nuclease is stimulated by PABP; this stimulation requires hPan3, which is consistent with the finding that hPan2 interacts with PABP through hPan3. These characteristics are clearly distinct from those of another deadenylase, PARN, which has been reported to be a major mRNA deadenylase in mammalian cells. Eukaryotic mRNAs have two features, a 5′-cap and a 3′-poly(A) tail. eIF4E binds to the 5′-cap and PABP binds to the poly(A) tail during translation. eIF4E competes with PARN on 5′-cap and inhibits the deadenylating activity of PARN (46.Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), because this activity is stimulated by 5′-cap. Moreover, PABP was also reported to inhibit the deadenylating activity of PARN under physiological conditions (28.Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 31.Korner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dissociation of eIF4E and PABP from the 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) tail, respectively, may be a necessary step for deadenylation by PARN. The biological regulation of PARN activation is an important issue. Because human PAN nuclease preferentially degrades poly(A) RNA in the presence of PABP and does not absolutely require the 5′-cap for its deadenylating activity, it could degrade the poly(A) tail of mRNAs even during translation. In yeast, the Pop2/Ccr4 complex is identified as the major mRNA deadenylase (27.Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Pop2 encodes a member of the RNase D family of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases (43.Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Yeast Pop2 has recently been shown to exhibit deadenylating activity in vitro (43.Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but other groups reported that Pop2 is not required for the deadenylase activity (36.Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 47.Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ccr4, which is structurally homologous to apurinic endonucleases, was also shown to be the catalytic component of the 3′ to 5′ deadenylase in yeast and humans (36.Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 47.Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly to hPan2, Ccr4 functions in a distributive manner with strong preferences for poly(A) and shows Mg2+ dependence (48.Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it contains a unique non-poly(A)-specific binding site and becomes processive with longer RNA substrates (48.Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to that of hPAN nuclease, the deadenylating activity of Pop2/Ccr4 is inhibited by PABP (47.Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, the fifth mRNA deadenylase has been reported (30.Baggs J.E. Green C.B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nocturnin is a homologue of Ccr4 and specifically degrades the 3′-poly(A) tail in a processive manner. In contrast to other deadenylases, nocturnin is located exclusively in the rods and cones of photoreceptor cells in Xenopus laevis and is specifically expressed in the early night (35.Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that nocturnin functions in the regulation of circadian rhythm. However, in mammalian cells, it may also be involved in the general mechanism of mRNA decay, because a nocturnin homologue has been found to be expressed widely in mouse tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, lung, and heart in addition to the retina (49.Dupressoir A. Barbot W. Loireau M.P. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31068-31075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50.Wang, Y., Osterbur, D. L., Megaw, P. L., Tosini, G., Fukuhara, C., Green, C. B., and Besharse, J. C. (2001) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/1/9Google Scholar). The requirement of the cap and PABP has not yet been elucidated. In combination, mammalian PAN is a unique deadenylating nuclease in the sense that it is specifically activated by PABP. Possible Roles of Mammalian PAN in Poly(A) Metabolism—In yeast, the primary function of PAN was suggested to be the nuclear trimming of poly(A) tails to message-specific lengths (26.Brown C.E. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that PAN contributes to cytoplasmic mRNA turnover as an alternative mRNA deadenylase to the Ccr4/Pop2 complex (27.Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In both cases, Pab1 plays pivotal roles. However, in mammals, two types of poly(A)-binding protein, PABP and PABPN1, function in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and PABPN1 is considered to be required for mammalian poly(A) tail-length control in the nucleus (51.Meyer S. Urbanke C. Wahle E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6082-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 52.Kuhn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We present here the data indicating that both hPan2 and hPan3 are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and that the hPan2/hPan3 complex interacts with PABP. Therefore, these results support the latter function suggested in yeast, that is, mammalian PAN functions in cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation. However, our data cannot totally exclude the possibility that hPAN also interacts with PABPN1 and functions in the nuclear trimming of poly(A) tails. A previous study from Shyu and co-workers using c-fos mRNA indicated that mRNA undergoes synchronous poly(A) shortening (53.Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, at least in the representative example, distributive ribonucleolytic digestion of poly(A) tails is implied in the mRNA decay in mammalian cells, and Shyu and co-workers predicted that the mammalian counterpart of the yeast PAN might be a distributive enzyme and may be involved in the mRNA deadenylation reactions (53.Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our observation that the hPan2 functions in a distributive manner is consistent with this notion and further strengthens the possibility that the hPan2 is involved in the cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation. Implication of a Phosphorylation-dependent Regulation in Deadenylation—In this study, we have identified a putative kinase domain in the segment amino acids 302-549 of hPan3. The functional significance of this domain in the regulation of hPAN nuclease is not yet clear at present. However, Hammet et al. have shown recently that yeast Pan3 interacts with Dun1 kinase, which has complex checkpoint functions, including the DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2/M, transcriptional induction of repair genes and the regulation of post-replicative DNA repair pathways (54.Hammet A. Pike B.L. Heierhorst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22469-22474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The interaction between Pan3 and the Dun1 kinase is necessary in the posttranscriptional regulation of the RAD5 DNA repair gene, possibly in the regulation of the poly(A)-tail length of mRNA. As indicated in Fig. 4A, the sequence analysis of Pan3 homologues from yeasts to humans revealed that the putative kinase domain is conserved in D. melanogaster and humans but not in yeast and C. elegans. Therefore, it is intriguing to determine whether the built-in kinase domain of hPan3 is functional and behaves similar to Dun1 kinase. We thank Drs. Nahum Sonenberg and Hiroaki Imataka for providing the PABP antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2110151623,"Monomeric and dimeric PufX-containing core complexes have been purified from membranes of wild-type Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Reconstitution of both samples by detergent removal in the presence of lipids leads to the formation of two-dimensional crystals constituted of dimeric core complexes. Two-dimensional crystals were further analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. A projection map at 26-Å resolution reveals that core complexes assemble in an “S”-shaped dimeric complex. Each core complex is composed of one reaction center, 12 light-harvesting 1 α/β-heterodimers, and one PufX protein. The light-harvesting 1 assemblies are open with a gap of density of ∼30-Å width and surround oriented reaction centers. A maximum density is found at the dimer junction. Based on the projection map, a model is proposed, in which the two PufX proteins are located at the dimer junction, consistent with the finding of dimerization of monomeric core complexes upon reconstitution. This localization of PufX in the core complex implies that PufX is the structural key for the dimer complex formation rather than a channel-forming protein for the exchange of ubiquinone/ubiquinol between the reaction center and the cytochrome bc1 complex.

In purple photosynthetic bacteria, highly organized transmembrane pigment-protein complexes perform absorption of light and its conversion into chemical energy.

LH2 and LH1, ensure the collection of light. Then the excitation energy is funneled toward the special pair of bacteriochlorophylls in the reaction center (RC), followed by an electron transfer from the special pair of bacteriochlorophylls to the ubiquinone (Q) acceptors QA and QB. After two photoreactions and proton captures, ubiquinol (QH2) is formed at the QB site that dissociates from the RC into the membrane. The bc1 complex utilizes QH2 and oxidized cytochrome c2 as reductant and oxidant, respectively. The net result is a cyclic electron transfer that promotes the formation of a proton gradient across the membrane, which is utilized for ATP synthesis by F1F0-ATP synthase (for a review, see Ref. 1Hu X.

The mechanisms of excitonic energy migration and photoinduced electron transfer have been studied in detail using biophysical approaches and analyzed at the molecular level following the resolution of the atomic structures of the RC (2Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Google Scholar), LH2 (3McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W.

Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Google Scholar). However, despite the wealth of information available on the individual proteins, their supramolecular organization in the membrane remains undetermined. A crucial issue is the spatial organization between LH1 and RC, forming the so-called core complex, in which the transformation of light energy into charge separation occurs. So far, no atomic model of the core complex is available. Early studies by various electron microscopy (EM) techniques of native membranes of Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Ectothiorhodospira halochloris have shown a single RC surrounded by a closed circle of light-harvesting molecules (6Miller K.R. Nature. 1982; 300: 53-55Google Scholar, 7Stark W. Kühlbrandt W. Wildhaber I. Wehrli E. Muhlethaler K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 777-783Google Scholar, 8Engelhardt H. Engel A. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Organization of LH1 complexes in a closed ring of 16 subunits large enough to house a RC was observed on a cryo-EM projection map of LH1 purified from Rhodospirillum rubrum (9Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 631-638Google Scholar). Later, two-dimensional crystals were grown from purified entire core complexes of R. rubrum (10Walz T. Ghosh R. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 505-508Google Scholar) and analyzed by cryo-EM or negative stain EM, all consistent with a closed LH1 ring of 16 subunits around the RC. More recently, a high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of single molecules in native membranes of R. viridis showed LH1 to form a closed ellipse of 16 subunits around a specifically oriented RC (15Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Lévy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Google Scholar). A closed assembly of LH1 raises the question of QH2/Q exchange between the RC and the bc1 complex (16Loach P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5016-5018Google Scholar). At this point, a protein encoded by the pufX gene found in Rhodobacter sp. (sphaeroides and capsulatus) has been shown to be necessary for photosynthetic growth (17Farchaus J.W. Barz W. Grünberg H. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2779-2788Google Scholar, 18Lilburn T.G. Haith C.E. Prince R.C. Beatty J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 160-170Google Scholar) and more specifically to facilitate the transport of reducing equivalent from the QB site of the RC to the bc1 complex (17Farchaus J.W. Barz W. Grünberg H. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2779-2788Google Scholar, 19Barz W. Vermeglio A. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Google Scholar). In R. sphaeroides, this additional peptide PufX is a small protein of 82 amino acids with one membrane span (20Recchia P.A. Davis C.M. Lilburn T.G. Beatty J.T. Parkes-Loach P.S. Hunter C.N.

Much data led to the hypothesis that the PufX protein is located in the inner α ring of LH1 (20Recchia P.A. Davis C.M. Lilburn T.G. Beatty J.T. Parkes-Loach P.S. Hunter C.N. Loach P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11055-11063Google Scholar, 21Parkes-Loach P.S. Law C.J. Recchia P.A. Kehoe J. Nehrlich S. Chen J. Loach P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5593-5601Google Scholar, 22Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1877-1885Google Scholar), forming a specific channel and/or interrupting the LH1 continuity and thus allowing a facilitated diffusion of QH2/Q between RC and bc1 complex. Furthermore, biochemical studies have shown that PufX-containing core complexes could be isolated from R. sphaeroides membranes as dimeric structures with a 1:1 PufX/RC stoichiometry and a decreased number of LH1-associated Bchls per RC (23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar). The only structural information available about a PufX-containing core complex has been derived from a low resolution negative stain EM analysis of native two-dimensional crystals of a LH2-deleted R. sphaeroides strain (24Jungas C. Ranck J.-L. Rigaud J.-L. Joliot P. Vermeglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Google Scholar). This projection map revealed two C-shaped incomplete antenna rings each surrounding one RC. Finally, polarized spectroscopy of R. sphaeroides membranes containing or lacking PufX provided evidence that PufX induced a specific orientation of the RC in the LH1 ring as well as the formation of a long range order of LH1-RC core complexes (16Loach P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5016-5018Google Scholar, 25Frese R.N. Olsen J.D. Branvall R. Westerhuis W.H. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5197-5202Google Scholar). Taking together all of these considerations, PufX is thought to play a key role in the core complex. One challenge now being addressed is the localization of PufX in the core complex to get a deeper insight into its implication in the structure-function relationship critical for bacterial photosynthesis. In order to understand the role of PufX in the core complex, we have performed a structural study by two-dimensional crystallization of monomeric and dimeric PufX-containing core complexes isolated from wild-type R. sphaeroides. The purified complexes were analyzed by sedimentation and absorption spectroscopy. Two-dimensional crystals were produced by detergent removal from protein/lipid/detergent mixtures and analyzed by cryo-EM and AFM. Both monomeric and dimeric core complexes reassemble in dimeric PufX-LH1-RC complexes when reconstituted in lipid membranes. The cryo-EM projection map, revealing protein densities of trans-membrane segments, showed an “S”-shaped core complex dimer. The LH1 assemblies are open with a lack of protein density within the gaps, the dimer junction has a stronger density than the rest of the “S”, and the RC reveals an asymmetric density maximum within the open LH1. Taking all information together, we propose a model in which PufX is located at the dimer junction and directly involved in the formation of the supramolecular assembly of core complexes rather than providing a direct pathway for the QH2/Q exchange. Materials—All phospholipids and detergents were of highest purity and were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and from Fluka or Anatrace, respectively. Bio-Beads SM2 (25-50 mesh) from Bio-Rad were extensively washed with methanol and water before use as described (26Lévy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Moeck G.S. Bald D. Rigaud J.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 44-52Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Isolation and Purification of the Monomeric and Dimeric Complex— Core complexes from semiaerobically grown R. sphaeroides strains with and without PufX were isolated as described previously (23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar), except that after the washing step in 2 m NaBr, 0.2 m sucrose, membranes were directly resuspended at 10 mg/ml protein and extracted with 3% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) and 0.5% sodium cholate. After extraction, the supernatant was run on a sucrose gradient (10-40%) in buffer glycyl-glycine (50 mm), pH 7.8, 0.6% OG, and 0.2% sodium cholate. As previously shown (22Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1877-1885Google Scholar, 23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar), three major bands were isolated, including an LH2-containing band and two PufX-containing bands corresponding to the monomeric or dimeric core complexes. For detergent exchange, before two-dimensional crystallization, the monomeric or dimeric core complexes purified on an OG/cholate sucrose gradient, were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 0.1% 1-S-dodecyl-β-d-thiomaltoside (DOTM). The polypeptide composition of the final fraction was controlled by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Reconstitution and Two-dimensional Crystallization—Purified LH1-RC-PufX complexes at 0.4 mg/ml in a buffer containing 0.1% DOTM, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm gly-gly, pH 7.8, were mixed with egg phosphatidylcholine/egg phosphatidic acid (9:1, mol/mol) at lipid/protein ratios between 0.75 and 1 (w/w). The lipid/protein/detergent mixture was allowed to equilibrate overnight in the dark. Detergent removal was performed through two successive additions of 5 mg of SM2 Bio-Beads/50-μl sample, for 12 h each, at 4 °C (28Rigaud J. Lévy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 305-319Google Scholar). Crystals were then withdrawn and kept at 4 °C for EM and AFM analysis. Electron Microscopy—Negative stain and cryo-EM were performed using Philipps CM120 and Philipps FEG200 electron microscopes operated at 120 and 200 kV, respectively. Two-dimensional crystals were adsorbed for 1 min on glow-discharged carbon-coated 300-mesh grids. Two-dimensional crystals were either negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate, or quick frozen in liquid ethane for cryo-EM analysis. The latter were transferred into the electron microscope using a Gatan cryo transfer system. Images were directly assessed using low electron dose procedures at a magnification of ×40,000 on a 14-μm 2048 × 2048-pixel Gatan slow scan CCD camera corresponding to 3.5 Å/pixel. Atomic Force Microscopy—Mica prepared as described (29Schabert F.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2394-2403Google Scholar) was used as support and freshly cleaved before every experiment using Scotch tape. 3 μl of two-dimensional crystal solution (0.1 mg/ml) was injected into the adsorption buffer drop (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) on the mica surface. After 2 h, the sample was carefully rinsed with recording buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl). Imaging was performed with a commercial Nanoscope III AFM (from Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a 150-μm scanner (J-scanner) and oxide-sharpened Si3N4 cantilevers with a length of 100 μm(k = 0.09 N/m; Olympus Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The AFM was operated in contact mode applying forces of <0.2 nN at scan frequencies around 3 Hz. Image Processing—Cryo-EM images of two-dimensional crystals recorded on the CCD camera were treated using the MRC image processing package (30Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckman E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar, 31Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Google Scholar). Briefly, images were unbent running two cycles of CCUNBEND, and the symmetry space group was defined using ALL-SPACE (32Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Google Scholar). The final map was calculated by merging images using ORIGTILTK. Projection maps were calculated using programs of the CCP4 package (33Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; 4: 760-763Google Scholar). An isotropic temperature factor (B = -500) was applied to compensate for the degradation of image amplitudes. Density contouring is at 0.25 root mean square with densities above the mean contoured by solid lines. LH1-RC-PufX core complexes were extracted from membranes of semiaerobically grown wild type R. sphaeroides using an OG/sodium cholate mixture (22Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1877-1885Google Scholar, 23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar). As previously shown, two major bands corresponding to monomeric and dimeric forms of LH1-RC-PufX complexes are found on a sucrose gradient (22Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1877-1885Google Scholar, 23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar). Crystallization trials of both monomeric and dimeric PufX-containing core complexes led to small (∼50-nm diameter) noncrystalline vesicles, whatever the rate of detergent removal (dialysis or Bio-Beads) or lipid composition (data not shown). Since the nature of the detergent is a crucial parameter for the result of two-dimensional crystallization trials (34Rigaud J. Chami M. Lambert O. Lévy D. Ranck J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 23: 112-128Google Scholar, 35Chami M. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Lambert O. Ranck J. Lévy D. Rigaud J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 64-74Google Scholar), other detergents than the OG/cholate mixture were tried. For this purpose, the monomeric and dimeric LH1-RC-PufX bands purified in the OG/cholate sucrose gradient were dialyzed against buffers containing different detergents. After detergent exchange, the core complexes in different detergents were reconstituted, and the results were analyzed by EM. The best reconstitutions, in terms of crystallinity and size of the crystals, were obtained from PufX-containing core complexes in DOTM. The integrity of monomeric and dimeric core complexes in DOTM was confirmed by sedimentation on a sucrose gradient, absorption spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 (left), sucrose gradient patterns similar to those previously described for the core complex in OG/cholate were obtained with core complexes in DOTM (23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar). The monomeric PufX-containing core complex (tube 2) ran at a density similar to that of the PufX-deleted core complex (tube 3), whereas the dimeric PufX-containing core complex ran at higher density (tube 1). The composition of core complexes in DOTM was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and revealed the presence of PufX (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1A) in contrast to the pufX-deleted strain (lane 3 in Fig. 1A), as well as the subunits L, M, and H of RC and the subunits α/β of LH1 from wild-type R. sphaeroides. Finally, the spectra of core complexes in DOTM showed typical absorption peaks of pigments in native membranes at 872 and 804 nm, without detectable bands at 820 nm (disassembled LH1) or at 540-560 nm (cytochrome bc1 complex contamination). All of these data indicate that the core complexes purified in DOTM are identical to the previously well characterized core complexes in OG/cholate (23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3834-3845Google Scholar). For two-dimensional crystallization, monomeric or dimeric core complexes in DOTM were mixed with egg phosphatidylcholine/egg phosphatidic acid (9:1, mol/mol) at lipid-to-protein ratios between 0.75 and 1.0 (w/w). Complete detergent removal at 4 °C using Bio-Beads resulted in the formation of vesicular structures whose crystallinity could be directly observed in low magnification images of negatively stained samples (Fig. 2, A and B). Strikingly, reconstitutions from both isolated monomeric and dimeric core complexes result in two-dimensional crystals constituted of dimers. Indeed, Fourier transforms (top insets in Fig. 2, A and B) revealed identical vector lengths for both two-dimensional crystals, and corresponding filtered images revealed the same packing arrangement of dimers in the lipid bilayer (bottom insets in Fig. 2, A and B). It has to be recalled that in the absence of PufX (i.e. with core complex from pufX-deleted strain), dimerization of core complexes does not occur upon reconstitution (data not shown; see also Ref. 13Walz T. Jamieson S.J. Bowers C.M. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Google Scholar). Better crystals, as judged from size (>1 × 1 μm) and packing coherence, were obtained starting from the dimeric core complex sample (Fig. 2A). The less coherent crystal packing obtained with the monomeric core complex was probably due to defects introduced by an incomplete dimerization of the complexes upon reconstitution. Two-dimensional crystals formed from the dimeric preparation were embedded in vitreous ice and analyzed by cryo-EM. The two-dimensional crystals had p22121 symmetry and unit cell dimensions of a = 381.5 Å, b = 130.0 Å, and γ = 89.5°, housing two dimeric core complexes in up-and-down orientation as clearly visible by the “S” and “Z” appearance of dimers in neighboring rows (Fig. 3, Table I). As judged from phase residual analysis, a projection map could be calculated to 26-Å resolution (Table I).Table ICharacterization of R. sphaeroides dimer core complex two-dimensional-crystals by cryo-EMParameterDimensionError (p = 0.95)nUnit cell dimension (housing two dimeric complexes)a = 381.5 Å2.5 Å3aNumber of lattices in the merged image (Fig. 3)b = 130.0 Å2.5 Å3aNumber of lattices in the merged image (Fig. 3)γ = 89.5°1.5°3aNumber of lattices in the merged image (Fig. 3)Defocus range4000Å—6000 ÅSpace groupPhase residuals (versus other spots)No. of spotsPhase residuals (versus theoretical)No. of spotsSymmetryp2212120.812711.7108ResolutionnbNumber of unique reflections (IQ ≤ 5)Phase residual (45° is random)Å157.71916.3240.81421.8333.31116.8428.91136.9525.81238.7623.61155.0OverallcResolution cut-off was set at 26.0 Å (see also Fig. 3)26.06724.9a Number of lattices in the merged image (Fig. 3)b Number of unique reflections (IQ ≤ 5)c Resolution cut-off was set at 26.0 Å (see also Fig. 3) Open table in a new tab The cryo-EM projection map reveals that the core complexes assemble in a particular “S”-shaped arrangement with densities enclosed within each cavity of the “S.” In agreement with general models and structural data of core complexes, the “S”-shaped densities are interpreted as LH1 assembly, and the two enclosed densities are interpreted as two RCs (1Hu X. Ritz T. Damjanovic A. Autenrieth F. Schulten K. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 1-62Google Scholar, 12Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Google Scholar, 15Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Lévy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1690-1693Google Scholar). However, the LH1 complex is open, forming a bow density over ∼285° (see double-headed arrow in Fig. 3B) with inner and outer diameters of ∼75 and ∼110 Å, respectively. In the projection map of the dimer, three remarkable features can be stressed. First, there is no detectable density in the ∼30-Å gap of the LH1 assembly, indicating the absence of any transmembrane segment at this position (1 in Fig. 3B). Second, a maximal density is found at the dimer junction (2 in Fig. 3B), whereas the rest of the projection density along the “S” is homogeneous. Third, the enclosed density originating from the RC is asymmetric, with the strongest density at the side approximately opposed to the LH1 gap (3 in Fig. 3B). Since random orientation would have resulted in an averaged centered, ill defined, circular blob, the asymmetric density of the RC indicates a specific orientation of the RC within the core complex. This is in agreement with Frese et al. (25Frese R.N. Olsen J.D. Branvall R. Westerhuis W.H. Hunter C.N. van Grondelle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5197-5202Google Scholar), who have shown such a unique orientation of the RC with respect to PufX to maximize the diffusion rate of the QH2/Q out of and into the QB site. All of these features are consistent with the nonsymmetrized projection map, in which the unit cell contains four unique core complexes (i.e. two unique dimer complexes (1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 3C). Two-dimensional crystals and densely packed membranes were further analyzed by AFM to acquire additional topographical information on the LH1-RC-PufX assembly (Fig. 4). Two-dimensional crystals produced from the purified dimeric core complexes were adsorbed to the mica surface. Overview topographs revealed strongly corrugated ripples (Fig. 4, A and B). At higher magnification, the ripples revealed substructure corresponding to the dimeric organization of the complexes. Obviously, the incorporation of dimeric core complexes in up-and-down orientation bends the lipid membrane in opposite directions (Fig. 4C, line 1, as shown by the height profile (Fig. 4D, trace 1). Such wave shape of the membranes has hampered imaging at higher resolution by AFM and explains the strong uneven staining effect observed in negative stain electron microscopy (see bottom insets in Fig. 2, A and B). However, the ripples reveal a periodicity of 385 Å, consistent with the long axis of the unit cell as observed in EM (Table I) and an amplitude of 38 Å (Fig. 4D, trace 1). Along the top of the ripple axis (Fig. 4C, line 2) a periodicity of 125 Å, consistent with the short axis of the unit cell as observed in EM (Table I), and an amplitude of 8 Å are found in section analysis (Fig. 4D, trace 2). Additional information was provided by imaging membranes, in which the dimeric core complexes were reconstituted at high density but not crystalline (Fig. 4, E and F). Two different types of surfaces can be clearly identified on the membrane, corresponding to dimers inserted in up-and-down orientations in the lipid bilayer. In one orientation, the protein surfaces can be imaged and show lines of protein in dimeric arrangement (arrow 1), whereas in the opposite orientation, the surfaces reveal a blurry topography also arranged in lines with a similar width of about 220 Å (arrow 2). Such a blurry topography, covering the whole dimer surface, could be attributed to the presence of extramembranous protein domains with a high flexibility (36Scheuring S. Ringler P. Borgina M. Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Agre P. Engel A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4981-4987Google Scholar). This is in contrast with previous AFM topographies of different antenna complexes without PufX (15Scheuring S.

Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Google Scholar) and is probably related to the extramembranous domain of PufX proteins. However, the finding of dimers in a noncrystalline membrane represents additional strong evidence that dimerization is specific to PufX rather than resulting from crystallographic constraints. A single trans-membrane protein, termed PufX in R. sphaeroides, has been evidenced to play a key role in the initial steps of photosynthesis. Functional studies have shown that the PufX protein is essential for photosynthetic growth and is required for a fast QH2/Q exchange between the QB site in the RC and the Qo site of the cytochrome bc1 complex (19Barz W. Vermeglio A. Francia F. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15248-15258Google Scholar, 23Francia F. Wang J. Venturoli G. Melandri B. Barz W. Oesterhelt D.

From a structural point of view, PufX-containing core complexes have been shown to be dimeric in native membranes of R. sphaeroides (24Jungas C. Ranck J.-L. Rigaud J.-L. Joliot P. Vermeglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Google Scholar). However, this finding raised strong criticism, since the study was performed on tubular crystalline membranes gained from a LH2 deletion mutant grown under partial aerobic nonphotosynthetic conditions (16Loach P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5016-5018Google Scholar, 39Vermeglio A. Joliot P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 435-440Google Scholar, 40Crofts A.R.

Moreover, this projection map was calculated from negative stained sample, hence contrasting extramembranous domains rather than trans-membrane parts. Finally, the presence of bc1 complex was proposed within t"

Because bile acids are produced from cholesterol in liver and many enzymes involved in their biosynthesis are preferentially expressed in liver, the role of HNF4α in the regulation of bile acid production was examined. In mice, unconjugated bile acids are conjugated with taurine by the liver-specific enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). Mice lacking hepatic HNF4α expression exhibited markedly decreased expression of the very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related gene (VLACSR), a mouse candidate for bile acid-CoA ligase, and BAT. This was associated with markedly elevated levels of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids in gallbladder. HNF4α was found to bind directly to the mouse VLACSR and BAT gene promoters, and the promoter activities were dependent on HNF4α-binding sites and HNF4α expression.

In humans, these reactions are initiated by steroid nucleus and side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol and followed by β-oxidation of the side chain and resulting in the production of the primary BAs cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (1.Vlahcevic R.Z.

These BAs are stored in gallbladder and then transported into the small intestine. BAs are biological detergents that serve to solubilize fats, sterols, and fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor hormone superfamily that is mainly expressed in liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreas and regulates expression of target genes including several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipid, ammonia, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism by binding to direct repeat-1 elements in their promoter or enhancer regions (8.Schrem H.

Whereas BA biosynthesis and transport are controlled to some degree by HNF4α, it remains unknown whether HNF4α regulates the BA conjugation pathway. Nuclear receptors are involved in the control of the BA biosynthesis and transport system (6.Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 14.Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 15.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), but the mechanism regulating BA conjugation pathways have not been analyzed. BA conjugation reactions are catalyzed by two liver-enriched enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase (BAL) and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) (1.Vlahcevic R.Z. Pandak M.W. Stravitz T.R. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14.Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). BAL activities are associated with rat BAL protein (16.Falany C.N. Xie X. Wheeler J.B. Wang J. Smith M. He D. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2062-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and human very long chain acyl-CoA synthase homolog 2 (VLACSR-H2) protein (17.Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but enzymatic analysis of BAL protein has not been performed in the mouse. Because the mouse very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related (VLACSR) gene, which is highly expressed only in liver (18.Berger J. Truppe C. Neumann H. Forss-Petter S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 genes, has a high homology to these proteins (16.Falany C.N. Xie X. Wheeler J.B. Wang J. Smith M. He D. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2062-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to assume that the VLACSR gene might be the mouse homolog for the BAL gene. On the other hand, BAT genes have been cloned from mouse (19.Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat (20.Furutani M. Arii S. Higashitsuji H. Mise M. Fukumoto M. Takano S. Nakayama H. Imamura M. Fujita J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and human (21.Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human BAT protein has conjugation activity with both taurine and glycine as substrates (21.Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the mouse BAT protein only uses taurine as a substrate (19.Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the biological function of HNF4α was investigated in vivo and in vitro using liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. These mice exhibit increased unconjugated and glycine-conjugated BAs in gallbladder bile and decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT. Expression of the VLACSR and BAT was shown to be regulated directly by HNF4α via HNF4α-binding sites in their promoter regions. These results indicate that HNF4α has an important role in the maintenance of BA homeostasis by regulating BA conjugation pathways. Animals and Treatment—Liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were generated as described previously (10.Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with 45-day-old HNF4αflox/flox × albumin-Cre+ (KO) and HNF4αflox/flox × albumin-Cre– (FLOX) mice. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with water and chow ad libitum. All experiments with mice were performed under Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines with the approval of the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee. Northern Blot Analysis—Total liver RNA (10 μg), extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), was fractionated by electrophoresis through a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont). Blots were hybridized at 68 °C in PerfectHyb plus solution (Sigma) with random primer-labeled cDNA probes and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen cassette followed by visualization using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). All probes were amplified from a mouse cDNA library using gene-specific primers and cloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen). Sequences were verified using CEQ 2000 Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kits (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and a CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). Extraction of Bile Acids from Bile—Three μl of bile or a 1/100 dilution (in methanol) was added into 200 μl of acetonitrile containing 20 μl of 50 μm dehydrocholic acid. The sample was vortexed for 10 s and then subsequently centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new glass tube and extracted with 2 ml of a mixture of ethyl acetate and t-butyl methyl ether (2/1, v/v). After centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the organic phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. The residue was reconstituted in 60 μl of a 50% methanol solution containing 0.2% formic acid. Ten μl of each reconstituted sample was injected for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Identification and Quantitation of Intact Free and Conjugated Bile Acids by LC-MS/MS—LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a PE SCIEX API2000 ESI triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) controlled by Analyst software. A Phenomenex Luna C18 3-μm 100 × 2 mm inner diameter column (Torrance, CA) was used to separate free bile acids. The flow rate through the column at ambient temperature was 0.2 ml/min, and optimal resolution was achieved by elution with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% formic acid (45 → 0%) and methanol (55 → 100%) for 10 min at room temperature. Separation of glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids was performed on an Aquasil C18 5-μm 50 × 2 mm inner diameter column (Keystone Scientific Operations, Bellefonte, PA), and the high pressure liquid chromatography system was operated isocratically at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with the mobile phase (acetonitrile/water/methanol = 30/45/25, v/v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection. The turbo ion spray temperature was maintained at 350 °C, and a voltage of 4.8 kV was applied to the sprayer needle. Nitrogen was used as the turbo ion spray and nebulizing gas. The detection and quantification of free and conjugated bile acids and the internal standard were accomplished by multiple reactions monitoring with the transitions m/z 403.3/367.4 for dehydrocholic acid; 359.1/135.0 for lithocholic acid; 375.1/357.2 for deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and murideoxycholic acid; 373.1/355.3 for cholic acid, hyocholic acid, α- and ω-muricholic acid (MCA); 391.1/355.2 for β-MCA; 466.4/412.3 for glycocholic acid; 450.4/414.4 for glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), 516.3/462.4 for taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-β-MCA); and 500.4/464.4 for taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic (TCDCA). All raw data were processed using Analyst software. Calibration curves were linear for free deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and murideoxycholic acid concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10 μm; free cholic acid, hyocholic acid α-, β-, and ω-MCA from 0.2 to 20 μm, GDCA and GCDCA from 0.1 to 10 μm; TDCA and TCDCA from 1.0 to 200 μm; and glycocholic acid, TCA, and T-β-MCA from 2.5 to 500 μm. Determination of the Transcription Start Sites of the Mouse VLACSR and BAT Genes—5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed to determine the transcription start site of the mouse VLACSR and BAT genes using GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned into pCR TOPO II, and 20 individual clones were sequenced. Based on these results, the major transcription start site was determined. Construction of the Mouse VLACSR and BAT-Luciferase Reporter Plasmids—The mouse VLACSR (–2219, –1435, –1014, –256, –220, –194, and –146/–47 bp from translation start site) and BAT (–1972, –1567, –1447, –1322, –602, –505, –136, and –52/+178 bp from transcription start site) promoters were amplified by PCR using sequence data derived from the Celera data base (Celera Genomics, Rockville, MD) and cloned into KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3/basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutations were introduced into the putative HNF4α-binding site in the VLACSR-luciferase constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the following primer pair: 5′-acaaaCTGACAGAGTCCAtgggt-3′ and 5′-acccaTGGACTCTGTCAGtttgt-3′ (M2; mutations in the HNF4α-binding site are boldface and underlined). Similarly, mutations were introduced into an Sp1-binding site in the VLACSR-luciferase constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the following primer pair: 5′-tgtccaagTAAAGAAGTGag-3′ and 5′-ctCACTTCTTTActtggaca-3′ (mutations in the GC box are boldface and underlined). Similarly, mutations were introduced into an HNF4α-binding site in the BAT-luciferase constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the following primer pair: 5′-agtccaCTTTCCAAGGTCTtagtct-3′ and 5′-agactaAGACCTTGGAAAGtggact-3′ (mutations in the HNF4α-binding site are boldface and underlined). Sequences were verified using a CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 and CV-1 cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to 90–95% confluency. For transfections, 500 ng/well pGL3 basic or the wild-type or mutated BAL and BAT promoters and 200 ng/well pRL/TK (Promega) were used with the total amount of DNA adjusted to 900 ng by the addition of pUC19 as a carrier DNA. For cotransfections, 200 ng/well of the rat HNF4α expression plasmid, pSG5/HNF4α, was used. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for dual luciferase activity using commercial kits (Promega). Gel Shift Analysis—Crude nuclear extracts were prepared, and gel shift analysis was carried out as described previously (11.Inoue Y. Hayhurst G.P. Inoue J. Mori M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25257-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The following three double-stranded probes were used: HNF4α-binding site for the mouse VLACSR promoter (wild-type), 5′-acaaaAGGACAGAGTCCAtgggt-3′ and 5′-acccaTGGACTCTGTCCTtttgt-3′, the mouse VLACSR promoter (mutant), 5′-acaaaCTGACAGAGTCCAtgggt-3′ and 5′-acccaTGGACTCTGTCAGtttgt-3′ (mutations in the HNF4α-binding site are boldface and underlined); GC box for the mouse VLACSR promoter (wild-type), 5′-tgtccaagGGGGCGGGGCag-3′ and 5′-ctGCCCCGCCCCcttggacaC-3′, HNF4α-binding site for the mouse VLACSR promoter (mutant), 5′-tgtccaagTAAAGAAGTGag-3′ and 5′-ctCACTTCTTTActtggaca-3′ (mutations in the GC box are boldface and underlined); the mouse BAT promoter (wild-type), 5′-agtccaAGTTCCAAGGTCTtagtct-3′ and 5′-agactaAGACCTTGGAACTtggact-3′, and the mouse BAT promoter (mutant), 5′-agtccaCTTTCCAAGGTCTtagtct-3′ and 5′-agactaAGACCTTGGAAAGtggact-3′ (mutations in the HNF4α-binding site are boldface and underlined). End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (2 × 105 cpm) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 25-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min prior to the addition of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of anti-HNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min after the addition of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. (Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7) or standard deviation (S.D., Tables I and II). All data were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test for significant differences between the mean values of each group.Fig. 4Effects of mutations of the HNF4α-binding site and GC box in the mouse VLACSR promoter.

Similarly, the labeled mutated HNF4α-binding site oligonucleotide of the mouse BAT promoter was incubated with nuclear extracts from H4Flox (lane 5) and H4LivKO (lane 10) mice. For the supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled probe in the presence of the anti-HNF4α (lanes 4 and 9).

The enzyme activity of BAL has not been analyzed in mouse, but the mouse VLACSR gene might be a candidate for a mouse BAL since VLACSR has high homology to both the rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 that have BAL activities. Human BAT is able to conjugate both glycine and taurine (21.Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but mouse BAT has conjugation specificity toward taurine and not glycine (19.Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed to determine whether the expression of VLACSR and BAT is significantly different between liver-specific HNF4α-null (HNF4α-floxed/floxed, albumin-Cre; H4LivKO) and control (HNF4α-floxed/floxed, without albumin-Cre; H4Flox) mice. Expression of VLACSR and BAT was markedly reduced in the livers of H4LivKO mice as compared with H4Flox mice (Fig. 1). It is also noteworthy that the expression of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and taurine transporter, two enzymes that determine the levels of cytosolic glycine and taurine, were unchanged. Free BAs and Glycine-conjugated BAs Are Increased in Gallbladder Bile of Liver-specific HNF4α-null Mice—Because the expression of VLACSR and BAT was decreased in H4LivKO mice, it was expected that free BAs are increased and conjugation patterns are altered in H4LivKO mice. Most BAs in the H4Flox mice are also found as conjugated derivatives in gallbladder bile because only small amounts of free BAs were detected (Table I). However, free BAs were significantly increased in the gallbladders of H4LivKO mice (Table I), indicating that the conjugation enzymatic machinery of the BAs might be impaired by decreased expression of VLACSR in the livers of H4LivKO mice. The conjugation pattern of BA in gallbladder bile was further determined by LC-MS/MS (Table II). In male H4Flox mice, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-β-MCA) were the predominant BAs. The concentrations of these BAs (Table II, upper) were decreased in H4LivKO mice, but the total amounts (Table II, lower) were almost unchanged (TCA) or increased (T-β-MCA). Most mammals secrete BAs conjugated with taurine and/or glycine, but mouse gallbladder bile contains only the taurine-conjugated forms (18.Berger J. Truppe C. Neumann H. Forss-Petter S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, small amounts of glycine-conjugated BAs including glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were detected in the H4Flox mice, and their levels were much lower as compared with their taurine-conjugated derivatives. In contrast to the results with control mice, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), GDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were increased in H4LivKO mice with GDCA and GCDCA being markedly elevated. These results indicate that the conjugation pattern of BAs in H4LivKO mice is significantly different from H4Flox mice because of decreased expression of BAT. Because glycine-conjugated BAs are increased and taurine-conjugated BAs are maintained in H4LivKO mice, an unidentified BAT that can use both glycine and taurine as substrates might play an important role in H4LivKO mice. Expression of the Mouse VLACSR Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4α—To investigate why expression of VLACSR was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene was cloned (Fig. 2). A transcription start site was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and five major sites were identified between –143 and –85 from translation start site (+1). A putative HNF4α-binding site and a GC box were found between –162 and –150 and –238 and –229, respectively (Fig. 2). To determine whether HNF4α has the potential to activate the mouse VLACSR promoter, several VLACSR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig. 3A). When HepG2 cells, which express HNF4α, were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the –194-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4α-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the –146-bp fragment (Fig. 3A). The promoter activities of the –220-bp fragment was higher than –194-bp fragment, indicating that the nucleotide sequence between –220 and –195 bp, which are GC-rich regions similar to the GC box between –238 and –229 bp, might be important for promoter activity. Furthermore, the promoter activities of the –256-, –1014-, –1435-, and –2219-bp fragments, which contain an HNF4α-binding site and GC-rich sequences, were much higher than that of –194- and –220-bp fragments. To determine whether HNF4α positively regulates the promoter activity, CV-1 cells, which do not express HNF4α, were used. The promoter activity of the –146-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4α expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4α-binding site (Fig. 3B). However, the promoter activity of the –194-bp fragment was increased by cotransfection with an HNF4α expression vector. The same results were obtained using the longer fragments, indicating that HNF4α positively regulates expression of the VLACSR gene. Interestingly, the basal promoter activity of –220-bp fragment was increased in the absence of HNF4α expression, and the activity of –256-bp fragment was much higher. Because a GC-rich sequence was observed in the region between –256 and –195 bp, the Sp1 family proteins might be important in activating maximal promoter activity in the presence of HNF4α. To determine whether HNF4α can bind to the HNF4α-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter, gel shift analysis was performed (Fig. 3C). Liver nuclear extracts from H4Flox mice contained proteins that bound to the HNF4α-binding site (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Binding was diminished by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled VLACSR probe (wild-type) but not by the mutated probe, indicating that a protein specifically bound to this site (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3, the lower arrow). Furthermore, these bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-HNF4α antibody, indicating that the protein bound to this HNF4α-binding site was indeed HNF4α (Fig. 3C, lane 4, the upper arrow). However, supershifted bands were not detected using liver nuclear extracts from H4LivKO mice (Fig. 3C, lane 9) and no specific complex, indicated by the lower arrow, was detected using the labeled mutated probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 10). These results indicate that the HNF4α-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter is capable of binding HNF4α. To determine whether disruption of the HNF4α-binding site and GC box decreases the promoter activity, mutations were introduced into the HNF4α-binding site and GC box in the mouse VLACSR (–1014/–47)-luciferase construct (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4α mutant (–1014/HNF4α Mut) was decreased as compared with the wild-type construct (–1024/WT). The promoter activity of the GC box mutant (–1014/GC box Mut) was further decreased, and the double mutants for both the HNF4α-binding site and GC box (–1014/HNF4α/GC box Mut) had almost no promoter activity. When CV-1 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4α mutant (–1014/HNF4α Mut) was decreased to 40% as compared with the wild-type fragment (–1014/WT) in the presence of HNF4α (Fig. 4C). The basal activity of the GC box mutant (–1014/GC box Mut) was decreased to the same level as the promoterless vector, but the activity was still increased by HNF4α. Furthermore, introduction of mutations into the binding sites of both factors (–1014/HNF4α/GC box Mut) caused a marked reduction of promoter activities even in the presence of HNF4α. These results indicate that the HNF4α and a GC box-binding protein can activate expression of the VLACSR gene, but both are needed for the maximal activation. Expression of the Mouse BAT Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4α—In order to investigate why the expression of BAT was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse BAT gene was cloned (Fig. 5B). An HNF4α-binding site was found between –68 and –56 from the transcription start site (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the promoter activity of the 3078-bp fragment between the beginning of intron 1 and translation start site was not induced in HepG2 and CV-1 cells by cotransfection with HNF4α (data not shown). To determine whether HNF4α has the potential to activate the mouse BAT promoter, several BAT promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig. 6A). When HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the –136-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4α-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the –52-bp fragment (Fig. 6A). The promoter activities of the longer fragments were much higher than that of the –136-bp fragment. To determine whether this effect was due to HNF4α, CV-1 cells were used. The promoter activity of the –52-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4α-expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4α-binding site (Fig. 6B). However, the promoter activity of the –136-bp fragment was increased by HNF4α. The same results were obtained from experiments using the longer fragments. To determine whether HNF4α can bind to the DR1-like elements in the mouse BAT promoter, gel shift analysis was performed (Fig. 6C). Liver nuclear extracts from H4Flox mice contained proteins that bound to the HNF4α-binding site (Fig. 6C, lane 1). Binding was diminished by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled BAT probe (wild-type) but not by the mutated probe, indicating that a protein specifically bound to this site (Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 3, the lower arrow). Furthermore, these bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-HNF4α antibody, indicating that the protein bound to this HNF4α-binding site was indeed HNF4α (Fig. 6C, lane 4, the upper arrow). Supershifted bands were not detected using liver nuclear extracts from H4LivKO mice (Fig. 6C, lane 9), and no specific complex, indicated by the lower arrow, was detected using the labeled mutated probe (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 10). These results indicate that the HNF4α-binding site in the mouse BAT promoter is capable of binding HNF4α. To determine whether disruption of the HNF4α-binding site decreases the promoter activity, the same mutations used in Fig. 6C were introduced into the HNF4α-binding site in the mouse BAT (–602/+178)-luciferase construct (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the mutated –602-bp fragment (–602/Mut) was decreased to 25% as compared with the wild-type fragment (–602/WT). When CV-1 cells were used, the promoter activity of the mutated fragment was decreased to 15% by cotransfection of HNF4α as compared with the wild-type fragment (Fig. 7C), indicating that the HNF4α-binding site is important for activation of the mouse BAT promoter. BAs are synthesized by steroid nucleus and side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol followed by β-oxidation of the side chain. Because serum BA levels are significantly increased and expression of OATP1 and NTCP was decreased in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice (10.Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), HNF4α is likely a critical transcription factor regulating genes involved in BA biosynthesis. In this study, HNF4α was also found to control the BA conjugation pathway by direct binding to the promoter regions of both the VLACSR and BAT genes and activation of their transcription. Because the levels of unconjugated (free) BAs are very low in gallbladder bile (22.Capocaccia L. Attili A.F. Cantafora A. Bracci F. Paciscopi L. Puoti C. Pieche U. Angelico M. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1981; 26: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), increased levels of unconjugated BAs in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice appear to be due to decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT. Because VLACSR and BAT are preferentially expressed in liver (18.Berger J. Truppe C. Neumann H. Forss-Petter S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as HNF4α, HNF4α is a central factor in the regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo. An HNF4α-binding site and a GC-rich region were identified in the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene. Indeed, HNF4α binds to this HNF4α-binding site, and the promoter activities were dependent on this site and expression of HNF4α. Furthermore, a GC-rich sequence was also important for maximal activation of the VLACSR gene because the mutated GC-rich sequence reduced its basal promoter activity. It was reported that HNF4α and Sp1, a prototypical GC box-binding protein, binds to promoter regions of genes, including apolipoprotein C-III and CYP27, and increases their expression (23.Kardassis D. Falvey E. Tsantili P. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Zannis V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24.Garuti R. Croce M.A. Piccinini L. Tiozzo R. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the mouse VLACSR promoter, HNF4α can still activate promoter activity when mutations were introduced into the GC box, but the resultant activity was much lower when compared with that of the wild-type promoter. This result indicates that cooperative binding of HNF4α and Sp1 to the promoter might be required for maximal induction of VLACSR expression in the liver. Furthermore, the expression of sterol carrier protein x, which is involved in the side chain β-oxidation of BA, was also reduced in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice, and Sp1 was identified as a critical factor regulating the sterol carrier protein x gene in an HNF4α-independent manner (data not shown). Because expression of Sp1 and Sp3, typical GC box-binding proteins, was unchanged and VLACSR expression is markedly reduced in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice (data not shown), post-transcriptional modification of Sp1 and/or Sp3 could reduce the expression of VLACSR in these null mice. In addition to increased unconjugated BAs in serum, glycine-conjugated BAs such as GDCA and GCDCA were significantly increased in the gallbladder of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. Because mouse BAT has no glycine conjugation activity (19.Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), expression of an unidentified BAT gene might be activated in H4LivKO mice. Actually a few mouse genes that exhibit similarity to mouse BAT were cloned, but their function is still unknown. Expression of one of these genes (GenBank™ accession number NM_145368) was found to be increased in the livers of H4LivKO mice (data not shown). However, it remains unclear whether this gene encodes an enzyme with glycine conjugation activity. Furthermore, the physiological role of increased GDCA and GCDCA in H4LivKO mice also remains unclear, but these BAs in the intestinal lumen might change many aspects of intestinal and whole body cholesterol homeostasis. Recently it was reported (25.Carlton V.E.H. Harris B.Z. Puffenberger E.G. Batta A.K. Knisely A.S. Robinson D.L. Strauss K.A. Shneider B.L. Lim W.A. Salen G. Morton D.H. Bull L.N. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) that a mutation of the BAT coding sequence causes human familial hypercholanemia that is characterized by elevated serum BA, and serum of homozygous individuals for this mutation contains only unconjugated BAs. Because serum unconjugated BAs are increased, but most BAs in the gallbladder are conjugated forms in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice, protein and enzyme activity of VLACSR and BAT might still be active in these mice. In human disease, mutations in the HNF4α-binding sites were reported in HNF1α, blood coagulation factor VII, and IX (9.Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Because HNF4α regulates many liver-enriched genes, human diseases might be found to be caused by mutations of the HNF4α-binding sites in the VLACSR and BAT genes. It was reported that the expression of BAL and BAT is induced by treatment with ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in rat, and this induction was due to the binding of FXR to FXR-binding sites in their promoter regions (26.Pircher P.C. Kitto J.L. Petrowski M.L. Tangirala R.K. Bischoff E.D. Schulman I.G. Westin S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27703-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because this phenomenon was not observed in mouse, regulation of both genes by FXR exhibits a species difference between rat and mouse (26.Pircher P.C. Kitto J.L. Petrowski M.L. Tangirala R.K. Bischoff E.D. Schulman I.G. Westin S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27703-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Actually, neither VLACSR nor BAT gene was induced in wild-type mice treated with cholic acid, a ligand for FXR (data not shown). Unlike other nuclear receptors including FXR, HNF4α is constitutively activated in vivo and in vitro without exogenous compounds (9.Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Thus, HNF4α positively regulates the basal levels of expression of the VLACSR and BAT genes. It may also be involved in the regulation of transporters such as OATP1 and NTCP that are required for hepatocyte uptake of conjugated BAs from the portal circulation (Fig. 8). Many nuclear receptors including FXR are involved in regulating the BA biosynthesis pathway and transport system (6.Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 633-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 14.Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 15.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, these nuclear receptors also might have important roles in inducing or repressing the expression of VLACSR and BAT to regulate the BA conjugation pathway."

GATA transcription factors 2 and 3 could be involved in modulating this switch, because they were shown to negatively regulate erythropoietin gene transcription through a promoter proximal GATA site. Herein, we analyzed the role of several GATA factors in the regulation of the erythropoietin gene in human liver and in hepatoma cells. Although GATA-3 expression in hepatocytes increases during human development, erythropoietin mRNA accumulation is unaltered in mutant mice lacking GATA-3. We found that GATA-2, -3, -4, and -6 are all expressed in human hepatocytes and that GATA-4 exhibits the most prominent Epo promoter binding activity in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of GATA-4 expression by RNA interference leads to a dramatic reduction in Epo gene transcription in Hep3B cells. Moreover, GATA-4 expression is high and limited to hepatocytes in the fetal liver, whereas GATA-4 expression in the adult liver is low and restricted to epithelial cells surrounding the biliary ducts. Thus, GATA-4 is critical for transcription of the Epo gene in hepatocytes and may contribute to the switch in the site of Epo gene expression from the fetal liver to the adult kidney.

Conserved cis-acting elements both 5′ and 3′ of the Epo gene are important for its regulation. Three sites in the Epo gene 3′ enhancer mediate Epo gene expression in response to hypoxia; a binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a CACA element, and a direct repeat DR-2 site, which interacts with hepatic nuclear factor-4 (12.Semenza G.L.

The combined data indicate that Epo gene transcription in the liver is mediated predominantly by cis-regulatory DNA elements in the 5′-flanking region, including the minimal promoter. Moreover, Epo transcription is negatively regulated by a subset of GATA transcription factors (GATA-1, -2, and -3), which bind to a GATA site within the minimal promoter (19.Imagawa S. Izumi T.

GATA transcription factors belong to the family of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins and play critical roles in cell growth and differentiation (23.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Aird W.C. Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 883-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The six members of the GATA family have been subdivided into two groups based on sequence homology and expression pattern (25.Lowry J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Whereas GATA-1, -2, and -3 were originally characterized as a subgroup essential for the regulation of hematopoiesis, a broader range of functions became obvious after examining the phenotypes of mice with targeted deletions of these factors (26.Pevny L.

Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). GATA-2 is expressed in various tissues, including liver, kidney, and the CNS (31.Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32.Nardelli J. Thiesson D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of GATA-4 and -6 in cardiomyocytes results in a reduced expression of several genes, indicating that GATA-4 and -6 act as tissue-specific transcriptional activators (42.Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). GATA-4 and -6 are expressed in the liver during murine embryogenesis (43.Nemer G. Nemer M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 254: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). During gestation, GATA-6 is clearly expressed in hepatocytes, whereas expression of GATA-4 is detectable late in gestation only in endothelial/epithelial cells surrounding the hepatic vessels. A recent study demonstrated that GATA-4 cooperates with HNF3 (Fox3A) to stimulate albumin gene transcription in liver progenitor cells (44.Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that developmental changes in GATA-4 and -6 gene expression occur during human development and that these proteins are involved in the tissue- and developmental stage-specific regulation of Epo gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the role of several GATA factors in the liver-specific regulation of the Epo gene. The summarized data indicate that GATA-4 is important for hepatic Epo gene transcription during a particular period of development. Human Tissue Specimens—Tissue biopsy specimens from the liver, and in single cases also from kidneys and the CNS, were collected from 24 individuals at post mortem examination at the Institute of Pathology after written parental consent was obtained. Approval for this study was given by the Institutional Review Board. The study group included 11 fetuses (gestational age (GA) < 24 weeks post conception (pc)) and six preterm or term neonates with normal organ development, which were spontaneously or electively delivered due to perinatal complications (premature rupture of membranes, amnion infection, or placental/umbilical complications). To broaden the spectrum of developmental times examined, we included five neonates with congenital malformations who revealed normal medullary and extramedullary hematopoiesis as well as normal development of the liver and kidneys. The diagnoses of these patients were malformations of the CNS (n = 3), vitium cordis, or congenital asplenia. We also included two infants with sudden infant death syndrome. In the 24 individuals, gestational GA ranged from 8 to 67 weeks pc. The body weight ranged from 118 to 5627 g (median 656 g) and the crown-rump length from 18.1 to 64.5 cm (median 32.0 cm); these data were not evaluated in subjects with an age below 16 weeks pc. Technical procedures to collect the tissue biopsy specimens from liver (both right and left lobe) were performed as previously described (4.Dame C. Fahnenstich H. Freitag P. Hofmann D. Abdul-Nour T. Bartmann P. Fandrey J. Blood. 1998; 92: 3218-3225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the patients' samples, we obtained RNA (liver, kidney, spinal cord, and CNS) from a commercially available panel, which included a liver sample from a 27-year-old Asian male (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA).

Heterozygous and wild-type fetuses from the same pregnant female mouse were used as controls for RT-PCR analysis of GATA-3 and Epo gene expression. Fetal livers were homogenized in Isogen-TRIzol buffer (Nippongene, Inc.). The RNA was extracted, quality was assessed, and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed as previously described (4.Dame C. Fahnenstich H. Freitag P. Hofmann D. Abdul-Nour T. Bartmann P. Fandrey J. Blood. 1998; 92: 3218-3225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out with 1 μl of cDNA (equivalent to 200 ng of total RNA), 21 μl of PCR Platinum Supermix (Invitrogen), 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 1 μl of each primer (400 nm). We used the following primer sets: mGAPDH: 5′ primer, 5-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTACAGCAACAGGGTGGTGGA-3′; mEpo: 5′ primer, 5′-CTGGGAGCTCAGAAGGAATTGATG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CAGTCTGTCCCATGGACACTCCAG-3′; mGATA-3: 5′ primer, 5′-TGGCGCCGTCTTGATAGTTTCAGA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TCTGAGCGCCAAGGAATCAGTGTG-3′. The annealing temperature for analyzing expression of GAPDH, GATA-3, and Epo was 60 °C; Epo and GATA-3 cDNA was amplified for 30 cycles, and GAPDH for 24 cycles. 3 μl of each PCR product was electrophoresed in 5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and radioactive signals were visualized by autoradiography. Semiquantitative analysis of gene expression was performed as described before (47.Dame C. Sola M.C. Fandrey J.

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 9.0 software. We applied the Student's t test to evaluate statistical differences. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Iwai T. Yuasa Y. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all reactions, primers were annealed for 1.5 min at 60 °C. cDNAs generated from the human cell lines were amplified for 26 cycles. PCR of cDNA from human tissue specimens for GATA-4 and -6 was amplified at 30 cycles and for GAPDH at 26 cycles. Aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Immunohistochemistry—6-μm-thick slices of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were baked at 80 °C for 2 h, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. Immunohistochemical staining for GATA-4 was performed as described by Laitinen et al. (50.Laitinen M.P. Anttonen M. Ketola I. Wilson D.B. Ritvos O. Butzow R. Heikinheimo M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3476-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), using the Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). The primary antibody (anti GATA-4, C-20, 1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the human GATA-4. Negative controls were prepared for each sample by following the complete staining procedure in the absence of the primary antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Whole cell extracts from Hep3B cells grown under standard conditions were prepared for EMSA as previously described (51.Leach K.M. Nightingale K. Igarashi K. Levings P.P. Engel J.D. Becker P.B. Bungert J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 100 fmol of an end-labeled 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the GATA-binding site at -30 of the Epo transcription start site was incubated with 5 μg of Hep3B extract in 1× binding buffer (13.Blanchard K.L.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). In competition experiments, a 300-fold excess of cold wild-type or mutant competitor was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. After addition of the radiolabeled probe, the binding reaction was allowed to continue for an additional 45 min. Where indicated, reactions were postincubated for 20 min with the following antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology): GATA-2 (CG2–96), GATA-3 (HG3–31), GATA-4 (C-20), and GATA-6 (C-20). Immediately after incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm Boric Acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Electrophoresis was performed at 34 mA for ∼2.5 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and complex formation was visualized by autoradiography. The following double-stranded oligonucleotide was used in the experiments (only the non-coding strand is shown): GATA -30 oligonucleotide Epo promoter 5′-CATGCAGATAACAGCCCCGACCC CCGGCCA-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—To analyze the binding of transcription factors in human hepatoma cell (Hep3B) cultures, ChIP assays were performed as previously described (52.Lee Kang S.H. Vieira K. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Hep3B cells were cultured in normoxia as described above and harvested. Proteins and DNA were cross-linked by incubating 2–5 × 107 cells in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies (5 μl) against the following proteins were used: RNA polymerase II (N20); GATA-2 (H116), GATA-3 (HG3–31), GATA-4 (C-20), GATA-6 (C-20), SP1 (H-225), CBP/p300 (A22), and NFκB p65 (A), all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. One aliquot (“no antibody”) served as a negative control. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 60 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads as previously described (52.Lee Kang S.H. Vieira K. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant of the “no antibody” sample was kept as “input.” Immunoprecipitates were washed, DNA was eluted, and the cross-linking was reversed. RNA and proteins were digested as described before (52.Lee Kang S.H. Vieira K. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was purified (QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit, Qiagen) and eluted in 50 μl of Qiagen elution buffer. For amplification by PCR, 0.5 μl of input DNA (diluted in a total volume of 5 μl of ddH2O), 5 μl of the “no antibody” sample, or 5 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA were mixed with 2 μl of primers (400 nm), 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 43 μl of Eppendorf-PCR Mastermix to a total volume of 50 μl. The following primer pairs were used: 1) Epo 5′-flanking region: 5′ primer, 5′-ACTCAGCAACCCAGGCATCTCTGA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CGACCCCTCACGCACACAGCCTCT-3′; 2) GAPDH: 5′ primer, 5′-ACGTAGCTCAGGCCTCAAGACCTT-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GGCGGGCGGAGGACGTGATGCGGC-3′. All samples were processed in the same PCR reaction and performed in triplicate. The annealing temperature was 60 °C, and Epo and GAPDH were amplified for 30 cycles. 5 μl of each reaction was electrophoresed in 5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and radioactive signals were visualized by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts from Hep3B or HepG2 cells were prepared and analyzed by Western blot experiments as described by Leach et al. (51.Leach K.M. Nightingale K. Igarashi K.

Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), using specific antibodies for the GATA transcription factors as listed above as well as antibodies specific for HIF-1α (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories) and α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, TU-02, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RNA Interference—The plasmid pSilencer™ 1.0-U6 (Ambion, Inc.) was used to express GATA-4 interfering RNAs in Hep3B cells. The RNA-expressing oligonucleotides were ligated downstream of a human U6 promoter as described previously (54.Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Two different 19-bp oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences immediately downstream of AA dinucleotides in the 5′ region of the GATA-4 coding sequence (Gen-Bank™, accession number L34357) were ligated into pSilencer. Sequences were compared with the human genome data base to exclude significant homology to other genes. Two DNA oligonucleotides were generated for each construct. In the forward oligonucleotide, the 19-nucleotide sense siRNA sequence was linked to the reverse complementary antisense strand by a 9-nucleotide spacer. Five Ts were added to the 3′-end of the oligonucleotides, and 4-nucleotide overhangs for EcoRI and ApaI restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the complementary sequence, respectively. The oligonucleotides have the following sequences: Construct 1: GATA-4/1 siRNA852–870 sense, 5′-T CTCGATATGTTTGACGACTTCAAGAGAGTCGTCAAACATATCGAGATTTTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AATTAAAAAATCTCGATATGTTTGACGACTCTCTTGAAGTCGTCAAACATATCGAGAGGCC-3′. Construct 2: GATA-4/2 siRNA897–915 sense, 5′-CTGTGGGGCTATGTCCACCTTCAAGAGAGGTGGACATAGCCCCACAGTTTTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AATTAAAAAACTGTGGGGCTATGTCCACCTCTCTTGAAGGTGGACATAGCCCCACAGGGCC-3′. The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the EcoRI and ApaI sites in pSilencer. Hep3B cells were freshly passaged overnight at a concentration of 5 × 104/ml to 1 × 105/ml in 6-well plates under standard conditions. 15 min prior to transfections, medium was changed to quiescent medium (no fetal bovine serum). Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Highest efficiency of transfection was reached using 6 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent and 1 μg of DNA per 9.4 cm2 well (2-ml medium). 4 h after transfection, 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) were added. The reduction of GATA-4 expression by siRNA was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Experiments were repeated at least twice and performed for each set in duplicate or triplicate. Induction of Hypoxia and Inflammation in HepG2 Cells—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in 5% CO2. To achieve hypoxic conditions, culture dishes were placed in a Heraeus incubator (Heraeus, Inc.) with 5% CO2 and 3% O2 (hypoxia). Cytokines (interleukin-1β, 100 pg/ml; tumor necrosis factor α, 5 ng/ml) or glutathione-NO (250 μm) were added to the cells for 6 h under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Role of GATA-3 in Epo Gene Regulation during Development of the Liver—Previous studies have shown that GATA-3 negatively regulates Epo gene transcription through a promoter proximal GATA-site in vitro (23.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether GATA-3 is involved in regulating the switch of Epo gene transcription from the fetal liver to the adult kidney, we examined GATA-3 expression levels in human liver specimens taken at different developmental stages. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GATA-3 is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitor cells and in hepatocytes (not shown). In contrast, GATA-1 is expressed only in hematopoietic cells and thus represents an indicator of hematopoietic activity in the fetal liver as previously shown (47.Dame C. Sola M.C. Fandrey J. Rimsza L.M. Freitag P. Knöpfle G. Christensen R.D. Bungert J. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 119: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of GATA-3 expression, we have grouped the samples according to well defined stages of hematopoietic activity in the liver. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), GATA-1 expression declines in liver specimens after mid-gestation, while expression of GATA-3 increases. The reciprocal expression pattern of GATA-3 and Epo during development in the liver (Fig. 1A and Ref. 4.Dame C. Fahnenstich H. Freitag P. Hofmann D. Abdul-Nour T. Bartmann P. Fandrey J. Blood. 1998; 92: 3218-3225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led us to directly examine the role of GATA-3 in regulating the switch from liver to renal Epo gene expression in fetal mice deficient for GATA-3 (Fig. 1, C and D). Hepatic Epo expression decreased significantly between days E14.5 pc and E18.5 pc, indicating that the switch from liver to renal Epo synthesis in mice occurs before birth. More importantly, Epo gene expression is not affected by the absence of GATA-3. Expression Pattern and Epo Promoter Binding Activity of GATA Transcription Factors in Human Hepatoma (Hep3B) Cells—The above observations and unpublished data showing that expression of GATA-2 in human hepatocytes does not significantly change during development, 2C. Dame, M. C. Sola, G. Knöpfle, and J. Bungert, unpublished data. led us to investigate the expression pattern of all six GATA transcription factors in Hep3B cells. Both RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and Western blot analysis (data not shown) indicate that Hep3B cells express GATA-2, -3, -4, and -6, but not GATA-1 and GATA-5. To examine whether GATA-2, -3, -4, and -6 directly interact with GATA binding sites in the Epo promoter, we performed EMSA with protein extracts prepared from Hep3B cells (Fig. 2). There are two GATA binding sites in the Epo upstream promoter region, one at -30 and the other at -267, relative to the transcription initiation site (55.Lin F.K. Suggs S. Lin C.H. Browne J.K.

A key question of the proPO system is how pattern recognition proteins recognize pathogenic microbes and subsequently activate the system. To investigate the biological function of 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein in the proPO cascade system, we isolated eight different 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding proteins from the hemolymph of large beetle (Holotrichia diomphalia) larvae by using 1,3-β-d-glucan immobilized column. Among them, a 20- and 17-kDa protein (referred to as Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2) show high sequence identity with the short forms of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs-S) from human and Drosophila melanogaster. To be able to characterize the biochemical properties of these two proteins, we expressed them in Drosophila S2 cells. Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 were found to specifically bind both 1,3-β-d-glucan and peptidoglycan. By BIAcore analysis, the minimal 1,3-β-d-glucan structure required for binding to Hd-PGRP-1 was found to be laminaritetraose. Hd-PGRP-1 increased serine protease activity upon binding to 1,3-β-d-glucan and subsequently induced the phenoloxidase activity in the presence of both 1,3-β-d-glucan and Ca2+, but no phenoloxidase activity was elicited under the same conditions in the presence of peptidoglycan and Ca2+. These results demonstrate that Hd-PGRP-1 can serve as a receptor for 1,3-β-d-glucan in the insect proPO activation system.

These results demonstrate that Hd-PGRP-1 can serve as a receptor for 1,3-β-d-glucan in the insect proPO activation system. The innate immune system is a host defense mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved from plants to humans and is mainly involved in the recognition and control of the early stage of infection in all animals (1Hoffmann J.A.

It is activated by a group of germ line encoded receptors, conceptually termed pattern recognition receptors, that recognize microbial surface determinants that are conserved among microbes but absent in the host, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharidePGNpeptidoglycanPGRPpeptidoglycan recognition proteinproPOprophenoloxidasePOphenoloxidaseESGCthe eluate solution from 1,3-β-D-glucan-immobilized columnGRP1,3-β-D-glucan recognition proteinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographybovine OBPbovine oligosaccharide-binding proteinBoc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCAt-butyloxycarbonyl-benzyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-seryl-l-arginine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide. peptidoglycan (PGN), 1,3-β-d-glucan, and mannan. Upon recognition, these receptors activate distinct signaling cascades that regulate specific immune-related proteins aimed at the aggressors. Recently, our knowledge of innate immunity in mammalian and insects has increased dramatically (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) have been recognized as an important component of the innate immune system in a variety of organisms ranging from invertebrates to vertebrates including insects and mammals. Ashida and colleagues (7Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Google Scholar) were first to purify a soluble PGRP showing an affinity for PGN, and upon binding to PGN this complex induced activation of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade. Subsequent identification and cloning of many other PGRPs demonstrated that PGRPs are conserved from insects to mammals (8Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Google Scholar). However, the exact biological functions of short forms of PGRPs were not determined. The proPO activation pathway, like the vertebrate complement system, is a proteolytic cascade comprising pattern recognition proteins, several serine proteases, their inhibitors, and terminates with the zymogen, proPO (11Söderhäll K.

It is known that microbial carbohydrates such as LPS, PGN, or 1,3-d-β-glucan are first recognized by pattern recognition proteins, which then induce activation of serine proteases within the proPO system (11Söderhäll K.

The proPO-activating enzyme or factor, which all are similar to Drosophila easter-type serine proteases, cleaves proPO to generate the active enzyme, phenoloxidase (PO) (14Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H.

A key question regarding the proPO activation system is how pattern recognition molecules can induce activation of the system in response to microbial infection. We were able to reconstitute the downstream components of the proPO cascade using biochemically purified proteins from a large beetle, Holotrichia diomphalia (19Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Google Scholar). Using this in vitro system, we were able to show that the downstream part of the proPO system is regulated by two easter-type serine proteases and a masquerade-type serine protease homologue and involves a two-step proteolysis of proPOs before they exhibit any PO activity. However, the molecular mechanism of the upstream part of the proPO cascade is still poorly understood. Additionally, it remains to be elucidated how the connection between the upstream and downstream part of the proPO cascade is organized and activated. It was proposed that pattern recognition molecules, such as PGRPs, Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins, LPS, or 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding proteins (GRPs), make a complex with the proPO-activating enzyme(s) and microbial cell wall components, then activate proPO-activating enzyme(s), which then will convert proPO to active PO by a limited proteolysis (11Söderhäll K.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 4375-4383Google Scholar, 24Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.K. Osaki S. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that a mixture of plasma and hemocyte lysate of the coleopteran insect Tenebrio molitor could induce proPO activation in response to 1,3-β-d-glucan, but not to LPS and PGN (24Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.K. Osaki S. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Google Scholar). This result suggests that this mixture contains all the necessary components for 1,3-β-d-glucan-dependent proPO activation, such as 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein(s), proPO-activating factors (PPAFs), and proPOs. In this article we report that Drosophila PGRP-SA-like proteins from the large beetle H. diomphalia recognize 1,3-β-d-glucan and induce 1,3-β-d-glucan-dependent proPO activation with the increase of serine protease activity upon binding to 1,3-β-d-glucan in the presence of Ca2+. These proteins were also expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, and their biochemical properties were studied. Animals and Collection of Hemolymph—Methods for rearing the insects and collection of hemolymph were as previously described (25Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Google Scholar). Hemocytes were collected from the hemolymph by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with anti-coagulation buffer (30 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 20 mm EDTA, and 15 mm sodium chloride, pH 4.6, buffer A), and stored at –80 °C. Approximately 3 × 109 packed cells were obtained from 500 ml of hemolymph. The supernatant was taken as plasma, adjusted to pH 4.6 with 1 m citric acid solution, and stored at –80 °C until use. The hemocyte lysate was prepared according to our previously published method (25Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of packed cells were suspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, and then subjected to ultrasonification five times for 3 s at 4 °C. The suspended solution was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as hemocyte lysate in further experiments. Preparation of 1,3-β-d-Glucan- and PGN-immobilized Columns—A 1,3-β-d-glucan immobilized column was prepared with a previously published method (26Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Google Scholar). Briefly, three ml of insoluble 1,3-β-d-glucan (curdlan, Wako) stock solution (500 mg of curdlan was dissolved in 15 ml of 1 n NaOH solution) was added to 20 ml of 0. 2 m K2HPO4, and then adjusted to pH 8.4 with 6 m HCl. Two and a half grams of suction-dried AF-Amino Toyopearl 650M was suspended in the soluble curdlan solution prepared with 1 n NaOH. After addition of 1 g of NaCNBH3, the suspension was incubated at 60 °C overnight. The gel was then acetylated to block remaining free amino groups by incubation with 8 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate and 4 ml of acetic anhydride on ice for 30 min, followed by adding an additional 4 ml of acetic anhydride, and then incubating 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the resin was washed with 150 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, 150 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and finally with distilled water. As a control, the resin was treated as described above but without curdlan. The amount of coupled 1,3-β-d-glucans to resins were quantified by the sulfuric acid-phenol method (27Rao P. Pattabiraman T.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 181: 18-22Google Scholar). The resins that had coupled more than 3 μg of glucose/mg of resin were used for further purification of Holotrichia 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding protein. We have made a PGN-immobilized resin by coupling soluble PGN fragments to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The soluble PGN fragments was prepared from Staphylococcus aureus-insoluble PGN (Fluka, catalog no. 77140) according to the published method (28Rosental R.S. Dziarski R Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-283Google Scholar). Preparation of G-100 Solution and Glucan-specific Solution—G-100 solution from Holotrichia plasma was prepared by our previously published method (29Kwon T.H. Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 90-97Google Scholar). Briefly, the collected plasma solution (∼100 ml containing 900 mg of protein) was concentrated by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter (Amicon, YM1). Approximately 3 ml of the concentrated solution was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1.2 × 42 cm) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, containing 20 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) and then eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Fractions (∼12 ml containing 100 mg of protein) showing PO activity in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration. This solution (referred as G-100 solution) was stored at –70 °C until use. To examine the β-1,3-glucan-dependent PO activity, we prepared a solution (referred to as glucan-specific solution) by mixing G-100 solution (4 g of protein) from plasma and the crude hemocyte lysate (4 g of protein). Assay of PO Activity—An assay of PO was carried out according to our previously published method (14Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure PO activity, 30 μl of the glucan-specific solution (300 μg of protein) or fractionated G-100 solution (150 μg of protein) or hemocyte lysate (150 μg of protein) was pre-incubated in 70 μlof20mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 μg of 1,3-β-d-glucan for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 400 μl of substrate solution (1 mm 4-methylcatechol, 2 mm 4-hydroxyproline ethylester in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the increase in absorbance at 520 nm was measured using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. One unit of phenoloxidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme causing an increase in absorbance of 0.1 at 520 nm per 10 min of incubation (A520/10 min). Laminarioligosaccharides for examining 1,3-β-d-glucan-dependent PO activity were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). To examine the effects of the eluate solution from 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column (referred to as ESGC) on PO activity, 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding proteins depleted solution was obtained by passing the glucan-specific solution through the 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column. To determine the effects of the purified recombinant Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 on the Holotrichia proPO system, the purified Hd-PGRPs (1 μg) was incubated with the glucan-specific solution (150 μgof protein), or the eluate solution or the pass-through solution (150 μg of protein) from the 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of Ca2+ and 1,3-β-d-glucan as described above. Measurement of the Amidase Activity during ProPO Activation—To determine amidase activity in the samples, commercially available trypsin substrate (t-butyloxycarbonyl-benzyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-seryl-l-arginine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA)) was used. In our previous studies, we observed that this substrate was mostly hydrolyzed during Holotrichia proPO activation in the presence of 1,3-β-d-glucan and calcium ion (14Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Google Scholar, 30Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Google Scholar). This substrate was dissolved in dimethylformamide according to the instruction from the manufacturer. One hundred μl of reaction mixture for measuring PO activity was incubated with 490 μl of substrate solution, which contains 40 μm substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After incubation of the mixture at 30 °C for 1 h, 500 μl of 17% (v/v) acetic acid was added to terminate enzyme reaction. The specific amidase activity of the eluate solution can be detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer at λex = 380 nm and λem = 460 nm. As a control, 100 μl of buffer A was added to check amidase activity as above. One unit of the amidase activity was defined as the amount that liberated 1 nmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin/min. Purification of the Denatured Holotrichia 1,3-β-d-Glucan-binding Proteins—To purify proteins that can recognize 1,3-β-d-glucan from the hemolymph of H. diomphalia larvae, the glucan-specific solution was applied to a 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized Toyopearl column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at 0.6 ml/min. After the washing column with buffer B until no absorbance at 280 nm was evident, bound proteins were eluted with buffer B containing 8 m urea at 0.5 ml/min. Then they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. The enriched two bands with molecular sizes of 20 and 17 kDa were cut out from the gel and then extracted by electroelution with 250 mA for 3 h at 4 °C according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Finally the purity of the two bands was checked by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To determine the partial amino acid sequences of the purified 20- and 17-kDa proteins, the purified proteins (25 μg each) were reduced, alkylated, and digested with 2 μg of lysylendopeptidase at 37 °C for 13 h. The digested peptides were separated by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column (Gilson) with a linear gradient between 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (30Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Google Scholar). The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified proteins and the internal peptides from HPLC were determined on an Applied Biosystem Procise automated gas-phase amino acid sequencer (31LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 154-159Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of the 20- and 17-kDa Proteins—A cDNA library from H. diomphalia larvae was constructed as previously described (14Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Google Scholar) by using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Three partial amino acid sequences of the purified 20-kDa protein were determined. Among them, an oligonucleotide corresponding to IQNWEDFT was synthesized as follows: 5′-AT(T/C/A)CA(A/G)AAT(T/C)TGGGA(A/G)GGITT(T/C)AC-3′, and it was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a previously described method (32Sgaramella V. Khorana H.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 427-444Google Scholar). Additionally, three partial amino acid sequences of the purified 17-kDa protein were determined. Among them, an oligonucleotide corresponding to NRWG-GQQA was synthesized as follows: 5′-AA(T/C)CG(A/I)TGGGGIGGICA(A/G)CA(A/G)GC-3′, and it was also labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. We screened 5 × 104 colonies and obtained six hybridization-positive clones. We analyzed two plasmids containing two chemically determined amino acid sequences and amino-terminal sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of the 20-kDa (Hd-PGRP-1) and 17-kDa (Hd-PGRP-2) were compared with the protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Genetyx system (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Drosophila Schneider S2 Cell Line—The open reading frames corresponding to the full length of Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 proteins were subcloned into pMT/Bip/V5-His vector (pMT/Bip/V5-His-Hd-PGRPs-1 and -Hd-PGRP-2) under control of the metallothionin promoter (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines expressing Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 proteins were generated by transfection of each pMT/Bip/V5-His clone into Drosophila Schneider S2 cells. To detect secretion of recombinant proteins, we used the V5 epitope at the COOH-terminal tag. The secreted recombinant fusion proteins were examined with the anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) by Western blot analysis. Then the recombinant Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 proteins secreted into the medium were purified with MagneHis™ nickel particles according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Promega). 1,3-β-d-Glucan and PGN Binding Assay—The cultured medium (Invitrogen) of S2 stable cells expressing Hd-PGRP-1 (360 μl) or Hd-PGRP-2 (720 μl) or the mixture of Hd-PGRP-1 (360 μl) and Hd-PGRP-2 (720 μl) was mixed with 40 μl of 50% (v/v) suspension of the 1,3-β-d-glucan- or PGN-immobilized resins in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C overnight with rocking. After centrifugation, the resins were washed three times with the same buffer. Proteins bound to the 1,3-β-d-glucan- or PGN-immobilized resins were dissolved in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 20 V, 4 °C using an electroblot apparatus. The membranes were then treated with the anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and visualized using an ECL kit, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). BIAcore Analysis—For calculation of association constants (KD) for Hd-PGRPs, biotinylated laminarioligosaccharide were immobilized on to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA (SA chip, BIAcore AB). The biotination reactions of laminarioligosaccharide were performed as described (26Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Google Scholar). Each solution of laminarioligosaccharides in water was incubated at 90 °C for 2 h with Biotin-LC-Hydrazide (Pierce). The reaction mixture was directly injected onto the surface of the SA chip at a flow rate of 2 μl/min with BIAcore 1000 (BIAcore AB). Samples in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl at a concentration of 100 nm to 1 μm were passed over the surface of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The interaction was monitored as the changes of surface plasmon resonance response at 25 °C. After 3 min of monitoring, the same buffer was introduced onto the sensor chip in place of the protein solution to start the dissociation. At the end of each cycle, regeneration of the chip was accomplished by washing away the surface-bound protein with 5 μl of 10 mm H3PO4. Both the association rate constant (ka) and the dissociation rate constant (kd) were obtained from the surface plasmon resonance signal binding data and calculated using a program named 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model to obtain constants with the BIA-Evaluation software (version 3.2, BIAcore AB). The association constant (KD) was subsequently determined by kd/ka. Antibody and Immunoblotting—Antibodies against the purified Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 were raised by injecting 10 μg of the purified proteins into a male albino rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant and twice giving booster injections with the same amount of protein 7 and 14 days later (33McCauley R. Racker E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 73-81Google Scholar). The resulting antibodies were affinity-purified as previously described (14Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and the filter was blocked by immersion in 5% skim milk solution containing 1% horse serum for 12 h. The membrane was then transferred to a rinse solution I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% skim milk) containing the affinity-purified antibodies against Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 (50 ng/ml) and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound antibody was identified using an ECL Western blotting reagent kit. Determination of Hd-PGRP Localization—Hemolymph and fat body were obtained from 5 larvae. The hemolymph was centrifuged separately at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as plasma. The hemocyte lysate was prepared as described above. The soluble proteins of plasma, hemocyte lysate, and fat body were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotting with affinity-purified Hd-PGRP-1 and Hd-PGRP-2 antibodies, respectively. Relationship between PO Activity and Amidase Activity of 1,3-β-d-Glucan-dependent ProPO Activation—It is well known that invertebrate proPO system can be activated by LPS, PGN, and 1,3-β-d-glucan (11Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Google Scholar, 12Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 13Gillespie J. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Google Scholar). To purify 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein(s) from Holotrichia proPO system, it is necessary to make a solution showing PO activity by 1,3-β-d-glucan, not by PGN or LPS. As shown in Fig. 1A, we prepared a glucan-specific solution showing 1,3-β-d-glucan-dependent PO activities using a mixture of G-100 solution from plasma and hemocyte lysate. This solution specifically showed PO activity in the presence of both 1,3-β-d-glucan and Ca2+ (column 10), but not in the presence of Ca2+ and PGN or LPS (columns 11 and 12). This result suggests that the glucan-specific solution contains all necessary proPO-activating enzymes, proPOs, and unidentified 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2045233234,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are thought to be responsible for dermal photoaging in human skin. In the present study, we evaluated the involvement of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in MMP-1 expression under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. UVA (20 J/cm2) up-regulates MIF production, and UVA-induced MMP-1 mRNA production is inhibited by an anti-MIF antibody. MIF (100 ng/ml) was shown to induce MMP-1 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. We found that MIF (100 ng/ml) enhanced MMP-1 activity in cultured fibroblasts assessed by zymography. Moreover, we observed that fibroblasts obtained from MIF-deficient mice were much less sensitive to UVA regarding MMP-13 expression than those from wild-type BALB/c mice. Furthermore, after UVA irradiation (10 J/cm2), dermal fibroblasts of MIF-deficient mice produced significantly decreased levels of MMP-13 compared with fibroblasts of wild-type mice. Next we investigated the signal transduction pathway of MIF. The up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA by MIF stimulation was found to be inhibited by a PKC inhibitor (GF109203X), a Src-family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (herbimycin A), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), a PKA inhibitor (H89), a MEK inhibitor (PD98089), and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). In contrast, the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was found to have little effect on expression of MMP-1 mRNA. We found that PKC-pan, PKCα/βII, PKCδ (Thr505), PKCδ (Ser643), Raf, and MAPK were phosphorylated by MIF. Moreover, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of PKCα/βII and MAPK in response to MIF was suppressed by genistein, and herbimycin A as well as by transfection of the plasmid of C-terminal Src kinase. The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was significantly up-regulated 2 h after MIF stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF is involved in the up-regulation of UVA-induced MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts through PKC-, PKA-, Src family tyrosine kinase-, MAPK-, c-Jun-, and AP-1-dependent pathways.

The skin is an important barrier that protects the body from damage due to direct contact with the outside environment, including trauma, bacterial infection, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Regarding the environmental damage to skin, the most common physical injury is that caused by UV irradiation. UV irradiation substantially increases the risk of actinic damage to the skin. Interstitial collagens, the major structural components of the dermis, have been found to be particularly diminished in skin actinically damaged by UV irradiation (1.Ohnishi Y. Tajima S. Akiyama M. Ishibashi A. Kobayashi R. Horii I. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2000; 292: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2.Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J.

Quantitative and qualitative changes in the dermal extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and interstitial collagens are also associated in dermal photodamage. There are several morphological and biochemical indications that collagen type I is reduced in UV actinically damaged skin (4.Brauchle M. Gluck D. Di Padova F. Han J. Gram H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Various types of UV-induced matrix-degenerating metalloproteinases present in dermal fibroblasts contribute to the breakdown of dermal interstitial collagen and other connective tissue components. As for the underlying biological mechanisms of action involved in skin damage, the skin is known to secrete a number of cytokines, including interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; UV, ultraviolet; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; CSK, C-terminal Src kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol-PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase.-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (5.Alexander J.P.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). UV irradiation up-regulates the production of these cytokines, and UV-induced collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 from dermal fibroblasts are mediated in part by IL-1α and IL-1β (6.Wlaschek M. Heinen G. Poswig A. Schwarz A. Krieg T. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, collagenase activity has been shown to be inhibited by a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) (8.Kawaguchi Y. Tanaka H. Okada T. Konishi H. Takahashi M. Ito M. Asai J. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 288: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), originally identified as a lymphokine that concentrates macrophages at inflammatory loci, is a potent activator of macrophages in vivo and is considered to play an important role in cell-mediated immunity (9.David J.R.

It has been reported that MIF is expressed primarily by T cells and macrophages; recent studies have however revealed that this protein is ubiquitously expressed by various cells, thus indicating its involvement beyond the immune system in a variety of pathologic states (11.Nishihira J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 17-28PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bucala R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is of interest that MIF functions as a cytokine, an anterior pituitary-derived hormone, and a glucocorticoid-induced immunomodulator (13.Nishihira J. J. Interferon. Cytokine. Res. 2000; 20: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is of note that UVA irradiation reaches the reticular dermis, rendering fibroblasts accessible targets (14.Herrmann G. Wlaschek M. Lange T.S. Prenzel K. Goerz G. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Dermatol. 1993; 2: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the skin, MIF is expressed in the epidermis, particularly in the basal layer (15.Shimizu T. Ohkawara A. Nishihira J. Sakamoto W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of MIF in the dermis and the effects of UVA on MIF expression of dermal fibroblasts remain unknown. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether MIF mediates the up-regulation of MMP-1 expression in response to the stimulation of UVA irradiation. We also investigated the signal transduction pathway of MIF in human dermal fibroblasts. Materials—The following materials were obtained from commercial sources. Genistein, herbimycin A, PP2, GF109203X, H89, PD98089, SB203580, and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) from Invitrogen (Groningen, Netherland); Dig Gel Shift kit and FuGENE 6 was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany); the Isogen RNA extraction kit was from Nippon Gene (Toyama, Japan); the Biotrack MMP-1 assay kit, [α-32P]dCTP, and Hybond N nylon membrane were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ); the consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide was from Promega (Madison, WI); the DNA random primer labeling kit was from Takara (Kyoto, Japan); anti-phospho-PKCpan, PKCα/βII (Thr638/641), PKCδ (Thr505), PKCδ (Ser643), PKCθ (Thr538), PKD/PKCμ (Ser744/748), PKD/PKCμ (Ser916), PKCζ/λ (Thr410/403); anti-phospho-Raf, anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies, and the phototope-HRP Western blot detection system were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); Anti-MMP-1, anti-β-actin antibodies and gelatin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.; anti-MMP-13 (Collagenase-3) antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); YM-30 was from Millipore (Bedford, MA); and recombinant human MMP-1 was from Genzyme-Techne (Minneapolis, MN). The anti-MIF polyclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (15.Shimizu T. Ohkawara A. Nishihira J. Sakamoto W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recombinant human MIF was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21/DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described previously (16.Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Ohki S. Hikichi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This MIF contained less than 1 pg of endotoxin per μg of protein, as determined by chromogenic Lumulus amoebocyte assay (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD). Plasmids of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and dominant negative mutant of CSK (CSK–) were prepared as previously described (17.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cells and Skin Tissues—Human dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Dainippon Seiyaku (Osaka, Japan). Cells of passages 3–4 were used for the experiments. In brief, cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, glutamine (2 mm), sodium ascorbate (50 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (100 μg/ml). The cells were grown in a moist atmosphere in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. MIF-deficient mice were established by targeted disruption of the MIF gene, using a mouse strain bred onto a BALB/c background (18.Honma N. Koseki H. Akasaka T. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Serizawa I. Akahori H. Osawa M. Mikayama T. Immunology. 2000; 100: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) BALB/c mice were purchased from Japan Clea (Shizuoka, Japan) and maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Mouse dermal fibroblasts were obtained from MIF-deficient mice and control WT mice. Newborn mouse skin was carefully shaven, a segment of skin excised, and fibroblasts were obtained using the standard explant technique. Briefly, the skin was cut into 3 × 5-mm pieces and placed onto large Petri dishes with the subcutaneous side down. Once a sufficient number of fibroblasts had migrated out from the skin sections, pieces of the skin were removed and the cells were passaged by trypsin digestion in the same manner as for the fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells from passage 3 were used for the experiment. UVA Irradiation—Human dermal fibroblasts were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The UVA irradiation source was a FL20S/BLB fluorescent lamp (Clinical Supply, Tokyo, Japan) that emitted an energy spectrum with high fluency in the UVA region (300–430 nm), with a peak at 352 nm. A 6-mm thick glass plate was used to block UVB emissions. The emitted dose was calculated using a UVA radiometer photodetector (Torex, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in Hank's buffer, and subjected to UVA irradiation. The duration of UV irradiation delivered to cells was altered by sliding a plastic lid covered with aluminum foil onto a flat-bottomed 6-well plate. After irradiation, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C. Control samples were mock-irradiated and maintained under the same culture conditions as those used for the UVA-irradiated specimens. To examine the effects of anti-MIF antibody on the UVA-induced MMP-1 mRNA, fibroblasts were UVA-irradiated (20 J/cm2) in the presence of an anti-MIF antibody (1 and 10 μg/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and then further incubated for 24 h. Expression of MMP-1 mRNA and protein levels were assessed by Northern blot and Western blot analyses. The abdomens of MIF-deficient mice or WT mice were carefully shaved, and irradiated with UVA (0–30 J/cm2). After UVA irradiation for 24 h, skin was surgically obtained and MMP-13 production was assessed by Western blot analysis. Dermal fibroblasts from MIF-deficient mice or WT mice were harvested after reaching 70% confluence. The cells were washed twice with PBS and exposed to a UVA fluorescent lamp for the indicated doses (0–10 J/cm2). After irradiation, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS for 24 h, and MMP-13 production was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—Complete coding cDNA for human MMP-1 in a pSP64 vector was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Templates of human TIMP-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA for Northern blot analyses were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a human cDNA library of human primary dermal fibroblasts. Preparation of each template proceeded using the following primers: TIMP-1 (535 bp), forward primer 5′-TCCTGTTGTTGCTGTGGCTGATAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGGCAAGGTGACGGGACTGGAAGC-3′, GAPDH (306 bp), forward primer 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′. To examine the signal transduction pathway of MIF, human dermal fibroblasts were stimulated with or without MIF and various inhibitors of molecules involved in the signal transduction pathway for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from monolayered cultures using an Isogen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and equal amounts of RNA (5–10 μg) from samples were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the RNA standards, and the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane. Fragments obtained by restriction enzyme treatments for MMP-1, TIMP-1, GAPDH, and MIF were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a DNA random primer labeling kit. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h. Post-hybridization washes were performed twice in 0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) at 65 °C for 15 min. The radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film and quantitatively analyzed using the NIH Image system. Multiple autoradiographic data were examined to ensure that the results reflected those produced in the linear range of the film. The results were normalized by GAPDH mRNA levels. Comparison of ethidium bromide-stained gels with the corresponding GAPDH mRNA levels showed that GAPDH mRNA levels reflected the total RNA loaded onto the gels. ELISA for MIF—To examine the concentration of MIF from cultured fibroblasts, supernatants from cultured fibroblasts by UVA were examined using an MIF ELISA system essentially as described previously (19.Shimizu T. Abe R. Ohkawara A. Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For this assay we used recombinant human MIF to obtain the standard curve, in which good linearity was demonstrated between MIF concentrations (1 to 200 ng/ml) and absorbency. ELISA for MMP-1—After reaching confluence, the cells were trypsinized and then plated on a 24-well culture dish at 4 × 104 cells per well in 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM containing various doses of MIF (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml). After 24 h, the supernatants were collected and subjected to ELISA for MMP-1. The protein level values for MMP-1 were added to those of the supernatants. For the time-course study, we used a procedure similar to that used for the dose response study in the presence of 100 ng/ml MIF using human dermal fibroblasts. Aliquots were obtained at the indicated intervals for up to 48 h. MMP-1 was assayed by an ELISA using a Biotrack MMP-1 assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The minimal sensitivity of the assay system was 6.25 ng/ml, and good linearity was observed at amounts up to 100 ng/ml. Using this ELISA system, all forms of MMP, including pro-MMP-1, MMP-1, and MMP-1 complexes with TIMP-1, could be measured. Determination of MMP-1 Activity in Culture Media of Fibroblasts— Culture media of dermal fibroblasts were collected at the indicated intervals in the presence of MIF (100 ng/ml) for up to 48 h, and concentrated (10-fold) using Centriprep YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for further analyses. Then, MMP-1 activities were determined by heparin-enhanced zymography as previously described (20.Yu W. Woessner Jr, F. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, gelatin (0.5 mg/ml) was embedded in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Samples (15 μg protein for each sample) were treated with sample buffer without dithiothreitol at room temperature and electrophoresed until the dyefront was near the bottom of the gel. To produce the enhancing effects, 10 ml heparin (0.3 mg/ml in 1× sample buffer without SDS) was added to the lanes 20–30 min after electrophoresis began. Each gel was washed two times with 2.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 °C, 20 min each, to remove SDS and then two times with buffer plus 5 mm CaCl2. The gel was washed three times with incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2) and then incubated in this buffer with added protease inhibitors (50 μm each of z-phe-chloromethylketone and tosylphe-chloromethylketone and aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride) for 18 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% MeOH, 10% acetic acid, for 45 min, and destained with 7% acetic acid. A positive control for recombinant human MMP-1 was used to detect the molecules of MMP-1. Western Blot Analysis—Cells (1 × 106 cells) were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). The protein concentrations of the cell homogenates were quantified using a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of homogenates were dissolved in 20 μl of Tris-HCl, 50 mm (pH 6.8), containing 2-mercaptoethanol (1%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (2%), glycerol (20%), and bromphenol blue (0.04%), and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, probed with anti-phospho-Raf, or anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, then allowed to react with goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The resultant complexes were processed for the detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol. To investigate the involvement of tyrosine kinase in PKC phosphorylation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and challenged with MIF (100 ng/ml) 30 min after the addition of PP2 (10 μm), tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) (100 μm), and Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Herbimycin A) (10 μm) in serum-free medium. After 60 min, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis for phosphorylation of phospho-PKCα/βII. To investigate the involvement of tyrosine kinase and PKC in the phosphorylation of MAPK by MIF, fibroblasts pretreated with inhibitors against tyrosine kinase and PKC for 30 min were stimulated by MIF for 60 min. Then cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. For loading controls, we carried out Western blot analysis on β-actin using an anti-β-actin antibody. Transfection of CSK and CSK–—At 24 h after plating the fibroblasts on 6-well dishes, plasmid DNAs of CSK and CSK– were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each dish, CSK or CSK– plasmid (1 μg) was transfected to cultured cells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Following this, cells were stimulated with MIF (100 ng/ml) for 60 min. The cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for phosphorylation of PKC and MAPK. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Human dermal fibroblasts were incubated with 100 ng/ml MIF for the indicated times, and the nuclear proteins extracted. The consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide was annealed and labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP. To prevent nonspecific binding, 0.1 μg of poly(d(I-C)) was added to the binding reaction. The mixture was transferred to a 6% polyacrylamide gel and submitted to gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, the oligonucleotide-protein complexes were electroblotted to a Nylon membrane. The digoxigenin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides were visualized by an enzyme immunoassay using anti-digoxigenin-AP, Fab-fragments, and the chemiluminescent substrate CSPD, as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The generated chemiluminescence was visualized on x-ray film. Statistics—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. of the respective test or control group. Statistical significances between the control group and test groups were evaluated by the Student's t test. Data are representative of at least three experiments. MIF Production in Response to UVA Irradiation in Human Dermal Fibroblasts—We first examined whether UVA is able to stimulate production of MIF in dermal fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were stimulated by UVA, and it was found that UVA up-regulates MIF production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). After 24-hr UVA stimulation at an intensity of 20 J/cm2, the MIF content was remarkably elevated, showing a more than 8-fold increase compared with levels in the absence of UVA stimulation. Effects of MIF on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 mRNA Expression—In human dermal fibroblasts, MMP-1 mRNA was up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in response to MIF, ranging from 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml for per 24-hr treatment (Fig. 2a). A timecourse study of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts was then performed. MMP-1 mRNA expression increased in response to MIF (100 ng/ml) at 1 h post stimulation and reached a maximum at 24 h (Fig. 2b). MIF mRNA levels were slightly down-regulated at 48 h. TIMP-1 mRNA was also elevated, but the increase was less significant than MMP-1 mRNA, although the levels were sustained for at least 48 h. MMP-1 Production and Activation in Response to MIF— MMP-1 protein was detected in the culture supernatant of human dermal fibroblasts. In a dose-response study, the MMP-1 protein levels were significantly up-regulated at doses of 100 ng/ml (Fig. 3a). For the time-course study, MMP-1 in the supernatant was elevated at 12 h after MIF stimulation (100 ng/ml), reached a maximum at 24 h, and was sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 3b). To investigate MIF induced MMP-1 activity, zymography was performed. We used heparin to enhance the signal, because MMP-1 is difficult to detect at low levels in conventional gelatin zymography (20.Yu W. Woessner Jr, F. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MMP-1 in the active form (45 kDa) in fibroblasts was enhanced by 100 ng/ml MIF stimulation, reached a maximum at 24 h, and slightly decreased at 48 h (Fig. 3c). Inhibition of MMP-1 Production of Dermal Fibroblasts by a Neutralizing anti-MIF Antibody—We attempted to determine whether neutralizing anti-MIF antibody influences UVA-induced MMP-1 expression in human dermal fibroblasts. By Northern blot analysis, we found that the anti-MIF antibody (1 and 10 μg/ml) significantly down-regulated the expression of MMP-1 mRNA induced by UVA stimulation (20 J/cm2) (Fig. 4a). Based on the results of the Western blot analysis, we confirmed that MMP-1 production is inhibited by the anti-MIF antibody (Fig. 4b). UVA-induced MMP-13 Production in Cultured Dermal Fibroblasts and Skin Tissue in Vivo from MIF-deficient Mice—To clarify whether synthesis of MIF is required for the UVA-induced collagenase, we used dermal fibroblasts from MIF-deficient mice in the production of mouse collagenase MMP-13. Although MMP-13 plays a restricted role in human tissues, it is the predominant tissue collagenase in rodents. Twenty-four hours after UVA irradiation, a significant decrease in viability was observed only after more than 15 J/cm2 UVA irradiation in fibroblasts from MIF-deficient mouse (data not shown); we therefore used up to 10 J/cm2 UVA irradiation for experiment. After 24 h of UVA irradiation (0–10 J/cm2), elevated MMP-13 production was observed in cell lysates of dermal fibroblasts in control WT mice in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, UVA irradiation appeared to have no effect on MMP-13 production in dermal fibroblasts of MIF-deficient mice. Consistent with these results in vitro, elevated MMP-13 production was also observed in the skin of control WT mice in a dose-dependent manner after UV irradiation in vivo, whereas UVA irradiation had little effect on MMP-13 production in the skin of MIF-deficient mice (Fig. 5b). Effects of Inhibitors on MMP-1 Expression in Response to MIF—To examine the signal transduction pathway of MIF, we examined the effects of several inhibitors of molecules involved in the signal transduction pathway when dermal fibroblasts were stimulated with MIF relevant to MMP-1 up-regulation. Several inhibitors were tested, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, PKA inhibitor H89, PKC inhibitor GF109203X, and MEK inhibitor PD98089. We found that these inhibitors for tyrosine kinase, PKA, PKC, and MEK inhibitors significantly reduced MMP-1 mRNA stimulated by MIF (Fig. 6, a–c). In contrast, the SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) failed to inhibit the up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, we found that JNK inhibitor SP600125 also significantly suppressed MMP-1 mRNA stimulated by MIF (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effects of JNK inhibitor on MIF-induced MMP-1 mRNA expression. Dermal fibroblasts were preincubated for 30 min with various concentrations of inhibitors prior to challenge with MIF similar to the procedure in Fig. 6. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitor SP600125. Lane 1, no stimulation; lane 2, SP600125 30 μm; lane 3, MIF 100 ng/ml; lane 4, MIF 100 ng/ml + SP600125 3 μm; lane 5, MIF 100 ng/ml + SP600125 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of PKC, Raf, and MAPK—We investigated the phosphorylation of PKC, Raf, and MAPK after MIF stimulation in dermal fibroblasts. The phosphorylation of PKC pan, PKCα/βII, PKCδ (Thr505) and PKCδ (Ser643) reached a maximum level at 30 min in response to MIF, and was down-regulated after 120 min, whereas PKCζ/λ (Thr410/403) was not phosphorylated (Fig. 8). Other PKC isoforms, including PKD/PKCμ (Ser744/748), PKD/PKCμ (Ser916), and PKCθ (Thr538), were not phosphorylated (data not shown). The phosphorylation of Raf reached a maximum level at 15 min, and that of MAPK was at a maximum level at 60 min (Fig. 9).Fig. 9Phosphorylation of Raf and MAPK in response to MIF. Dermal fibroblasts were stimulated for the indicated time intervals (0–120 min) by MIF (100 ng/ml). Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates (40 μg) and antibodies against phospho-Raf, and anti-phospho-p44/p42-MAPK were used.

https://openalex.org/W1995996832,"MEKK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that can regulate the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase cascade. MEKK1 is comprised of a kinase domain and a long amino-terminal regulatory domain. This amino-terminal domain has a scaffold function in that it can assemble modules of the JNK and ERK MAP kinase cascades. Recently, we have demonstrated that MEKK1 binds to p115 Rho GTPase-activating protein, which has GTPase-activating protein activity toward RhoA. Thus, we tested whether Rho GTPases interact with the regulatory domain of MEKK1. RhoA, but not Rac or Cdc42, binds to a site in the aminoterminal one-third of MEKK1, which includes its PHD domain. The interaction is prevented by mutation of the essential cysteine in the MEKK1 PHD domain. Rho-GTP stimulates the kinase activity of full-length MEKK1 as much as 10-fold toward MEK4 but does not appear to be ubiquitinated by MEKK1 under conditions that result in modification of ERK2. In summary, we have characterized a novel point at which Rho GTPases impinge upon the regulation and function of MEKK1.

It is sensitive to numerous stimuli, including cold shock, UV light, lysophosphatidic acid, osmotic stress, and microtubule-disrupting drugs. In vitro MEKK1 activates the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways by phosphorylation of the relevant MAP2 kinases (3.Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.

Thus, MEKK1 can assemble elements of signaling modules, in a manner reminiscent of the yeast scaffold Ste5p (19.Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Through its PHD domain, MEKK1 can also ubiquitinate and promote the degradation of ERK2 (22.Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Additional interactions with proteins such as α-actinin may impact MEKK1 localization, and with 14-3-3, reflect phosphorylation-dependent interactions (23.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24.Fanger G.R. Widmann C. Porter A.C. Sather S. Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3476-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The small G proteins Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 have also been shown to interact with the kinase domain of MEKK1 (25.Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Perhaps the clearest of functional changes as a result of these interactions is the activation of MEKK1 by the MAP4 kinase germinal center kinase elucidated by Kyriakis and co-workers (18.Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, B, C, Rac1, 2, and Cdc42, control cellular morphology and motility and MAP kinase signaling pathways and influence other processes, such as the cell cycle (27.Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Many of these effects derive directly or indirectly from their ability to regulate the cytoskeleton. The morphological phenotypes induced by active mutants of Rho GTPases have been well documented in different cell types. The most distinct effects of these GTPases were noted in Swiss 3T3 cells in which RhoA induces stress fiber formation and Rac1 induces membrane ruffling and lamellipodia, whereas Cdc42 induces spike-like filopodia (28.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). The connections between MEKK1 and the cytoskeleton are striking. Cells cultured from MEKK1–/–mice exhibit defects in cellular morphology and motility, suggesting that MEKK1 regulates cytoskeletal function (8.Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R.

Drugs that target the cytoskeleton are among the most powerful activators of MEKK1 (16.Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30.Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is localized not only to actin stress fibers and focal adhesions but also to microtubules, intermediate filaments, and around and in the nucleus (23.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As is the case for other signaling molecules, it is expected that its localization will have a major impact on its function (23.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31.Schlesinger, T. K., Bonvin, C., Jarpe, M. N., Fanger, G. R., Cardinaux, J. R., Johnson, G. L., and Widmann, C. (2002) J.

Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In view of the association of p115 RhoGAP with MEKK1, the importance of Rho to regulation of the cytoskeleton, and the linkage of MEKK1 to the cytoskeleton, we examined the possible interaction of Rho and other small GTPases with the regulatory amino-terminal portion of MEKK1. Cell Culture, Transfection, Plasmids, and Proteins—HEK 293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GST-MEKK1 221–559 (PHD domain) and GST-ERK2 (K52R) were produced in Escherichia coli. Full-length recombinant MEKK1, RhoA, and other small G proteins were produced in Sf9 cells (33.Gallagher E.D.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following constructs were utilized in transfection experiments: pCMV5RhoA Myc, pCMV5RhoA L63Myc, and pCMV5RhoA N19Myc. Mutations were introduced into MEKK1 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Antibodies and Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies were as follows: MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1–9C-2A and C-22), RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 26C4,119-G and 119-R), Myc monoclonal 9E10 (National Cell Culture Center). HEK 293 cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed from soluble extracts using 20 μl of the C-22 rabbit polyclonal antibody, in the presence or absence of the C-22-P peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described in detail previously (16.Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates resolved by SDS-PAGE were immunoblotted as described (16.Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Approximately 3 μg of the wild type MEKK1 PHD domain (GST-MEKK1 221–559 (22.Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)), His6-RhoA-GTP, and GST-ERK2 (K52R) were incubated with 50–500 nm His6-E1, 0.5–5 μm His6-E2, 10 μm ubiquitin, and 2 mm ATP in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Anti-ERK polyclonal antibody (Y691) and anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology: 26C4) were used for immunoblotting analysis. His6-E1, His6-E2, and ubiquitin were kind gifts from Dr. Zhijian J. Chen (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (36.Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—All protein kinase reactions were performed in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 μm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2), supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (16.Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained overnight with 10% glacial acetic acid and 20% methanol, dried, and then visualized by autoradiography. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed essentially as described previously (32.Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 strain was transformed with the following constructs: pAS1CYH2 MEKK1-(1–132), pAS1CYH2 MEKK1-(149–347), pAS1CYH2 MEKK1-(149–636), pAS1CYH2 MEKK1-(630–772), pAS1CYH2/MEKK-(766–1173), pAS1CYH2 MEKK1-(766–1493), pAS1CYH2 SNF1, pAS1CYH2/MEKK-(1–719), pAS1CYH2/MEKK-(565–1174), pACT2 RhoA wild type, pACT2 RhoA leucine 63, pACT2 RhoA asparagine 19, pACT2 Rac1, pACT2 Cdc42, pACT2 Ras, pACT2 WNK1 1–555, pACT2 JNK2, pACT2 SNF1, pACT2 α-actinin, and pACT2 5d (a fragment of p115 RhoGAP). Final growth selection was carried out on His–, Leu–, Trp– plates supplemented with X-gal. RhoA Interacts with MEKK1 via Its Amino Terminus—Previously, we found that p115 RhoGAP binds to a central region of MEKK1 located amino-terminal to its kinase domain (32.Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether Rho GTPases might also interact with MEKK1 outside of its kinase domain. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that a fragment of MEKK1 containing residues 1–719 interacted with wild type RhoA, but not with Cdc42, Rac1, or H-Ras (Table I). None of these GTPases bound to an MEKK1 fragment, residues 565–1174, which interacts with p115 RhoGAP. As negative controls, the fragments were tested for interaction with the yeast protein SNF1 and the protein kinase WNK1-(1–555); neither fragment of MEKK1 interacted with these molecules, consistent with our previous results (23.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37.Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As positive controls, α-actinin interacted with residues 1–719, and p115 RhoGAP interacted with residues 565–1174 (23.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32.Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell.

At the same time, we used smaller fragments of MEKK1 to identify a RhoA-interacting region of the protein (Fig. 1A). Wild type RhoA bound to a smaller fragment of MEKK1, residues 149–636, but not to the negative specificity control SNF1 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the RhoA mutant N19, which has a much reduced affinity for GTP and exists either bound to GDP or nucleotide-free, was unable to bind any of the MEKK1 fragments. The RhoA L63 mutant, which is constitutively in its GTP-bound form, also bound residues 149–636, but not any of the other MEKK1 fragments or the negative control SNF1. These findings are consistent with the idea that MEKK1 interacts most strongly with Rho in its GTP-ligated state but do not rule out the possibility that Rho-GDP may also bind to MEKK1. For comparison, JNK2 bound only to residues 1–132, a fragment that we have shown contains a JNK-selective docking or D domain (Fig. 1B) (14.Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33.Gallagher E.D. Xu S. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45785-45792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Having narrowed the region of MEKK1 that interacts with RhoA to residues 149–636, we examined the amino acid sequence of this fragment to identify possible RhoA binding motifs (Fig. 2A). Domains of target proteins that interact with the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 are readily identifiable by primary sequence motifs within the target proteins. Best defined is the CRIB motif found in a number of effectors of these small G proteins (38.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Primary sequence motifs have been much more difficult to discern in RhoA targets by sequence inspection, mutagenesis, or through truncations. However, one motif termed the Rho effector motif is present in the Rho-binding domains of the targets PKN/PRK1, PRK2, Rhotekin, and Rhophilin (39.Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40.Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A region of MEKK1, residues 437–456, displays some sequence similarity to the Rho effector motif found in RhoA-binding proteins (Fig. 2A) and is highly conserved among mammalian species. To test whether this region of the MEKK1 fragment contained a functional Rho effector motif, we introduced several mutations in residues that might be involved in Rho binding (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table II). Only a triple mutation, G452C,R454C,N455D, lost all detectable interaction with RhoA. However, mutating Gly-452 and Arg-454 to alanine instead of cysteine was not sufficient to destroy binding (data not shown), suggesting an artifactual effect of the tandem cysteine residues. That observation, coupled with the overlap of the putative Rho binding site with the PHD domain of MEKK1, caused us to test whether mutation of the key cysteine residue required for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the MEKK1 PHD domain (22.Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), Cys-433, might influence Rho binding. Interestingly, the mutant C433A also failed to bind RhoA (Fig. 2C and Table II).Table IIInteraction of RhoA with MEKK1 mutantsGal4 binding domainGal4 activation domainInteractionSNF1RhoA-MEKK1-(149-636)RhoA+++MEKK1-(149-636) (G452C, R454C, N455D)RhoA-MEKK1-(149-636) (V446A, L448A)RhoA+++MEKK1-(149-636) (E451A, D452A, G453A)RhoA+++MEKK1-(149-636) (C433A)RhoA-MEKK1-(149-636)α-actinin+++ Open table in a new tab In Situ Complexes Formed between MEKK1 and RhoA in Mammalian Cells—To test whether MEKK1 associates with RhoA in cells, we examined MEKK1 immunoprecipitates for the presence of RhoA. We found that endogenous RhoA co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous MEKK1 (Fig. 3). The specificity of the MEKK1-RhoA interaction was tested by using the antigenic peptide to block MEKK1 immunoprecipitation from HEK 293 cell lysates. The peptide blocked both the immunoprecipitation of MEKK1 and the co-immunoprecipitation of RhoA. Similarly, we found that MEKK1 associates with endogenous RhoA in extracts prepared from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (not shown). A control experiment failed to reveal a similar interaction with another MAP3K, Raf-1 (not shown); this MAP3K has been demonstrated to bind specifically to Ras (42.Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 43.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). MEKK1 Does Not Ubiquitinate RhoA in Vitro—The failure of MEKK1 C433A to bind to RhoA suggests that the binding of RhoA to the PHD domain of MEKK1 may facilitate its ubiquitination by MEKK1. To determine whether this can occur, we used the isolated PHD domain of MEKK1 in an in vitro ubiquitination assay with RhoA. As a positive control, we used GST-ERK2, which was shown previously to be ubiquitinated by MEKK1 in vitro and in cells (22.Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A band migrating between the 48- and 58-kDa protein standards, which is the expected size for mono-ubiquitin ERK2, was detected upon immunoblotting the reactions with an anti-ERK antibody (Fig. 4, top panel). Under the same conditions with RhoA-GTP in place of ERK2 as the substrate, no modified forms of RhoA were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Rho antibody (Fig. 4, bottom panel). These results suggest that RhoA is not a good ubiquitination substrate of the MEKK1 PHD domain. Because the E2 protein in the ubiquitination reaction also contributes to specificity, it is possible that some other E2 might cause the reaction to proceed. Whether RhoA is a substrate under other circumstances or not, it may competitively inhibit the ability of MEKK1 to ubiquitinate other proteins in cells by binding to the MEKK1 PHD domain. If this is so, activation of Rho would be expected to stabilize proteins that might otherwise be ubiquitinated by MEKK1. In the future, we hope to test this possibility. RhoA Stimulates the Kinase Activity of MEKK1 in Vitro and in Vivo—Given that MEKK1 appears to interact selectively with RhoA-GTP, we determined whether this interaction alters the kinase activity of native MEKK1. Endogenous MEKK1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells after transfection with Myc-tagged RhoA, RhoA L63, and RhoA N19 constructs (Fig. 5). Equal amounts of the Rho proteins were expressed in the cells (top panel), and roughly equal amounts of MEKK1 were immunoprecipitated (third panel). Expression of wild type RhoA or RhoA N19 produced little activation of MEKK1 as compared with vector alone. In contrast, expression of RhoA L63 in HEK 293 cells stimulated the activity of endogenous MEKK1 toward MEK4 K131M nearly 10-fold (bottom panels). To establish whether the activation mechanism could be recapitulated in vitro, full-length recombinant MEKK1 expressed in Sf9 cells was treated with phosphoprotein phosphatase 2a to reduce its activity (33.Gallagher E.D. Xu S. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45785-45792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MEKK1 expressed in Sf9 cells has very high activity, in part due to autophosphorylation. The dephosphorylated protein was mixed in kinase assays with GTP-loaded or GDP-loaded RhoA, and activity toward MEK4 K131M was measured (Fig. 6A). If RhoA-GTP was included in the reaction, MEKK1 activity increased as much as 11-fold, consistent with the findings in cells, and indicating that RhoA can directly stimulate the kinase activity of MEKK1. RhoA-GDP caused no more than a 3-fold increase in MEKK1 activity. Boiling RhoA prior to incubation with MEKK1 reduced its ability to stimulate MEKK1 to no more than 3-fold, further supporting the idea that activity is increased specifically by Rho-GTP. For comparison, MEKK1 was incubated with Cdc42 or Rac1 loaded with GDP or GTP (Fig. 6B). Rac1 bound to either GDP or GTP caused little increase in activity; RhoA-GTP increased activity as expected. Interestingly, GTP-liganded Cdc42 also increased MEKK1 activity to approximately the same extent as RhoA-GTP. We have been unable to show binding of Cdc42 to the aminoterminal domains of MEKK1. A previous study used pull-down assays to demonstrate that Rac1 and Cdc42 can bind to the MEKK1 kinase domain (26.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), leading us to suggest that the change in activity we observe may be due to interaction of Cdc42 with the kinase domain, a site distinct from the one identified here. If this is so, it is puzzling that MEKK1 distinguished between Cdc42 and Rac1. The GTP-bound form of RhoA increases the activity of several other protein kinases, including PRK/PKN and Rho kinase (39.Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40.Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P.

Although the magnitude of activation of MEKK1 induced by RhoA is smaller than that of p21-activated kinases by GTP-bound Cdc42 or Rac1 (46.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 47.Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the activation of MEKK1 by RhoA is of a similar magnitude to that of these other kinases regulated by RhoA. Thus, MEKK1 shows activity changes in keeping with those displayed by other Rho targets. We observed a nearly additive effect of the combination of MEKK1 and RhoA on activation of a serum response element promoter SRE.L (not shown), suggesting a potential readout for Rho effects on MEKK1. LIM kinases have previously been proposed to mediate activation of this reporter by Rho (48.Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, in the case of MEKK1, we have been unable to demonstrate the relationship between its kinase activity and activation of the reporter; a kinase-dead mutant of MEKK1 displays the same effect on reporter activity in combination with Rho as does the wild type kinase. Likewise, JNK activation by MEKK1 is not absolutely dependent on MEKK1 kinase activity (14.Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential cellular consequences of increased MEKK1 activity induced by Rho-GTP have not yet been identified. The capacity of MEKK1 to bind both RhoA and a Rho-selective RhoGAP suggests that Rho bound to MEKK1 will be rapidly inactivated by the associated GAP. This might cause only transient activation of MEKK1 due to rapid inactivation of Rho. In addition, the population of Rho in the vicinity of MEKK1 may have a different active lifetime than Rho in distinct locations due to the proximity of the GAP. MEKK1 scaffolds members of the JNK and ERK MAP kinase cascades (14.Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15.Xia Y.

We hope to identify the properties of these MEKK1 complexes and to determine whether they represent functionally distinct entities. In summary, we have defined a novel point at which Rho GTPases can impinge on the function of MEKK1. Given that MEKK1 localizes to focal adhesion and stress fibers, is activated by drugs that impact cytoskeletal structure, and is required for cell motility, MEKK1 must perform a critical role in the regulation of the function of the cytoskeleton. It seems likely that interactions with Rho signaling pathways will contribute to these properties of MEKK1.

https://openalex.org/W1991298209,"Central and peripheral mammalian circadian clocks regulate a variety of behavioral and physiological processes through the rhythmic transcription of hundreds of clock-controlled genes. The circadian expression of many transcriptional regulators suggests that a major part of this circadian gene network is indirectly regulated by clock genes. Here we show that the basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor Stra13 is rhythmically expressed in mouse peripheral organs. The circadian transcription of Stra13 is mediated by a response element recognized by the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and located in the proximal promoter region. CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent activation of Stra13 is strongly repressed by CRY1 and also by STRA13 itself. To determine putative Stra13 output genes, we performed microarray analyses of differential gene expression in the liver between wild type and Stra13-/- mice and identified 42 target genes including a subset of 20 previously known as clock-controlled genes. Importantly, we demonstrate that circadian gene expression of the serum protein insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and of the NKG2D receptor ligand retinoic acid early transcript was suppressed in Stra13-/- mice. These biochemical and genetic data establish a role for the basic helix-loop-helix repressor STRA13 as a circadian output regulator in the periphery.

These biochemical and genetic data establish a role for the basic helix-loop-helix repressor STRA13 as a circadian output regulator in the periphery. Circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior are observed in most organisms. They are generated by a self-sustained endogenous circadian clock that is reset by external time cues such as light and temperature (1.Panda S. Hogenesh J.B. Kay S.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 330-335Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar). This mechanism is believed to provide organisms with an anticipatory adaptive mechanism to the daily predictable changes in their environment. Biochemical and genetic studies in various model systems have identified a molecular oscillator generated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops. In mammals, the main loop involves the E box-mediated transcriptional activation of the Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2 clock genes by the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer. Then PER and CRY proteins form complexes that enter into the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to repress the CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent transcription of their own genes, thereby generating a ∼24-h period molecular oscillator (2.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar). This loop controls also the rhythmic expression of the repressor REV-ERBα, which is required for rhythmic Bmal1 transcription, comprising a second loop thought to be important for the overall robustness of the oscillator (3.Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J. Duboule D. Albrecht U. Schibler U. Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). In mammals, the master oscillator is present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nuclei; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CCG, clock-controlled gene; CT, circadian time; DD, dark/dark; LD, light/dark; SAM, significance analysis of microarrays; ZT, Zeitgeber time; EST, expressed sequence tag; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; RPA, RNase protection assay. 1The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nuclei; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CCG, clock-controlled gene; CT, circadian time; DD, dark/dark; LD, light/dark; SAM, significance analysis of microarrays; ZT, Zeitgeber time; EST, expressed sequence tag; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; RPA, RNase protection assay. of the hypothalamus, which orchestrates autonomous oscillators in peripheral organs. Surprisingly, this oscillator can be observed in synchronized cultured cells ex vivo. The SCN oscillator is directly reset by light perceived and transmitted via the retinohypothalamic tract and is believed to entrain peripheral oscillators via ill-defined neurohormonal pathways. Peripheral oscillators also appear to be reset by hormonal signals and the feeding schedule (4.Balsalobre A. Brown S.A. Mercacci L. Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Reichardt H.M. Schütz G. Schibler U.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which central and peripheral oscillators regulate physiological and behavioral output pathways has remained poorly understood. To address this issue, genome-wide analyses of circadian clock-controlled gene (CCG) expression in the SCN, peripheral organs, and cultured cells have recently been performed by several groups (6.Delaunay F. Laudet V. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 595-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several hundred rhythmic transcripts were identified regulating a variety of key biological processes in a coordinated and tissue-specific manner (7.Kornmann B. Preitner N. Rifat D. Fleury-Olela F.

Shigeyoshi Y. Hashimoto S. Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a significant proportion of transcriptional regulators have been found among these CCGs, suggesting that many physiological outputs may be indirectly or not exclusively controlled by the circadian oscillators in mammals as previously proposed in Drosophila (13.McDonald M.J. Rosbash M. Cell. 2001; 107: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Accordingly, response elements for several rhythmically expressed transcription factors have been identified in the promoter region of CCGs (12.Ueda H.R.W.C. Adachi A. Wakamatsu H. Hayashi S. Takasugi T. Nagano M. Nakahama K.-I. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Lino M. Shigeyoshi Y. Hashimoto S. Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). One of these clock-controlled transcription factors is Stra13 (also known as Dec1, Sharp2, or Bhlhb2), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, which are important regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Stra13 is a transcriptional repressor that is up-regulated by multiple cell growth arrest triggers and plays a critical role in the immune system (14.Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P.

Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence supporting a role for Stra13 as a clock-controlled transcription factor that regulates a subset of circadian physiological outputs in peripheral organs. Animals—Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were purchased at IFFACredo (Lyon, France), housed in a 12 h of light and 12 h of dark cycle (LD12:12) with the lights on (defined as Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0) at 7:00 a.m. in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment, and fed ad libitum. After 2 weeks in LD 12:12, the mice were transferred to constant darkness (DD) and sacrificed during the DD first cycle under red dim light at various circadian times (CT). The tissues were collected, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Stra13-/- mice in the C57BL/6J-Sv129 background have been described and were kept under the same conditions as above (16.Sun H. Lu B. Li R.-Q. Flawell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Littermates were used as controls. The animal procedures were in accordance with Mount Sinai Institutional animal guidelines. Plasmid Constructs—cDNA fragments for mouse Stra13 (NM_011498), Per2 (NM_011066), Per3 (NM_011067), Bmal1 (NM_007489), Clock (NM_007715) Rev-erbα (NM_145434), Dbp (NM_016974), Sharp-1 (NM_024469), Alas1 (NM_020559), and Igfbp1 (NM_008341) were reverse transcription-PCR-amplified from total liver RNA using the following primers: 5′-TAAGCAAGAATCCGAAGAGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGGATGAGATAGAAGGGAAGG-3′ (Stra13); 5′-AACACCATAGTTTTCTGGCG-3′ and 5′-ACTGGAGAACTCAGGGCAGC-3′ (Per2); 5′-AAGTTGCCAGCACCTGTGGA-3′ and 5′-ATACTGCTGGCACTGCTTCC-3′ (Per3); 5′-CATTGATGCCAAGACTGGACTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTCCAGGACATTGGCTAAAAC-3′ (Bmal1); 5′-CCAGCTCCTTAATGAGGACA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTCATCTTCTTCCACC-3′ (Clock); 5′-ATGCTTGCCGAGATGCA-3′ and 5′-CATAGAGAAGTCTTCCCA-3′ (Rev-erbα); 5′-TCCAGGCCATGAGACTTTTGACCC-3′ and 5′-AT-GACGTTCTTCGGGCACCTAGCT-3′ (Dbp); 5′-TATGTGTAAACCCAAAAGGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTATCTTCTGATGCTGCTGCT-3′ (Sharp-1); 5′-GAGGTCCATGCAGTGGGGC-TCTAT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGTCGATCAGCAAACTCGTG-3′ (Alas1); and 5′-CGTCTTCTCATCTCTCTCGTA-3′ and 5′-CTGTGTGAGACGATGAGGAAT-3′ (Igfbp1). The fragments were cloned into pKSII+ Bluescript and sequenced. The 36B4 probe has been described elsewhere (8.Grundschober C. Delaunay F. Pühlhofer A. Triqueneaux G. Laudet V. Bartfai T. Nef P. J.

The Stra13 promoter deletion constructs Stra13Δ595::Luc, Stra13 Δ540::Luc, and Stra13 Δ312::Luc were generated by digesting the pGL3KN luciferase reporter plasmid (15.Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Stra13(E3E4)3x::Luc, Stra13(E3E4)m3x::Luc, Per1(E)3x::Luc, and Per1(E)m3X::Luc reporters were made by annealing phosphorylated oligonucleotides containing wild type or mutated E box elements from the Stra13 (E3 and E4) or Per1 (proximal E box) promoter and ligating three copies of the resulting double strand fragments into a TATA box containing pGL2 reporter plasmid. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GATCTGAGCGTTGTCCAACACGTGAGGCTCATGTGATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATCACATGAGCCTCACGTGTTGGACAACGCTCA-3′ (Stra13(E3E4)3x::Luc); 5′-GATCTGAGCGTTGTCCAACATTGCAGGCTCATTGCATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATGCAATGAGCCTGCAATGTTGGACAACGCTCA-3′ (Stra13(E3E4)m3x::Luc); 5′-GATCCAGCACCCAAGTCCACGTGCAGGGATGTGTGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCACACATCCCTGCACGTGGACTTGGGTGCTG-3′ (Per1(E)3x::Luc); 5′-GATCCAGCACCCAAGTCCAATTGCAGGGATGTGTGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCACACATCCCTGCAATTGGACTTGGGTGCTG-3′ (Per1(E)m3X::Luc) (E box elements are in bold, and mutated nucleotides are underlined). To construct expression vectors for CLOCK and BMAL1, the respective open reading frames were PCR amplified from pBKS-Clock (17.King D.P. Zhao Y. Sangoram A.M. Wilsbacher L.D. Tanaka M. Antoch M.P.

All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. The pSG5-Stra13 and pcDNA-Cry1 expression vectors have been described (14.Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dollé P. Chambon P.

RNase Protection Assay—The plasmids were linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and antisense Stra13 (+1050 to +1205) Per2 (+4544 to +4852), Per3 (+2437 to +2683), Bmal1 (+657 to +829), Clock (+1761 to +1999), Rev-erbα (+1207 to +1400), Dbp (+1041 to +1457), Sharp-1 (+157 to +405), Alas1 (+1330 to +1487), Igfbp1 (+1126 to +1287), and 36B4 (+24 to +143) probes were synthesized with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase using [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). RNase protection assays (RPA) were performed with 30 μg of total liver RNA using the RPA III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Hybridization was carried out at 55 °C overnight. The signals were quantified with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Real Time PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed with a Lightcycler (Roche Applied Science) using SYBR green I dye detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following primers were used: 5′-GCTGATGGGCAAGAACACCA-3′ and 5′-CCCAAAGCCTGGAAGAAGGA-3′ (36B4); 5′-ATGGCATAGCCTTCAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGGGGTCAATGAAAGCACC-3′ (Cyp2a4); and 5′-AAGGCAGCAGTGACCAAGCG-3′ and 5′-TGGGGTAGGAGCCTTGATGG-3′ (Raet1c). Liver cDNA from wild type and Stra13-/- mice or calibrator (dilution 1:100) was added to a reaction mixture (Faststart DNA SYBR Green I; Roche Applied Science) with appropriate primers at 0.5 μm each and amplified using the following PCR conditions: 10 min at 95 °C; 30 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 58 °C, and 10 s 72 °C for 45 cycles; and then melting curve analysis. The expression levels were normalized to the levels of 36B4. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated using a standard curve method. Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures using 50 μg of liver nuclear extract from mice kept in DD conditions. STRA13 was detected using a specific affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma GenoSys) that was raised against a C-terminal peptide 2S. Azmi and R. Taneja, unpublished data. and used at a dilution of 1:100 followed by chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading was checked by reprobing the membrane with an EF-1α polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The signals were quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—NIH 3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. NIH 3T3 cells were serum-shocked as described (20.Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well in 12-well multidishes. On the following day, the cells were cotransfected with reporter vector (40 ng) and expression vector (200 ng) for 6 h using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated for 48 h in fresh medium and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed using a Trilux luminometer (Wallac). The activities were normalized to the total protein concentrations determined with the Bradford method. DNA Microarrays Experiments—For each genotype, the livers from two (CT4) or three (CT12) animals were dissected, and total RNA was prepared. cDNA synthesis, biotin labeling of cRNA, and hybridization to murine U74Av2 Genechips (one chip/sample) were performed according the recommendations of the manufacturer (Affymetrix). The .cel files were condensed using the robust multiarray average algorithm (21.Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8407) Google Scholar). To identify differentially expressed genes, we used the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method with a maximal false discovery rate of 20% and a fold change of at least 1.5 for genes called significant by SAM (22.Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9715) Google Scholar). Fold change was calculated as the mean from two (CT4) or three (CT12) knockout animals/mean from two (CT4) or three (CT12) wild type animals. Functional annotation was done using NetAffx (www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx; released August 2003). The resulting data sets were compared with publicly available liver data sets of rhythmic transcripts (7.Kornmann B. Preitner N. Rifat D. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U.

Circadian Expression of Stra13 in Peripheral Tissues—The Stra13 gene is expressed in many embryonic and adult tissues with high levels in the liver, kidney, and lung (14.Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dollé P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here we show using a quantitative RNase protection assay that Stra13 mRNA exhibits a robust rhythmic expression pattern in the liver of mice kept in a LD12:12 cycle, with a ∼5-fold amplitude and trough and peak levels at ZT4 and ZT8-ZT12, respectively (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, this rhythmic expression pattern was also observed in zebrafish liver, suggesting that Stra13 oscillating expression plays a physiologically important role in the vertebrate circadian system (data not shown). Under constant darkness conditions a similar circadian expression pattern was observed in liver as well as in several other peripheral tissues including the heart, kidney, and lung, indicating that Stra13 cyclic expression is driven by endogenous circadian oscillators in these organs (Fig. 1B). A 2-h serum shock of cultured cells followed by serum starvation has previously been shown to trigger circadian gene expression in vitro (20.Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). This treatment was also able to induce Stra13 oscillating expression in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis of STRA13 protein expression in mouse liver nuclear extracts showed a circadian pattern consistent with the mRNA expression profile with a peak at CT12 (Fig. 1D). Together these expression data indicate that Stra13 is under a circadian regulation in mouse peripheral tissues, in accordance with two recent microarray analyses of the liver gene expression (10.Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. Takahashi J.S. Hogenesch J.B.

Sugano S. Lino M. Shigeyoshi Y. Hashimoto S. Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Notably the peak of Stra13 mRNA expression corresponds to the known maximal activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in liver, and Stra13 mRNA levels are depressed in the livers of Clock/Clock mice (10.Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B. Straume M. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. Takahashi J.S. Hogenesch J.B.

The CLOCK-BMAL1 Heterodimer Activates the Stra13 Promoter—The components of the positive limb of the main feedback loop of the circadian oscillator, CLOCK and BMAL1, have been shown to directly regulate the expression of several clock genes and CCGs through E box elements generally localized in the proximal promoter region or the first intron (23.Gekakis N.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 679-689PubMed Google Scholar). Four such E box sequences were identified within the proximal 5′-flanking region of the mouse Stra13 gene, two of them (E3 and E4) being also conserved in the puffer fish (fugu) and human promoters (Fig. 2A). When a luciferase reporter construct containing the mouse Stra13 proximal promoter region (Stra13Δ595::Luc construct) and expression vectors for CLOCK and BMAL1 were cotransfected in COS-7 cells, a significant (∼3-fold) induction over basal activity level was observed (Fig. 2B). Deletion constructs lacking either part of the E box element E4 (Stra13Δ540::Luc construct) or both E box elements E3 and E4 (Stra13Δ312::Luc construct) were unresponsive to CLOCK-BMAL1 (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that element E4 is critical for CLOCK-BMAL1 responsiveness. Interestingly the region including elements E3 and E4 had a configuration very close to that recently defined as being optimal for mediating rhythmic transcription, a perfect class B E box followed by a divergent E box (Fig. 2A) (26.Munoz E. Brewer M. Baler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36009-36017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test whether this composite element was sufficient to confer responsiveness to the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, we cloned this sequence in triplicate in front of minimal promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. This construct was strongly stimulated by the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, whereas a mutated version was inactive (Fig. 2C). As expected this activation could be totally inhibited by coexpressing CRY1, a strong repressor of the negative limb of the circadian oscillator (27.Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection of a STRA13 expression vector also resulted in a potent repression of CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent activation as previously described for the Per1 promoter (28.Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K.-I. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These functional data provide a direct and simple mechanism for the rhythmic transcriptional regulation of Stra13 by circadian oscillators and furthermore suggest a role for Stra13 in negative autoregulation of this mechanism. Stra13 Is Not Required for Normal Circadian Oscillator Activity—The transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1 contain bHLH DNA-binding domains also present in the STRA13 repressor protein. Consequently, the role of STRA13 in the circadian system could be to negatively regulate the circadian oscillator through DNA binding interference with the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer as previously suggested from in vitro studies (28.Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K.-I. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To genetically test this assumption, we analyzed wild type and STRA13-deficient mice kept in constant darkness for the expression of Per2, Per3, Rev-erbα, and Dbp whose transcription is known to be under the control of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (3.Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J. Duboule D. Albrecht U. Schibler U. Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 25.Ripperger J.A. Shearman L.P.

Bradfield C.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The liver circadian expression profiles of these four genes were nearly identical in mice from both genotypes (Fig. 3A). Consistently, expression patterns of Bmal1 and Clock, which are targets of Rev-erbα, were not altered in Stra13-/- mutant mice. These data suggest that Stra13 is not a critical regulator of peripheral circadian oscillators. Alternatively the disruption of Stra13 in mutant mice may be compensated by its paralog Sharp-1 (also known as Dec2), which exhibits a robust circadian expression pattern in the rat SCN and whose promoter is down-regulated in vitro by STRA13 in human cells (28.Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K.-I. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 30.Li Y. Xie M. Song X. Gragen S. Sachdeva K. Wan Y. Yan B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16899-16907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Analysis of Sharp-1 mRNA expression in the liver from wild type mice kept in DD showed weaker expression, oscillating with a peak at CT8-CT12 (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression levels of Sharp-1 were increased by ∼2-fold at all time points in Stra13-/- mutant animals, consistent with a role for Stra13 in Sharp-1 expression (30.Li Y. Xie M. Song X. Gragen S. Sachdeva K. Wan Y. Yan B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16899-16907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We conclude from these observations that Sharp-1 is a Stra13 target gene in vivo and that Stra13 is not required for circadian oscillator activity in the presence of Sharp-1. STRA13 Regulates a Subset of CCGs in Liver—To further investigate the physiological role of Stra13 in the mammalian circadian clock, we sought to identify circadianly expressed STRA13 target genes. To this end, we performed a microarray analysis of liver gene expression at CT4 and CT12 in wild type and Stra13-/- mice using DNA GeneChips (Affymetrix) and compared the resulting data sets with previously established lists of rhythmic transcripts in liver. The CT4 time point was selected to minimize the possible redundant activity of Sharp-1 as Sharp-1 expression level remained low while the STRA13 protein was present at CT4 (Figs. 1D and 3C). CT12 was analyzed as the time point of maximum STRA13 protein accumulation (Fig. 1D). Using the recently developed robust multiarray average algorithm for normalization followed by a SAM statistical procedure for the detection of differentially expressed genes in mutant versus wild type mice, we identified 42 STRA13 target genes showing at least a 1.5-fold change in expression, of which 20 were known as CCGs in liver (Table I) (7.Kornmann B.

https://openalex.org/W1966752080,"The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in regulation of ovarian and testicular functions. Here we show that the receptor is present also in specific areas of the peripheral and central nervous system and may thus have a broader functional role than has been anticipated. Full-length LHR mRNA and two receptor protein species of Mr 90,000 and 73,000, representing mature and precursor forms, respectively, were expressed in adult and developing rat nervous tissue, starting at fetal day 14.5. The receptor was capable of ligand binding because it was purified by ligand affinity chromatography, and human chorionic gonadotropin and LH were able to displace 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin binding to fetal head membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, two 5′-flanking sequences (∼ 2 and 4 kb) of the rat LHR gene were shown to direct expression of the lacZ reporter to specific areas of the peripheral and central nervous system in fetal and adult transgenic mice, especially to structures associated with sensory, memory, reproductive behavior, and autonomic functions. Importantly, the transgene activity was confined to neurons and colocalized with the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that the neuronal LHR is a functional protein, implicating a role in neuronal development and function, possibly by means of regulating synthesis of neurosteroids.

Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Like other GPCRs, the leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs (LGRs) are integral membrane proteins with seven transmembrane domains but diverge structurally in having a large extracellular N-terminal domain that is involved in ligand binding (3.Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4.Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In mammals this GPCR subfamily contains glycoprotein hormone receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH), chorionic gonadotropin (CG), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (designated LH receptor (LHR), FSHR, and TSHR, respectively) as well as several recently identified novel receptors, most of which are still orphans (5.Hsu S.Y.

These novel LGRs appear to have a wide and divergent distribution, which implicates roles in reproductive, renal, cardiovascular, and brain functions as well as in tissue and organ development. In contrast, the more canonical LGRs, the LHR, FSHR, and TSHR, have been thought to display a more restricted tissue distribution, being essential in regulating development and function of the gonads (LHR and FSHR) and the thyroid gland (TSHR) (10.Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 11.Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Ascoli M. Fanelli F.

LHR, however, appears to be expressed in extragonadal tissues as well because increasing evidence suggests that the receptor may be present also in the reproductive tract (13.Reshef E. Lei Z.M.

Metab. 1993; 77: 1706-1714PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the receptor has been shown to be expressed in the nervous tissue because the rat, bovine, and human brains were reported to contain mRNA transcripts for LHR (17.Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Kornyei J.L. Licht P. Hiatt E.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the existence of LHR protein in the nervous tissue has remained controversial and, furthermore, the developmental changes in the neuronal LHR expression have not been investigated thoroughly. Here we demonstrate that the LHR mRNA is present in rat nervous tissue and is translated into receptor protein that is capable of specific high affinity ligand binding. Two receptor species of Mr 90,000 and 73,000 were expressed in the brain, representing mature and precursor receptor forms, respectively. In addition, rat LHR promoter fragments of 2,060 and 3,970 bp were shown to direct expression of the lacZ reporter to spatially restricted areas of the peripheral and central nervous system in fetal and adult transgenic mice, particularly to regions involved in olfaction and other sensory functions. The transgene activity colocalized with the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) to the same neurons, suggesting a putative regulatory role for the LHR in neurosteroid synthesis. The LHR, therefore, has a wider tissue distribution and possibly more diverse functional roles than has been anticipated previously. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Sprague-Dawley rats were used for preparing tissues for RT-PCR, receptor purification, and ligand binding assays. To time the developmental stage of the fetuses, females were housed with males, and the following morning was designated day 0.5 of pregnancy (0.5 days postcoitum, dpc), when the vaginal plug was detected. Immature female rats (25–27 days old) were rendered pseudopregnant as described previously (18.Keinänen K.P. Kellokumpu S. Metsikkö M.K. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7920-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pregnant and pseudopregnant females as well as adult males (90 days) were killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide, and the tissues were removed immediately, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The use of animals was approved by the University of Oulu committee for the care of experimental animals. RT-PCR—Four oligonucleotide primers of 29–36 nucleotides were designed based on the rat LHR sequence (GenBank accession M26199 (19.McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar)), as depicted in Fig. 1A. Primers 1 (nucleotides–27 to +9 from translation initiation site) and 2 (nucleotides +2116 to +2084) were used for RT-PCR and primers 3 (nucleotides +65 to +97) and 4 (nucleotides +1887 to +1858) for the subsequent nested PCR. Total RNA was extracted from rat tissues using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen), and the RT-PCR was performed as described previously (20.Aatsinki J.T. Lakkakorpi J.T. Pietilä E.M. Rajaniemi H.J. BioTechniques. 1994; 16 (286–288): 282-284PubMed Google Scholar), using modified conditions. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl using 1 μg of total RNA as template and 0.2 μm primers 1 and 2. The reaction mixture contained 50 units of Superase inhibitor (Ambion), 200 μm deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Finnzymes), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), and 2.5 units of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in addition to PCR buffer (Invitrogen). After RT reaction (42 °C, 60 min), the samples were run in PCR for 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, denaturation; 60 °C for 2 min, annealing; 72 °C for 5 min +1 min/cycle, extension). For the second amplification round, 1 μl of the product from the first amplification was used as a template with the slightly intended primers 3 and 4 in the same PCR conditions as described above. The 10-μl PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Immunoprecipitation and Ligand Affinity Chromatography—Total cellular membranes were prepared from rat tissues by homogenizing with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T-25, Janke & Kunkel) in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (∼100 mg/ml) and centrifuging at 100 × g for 10 min. The membrane particles were then collected by centrifuging the supernatant for 30 min at 27,000 × g. After washing with buffer A, the protein concentration in each sample was determined by a Bio-Rad DC assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Membranes from the pseudopregnant rat ovary (1.7 mg), 14.5-dpc fetus head (5.5 mg), 19.5-dpc fetus head (23.6 mg), adult rat thalamus (14 mg) and muscle (20 mg) were then solubilized by stirring on ice for 60 min in 500 μl of buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 20% (v/v) glycerol) and centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and subjected to immunoprecipitation or ligand affinity chromatography. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a purified anti-rabbit antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of the rat LHR (Gly620–His674). 2J. T. Aatsinki and H. J. Rajaniemi, unpublished data. After adding the antibody (5 μg/ml) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed twice with 500 μl of buffer B, twice with 500 μl of buffer C (buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.36 m NaCl), and twice with 500 μl of buffer D (buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The receptors were eluted by incubating the resin for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Ligand affinity chromatography was performed using hCG-Affi-Gel 10, which was prepared as described previously (18.Keinänen K.P. Kellokumpu S. Metsikkö M.K. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7920-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized receptors were incubated with 20 μl of the resin overnight at 4 °C, washed, and eluted as described above. Deglycosylation of the Immunoprecipitated LHRs—Immunoprecipitated receptors from the pseudopregnant rat ovary (1.1 mg of membrane protein) and the 19.5-dpc fetus head (7.9 mg of membrane protein) were deglycosylated after elution from protein G-Sepharose with 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Before the enzyme reaction, the eluates were diluted 5-fold with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm 1,10-phenanthrolene (Endoglycosidase H, Roche Applied Science) or 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm 1,10-phenanthrolene (peptide N-glycosidase F, Roche Applied Science). The enzymes were added at final concentrations of 60 milliunits/ml (Endoglycosidase H) and 20 units/ml (peptide N-glycosidase F). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitated and ligand affinity-purified receptors were reduced by heating for 2 min at 95 °C in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol before SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gels and 7.5% separating gels). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and probed with the anti-rabbit antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of the rat LHR (0.12 μg/ml). 2J. T. Aatsinki and H. J. Rajaniemi, unpublished data. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences were used to reveal the blotted proteins. The molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were detected by staining with Ponceau S. Radioligand Binding Assays—The hormone binding characteristics of the membrane-bound rat LHRs were determined by competition binding experiments. Total cellular membranes were prepared as described above, and samples from the pseudopregnant rat ovary (6.5 μg) and the 19.5-dpc fetus head (285 μg) were incubated with 1.8 nm [125I]hCG in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG (9 fm–70 nm), hLH (9 fm–75 nm), or hFSH (36 nm) in a final volume of 150 μl of buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and counted for 125I radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled hCG (350 nm). Analysis of the binding data was performed using the GraphPad Prism version 3.02. The hCG was radioiodinated with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) by the chloramine-T method as described previously (18.Keinänen K.P. Kellokumpu S. Metsikkö M.K. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7920-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled hCG (16,600 units/mg) and the unlabeled hormones used for competition (hCG, 6,300 units/mg; hLH, 11,000 units/mg and hFSH, 7,000 units/mg) were from Sigma. Promoter Constructs and Production and Analysis of the Transgenic Mice—The rat LHR promoter constructs (see Fig. 4A) carried genomic EcoRI-XhoI fragments of the 5′-flanking region (–2,060 or–3,970 bp from translation initiation site) of the rat LHR gene in front of the reporter gene in the lacZ vector pNASSβ (Clontech). The constructs were released from the vector sequences by EcoRI, SalI or SalI, PstI digestion, and the gel-purified constructs were microinjected into pronuclei of (C57BL/6 × DBA)F2 mouse zygotes (21.Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar), after which they were transferred into the oviduct of pseudopregnant NMRI mice. Founder animals were identified from the tail DNA by PCR analysis using lacZ-specific primers (22.Hanley T. Merlie J.P. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 56PubMed Google Scholar). 22 transgenic founder mice were mated with C57BL/6 mice for litter production, and 11 of these produced offspring expressing the transgene. Fetuses and tissue samples from the adult mice were collected as described above and fixed in 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) at 4 °C for 1–24 h depending on the sample size. The fixed samples were washed three times for 15 min with the washing buffer (5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.02% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) and stained overnight in 0.1% (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, MBI Fermentas), 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6 x 3 H2O in the washing buffer. After staining, the samples were washed and postfixed overnight in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and observed under a stereoscope as whole mounts or, alternatively, were frozen or embedded into paraffin. The frozen samples were sectioned at 5 μm and counterstained with safranin. The paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sectioned at 10 μm and used for immunohistochemistry. A mouse monoclonal antibody for neuronal nuclei (NeuN, Chemicon International) and a polyclonal rabbit antibody for bovine S-100 protein (DakoCytomation) were used to detect neurons and glial cells, respectively. A polyclonal rabbit antibody for the P450scc (Chemicon International) was used to detect steroidogenic cells. Subsequent biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase complex detection systems for the S-100, NeuN, and P450scc antibodies were used according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Detection of the LHR mRNA in Developing and Adult Rat Tissues—To evaluate the overall spatial and temporal tissue expression pattern of the LHR, total RNA was isolated from adult and fetal rat tissues and subjected to RT-PCR, followed by nested PCR for amplification of the products. The primers used (Fig. 1A) were chosen to flunk the entire coding region of the LHR to amplify cDNAs with full-length open reading frames. To assess the expression in the fetal brain, the head, middle trunk, and lower trunk of the 14.5-dpc and the 19.5-dpc fetuses were isolated to separate the brain from the developing gonads, which in male fetuses start to express the full-length LHR mRNA at 15.5 dpc (23.Zhang F.P. Hämäläinen T. Kaipia A. Pakarinen P. Huhtaniemi I. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2206-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the expression pattern of the LHR transcripts isolated from the various adult and fetal tissues. Three major products of 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 kb were obtained from the adult testis (lane 1), ovary (lane 11), and placenta (lane 10), whereas muscle (lane 13) and liver (lane 14) showed no amplification of the LHR mRNA. The 1.9- and 1.7-kb species correspond to the full-length LHR and the most common receptor isoform, respectively (24.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Aatsinki J.T. Pietilä E.M. Lakkakorpi J.T. Rajaniemi H.J. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas the 1.8-kb species most likely represents a hybrid of the 1.9- and 1.7-kb products (27.Pietilä E.M. Aatsinki J.T. Rajaniemi H.J. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 47: 5-14PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the nested primers used in the second amplification run, the final products were slightly (∼200 bp) smaller than the original cDNA. The three major mRNA products were also obtained from the adult nervous tissue (e.g. from trigeminal ganglion, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and pituitary; lanes 6, 8, 9, and 7, respectively), but the spinal cord showed no amplification of the LHR mRNA (lane 12). The three major products were also amplified from the heads of the 14.5-dpc (lane 5) and the 19.5-dpc (lane 4) fetuses. However, the amount of the LHR mRNA transcripts in the nervous system appears to be very low because the transcripts were detected only after the second amplification round. Interestingly, several smaller mRNA transcripts were also observed, possibly representing developmental stage- or tissue-specific isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of the primary transcript (23.Zhang F.P.

This was especially evident in the pituitary (lane 7), which exhibited unique sized mRNAs compared with the other brain areas. Taken together, the LHR appears to be expressed at the mRNA level in several regions of the developing and adult nervous system in a manner similar to that of the LGR5–8 (5.Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G.

Detection of LHR Protein in Rat Nervous Tissue—The results shown suggest that the full-length LHR mRNA is expressed in both the adult and fetal rat nervous tissue, albeit at a low level. To determine whether the receptor is also expressed at the protein level, Triton X-100-solubilized membranes were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a LHR-specific polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of the protein. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by Western blotting using the same antibody for detection. As shown in Fig. 2A, the LHR-specific antibody immunoprecipitated two bands with apparent molecular masses of 90,000 and 73,000 from the pseudopregnant rat ovary (lane 1), which were not detected when the antibody was replaced with a nonimmune serum (data not shown). This indicates that they specifically represent the expressed LHR. Furthermore, the two bands were not immunoprecipitated from muscle (lane 5), in accordance with the absence of the LHR mRNA in this tissue (see Fig. 1B, lane 13). The two LHR species of Mr 90,000 and 73,000 were also immunoprecipitated from the 14.5-dpc (lane 3) and the 19.5-dpc fetus heads (lane 2) as well as from the adult thalamus (lane 4). Importantly, the two receptor species were also purified by ligand affinity chromatography (Fig. 2B), indicating that the LHR expressed in the nervous system is capable of ligand binding. The data presented above show that two different LHR forms were immunoprecipitated from the rat ovaries and nervous tissue. To find out whether these two forms differ in their post-translational modifications, i.e. carbohydrates, the immunoprecipitated receptors were subjected to glycosidase treatments. Endoglycosidase H reduced the molecular mass of the Mr 73,000 LHR to about 62,000 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6), indicating that it represents the full-length receptor bearing high mannose-type oligosaccharides because Endoglycosidase H selectively removes unprocessed high mannose type oligosaccharides from glycoproteins (30.Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr, T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The resistance of the Mr 90,000 receptor species to the Endoglycosidase H treatment suggests that this species contains complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6). This interpretation was supported by the fact that peptide N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that can remove all types of N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins (30.Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr, T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), was able to digest the Mr 90,000 receptor (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the LHR protein is expressed in the adult and fetal rat nervous system. The Mr 90,000 and 73,000 receptor forms contain either fully or partially processed oligosaccharides, respectively, thus representing mature and precursor forms of the receptor. Furthermore, the data indicate that the receptor protein is processed in a similar manner in the ovaries and in the neuronal tissue. Characterization of the Ligand Binding Ability of the Rat LHR Expressed in the Fetal Nervous Tissue—The ability of the neuronal LHR to bind ligand was tested directly in competition binding experiments by incubating crude membrane particles from the 19.5-dpc fetal rat heads with [125I]hCG in the presence of an increasing amount of unlabeled hCG, hLH, or hFSH. As expected, both hCG and hLH inhibited binding of [125I]hCG in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibition of binding obtained at concentrations of 0.10 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.E.) nm and 2.63 ± 0.46 nm, respectively (Fig. 3). In contrast, hFSH was not able to displace [125I]hCG binding, confirming the hormone binding specificity of the neuronal LHR. The inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) obtained for hCG (0.08 ± 0.04 nm) was in good agreement with that reported previously for rat gonadal LHRs (12.Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 31.Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) for hCG, determined from the homologous competition experiments, was 31.5 ± 1.1 fmol/mg membrane protein in the fetal heads compared with 3.68 ± 0.22 pmol/mg in the pseudopregnant rat ovaries. LHR Promoter-driven Transgene Expression in the Fetal and Adult Mouse Nervous System—To examine regional and cell type-specific expression of the LHR in the fetal and adult nervous tissue in more detail, we generated transgenic mice, which carried the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the rat LHR promoter fragments of 2,060 and 3,970 bp in length (Fig. 4A). These two promoter fragments were chosen because the basal activity of the rat LHR gene is known to involve –180 nucleotides, and sequences further upstream possess elements directing the cell- and tissue-specific basal promoter activity (32.Ji, I., Koo, Y. B., and Ji, T. H. (1994) Endocr. J. 279–287Google Scholar, 33.Nelson S. Liu X. Noblett L. Fabritz J. Ascoli M.

The promoter constructs were microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs, and the progenies were tested for transgenicity from the tail DNA with the lacZ-specific PCR screening. The expression of the lacZ gene was examined by whole-mount staining of the fetuses and adult tissues with the chromogenic substrate X-gal. The 2,060- and 3,970-bp LHR promoter fragments were able to direct expression of the lacZ gene in three and eight transgenic mouse lines, respectively. All of these expressed β-galactosidase in the gonads in a similar manner, 3P. M. Apaja, U. E. Petäjä-Repo, and H. J.

The requirement of protein synthesis inhibition for efficient killing suggests that CD40 transduces potent survival signals capable of suppressing its pro-apoptotic effects. We have found that inhibition of CD40 signaling on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and ERK MAPK but not on the p38 MAPK axis disrupts this balance and sensitizes carcinoma cells to CD40-mediated cell death. The CD40-mediated PI3K and ERK activities were found to converge on the regulation of protein synthesis in carcinoma cells via a pathway involving the activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk) and p70S6 kinases, upstream of the translation elongation factor eEF2. In addition, CD40 ligation was found to mediate a PI3K- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its subsequent dissociation from the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E as well as an ERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E, thus promoting translation initiation. Concomitantly, the antiapoptotic protein cFLIP was found to be induced in CD40 ligand-stimulated carcinoma cells in a PI3K-, ERK-, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner and down-regulation of cFLIPS expression sensitized to CD40-mediated carcinoma cell death. These data underline the significance of the PI3K and ERK pathways in controlling the balance between CD40-mediated survival and death signals through the regulation of the protein synthesis machinery. Pharmacological agents that target this machinery or its upstream kinases could, therefore, be exploited for CD40-based tumor therapy.

The key role of the CD40-CD40L duet in orchestrating immune responses is exemplified by clinical data from patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome, a rare immune disorder caused by mutations in the CD40L gene. In these patients thymus-dependent responses to antigens such as immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production are impaired, with consequent deficiency in germinal center formation, recurrent infections, and high frequency of carcinomas and lymphomas (3.Callard R.E.

Etzioni A. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Cosyns M. Weinberg A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 977-983PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its expression in normal lymphoid cells, CD40 is also found in a variety of malignant cells, including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas of the ovary, nasopharynx, liver, bladder, and breast (5.Young L.S. Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Dawson C.W. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 502-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, in marked contrast to the proliferative effects of CD40 ligation on normal B lymphocytes, CD40 stimulation in malignant lymphoid cells results in growth retardation both in vitro and in vivo, indicating a cell type/differentiation state-dependent response to CD40 ligation (6.Funakoshi S. Longo D.L. Beckwith M. Conley D.K. Tsarfaty G. Tsarfaty I. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Murphy W.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Baker M.P. Eliopoulos A.G.

This treatment also promotes the endogenous production of cytotoxic ligands of the TNF family, such as FasL, TNF-α, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and results in low levels of apoptosis in carcinoma cells grown in vitro or in severe combined immunodeficiency mice as human ovarian or breast tumor xenografts (9.Hirano A.

This observation suggests that CD40 transduces potent survival signals which counterbalance its apoptosis-inducing effects. In view of the potential therapeutic role of CD40L in carcinomas, we wished to probe the CD40-activated signaling pathways that mediate anti-apoptotic responses and evaluate the hypothesis that inhibition of these pathways may enhance the susceptibility of carcinoma cells to CD40L-induced cell death.

To generate RAd-dn p85, the cDNA for dominant-negative p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was cloned into a transfer vector, and a replication deficient adenovirus expressing this molecule was generated by homologous recombination with the Ad-Easy1 vector in BJ5183 cells. The virus produced was expanded in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and a passage 4 virus was collected, purified, and used to infect cells, as previously described (12.Eliopoulos A.G. Davies C.

RSK1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and Mnk antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The 4E-BP1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. R. Denton, University of Bristol, UK. For immunoblotting, 15–30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. After 3 washes with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody and for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For cFLIP immunoblots, 80 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Biotrace nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The NF6 antibody from Alexis Biochemicals was used for detection of cFLIPL/S. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For PI3K assays, Rat-1/CD40 cells were seeded at 1.2 × 106/60-mm dishes in complete media and allowed to adhere overnight. After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were stimulated with rsCD40L and lysed in situ with PI3K lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). 500 μg of protein was pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered using Protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry), and unbound protein was removed by washing 4 times with PI3K lysis buffer, twice with a LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and twice with a NaCl buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Beads were resuspended in buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (reconstituted in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.

To recover radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol, 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) was added, vortexed vigorously, and pulse-centrifuged. 40 μl of the lower organic phase was separated by thin layer chromatography in a pre-equilibrated with propan-1-ol, 2 m acetic acid (65:35) tank. Dried plates were quantitated by phosphorimaging. The p90Rsk and p70S6 peptide kinase assays were performed as previously describe (18.Eliopoulos A.G. Dumitru C.D. Wang C.-C. Cho J. Tsichlis P.N.

After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with lysis buffer, and beads were resuspended in a small volume of lysis buffer and SDS/PAGE loading buffer. After denaturation, immunoprecipitates were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to standard Western blotting for eIF4E and 4EBP1. Protein synthesis was assessed as previously described (19.Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

We confirmed that CD40 ligation engages this signaling pathway in non-lymphoid cells by performing in vitro kinase assays using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from CD40L-stimulated Rat-1/CD40 cultures and phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (Fig. 1A). As a read-out for PI3K activation, the effects of CD40 ligation on the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, an established PI3K target, were assessed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 or an antibody raised against total (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) Akt. The results of these experiments confirmed that CD40 ligation promotes a transient increase in the phosphorylation of Akt in both Rat-1/CD40 and HeLa/CD40 cells. Furthermore, this effect was found to occur in a PI3K-dependent manner, as CD40L-induced Akt phosphorylation was abolished by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 (Figs. 1, B and C). We then proceeded to assess whether PI3K signals are involved in the protection against CD40-mediated carcinoma cell death. To this end, serum-starved HeLa/CD40 clone 13 cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitors and then co-cultured with rsCD40L for 48 h. The results showed that although rsCD40L alone induced ∼10% cell death above background, pretreatment with LY294002 or wortmannin significantly augmented this effect to 45% (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Neither of these inhibitors affected the levels of CD40 expression in these cells (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in other HeLa/CD40 clones as well as in Rat-1/CD40 fibroblasts but not in vector control-transfected cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of EJ bladder carcinoma cells, which naturally express CD40 (8.Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Mosialos G. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Armitage R.J. Dawson J. Zapata J.M. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Reed J.C. Kieff E. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2243-2254PubMed Google Scholar) with 20 μm LY294002, also resulted in a significant increase in CD40L-induced apoptosis such that more than 30% of the cells were killed in the presence of both agents (Fig. 1D). However, LY294002 did not enhance the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin and did not result in susceptibility of HeLa/CD40 cells to IGF-1 or epidermal growth factor stimulation (data not shown). To confirm that the effects of these chemical inhibitors reflect a specific phenomenon, we generated a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expressing a dominant-negative form of p85 (RAd-dn p85), the regulatory subunit of PI3K, for its efficient delivery to the majority of target cells. The p85 PI3K has recently been shown to be recruited in the CD40 signaling complex (21.Deregibus M.C. Buttiglieri S. Russo S. Bussolati B. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Infection of HeLa/CD40 cultures with RAd-dn p85 resulted in significant sensitization to apoptosis after treatment with rsCD40L but not IGF-1 (Fig. 1E and data not shown). We conclude that CD40 transduces PI3K-dependent survival signals in carcinoma cell lines and fibroblasts capable of counteracting the apoptosis-inducing effects of CD40 ligation. ERK but Not p38 MAPK Activation Counteracts CD40-transduced Death Signals in Carcinoma Cells—Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in certain anti-apoptotic responses. Earlier studies suggested that CD40 stimulation does not engage the ERK MAPK pathway (22.Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23.Sakata N. Patel H.R. Terada N. Aruffo A. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Taking into account the controversy surrounding the ability of CD40 to transduce ERK signals, we examined the effects of CD40 ligation on ERK phosphorylation, a surrogate for its activation. In parallel, we assessed whether CD40 also engages the p38 MAPK pathway in carcinomas. To this end, HeLa/CD40 cells were stimulated with rsCD40L for 5, 15, 30, or 60 min, and total lysates were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of the ERK isoforms p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 and the p38 MAPK by immunoblot. The results demonstrated a dramatic and rapid activation of ERK and a significant phosphorylation of p38 after CD40 ligation (Figs. 2, A and B). To assess the potential involvement of ERK and p38 in the suppression of CD40-mediated cell death, serum-starved HeLa/CD40 cells were pretreated with SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, or PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1, the upstream kinase of ERK, and then co-cultured with rsCD40L for 48 h. The ability of these compounds to impair CD40L-induced p38 and ERK signaling was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated, active forms of these kinases (Figs. 2, C and D). PD98059 or rsCD40L alone had very little effect on cell viability; however, a 2-fold increase in cell death was noted when the cells were cultured with both agents (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained with a structurally unrelated MEK inhibitor, UO126, which further confirms the specificity of the observed phenomenon (data not shown). PD98059 also synergized with LY294002 to further potentiate CD40-mediated cell death (data not shown). Unlike the sensitizing effects of PD98059, pretreatment with SB203580 did not increase the susceptibility of HeLa/CD40 cells to CD40L-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2E). We conclude that inhibition of CD40L-induced ERK but not p38 MAPK activation partly sensitizes carcinoma cells to CD40-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, activation of ERK has also been shown to override anti-Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) but not soluble TNF-α-mediated cell death in the same cell line (27.Tran S.E. Holmstrom T.H. Ahonen M. Kahari V.M. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). CD40 Ligation Promotes de Novo Protein Synthesis in Carcinoma Cells That Is Dependent on the Activation of PI3K and ERK—The preceding data demonstrate a critical role for the PI3K and ERK in counteracting the apoptotic function of activated CD40. This PI3K and ERK-mediated resistance to CD40-induced cell death may depend on or occur independently (i.e. upstream) of de novo protein synthesis. To address this question, we treated HeLa/CD40 cells with IGF, epidermal growth factor, or a combination of these growth factors in the presence of rsCD40L and CHX, and apoptosis was quantitated 48 h later. IGF-1 and epidermal growth factor potently activated the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways, respectively, but failed to rescue these cells from the cytotoxic effects of CD40L and CHX treatment (data not shown). This finding suggests that CD40-transduced PI3K and ERK signals promote resistance to CD40L-induced apoptosis in carcinoma cells through the regulation of de novo synthesis of some crucial anti-apoptotic protein(s). The ability of CD40 to affect protein synthesis is, however, unknown. Measurements of the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein revealed that CD40 ligation in serum-starved HeLa/CD40 cells induces a substantial 30–40% increase in the overall rates of protein synthesis compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 3A). This increase was comparable with the levels of induction caused by treatment with insulin, the “prototypic” inducer of de novo protein synthesis in epithelial cells (28.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Although LY294002 and PD98059 partly affected the background levels of [35S]methionine incorporation, pretreatment with these inhibitors but not SB203580 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of CD40L-mediated protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that CD40-activated PI3K and ERK signals regulate de novo protein synthesis, thereby promoting the production of critical survival proteins that counteract the apoptosis-inducing effects of CD40 ligation. CD40 Ligation Promotes the Activation of the Ribosomal S6 Kinase and the Disruption of the 4E-BP1/eIF4E Complex in a PI3K-dependent Manner—To confirm the ability of CD40 ligation to promote protein synthesis and probe the mechanisms by which CD40-activated PI3K and ERK signals influence this phenomenon, we first examined the effects of CD40 ligation on the phosphorylation of p70S6k and 4E-BP1, two proteins that have been implicated in the control of translation of cytoplasmic RNAs (28.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 29.Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The activation of p70S6k results in the phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 that drives the translation of 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract RNAs and also contributes to the phosphorylation of eEF2k, the upstream kinase of the elongation factor eEF2 (30.Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 promotes its dissociation from eIF4E, the translation initiation factor that binds the cap structure (7-methylguanosine triphosphate) present at the 5′ termini of mRNAs, thereby allowing cap-dependent translation. The levels of p70S6k phosphorylation were examined by immunoblot in lysates from CD40-stimulated HeLa/CD40 cells using an antibody that detects p70S6k phosphorylated at Thr389, a critical site for its activation (31.Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), or an antibody that detects the protein independently of its phosphorylation status. The results showed that CD40 ligation promotes a significant increase in p70S6k phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, CD40-mediated p70S6k activation was blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 but only marginally affected by PD98059 (Fig. 4A). The regulation of p70S6k is complex and involves the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR. Consistent with an mTOR-dependent input in p70S6k activation, CD40L-induced p70S6k phosphorylation was significantly decreased in HeLa/CD40 cells pretreated with the mTOR specific inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 4A). The ability of CD40 to promote PI3K- and mTOR-dependent p70S6k activation was confirmed by using kinase assays in HeLa/CD40 cells stimulated with rsCD40L (Fig. 4B). To ascertain whether CD40 ligation influences 4E-BP1 phosphorylation status and function, serum-starved HeLa/CD40 cells were stimulated with rsCD40L and analyzed for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by immunoblot, using an antibody against 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Thr70 or an antibody that detects total protein. Furthermore, 4E-BP1/eIF4E assembly was evaluated by using m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography (30.Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The results showed that CD40 ligation promotes both the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from the translation initiation factor eIF4E (Figs. 4, C and D). Pretreatment with LY294002 or rapamycin inhibited the ability of CD40 to promote the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from cap-bound eIF4E (Fig. 4C). Taken together these data provide a link between CD40-mediated PI3K activation and initiation of translation through the modulation of p70S6k and 4E-BP1 function. Importantly, pretreatment with the mTOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin renders HeLa/CD40 cells susceptible to CD40L-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4E). CD40 Ligation Promotes the Phosphorylation of the Serine/Threonine Kinase Mnk1 and Its Downstream Target eIF4E in an ERK-dependent Manner—Mnk1, a MAPK substrate, promotes the phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209 in vitro and in vivo. The effects of CD40 ligation on the phosphorylation of Mnk1 and eIF4E were assessed in HeLa/CD40 cells stimulated with rsCD40L. Immunoblot analysis was performed in total cell extracts using antibodies that specifically recognize Mnk1 and eIF4E phosphorylated at Thr197/202 and Ser209, respectively. The results showed a substantial induction of Mnk1 and eIF4E phosphorylation after CD40 ligation, which was maximal at 15 min and decreased thereafter (Figs. 5, A and B, and data not shown). To identify the CD40-activated signaling pathways that are responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation, HeLa/CD40 cells were pretreated with PD98059, SB203580, or rapamycin and then stimulated with rsCD40L for 15 min. Protein extracts from these cells or from untreated control cultures were analyzed for eIF4E phosphorylation by immunoblot. Although both ERK and p38 MAPKs have been shown to target Mnk1 (32.Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), PD98059 but not SB203580 suppressed CD40L-induced eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). It is possible that p38 activation is dispensable for Mnk1 phosphor"

We monitored Na+-dependent Zn2+ transport in HEK293 cells and cortical neurons, using fluorescent imaging. Treatment of the HEK293 cells with CaPO4 precipitates induced Na+-dependent Zn2+ extrusion, against a 500-fold transmembrane zinc gradient, or zinc influx upon reversal of Na+ gradient, thus indicating that Na+/Zn2+ exchange is catalyzing active Zn2+ transport.

To our knowledge, the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger described here is the first example of a mammalian transport mechanism capable of Na+-dependent active extrusion of zinc.

Extracellular free zinc may reach micromolar concentrations in the brain, pancreatic islets, and in seminal fluid (1Vogt K. Mellor J. Tong G. Nicoll R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In contrast, free intracellular zinc ([Zn2+]i) concentrations range from picomolar to nanomolar. Such a steep electrochemical gradient (2Canzoniero L.M. Sensi S.L. Choi D.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), which may even exceed the transmembrane calcium gradient, has fundamental physiological and pathophysiological implications. For example, influx of zinc into hippocampal neurons has been suggested to play a role in the induction of long term potentiation (LTP) in CA3 neurons (4Li Y. Hough C.J. Frederickson C.J. Sarvey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8015-8025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, zinc influx induces gene expression (6Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Regulation of extracellular zinc may also be important for modulation of zinc signaling via the recently characterized zinc sensing receptor (7Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Epileptic seizures or transient global ischemia typically result in the release of massive amounts of zinc into the synaptic cleft, a phenomenon that leads to increase of [Zn2+]i, and is considered to play a key role in neuronal cell death following these episodes (8Suh S.W. Chen J.W. Motamedi M. Bell B. Listiak K. Pons N.F. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 9Frederickson C.J. Hernandez M.D. McGinty J.F. Brain Res. 1989; 480: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Similarly, zinc permeation into pancreatic β-cells leads to islet destruction occurring in streptozotocin-induced diabetes (10Kim B.J. Kim Y.H. Kim S. Kim J.W. Koh J.Y. Oh S.H. Lee M.K. Kim K.W. Lee M.S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The steep transmembrane zinc gradient, characterizing mammalian cells, must be maintained by an active mechanism that extrudes cellular zinc. Such a mechanism is also essential for protecting cells against excessive intracellular zinc. In plants and yeast, a H+/Zn2+ exchanger catalyzes the active extrusion of zinc into vacuoles (11Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Much less is known about such mechanisms in mammalian cells. Although proton/zinc exchange activity has been demonstrated in plasma membrane vesicles derived from brain cells (12Colvin R.A. Davis N. Nipper R.W. Carter P.A. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that the small magnitude of the proton electrochemical gradient is sufficient to catalyze the formation of steep Zn2+ gradients across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. Reversal of Na+/Ca2+ activity has been suggested to be involved in the accumulation of zinc in neurons but not in the efflux of neuronal zinc (13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, other studies have suggested that zinc allosterically inhibits cation transport mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (14Colvin R.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ZnT-1 is yet another protein suggested as a mediator of zinc efflux, and its expression was shown to confer resistance against zinc toxicity and to lower intracellular zinc (15Kim A.H. Sheline C.T. Tian M. Higashi T. McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Choi D.W. Brain Res. 2000; 886: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if ZnT-1 is a transporter per se, a regulator of zinc transport, or whether it catalyzes zinc extrusion against a zinc transmembrane gradient (17Cousins R.J. McMahon R.J. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1384S-1387SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the identity of an active cellular zinc extrusion mechanism in mammalian tissues remains to be elucidated. In the present report, we provide evidence that novel Na+-dependent Zn2+ exchange activity can be induced. Utilizing the transmembrane electrochemical Na+ gradient, this exchanger catalyzes active extrusion of cellular zinc against an estimated 500-fold zinc gradient. Such a transporter could play a major role in the transport of zinc in tissues such as the brain, prostate, and pancreas. Cell Cultures and Plasmid Transfection—HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell line) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (18Sekler I. Lo R.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28751-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment with calcium phosphate (CaPO4) precipitates was performed using the protocol for cell transfection, without plasmids, on a 20–30% confluent culture (19Graham F.L. Eb A.J.v.d. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). The CaPO4 treatment is identical to the classical transfection protocols, and in agreement with pervious studies (18Sekler I.

Transport experiments were carried out 30–48 h following CaPO4 treatment. Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (20Yin H. Turetsky D. Choi D.W. Weiss J.H. Neurobiol.

HEK293 cells grown on cover slides were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm of Fura-2 AM (TefLabs) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in sodium Ringer's solution. Following dye loading, the cells were washed in sodium Ringer's solution and the cover slides mounted in a chamber that allowed perfusion of cells. Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm wavelength light and imaged with a 510-nm-long pass filter (7Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For sodium loading HEK293 cells were treated essentially as previously described (24Gutser U.T. Gleitz J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μm oubain (Sigma) was added to the cells for 4–5 h; intracellular Na+ reached 30–40 mm following the incubation as calibrated in cells loaded with 10 μm SBFI (TefLabs). Zinc imaging in neurons was performed in cultured cortical neurons loaded with Newport Green (5 μm, 60 min at 25 °C).

Newport Green excitation was at 490 nm, emission at 530 nm, and calibrated zinc values were calculated as described previously (13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A.

The results shown are the means of four to six independent experiments, with averaged responses from 30–50 cells in each experiment. Assays for Zinc and Calcium Transport—The zinc influx assay aimed to study the reversibility of the exchanger was performed by perfusing the cells with a Na+-free (NMG) Ringer's containing 400 μm zinc (reversal medium). Active zinc efflux was monitored by first loading the cells with zinc by perfusion with the reversal medium reaching a steady state at about 80 nm of [Zn2+]i. Cells were then perfused with Na+ Ringer's containing 50 μm zinc. Zinc transport mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers was monitored using the zinc influx assay (using reversal medium) in cells heterologously expressing the cardiac or the neuronal isoform of this exchanger. When [Zn2+]i reached a steady state the perfusing solution was switched to Na+ Ringer's solution containing the intracellular zinc chelator, TPEN (50 μm), for 30–60 s, and then TPEN was removed by washing the cells with Na+ Ringer's solution. Rates of calcium transport were determined while perfusing the cells with Na+-free Ringer's solution. Cells were depleted of ATP, by incubation in Ringer's solution containing 10 mm KCN and 5 mm deoxyglucose for 10 min as described previously (25Wang Y.H. Li F. Schwartz J.H. Flint P.J. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1667-C1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc transport was monitored immediately following the ATP depletion using Ringer's solution containing deoxyglucose instead of glucose. During our studies of zinc transporters heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, we also monitored zinc transport in mock-transfected cells. Massive zinc influx was observed in cells (Fig. 1) perfused with Na+-free Ringer's solution containing 400 μm zinc, which were pretreated with CaPO4 precipitate according to a standard transfection protocol. Such zinc influx was not observed in cells treated with FuGENE 6, nor did it require the presence of plasmid, indicating that the CaPO4 treatment induced zinc transport activity. Zinc transport was monitored using Fura-2, which has 100-fold greater affinity to zinc than to calcium (6Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Dehaye J.P. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1995; 9: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to confirm that the increase in Fura-2 fluorescence shown in Fig. 1 is indeed related to the rise in [Zn2+]i, we performed the following experiment (Fig. 2); Fura-2 loaded cells were initially perfused with Na+-free Ringer's. Addition of extracellular zinc (200 μm) resulted in an increase of Fura-2 fluorescence, to about 80 nm[Zn2+]i. Subsequent application of the membrane-permeable heavy metal chelator, TPEN, resulted in reduction of fluorescence to background level, indicating that the observed changes in fluorescence were related to changes in [Zn2+]i. Taken together, our results indicate that treatment of the HEK293 cells with CaPO4 precipitates induced the acceleration of zinc influx.Fig. 2Changes in Fura-2 fluorescence are related to intracellular zinc level. HEK293 cells treated with CaPO4 precipitates and loaded with Fura-2 were perfused with 200 μm zinc in sodium-free solution. Following the fluorescent increase to steady state, TPEN (50 μm), a membrane-permeable zinc chelator, was added. The addition of TPEN lead to a decrease in the fluorescent signal back to a baseline level, indicating that changes in Fura-2 fluorescence reflect [Zn]i changes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Active Zinc Transport Is Catalyzed by a Na+-dependent Ion Exchange Mechanism—The increase in Zn2+ influx in the absence of Na+ shown in Fig. 1 may be related to reversal activity of a putative Na+/Zn2+ exchanger triggered by CaPO4 precipitates. To test this hypothesis, treated cells were perfused with Ringer's solution supplemented with 400 μm zinc, containing either Na+ or NMG. As shown in Fig. 3, zinc influx in the absence of Na+ (0.18 ± 0.03 nm/s) was accelerated by about 6-fold compared with influx rate in the presence of Na+ (0.03 ± 0.01 nm/s). If a sodium-dependent zinc exchange mechanism is indeed responsible for the zinc influx, then in the presence of extracellular Na+, acceleration of active zinc efflux would be expected. To address this question, cells were first loaded with zinc using Na+-free Ringer's solution, as described in the legend to Fig. 1, reaching a steady state of 60–80 nm [Zn]i. The rate of zinc efflux against its gradient was then monitored in the absence or presence of Na+. As shown in Fig. 4a, Na+ accelerated the rate of zinc efflux by about 5-fold compared with the efflux rate from zinc loaded cells that were washed with the Na+ free Ringer's solution. Thus, our results indicate that a Na+-dependent zinc efflux is catalyzed in HEK293 cells. Active zinc efflux, such as shown above, may involve either a primary or a secondary active mechanism. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, the rate of zinc efflux was determined in ATP depleted HEK293 cells (25Wang Y.H. Li F. Schwartz J.H. Flint P.J. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1667-C1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig 4b, rates of zinc influx catalyzed by the reversal of activity of the exchanger were similar in the control and the ATP-depleted cells. Rates of active zinc efflux were even slightly (10%) higher in ATP-depleted cells, indicating that the active zinc efflux is not catalyzed by a primary pump. Furthermore, because the sequestration of zinc into the mitochondria is totally dependent on intact trans-mitochondrial membrane gradient (27Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Weiss J.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the insensitivity of the Na+/Zn2+ exchange activity to ATP depletion, using cyanide, indicates that the reduction in intracellular zinc does not involve sequestration of zinc into this organelle. Taken together, the Na+ dependence of Zn2+ efflux and influx (Figs. 3 and 4) indicates that a secondary, active, reversible Na+/Zn2+ exchanger catalyzes efflux of zinc against an estimated gradient of 500-fold.Fig. 4Active Zn2+ extrusion in HEK293 cells is Na+-dependent, mediated by a secondary active transport. a, HEK293 cells were loaded with Zn2+ as described in the legend to Fig. 1. When [Zn]i reached a steady state, cells were perfused with Na+-containing or Na+-free Ringer's solutions containing 50 μm zinc and changes in intracellular zinc were monitored. The Na+-dependent zinc efflux, against its electrochemical gradient, indicates that the transport is mediated by Na+/Zn2+ exchange. (0.09 ± 0.01 nm/s and 0.44 ± 0.03 nm/s for NMG and Na+ Ringer's, respectively). b, the effect of ATP depletion on the initial rate of zinc influx (via the exchanger in reverse mode) and efflux (80 nm intracellular zinc against 50 μm extracellular zinc). Initial rates of zinc transport did not decrease following ATP depletion indicating that the transport is not meditated by a primary pump.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sodium and Zinc Dependence of the Na+/Zn2+ Exchanger— The apparent affinity of the external site for zinc was determined by dose response analysis (Fig. 5a), zinc influx was mediated by the reversal of the exchanger (see Fig. 1) while changing extracellular zinc concentration. Fitting the experimental data yielded a Hill coefficient for Zn2+ of 1.4 ± 0.5 and an apparent Km for extracellular zinc of 50 ± 8 μm. The dose response for the Na+ dependence of Zn2+ efflux was determined by monitoring zinc efflux while varying extracellular Na+, iso-osmotically replaced by NMG. As shown in Fig. 5b, the dose response profile of Na+-dependent zinc efflux was sigmoidal, yielding an apparent Km for sodium of 96 ± 4 mm, with an estimated Hill coefficient of 3.5 ± 0.3. To further analyze the coupling between zinc and sodium, we sought to determine whether addition of extracellular Na+ in the presence of saturable, extracellular zinc would inhibit zinc influx. Cells were loaded with Na+ using the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor, oubain (100 μm) (see “Materials and Methods”) and rates of zinc influx were determined in cells perfused with Ringer's containing various concentrations of Na+ (Fig. 5c). Increasing extracellular Na+ concentrations resulted in a reduction of zinc influx rate (Hill coefficient of 2.5 ± 0.5 and apparent Km of 41 ± 5 mm). These results further indicate that zinc transport is coupled to Na+ gradients. Zinc Transport Is Not Mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger— The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is abundantly expressed in brain regions where intense zinc homeostasis activity occurs (29Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 30Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) and upon reversal of the sodium gradient has been suggested to accelerate zinc influx into cortical neurons (13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies indicated that zinc allosterically inhibits neuronal Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (14Colvin R.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger to catalyze zinc transport remains controversial. We have, therefore, assessed the potential role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in catalyzing zinc transport. Brain and cardiac isoforms of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (kindly provided by Prof. Hana Rahamimoff from The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel) were heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells as described above. Cells expressing the various isoforms were loaded with Fura-2 and the rate of zinc influx was first determined. TPEN (50 μm), was used to verify that the fluorescent signal resulted from changes in [Zn2+]i and to lower it to resting level. Subsequently, the rate of Ca2+ transport was determined by perfusing the cells with Na+-free Ringer's solution in which zinc was replaced by Ca2+ (see Fig 6a). Fig. 6b shows a Na+-dependent increase in Ca2+ but not Zn2+ transport in cells expressing either the cardiac or neuronal isoforms of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Thus, our results indicate that neither of these Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms is involved in zinc transport, suggesting that Na+/Zn2+ exchange is catalyzed by a distinct exchanger. We further analyzed changes in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) mRNA levels, using RT-PCR, in HEK293 cells treated with CaPO4 precipitate versus control. No change in mRNA was demonstrated for NCX1 following the CaPO4 treatment (Fig. 6c). Apart from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, the ZnT-1 transporter has been suggested to catalyze active zinc efflux in mammalian cells (16Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed changes in ZnT-1 mRNA levels, using RT-PCR, and did not see any changes either (Fig 6c). In another study we found that expression of ZnT-1 does not lead to an increase in active zinc efflux in HEK293 cells. 2D. Segal, U. Ohana, R. Palty, M. Hershfinkel, A. Moran, and I. Sekler, submitted for publication. Thus, while CaPO4 induces Na+/Zn2+ exchange, it had no effect on ZnT-1 or NCX1 expression, indicating that these proteins are unlikely to be related to Na+/Zn2+ exchange. Sensitivity of the Na+/Zn2+ Exchanger to Inhibitors—The use of inhibitors is an important tool for the functional identification and characterization of an exchanger. We have, therefore, studied the sensitivity of the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger to various inhibitors of cation transporters (Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7b, application of KB-R7943, an inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, failed to inhibit Na+/Zn2+ exchange, further supporting our assertion that it is distinct from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The exchanger was inhibited by 4 mm nickel (Fig. 7, a and b) an inhibitor of sodium and calcium channels as well as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, or 150 μm verapamil, a non-selective calcium channel blocker. In contrast, treatment with the dihydropyridine nifedipine (another calcium channel blocker) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) (the amiloride analogue and Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor) failed to block Na+/Zn2+ exchanger activity (data not shown). Presence of Na+/Zn2+ Exchanger in Cultured Neurons—In neurons, prolonged rise of intracellular free zinc is injurious (5Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 31Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and it is, therefore, critical for these cells to achieve rapid clearance of toxic cytosolic zinc loads. Previous studies suggested a possible role for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as a pathway for Zn2+ extrusion in cortical neuronal cultures (13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the above results in HEK293 cells suggest a Na+-dependent Zn2+ exchanger distinct from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. We therefore studied the role of a Na+/Zn2+ exchanger as a pathway for transmembrane zinc movement in neuronal cells. Zinc fluxes in cortical neurons were determined using Newport Green. This dye, while specific, has a lower affinity for zinc, making it suitable for monitoring the large zinc fluxes encountered in neurons (2Canzoniero L.M. Sensi S.L. Choi D.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To monitor zinc transport, neurons were depolarized using high K+ (60 mm) in Na+-free buffer (sodium replaced by NMG) containing 400 μm zinc. Depolarization of the neurons triggered rapid influx of zinc via LTCC (2Canzoniero L.M. Sensi S.L. Choi D.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular zinc level remained high and fairly stable as long as the neurons were perfused with Na+-free buffer (Fig. 8a). When NMG was replaced with Na+ a steep, ∼10-fold, increase in the rate of zinc efflux was monitored. To determine whether this Na+/Zn2+ exchange could attenuate LTCC-mediated intracellular Zn2+ accumulation, we monitored zinc transport under physiological external sodium and zinc concentrations (32Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J. He Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8a, when cells were depolarized in the presence of Na+ (instead of NMG Ringer's) LTCC-related zinc accumulation decreased and the subsequent rate of zinc efflux increased (calculated rates shown in Fig. 8c). These results indicate that Na+/Zn2+ exchange is indeed playing a physiological role in reducing the accumulation of intracellular zinc concentration in neurons. Application of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, KB-R7943, did not attenuate the effect of external Na+ on intracellular accumulation or the subsequent zinc efflux (Fig. 8, b and c), indicating that the Na+/Zn2+ exchange in neurons is not mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Transmembrane zinc gradients play fundamental physiological and pathophysiological roles in mammalian cells (33Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these gradients and particularly the transporters involved are unknown. We now provide evidence for a Na+/Zn2+ exchanger, which utilizes the electrochemical Na+ gradient, to catalyze the active extrusion of intracellular zinc. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an active zinc extrusion mechanism in mammalian cells. Activity of Na+/Zn2+ exchange is demonstrated by the Na+-dependent extrusion of zinc against a 500-fold zinc gradient. The similar Zn2+ efflux observed in cells that were depleted of ATP argues against a mechanism involving an active ion pump. Lowering of intracellular Zn2+ may also be catalyzed by sequestration into the main organelle for zinc, the mitochondria (28Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 34Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Weiss J.H. Rothe A. Gee K.R. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such sequestration of zinc should be inhibited following the collapse of the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. Thus, the lack of effect following the cyanide treatment (at concentrations sufficient to collapse the mitochondrial trans-membrane gradient) indicates that there is no zinc sequestration. Another important hallmark of an exchanger is demonstrated by the reversibility of the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger activity upon the reversal of the Na+ gradient. The relatively low rates of the Na+/Zn2+ exchange that we monitor (<nm/s) may preclude direct fluorescent and radioisotopic measurement of Na+ transport because of the relatively low affinity and quantum efficiency of Na+-sensitive fluorescent dyes (35Diarra A. Sheldon C. Church J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1623-C1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the relatively high activity of endogenous transporters, e.g. Na+/K+ATPase, that are capable of catalyzing cytoplasmic Na+ transport at millimolar rates (36Despa S. Islam M.A. Pogwizd S.M. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 133-143Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore the present study on the rate of changes of intracellular zinc concentration strongly indicates that in HEK293 cells the reduction in Zni2+ is mediated by a secondary trans-membrane transporter but not by sequestration. We have previously suggested that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger might be involved in zinc transport (13Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings were based on the use of a general cation transport inhibitor and the demonstration of electrogenic Na+-dependent zinc transport. We now demonstrate that the Na+/Zn2+ exchange activity is distinct from the known Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. This is based on our findings that heterologous expression of the neuronal or cardiac isoforms of the exchanger increased the influx rates of Ca2+ but failed to accelerate the rate of Zn2+ transport. In addition, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, KB-R7943, as well as other inhibitors of this exchanger, failed to reduce Na+/Zn2+ exchanger activity in HEK293 and in cultured neurons, further supporting that they are different proteins. Notwithstanding the distinction between the two exchangers, the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger shares several features with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. For example, both catalyze an exchange of divalent ions with Na+, utilizing a similar electrogenic mode of transport. Therefore, the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger may be a novel member of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family. Indeed, the plant H+/Mg2+/Zn2+ exchanger does not catalyze H+/Ca2+ exchange, although it shares 30% homology with the mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (37Shaul O. Hilgemann D.W. de-Almeida-Engler J. Van Montagu M. Inz D. Galili G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3973-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The effect of CaPO4 precipitates on the induction of proteins is well documented in many cell types and numerous papers (38McCarthy G.M. Westfall P.R. Masuda I. Christopherson P.A. Cheung H.S.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 416-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Application of these precipitates has a profound effect, activating the MAP kinase pathway, proto-oncogenes such as c-fos and c-jun and the nuclear transcription factor CREB (41Zeng X.R. Sun Y. Wenger L. Cheung H.S. Cells Tissues Organs. 2003; 174: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All these proteins are partially responsible for induction of gene expression and therefore may play a role also in the induction of the gene involved in Na+/Zn2+ exchange activity (43Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Struve J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CaPO4 treatment is also known to induce the expression of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases (42Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Sun Y. Wenger L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Misra R.R. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1544-1552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Regardless of the induction mechanism, this pretreatment will be an invaluable tool for both the functional screening and the cloning of the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger gene. The ability of the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger to catalyze zinc efflux against a 500-fold transmembrane gradient may have important physiological implications. The rapid and active extrusion of zinc such as that catalyzed by the exchanger is of particular relevance for neurons due to their exposure to high extracellular zinc concentrations and their susceptibility to zinc toxicity following short exposure (8Suh S.W.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3139-3146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger not only effectively attenuates zinc accumulation triggered by the opening of the LTCC, but also significantly accelerates the rate of zinc efflux. Hence, this transporter is capable of playing a key role in protecting brain cells against toxic accumulation of zinc, encountered during excitotoxic syndromes such as ischemia and epilepsy. The Na+/Zn2+ exchanger may also play a role in resting intracellular zinc homeostasis, thus in regulating long term potentiation (LTP), which in the CA3 region of the hippocampus is linked to intracellular zinc concentrations (4Li Y. Hough C.J. Frederickson C.J. Sarvey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8015-8025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ion exchangers also play a key role in the vectorial transport across epithelia (30Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). It will, therefore, be interesting to determine the activity and expression of the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger in tissues such as prostate, where the rate of vectorial zinc transport is particularly high (46Costello L.C. Liu Y. Zou J. Franklin R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17499-17504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of zinc gradients and the pathophysiological implications of its collapse are well recognized. Hence, future study of this novel, active mammalian zinc transport activity is expected to novel insight on the homeostasis of this ion.

Here, we demonstrate that the human FIB N-terminal glycine- and arginine-rich domain (residues 1–77) and its spacer region 1 (78–132) interact with splicing factor 2-associated p32 (SF2A-p32) and that the FIB methyltransferase-like domain (133–321) interacts with protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5, Janus kinase-binding protein 1). We also show that these proteins associate with several additional proteins, including PRMT1, tubulin α3, and tubulin β1 to form a sub-complex that is principally independent of the association of FIB with preribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes that co-immunoprecipitate with the sub-complex in human cells expressing FLAG-tagged FIB.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2.Eichler D.C. Craig N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 197-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). FIB is also found in Cajal bodies, subnuclear organelles that contain distinct components involved in RNA transcription and editing such as mRNA splicing and small nuclear (nucleolar) ribonucleoprotein (sn(o)RNP) biogenesis (3.Snaar S.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2891-2893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FIB is a component of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that contains U3, U8, and U13 small nucleolar RNAs that exhibit consensus sequence elements denoted box C (5′-UGAUGA-3′) and box D (5′-CUGA-3′) (5.Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The FIB RNP associates with Nop56p, Nop5p/58p, and a 15.5-kDa protein (a counterpart of yeast Snu13p) to form box C/D snoRNP complexes that function in site-specific 2′-O-methylation of pre-rRNA (6.Kiss-Laszlo Z.

FIB is the methyltransferase that catalyzes this 2′-O-methylation (10.Omer A.D. Ziesche S. Ebhardt H. Dennis P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). FIB, or Nop1p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is highly conserved in eukaryotes with respect to sequence, structure, and function (11.Schimmang T. Tollervey D. Kern H. Frank R. Hurt E.C.

Deletion of the Nop1 gene in yeast results in inhibition of 2′-O-ribose methylation and pre-rRNA processing at sites A0 to A2, indicating that Nop1p is directly involved in both pre-rRNA methylation and processing and ultimately in ribosome assembly (18.Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Although human FIB is the functional homolog of yeast Nop1p, it only partially complements a yeast nop1-defective mutant (15.Jansen R.P. Hurt E.C. Kern H. Lehtonen H. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lapeyre B. Tollervey D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Human FIB is a nucleolar autoantigen for the non-hereditary immune disease scleroderma (14.Aris J.P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). FIB co-localizes with the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene product in both nucleoli and Cajal bodies/gems of primary neurons (19.Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20.Wehner K.A. Ayala L. Kim Y. Young P.J. Hosler B.A. Lorson C.L. Baserga S.J. Francis J.W. Brain Res. 2002; 945: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SMN is linked to one of the most common inheritable causes of childhood mortality, spinal muscular atrophy (19.Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In fact, a direct interaction between FIB and SMN has been demonstrated, although no functional basis for this interaction has been established, including any involvement of FIB in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. Another protein, the nuclear DEAD box protein p68, an RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase, co-localizes with FIB specifically in nascent nucleoli during telophase (21.Nicol S.M. Causevic M. Prescott A.R. Fuller-Pace F.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As with SMN, no physiological role of its interaction with FIB has been established. Human FIB (∼36 kDa) comprises 321 amino acids and three structural domains (14.Aris J.P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is 66% identical to yeast Nop1p. The N-terminal 80 residues comprise a glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain (14.Aris J.P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) that is also present in Nop1p and Xenopus FIB (Fig. 1) but not in Tetrahymena FIB (17.David E. McNeil J.B. Basile V. Pearlman R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or Methanococcus jannaschii FIB (22.Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The GAR domain is methylated at arginine residues, although the arginine methyltransferase responsible for in vivo methylation has not been identified (23.Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24.Lischwe M.A. Ochs R.L. Reddy R. Cook R.G. Yeoman L.C. Tan E.M. Reichlin M. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14304-14310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GAR domain is responsible for the interaction of FIB with both SMN protein and the DEAD box RNA helicase p68 (19.Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21.Nicol S.M. Causevic M. Prescott A.R. Fuller-Pace F.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A centrally located 90-residue sequence resembles an RNA-binding domain (RBD) present in various snRNPs. This RBD together with the C-terminal α-helix domain and the intervening spacer (spacer region 2) constitutes a methyltransferase-like domain that contains an S-adenosyl methionine-binding motif (14.Aris J.P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22.Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Replacement of two residues in the Nop1p S-adenosyl methionine-binding motif results in temperature sensitivity and a drastic reduction in nascent rRNA transcript methylation under restrictive conditions (18.Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, the methyltransferase-like domain is responsible for FIB methyltransferase activity. The C-terminal α-helix domain is composed of ∼30 residues, and although this domain probably targets FIB to Cajal bodies, spacer region 2 appears to target FIB to the fibrillar regions. However, the targeting of FIB in both instances occurs only in the presence of the RBD (3.Snaar S. Wiesmeijer K. Jochemsen A G. Tanke H.J. Dirks R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that FIB plays a role in ribosome biogenesis within the nucleolus, its role in Cajal bodies is not understood. Our recent studies have used proteomic methodology to characterize a series of preribosomal ribonucleoprotein (pre-rRNP) complexes formed in mammalian cells. We have thus far isolated and analyzed the pre-rRNP complexes associated with human nucleolin (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), parvulin (26.Fujiyama S. Yanagida M. Hayano T. Miura Y. Uchida T. Fujimori F. Isobe T. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Nop56p (27.Hayano T. Yanagida M. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Isobe T. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34309-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate the applicability of proteomic analysis to the study of human ribosome biogenesis and have identified a number of mammalian counterparts of yeast trans-acting factors involved in this process. Furthermore, several candidate mammalian trans-acting factors were identified that were not previously identified in yeast. Here, we present a proteomic analysis of FIB-associated protein complexes. In addition to the association of FIB with pre-rRNP complexes, we found that this protein interacts with a sub-complex containing a minimal set of proteins including SF2A-p32, PRMT5, tubulin α3, tubulin β1, and PRMT1. The FIB GAR domain and the spacer region 1 interact directly with SF2A-p32, whereas the methyltransferase-like domain interacts with PRMT5. These results provide new clues to the precise functions of FIB not only in ribosome biogenesis but also in sn(o)RNP biogenesis and mRNA processing in Cajal bodies.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, FLAG peptide, IGEPAL CA630, RNase A, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (Steinheim, Germany). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Trypsin (sequence grade) was from Promega (Madison, WI) and Achromobacter lyticus protease I (Lys-C) was from WAKO Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). ZipTipC18 was from Millipore (Billerica, MA).

Collagen I-coated Biocoat 8-well culture slides were from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). All other reagents were from WAKO Pure Chemicals. Vectors for Epitope-tagged FIB and FIB Truncation Mutants and Expression in 293EBNA Cells—The FIB expression plasmid was constructed using a PCR-amplified DNA fragment comprising the FIB open reading frame with the FLAG tag at its N terminus (Fig. 1). This fragment was introduced between the NheI and the BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen). The PCR primer set was 5′-ATATATCTAGAGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGAAGCCAGGATTCAGTCCCCGT-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTCAGTTCTTCACCTTGGGGGG-3′, and human placenta cDNA (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) was used as the template. The DNA fragment encoding the FLAG tag along with the nucleolar localization signal (NLS) of HIV Rex (TRRRPRRSQRKR) (28.Hofer L. Weichselbraun I. Quick S. Farrington G.K. Bohnlein E. Hauber J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the SV40 nuclear localization signal (NS) (PKKKRKV) (29.Goldfarb D.S. Gariepy J. Schoolnik G. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1986; 322: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) was synthesized by PCR using the oligonucleotide sets 5′-TATAGCTAGCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGACCCGTCGGAGGCCCCG-3′ and 5′-TCTTTTTCTTTGGGATCGGCGGGGCCTCCGACGGGT-3′, and 5′-GATCCCAAAGAAAAAGAGCCAGCCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATATAGGATCCTACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGG-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned between the NheI and the BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(+), and the resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA3.1-NLS. All the expression plasmids of the FIB deletion mutants were constructed by introducing PCR-amplified fragments between the BamHI and XhoI sites downstream of the FLAG tag/NLS/NS in pcDNA3.1-NLS. Primer sets used for the amplification of FIB deletion mutants were as follows; 5′-ATATAGGATCCAAGCCAGGATTCAGTCCCCGT-3′ and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTCATTTTCCTCCCCGACCACGACC-3′ for FIB I (residues 2–77), 5′-ATATAGGATCCAGAGGAAACCAGTCGGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTCATCGGTACTCAAATTTGTCATC-3′ for FIB II (residues 78–135), 5′-ATATAGGATCCGCCTGGAACCCCTTCCGCTCC-3′ and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTCAGTTCTTCACCTTGGGGGG-3′ for FIB III (residues 136–321), 5′-ATATAGGATCCAAGCCAGGATTCAGTCCCCGT-3′ and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTCATCGGTACTCAAATTTGTCATC-3′ for FIB IV (residues 2–135), 5′-ATATAGGATCCAGAGGAAACCAGTCGGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTCAGTTCTTCACCTTGGGGGG-3′ for FIB V (residues 78–321). Human 293EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml), and penicillin G (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in an incubator under 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE, and the transfected cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C. Isolation of FIB- and Its Truncated Mutant-associated Complexes—At 48 h post-transfection, 293EBNA cells were harvested and washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA630) containing a protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 30 min. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation of FIB-associated complexes or overnight at 4 °C for deletion mutant-associated complexes. After washing the agarose beads five times with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, the complexes bound to the agarose beads were eluted with 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 500 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Ribonuclease Treatment of the FIB- and Truncation Mutant-associated Complexes—The immunoprecipitated FIB and truncation mutant-associated complexes described above were incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 1 μg/ml RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice with lysis buffer, and then once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and eluted with buffer containing the FLAG peptide as described above. Immunocytochemistry—293EBNA cells were grown on Collagen I-coated 8-well culture slides and transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE. Prior to fixation, cells were washed with PBS followed by incubation with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. After several washes with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20), the cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then blocked by 3% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS and were incubated with anti-FLAG for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were rinsed in PBS-T and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS-T. The resulting cells were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope TCS (Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany). Protein Identification by the Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Method— Protein-containing SDS-PAGE gel fragments were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin as previously described (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were recovered and analyzed for peptide mass fingerprints using a PE Biosystems MALDI-TOF MS (Voyager DE-STR) as described previously (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peptide masses were searched with 50 ppm mass accuracy using the data base fitting program MS-Fit (available at prospector.ucsf.edu), and protein identification was performed according to the criteria described previously (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein Identification by LC-MS/MS Analysis—The FIB- and truncation mutant-associated complexes were digested with Lys-C, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using a nanoscale LC-MS/MS system as described (30.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was applied to a Mightysil-RP-18 (3-μm particle, Kanto Chemical, Osaka, Japan) frit-less column (45 mm × 0.150 mm i.d.) and separated using a 0–40% gradient of aceto-nitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over 80 min at a flow rate of 50 or 25 nl/min. Eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Tof 2, Micromass Wythenshawe, UK). MS/MS spectra were acquired by data-dependent collision-induced dissociation, and MS/MS data were analyzed using the MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London, UK) for peptide assignment. The criteria were in accordance with the manufacturer's definitions. If necessary, match acceptance of automated batch processes was confirmed by manual inspection of each set of raw MS/MS spectra in which the major product ions were matched with theoretically predicted product ions from the data base-matched peptides. Proteins in the mock eluate from anti-FLAG antibody with FLAG-peptide were analyzed by the same LC-MS/MS method as used for the fibrillarin-associated complexes and then subtracted from the proteins identified in the total fibrillarin-associated complexes. Thus, those proteins identified in the mock eluate were not included in the fibrillarin-associated proteins unless the quantitative increase was confirmed. Ultracentrifugation of FIB-associated RNP Complexes—The anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate obtained from FLAG-tagged FIB gene-transfected 293EBNA cells after elution with the FLAG peptide was analyzed on a 12–50% sucrose gradient in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2. The gradients were centrifuged in an SW65 rotor at 50,000 rpm (180,000 × g) for 3 h at 4 °C. A total of 18 fractions of 300 μl each were collected. The migration of the 40 S/60 S/80 S ribosomal complexes was determined by comparison to the ultraviolet absorption profile of cytosolic ribosomes fractionated by ultracentrifugation under identical experimental conditions. Isolation of FLAG-tagged FIB-associated Protein Complexes—Because endogenous FIB is found primarily in the nucleolus of mammalian cells, the subcellular localization of the FLAG-tagged protein in transfected 293EBNA cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody to FLAG (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although weak staining was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the FLAG·FIB-transfected cells, the nucleolus exhibited intense staining thus confirming the correct localization of FLAG-tagged FIB. Complexes associated with FIB were isolated from FLAG·FIB-transfected cells via immunoprecipitation using the FLAG antibody. A typical silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of the immunoprecipitated fraction showed that FIB-associated complexes contained many proteins spanning a wide range of molecular weight (Fig. 2). In contrast, only four protein bands were apparent in a mock immunoprecipitate prepared from untransfected control cells (Fig. 2). In addition, when cells were transfected with unrelated FLAG-tagged proteins, an entirely different pattern of protein bands was obtained (data not shown). These results indicated that most of the factors immunoprecipitated from FLAG·FIB-transfected cells represented de facto FIB-associated proteins. RNA Integrity in FIB-associated Complexes—RNA integrity is requisite for protein association in pre-rRNP complexes associated with human nucleolin, parvulin, and Nop56p, all of which may be involved in ribosome biogenesis as reported in our previous studies (25.Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Fujiyama S. Yanagida M. Hayano T. Miura Y. Uchida T. Fujimori F. Isobe T. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27.Hayano T. Yanagida M. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Isobe T. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34309-34319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the requirement for RNA integrity was also analyzed for FLAG·FIB-associated complexes. RNase treatment prompted the dissociation of the majority of the protein components of FLAG·FIB-associated complexes. However, at least four major protein-staining bands as well as several minor bands remained associated with FLAG·FIB after RNase treatment (Fig. 2). The four major protein bands appeared to exhibit approximate equivalent stoichiometry with respect to staining intensity and were representative of the more abundant proteins present in the non-RNase-treated complexes (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the proteins released by RNase treatment could not be distinguished from those present in the RNase-untreated complexes except for the four major protein bands and several minor protein bands that remained associated with FLAG·FIB after RNase treatment, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). These results suggested that at least two distinct groups of proteins are present in FIB-associated complexes, one whose association is dependent on RNA integrity (the FIB-associated RNPs) and another that associates directly with FIB (independent of RNA integrity). However, it was uncertain as to whether these two groups of proteins were associated with each other or present independently. Identification of Protein Components in FIB-associated RNPs—Given the involvement of FIB in ribosome biogenesis, we expected isolated FIB-associated RNP complexes to contain trans-acting factors involved in this process, as well as ribosomal proteins. We therefore identified the protein components of the FIB-associated RNPs. We previously described a highly sensitive “direct nano-flow LC-MS/MS” system to identify proteins in limited amounts of multiprotein complexes (30.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Immunoisolated FIB-associated complexes were digested with Lys-C and analyzed directly using the nano-LC-MS/MS system. In addition to the criteria for match acceptance described under “Experimental Procedures,” more stringent criteria were adopted to conclusively identify proteins. Namely, at least two different peptides had to be identified in a single nano-LC-MS/MS analysis, and/or at least one peptide had to be identified at least twice (with highly significant data base matching scores) among four separate analyses. A total of 1426 peptides were identified via sequence data base searches using the collision-induced dissociation spectra obtained from four nano-LC-MS/MS runs of a Lys-C digest of the FIB-associated complexes. These peptide data identified 170 proteins (excluding the bait protein and the proteins present in mock) that met our identification criteria. Although we do not exclude that some of the proteins identified may be nonspecifically associated proteins, we believe most of the protein components identified in the fibrillarin-associated complexes are specifically associated with fibrillarin. Of the 170 proteins, 73 were ribosomal proteins (43 from the large subunit and 30 from the small subunit; Supplementary Table SI) and 97 were non-ribosomal proteins (Supplementary Tables SII and SIII). Of the non-ribosomal proteins, 24 were assigned as probable trans-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis based on their homology to yeast proteins known or expected to be involved in ribosome biogenesis (Table I and Supplementary Table SII).Table IPutative fibrillarin-associated trans-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis In addition to the putative trans-acting factors that were assigned, the FIB-associated complexes contained 68 more non-ribosomal proteins, including a number of RNA-binding proteins, splicing factors, DNA-topoisomerase, Myb-binding protein, components of DNA-dependent protein kinase, components of the signal recognition particle, nuclear matrix proteins as well as many hypothetical/unknown proteins (Supplementary Table SIII). Of these, at least 44 proteins reportedly localize to the nucleolus or the nucleus (31.Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K.L. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr.

https://openalex.org/W2126077438,"DNA polymerase μ (pol μ), which is related to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and DNA polymerase β, is thought to be involved in non-homologous end joining and V(D)J recombination. Pol μ is induced by ionizing radiation and exhibits low fidelity. Analysis of translesion replication by purified human pol μ revealed that it bypasses a synthetic abasic site with high efficiency, using primarily a misalignment mechanism. It can also replicate across two tandem abasic sites, using the same mechanism. Pol μ extends primers whose 3′-terminal nucleotides are located opposite the abasic site. Most remarkably, this extension occurs via a mode of nucleotidyl transferase activity, which does not depend on the sequence of the template. This is not due to simple terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity, because pol μ is unable to add dNTPs to an oligo(dT)29 primer or to a blunt end duplex oligonucleotide under standard conditions. Thus, pol μ is a dual mode DNA-synthesizing enzyme, which can act as either a classical DNA polymerase or as a non-canonical, template-dependent, but sequence-independent nucleotidyl transferase. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a DNA-synthesizing enzyme with such properties. These activities may be required for its function in non-homologous end joining in the processing of DNA ends prior to ligation.

DNA polymerase μ (pol μ) 1The abbreviations used are: pol μ, DNA polymerase μ; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining. 1The abbreviations used are: pol μ, DNA polymerase μ; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining. is a recently identified member of the X family of DNA polymerases. Pol μ shares 41% amino acid identity with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), a template-independent DNA polymerase (1.Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. de Lera T.L. Garcia-Diaz M.

Reynaud C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both pol μ and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase are overexpressed in the immune system. However, unlike terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, which is specific to the immune system, pol μ is expressed in additional tissues (1.Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. de Lera T.L. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M.A. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A. Faili A. Bertocci B. Storck S. Delbos F. Cocea L. Gupta N. Weill J.C.

In vivo analysis with pol μ-deficient mice revealed depletion of B cells in peripheral lymphoid organs in ∼50% of the mice and impairment of the immunoglobulin κ light chain rearrangement (3.Bertocci B.

This suggests that pol μ is essential in V(D)J recombination, at least in mice. In addition, pol μ is up-regulated in response to ionizing and UV radiation and forms complexes with DNA ligase IV and the Ku proteins (5.Mahajan K.N. Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This indicates that pol μ partakes not only in V(D)J recombination but generally in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Pol μ was shown to be an error-prone DNA polymerase (1.Dominguez O.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), capable of incorporating either dNTPs or rNTPs (7.Nick McElhinny S.A. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4441-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has an outstanding tendency to form frameshift mutations, directed by its ability to misalign the primer terminus with short downstream homologies (microhomology search) (6.Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on this property, it was proposed that pol μ functions in NHEJ by searching homology between two broken ends, followed by filling in small gaps.When DNA is damaged in the vicinity of a break, its processing by DNA synthesis might require lesion bypass. Here we show that, unlike most other DNA polymerases, purified pol μ bypasses a synthetic abasic site very efficiently. Surprisingly, when extending a primer terminus located opposite an abasic site, pol μ adds each of the four dNTPs, regardless of the sequence of the template. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a template-dependent but non-instructed nucleotidyl transferase activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Recombinant human pol μ was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (9.Duvauchelle J.B. Blanco L. Fuchs R.P. Cordonnie A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2061-2067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli Pol IV (His-tagged) was a generous gift from H. Ohmori (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), and the E. coli pol I Klenow fragment was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp.DNA Substrates—DNA oligonucleotides without a lesion were supplied by Sigma-Genosys, whereas oligonucleotides containing synthetic abasic sites (dSpacer, Glen Research, Sterlin, VA), were synthesized by the Synthesis Unit of the Biological Services Department in our institute or purchased from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). The DNA substrates used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. They were prepared by annealing a 32P-5′-end-labeled primer oligonucleotide to the template oligonucleotide, followed by purification on a BioSpin 30 gel-filtration column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (10.Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11.Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z.

Analysis by electrophoresis on native gels revealed that >95% of the primers were annealed to the template oligonucleotides.Primer Extension Reactions—A typical primer extension reaction (20 μ l) contained 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 μ g/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 50 nm primed oligonucleotide substrate. Pol μ or DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) at 20–50 nm were added to start the reactions, which were carried out at 37 °C for 10–30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of a mixture of 99.5% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol. Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on 15 or 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, after which they were dried, visualized, and quantified using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorimaging device. Primer extension was calculated by dividing the amount of all extended primers by the sum of extended and non-extended primers. The extent of bypass was calculated by dividing the amount of bypass products by the amount of all extended primers. To qualitatively examine the specificity of primer extension by pol μ, the reactions were carried out under similar conditions in the presence of a single dNTP at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μm. The efficiency of extension was calculated by dividing the amount of extended primers by the total amount of primers.Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—Analysis of kinetic parameters for primer extension from the abasic site or deoxynucleotide incorporation opposite an undamaged nucleotide template was performed as follows. Human pol μ (at 25 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of a single deoxynucleotide (1–2000 μm; 6–8 concentration points) and with 50 nm DNA substrate for 20 or 30 min under standard reaction conditions. Gel band intensities of the substrates and products were quantified as described above. The percentage of primer extended was duplicated by 1000 fmol and divided by the time of the reaction to give Vobs values. These values were plotted using the Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot of the Michaelis-Menten equation, namely 1/v = 1/Vmax + Km/[dNTP]·Vmax). Apparent Km and Vmax steady-state parameters were obtained from the fit and used to calculate the frequency of deoxynucleotide incorporation (finc) using the equation finc = (Vmax/Km)incorrect nucleotide/(Vmax/Km)correct nucleotide. For each substrate a set of 3–5 experiments was carried out under conditions in which primer utilization was <25%.RESULTSPurified Pol μ Effectively Bypasses a Single or Two Tandem Abasic Site(s)—The ability of pol μ to replicate across DNA blocking lesions was assayed using primed oligonucleotides, each carrying a site-specific synthetic abasic site. Abasic sites are common lesions in DNA, formed both spontaneously and by DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (13.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4272) Google Scholar, 14.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 19-24Google Scholar).

When template AB1G, containing a synthetic abasic site was used, primer extension by pol μ was similar to that obtained in the absence of the lesion (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, primer extension by pol I (Klenow fragment) was strongly inhibited on this DNA substrate (Fig. 2A lane 3), consistent with previous results (11.Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with another DNA substrate, AB2C (Fig. 1), in which the abasic site was located in a different sequence context (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–12). We have also analyzed the ability of pol μ to bypass two tandem abasic sites in a different sequence context by using template ABXX33 (Fig. 1). E. coli pol I (Klenow) was completely blocked by the two tandem abasic sites (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In contrast, pol μ extended the primer across the two tandem abasic sites, although at a lower efficiency than across a single abasic site (90 and 44% primer extension, respectively; Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Most remarkably, pol μ did not show any pause at the site of the lesions, and bypass per se was little affected (93% bypass of a single abasic site and 84% bypass of two tandem abasic sites; Fig. 2B). The decreased activity on the substrate with the two tandem abasic sites, as compared with the single lesion template, is therefore due to inhibition of synthesis initiation rather than inhibition of lesion bypass.Fig. 2Primer extension by pol μ on templates carrying one or two tandem abasic sites. A, reactions were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” with primer-templates AB1G or AB2C and 50 nm pol μ or pol I (Klenow fragment) for 10 min at 37 °C. B, reactions were carried out with primer-template AB33A, carrying a single abasic site, or primer-template ABXX33, carrying two tandem abasic sites, and with 40 nm pol μ or pol I (KF, Klenow fragment) for 10 min at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pol μ Uses Misalignment to Bypass Abasic Sites—To elucidate the mechanism by which pol μ bypasses abasic sites, we examined the specificity of the nucleotide inserted opposite the abasic site. To this end, we performed standing start primer extension reactions with single dNTPs using template AB33A. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, when the template nucleotide next to the abasic site was an A, pol μ incorporated primarily a dTMP residue. We assayed three additional variants of AB33A, each containing a different template nucleotide 5′ to the abasic site (Figs. 1 and 3). As can be seen in Fig. 3, a–d, the specificity of incorporation by pol μ was dependent on the template nucleotide next to the abasic site. In each case, the most frequent event was insertion of a nucleotide complementary to the template nucleotide 5′ to the lesion. Pol μ also inserts dGMP on these templates, although with lower efficiency (Fig. 3, a, b, and d). This is the nucleotide complementary to the template C located two nucleotides 5′ to the abasic site. Taken together, these results suggest that pol μ bypasses abasic sites by using a skipping mechanism in which the abasic site is “flipped out” and the polymerase replicates the next template nucleotide, similar to the bypass by pol β (20.Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21.Daube S.S. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion, pol μ incorporated primarily dGMP on another template (AB2C), where a template C is located 5′ to the lesion (Fig. 3e).Fig. 3Specificity of nucleotides inserted by pol μ at an abasic site. Reactions were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” with the indicated primer-templates and 35 nm pol μ. Each dNTP was assayed at three different concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μm for 30 min at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The same mechanism was probably used when pol μ bypassed two tandem abasic sites, because mostly dGMP was incorporated by pol μ on primed template ABXX33, where the first template nucleotide 5′ to the two abasic sites is a C (Fig. 3f). In light of these results, the inhibition of synthesis initiation but not elongation by the two tandem abasic sites may be explained by the difficulty in skipping two abasic sites rather than only one.Pol μ Extends Primers Located Opposite an Abasic Site in a Sequence-independent Manner—The high bypass efficiency of pol μ prompted us to analyze its ability to elongate primers located opposite the lesion. This was done using template AB1G, with a primer terminated opposite the abasic site. As expected, Pol I (Klenow fragment) was ineffective in extending such primers (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). In contrast, pol μ extended all (abasic site:base) mismatches quite effectively, regardless of the identity of the 3′-terminal base located opposite the lesion (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7). This was somewhat surprising, because only the extension of C was expected to be effective if the polymerase uses a misalignment mechanism, as shown above. In contrast to pol μ, the E. coli DNA polymerase IV, which was shown to use template misalignment frequently (23.Kobayashi S. Valentine M.R. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24.Maor-Shoshani A. Hayashi K. Ohmori H. Livneh Z. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), could elongate only the primers terminated with C or A (Fig. 4B). These bases are complementary to the first or second template bases, respectively, 5′ to the abasic site, consistent with a mechanism of primer misalignment. Therefore, the ability of pol μ to extend effectively all four bases suggests that pol μ uses a mechanism other than primer misalignment when extending a nucleotide present opposite an abasic site.Fig. 4Extension by pol μ of a primer terminus located opposite an abasic site.

This was done using template AB33A primed with an oligonucleotide whose 3′-terminal nucleotide was located opposite the abasic site. Surprisingly, pol μ incorporated each one of the four dNMPs with apparently similar efficiencies (Fig. 5a). Similar results were obtained for substrates with a primer 3′-terminal A, C, G, and T (Fig. 5, a–d). This suggested a mode of DNA synthesis that is independent of the sequence of the template.Fig. 5Specificity of extension by pol μ of a primer terminus located opposite an abasic site. Reactions were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” with the indicated primer-templates and 25 nm pol μ. Each dNTP was assayed at three different concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 10 μm for 10 min at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To quantify these results, we performed quantitative kinetic experiments in which we determined the Km and Vmax values for extension from abasic site:base mismatches in three different substrates, AB33A-0A, AB33G-0A, and AB33T-0C (Table I). As a control, we used AB33A with no lesion. As can be seen in Table I, when extending an abasic site:A mismatch on substrate AB33A0-A, pol μ essentially lost its ability to discriminate against insertion of the incorrect nucleotide. All four dNTPs were inserted with comparable efficiencies (within 2-fold from the correct nucleotide). A similar decrease in the ability to discriminate against insertion of the incorrect nucleotide was also observed with the other lesion-containing substrates that were used (Table I). In contrast, pol μ did show clear discrimination against insertion of the incorrect nucleotides when the control substrate without the lesion was used (Table I, AB33A control). To examine the specificity of extension in a different sequence context, a qualitative primer extension analysis was performed with primed template AB1G. As can be seen in Fig. 5, e–h, a similar picture was obtained; Pol μ inserted all four dNMPs on each primer-template configuration. Only in the case of the 3′-terminal C in the primer strand was there preferential incorporation of dAMP, most likely due to misalignment, and template-directed incorporation opposite the next base (T). Still, even in this case, all other three dNTPs were incorporated by pol μ (Fig. 5, e–h).Table IKinetic measurement of nucleotide incorporation by pol μ when elongating from an abasic site:nucleotide mismatchdNTPVmaxKmVmax/Kmfincfmol/minμmAB33A0-A dNTP5′-GGTCA ↓3′-CCAGXACAGdATP4 ± 1.252 ± 160.0770.48dCTP6 ± 1.242 ± 60.1430.9dGTP2.4 ± 0.68 ± 0.90.31.8dTTP5.5 ± 134 ± 11.00.1601AB33G0-A dNTP5′-GGTCA ↓3′-CCAGXGCAGdATP7.5 ± 0.842 ± 40.1780.7dCTP2.5 ± 0.310 ± 1.60.2501dGTP2 ± 0.25.5 ± 0.10.3631.4dTTP3 ± 0.441 ± 1.70.0730.3AB33T0-C dNTP5′-GGTCC ↓3′-CCAGXTCAGdATP6 ± 3.5202 ± 920.0301dCTP3 ± 1.2475 ± 1950.0060.2dGTP2.3 ± 0.615.6 ± 4.20.1475dTTP2.5 ± 1.7338 ± 360.0070.25AB33A control dNTP5′GGTCC ↓3′-CCAGGACAGdATP0.9 ± 0.3564 ± 221.6 × 10-33.5 × 10-4dCTP1 ± 0.5218 ± 374.6 × 10-31 × 10-3dGTP10 ± 1.6114 ± 320.090.02dTTP18 ± 44 ± 1.74.51 Open table in a new tab The ability of pol μ to incorporate all four dNTPs when extending a primer terminus located opposite an abasic site may stem from local loss of template instruction, or from misalignment and instruction by template nucleotides at various positions 5′ to the lesion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a quantitative kinetic analysis of the specificity of extension in a substrate in which all 10 template nucleotides 5′ to the lesion were A (AB-(A-tail); Figs. 1 and 6A). This strongly biased one-nucleotide extensions to the insertion of dTMP, because any template-directed nucleotide incorporation, be it a direct extension or any misalignment event, is expected to yield dTMP incorporation on substrate AB-(A-tail). As can be seen in Fig. 6A, each of the four dNTPs was incorporated on this template. Moreover, multiple insertions were observed. Thus, with dATP as the only dNTP, extension by four nucleotides was observed, and a similar result was observed with dCTP as the only dNTP. Quite remarkably, when either dTTP or dGTP were used as the only dNTPs, there were multiple extension steps leading to a nascent DNA strand whose length exceeded the length of the template (Fig. 6). In the case of dTTP, this can be explained by template-instructed incorporation accompanied by primer slippage. However, in the case of dGTP, this indicates that long-range sequence-independent polymerization has occurred, as is discussed below. Primer extension analysis was performed also with another substrate, AB-(G-tail), which contains 10 G nucleotides 5′ to the abasic site (Figs. 1 and 6B). Results obtained with AB-(G-tail) were generally similar to those obtained with AB-(A-tail), except that the numbers of dNTP additions did not exceed the size of the G-tail (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Specificity of extension by pol μ of a primer terminus situated opposite an abasic site, which is located upstream to (A)10 or (G)10 runs.

As can be seen in Table II, all four nucleotides were inserted with similar efficiencies on the AB-(A-tail) substrate. In the case of the AB-(G-tail) substrate, dTMP and dGMP were incorporated best, and, most remarkably, the complementary dCMP was inserted with the lowest efficiency, primarily due to a high Km value (Table II). Pol μ did discriminate against insertion of the wrong nucleotides in the control substrates without the lesion, although its fidelity was low, especially in the G-tailed substrate (Table II). These results indicate that pol μ can act as a template-dependent, sequence-independent DNA polymerase.Table IIKinetic measurement of nucleotide incorporation by pol μ when elongating from an abasic site:nucleotide mismatch in homo-nucleotide-tailed substratesSubstrateVmaxKmVmax/Kmfincfmol/minμMAB-(A-tail) dNTP5′GGTCA ↓3′CCAGX(A)10dATP4 ± 0.340 ± 40.101dCTP11 ± 3117 ± 270.090.8dGTP2 ± 0.130 ± 90.070.6dTTP8 ± 0.876 ± 70.111Cont-(A-tail) dNTP5′GGTC ↓3′CCAGA(A)10dATP0.3 ± 0.07150 ± 1132 × 10-34.6 × 10-3dCTP0.6 ± 0.2215 ± 492.8 × 10-35.8 × 10-3dGTPNDaND, not determined.NDNDNDdTTP12 ± 125 ± 60.481AB-(G-tail) dNTP5′GGTCA ↓3′CCAGX(G)10dATP15 ± 478 ± 130.191.6dCTP25 ± 4202 ± 490.121dGTP11 ± 115 ± 10.736dTTP16 ± 210 ± 1.51.613.3Cont-(G-tail) dNTP5′GGTC ↓3′CCAGG(G)10dATP0.5 ± 0.2500 ± 1321 × 10-32.3 × 10-3dCTP20 ± 446 ± 110.431dGTP1.6 ± 0.446 ± 30.030.07dTTP1 ± 0.883 ± 80.010.02a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAll known DNA polymerases, with the exception of one, function mainly as template-dependent DNA polymerases. The exception is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which adds nucleotides to a 3′-primer terminus in the absence of a template (25.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1991Google Scholar). The REV1 protein, which is a member of the Y family of DNA polymerases, was initially thought to be a dCMP transferase (26.Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies showed that it is a G template-specific DNA polymerase (28.Masuda Y. Takahashi M.

The results presented above show that, given a primer terminus opposite an abasic site, pol μ adds each of the four dNTPs with no obvious preference, regardless of the sequence of the DNA template. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of a DNA polymerase that is basically template-dependent but can act in a mode that is non-instructed by the sequence of the template. It is noteworthy that this nucleotidyl transferase activity occurs in the context of a primer-template, suggesting that it is a template-dependent dNMP transferase activity, unlike terminal deoxynucl"

Recent evidence also suggests a role for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in this process. However, the relative importance of MTP in the two steps of VLDL assembly and the specific role of the LDL receptor still remain unclear. To further investigate the role of MTP and the LDL receptor in VLDL assembly, we bred mice harboring “floxed” Mttp alleles (Mttpflox/flox) and a Cre transgene on a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient background to generate mice with double deficiency in the liver (Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ). In contrast to the plasma of Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice, the plasma of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice contained apoB100. Accordingly, Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ but not Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes secreted apoB100-containing lipoprotein particles. The secreted lipoproteins were of LDL and HDL sizes but no VLDL-sized lipoproteins could be detected. These findings indicate that hepatic LDL receptors function as “gatekeepers” targeting dense apoB100-containing lipoproteins for degradation. In addition, these results suggest that very low levels of MTP are insufficient to mediate the second step but sufficient for the first step of VLDL assembly.

In addition, these results suggest that very low levels of MTP are insufficient to mediate the second step but sufficient for the first step of VLDL assembly. The hepatic assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) 1The abbreviations used are: VLDL, very low density lipoproteins; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; pI-pC, polyinosinic-polycytidylic ribonucleic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is usually described in two well defined steps (1.Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The first step consists of the formation of a small pre-VLDL particle and takes place in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the rough ER, the apoB protein is translated across the membrane and becomes enriched with lipids. If the apoB protein is not properly folded or if the enrichment of lipids is insufficient, the apoB-containing precursor particle will be degraded instead of proceeding to the second step. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is believed to be crucial for the first step of VLDL assembly because it transfers lipids and also binds to apoB (2.Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3.Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Kochl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J. Harrison G.B. Levitt D.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4892-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Through these actions, MTP is believed to avoid improper folding and premature degradation of apoB (5.Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6.Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A vital role of MTP in the formation and secretion of apoB is further supported by the fact that patients with abetalipoproteinemia, a dominant disorder caused by mutations in the MTP gene (Mttp), have low levels of apoB in plasma (7.Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although most evidence points toward the necessity of MTP in the first step of VLDL assembly, some studies indicate that the translation of apoB and the formation of the pre-VLDL particle can occur in the absence of normal levels of MTP (1.Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J.

In contrast, there is less controversy over the necessity of functional MTP to fulfill the second step of VLDL assembly (1.Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this step, an apoB-free lipid particle is synthesized in the smooth ER (MTP-dependent) and fuses with the apoB-containing precursor particle synthesized in the rough ER to form a nascent VLDL particle (MTP-independent) (6.Rustaeus S.

The nascent VLDL will be further enriched with lipids in the Golgi apparatus to form a buoyant VLDL particle that will eventually be secreted. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a key receptor for the endocytosis of circulating VLDL and LDL. The dominantly inherited disorder familial hypercholesterolemia is primarily caused by a dysfunctional LDL receptor, which leads to the accumulation of cholesterol-rich LDL in plasma and premature atherosclerosis (13.Schuster H. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 2: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inhibition of intracellular cholesterol synthesis with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. with a statins) leads to a compensatory up-regulation of primarily hepatic LDL receptors that increases the uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL particles, lowering plasma cholesterol levels. It has also been suggested that the LDL receptor is involved in the hepatic VLDL assembly by interfering with secretion of VLDL from the liver (13.Schuster H.

In vivo studies of MTP deficiency have been hampered because inactivation of Mttp in mice is embryonically lethal (21.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recently, the loxP system (22.Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was used to create conditional targeting of Mttp specifically in the liver (9.Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H.

These mice were unable to form buoyant VLDL in the liver, which is consistent with the idea that MTP is necessary for the second step of VLDL assembly. However, metabolic labeling studies performed in one of these studies (9.Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin.

We hypothesized that the absence of secretion of small apoB100-containing lipoproteins from the livers of liver-specific Mttp knockout mice is due to the presence of hepatic LDL receptors. To test this hypothesis, we conducted plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and metabolic-labeling analyses of liver-specific Mttp knockout mice (9.Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J.

At 21–28 days of age, male Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre and Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre mice were injected with 500 μl of polyinosinic-polycytidylic ribonucleic acid (pI-pC) (1 μg/μl, Sigma) every other day for 8 days to delete Mttp (Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ). Littermate Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox mice and Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox mice lacking the Cre transgene were also injected with pI-pC. The mice had a mixed genetic background (∼25% 129/SvJae and ∼75% C57BL/6). They were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed rodent chow containing 4.0% fat (Lactamin AB, Kimstad, Sweden). Genotypes were determined by PCR with genomic DNA from tail biopsies. Lipid Measurements—The mice were fasted overnight before blood sampling. Total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined with colorimetric assays (INFINITY-triglyceride/cholesterol kits, Sigma) 2 weeks after the final pI-pC injection. The distribution of lipids within the plasma lipoproteins was determined by fractionating mouse plasma (100 μl pooled from five mice) on a Superose 6 10/30 column (25.Farese Jr., R.V. Ruland S.L.

Liver pieces (∼200 μg) were homogenized with a polytron (Techtum Lab AB, Umeå, Sweden) in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Before extraction of triglycerides, a known amount of tripentadecanoic acid (Sigma) was added to the mixture as an internal standard (26.Leung G.K. Veniant M.M. Kim S.K. Zlot C.H. Raabe M.

The lipid transfer activity of MTP in primary hepatocytes was measured by using a commercial kit (Calbiochem Inc., San Diego, CA). Preparation of ER and Golgi Sub-cellular Fractions—Hepatic ER and Golgi fractions were isolated as described (27.Levy E. Garofalo C. Rouleau T. Gavino V. Bendayan M. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 848-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Marks D.L. Wu K. Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Watanabe R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

In brief, ER fractions were isolated from liver homogenates in buffer A (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 nm KCl with the addition of protease inhibitors, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC Plus, all from Roche Applied Science) by two consecutive ultracentrifugations in SW40 Ti rotors at 14,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. Golgi fractions were isolated from homogenate in buffer A isolated from the same livers. The density of the homogenates was first increased with sucrose to a final concentration of 1.07 m and overlaid with 9 + 9 ml of 0.9 m and 0.2 m sucrose in buffer A. The gradients were ultracentrifuged in SW28 Ti rotors at 16,500 rpm for 2 h. The Golgi fractions were extracted from the interface between 0.9 and 0.2 m sucrose, mixed 1:1 with 20% glycerol, and pelleted by an additional spin in SW40 Ti rotors at 28,000 rpm for 90 min. The total protein contents of all samples were determined by the method of Lowry (40.Lowry D.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot of ApoB—Mouse plasma samples (2 μl), hepatic ER, and Golgi samples (150 μg of total protein/well) were fractionated by 4% SDS—PAGE. The apoB proteins were detected with a commercial rabbit antiserum against mouse apoB (Biosite AB, Taby, Sweden). The binding of the primary antibodies was assessed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the apoB48 and apoB100 bands was assessed by densitometry with a Fuji LAS-1000 CCD camera and Image Gauge version 3.45 software (Fuji Film, Sweden). Real-time PCR—Mttp mRNA levels in the livers of pI-pC-treated Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre, Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre, and Mttpflox/flox mice were assessed by real-time, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, as described (30.Bjorkegren J. Veniant M. Kim S.K. Withycombe S.K. Wood P.A. Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38511-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Primary Hepatocytes—Primary mouse hepatocytes were prepared and cultured essentially as described (31.Kim E. Cham C.M. Veniant M.M. Ambroziak P. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized, the inferior vena cava was cannulated through the right atrium with an arterial catheter (Becton-Dickinson Infusion Therapy AB, Sweden), and the portal vein was cut open for drainage. The livers were perfused with liver perfusion medium (Invitrogen) for 3 min and then with liver digest medium (Invitrogen) for 10 min. The livers were harvested, and the hepatocytes were washed twice with 40 ml of hepatocyte washing medium (Invitrogen). The number of hepatocytes was calculated by trypan blue exclusion, and a fixed number of cells was plated on six-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking l-methionine and l-cysteine (Invitrogen) and containing 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, and 6.5% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen), and the cells were allowed to attach for 60 min. Metabolic Labeling of Primary Hepatocytes—The attached hepatocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1 ml of fresh medium containing 50 μl of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, 530 Mbq/ml, Amersham Biosciences) was added. The cells were incubated with the labeling medium for 3 h for the straight labeling experiments and for 15 min and 2 h for the pulse-chase experiments. The labeling media was harvested, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. For the pulse-chase experiments, the cells were then chased with fresh medium lacking [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 and 30 min or for 1, 2, and 3 h. In all experiments, protease inhibitors were added immediately after the medium had been harvested. In the pulse-chase experiments, the cells (washed twice with PBS) were incubated with PBS containing 100 international units/ml Heparin (LeoPharma AB, Sweden) at 4 °C for 30 min to release cell surface-bound lipoproteins. The PBS containing heparin was harvested and supplemented with protease inhibitors. After two final PBS washes, the hepatocytes were sonicated in 1 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors for 2–5 s using a 550W sonicator. Isolation of Lipoproteins from Labeled Primary Hepatocytes—To obtain HDL-sized and less dense lipoproteins, 3 ml of hepatocyte medium and PBS containing heparin or cell lysate was mixed with 0.2 ml of human plasma (used as carrier), the density was increased to 1.21 g/ml with NaBr, and the mixture was ultracentrifuged in an SW40 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for >80 h at 10 °C (32.Carlson K. J. Clin. Pathol. 1973; 5: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The top 0.5 ml of the tube containing HDL and less dense lipoproteins was collected and immediately delipidated in methanol:diethylether (1:1, v/v) (33.Karpe F. Hamsten A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1311-1317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delipidated proteins were resolved in 200 μl of loading buffer containing SDS, and 15 μl was fractionated on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient. The gels were fixed in isopropanol:H2O:acetic acid (5:13:2), incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried (on a Bio-Rad Model 583 gel dryer), and exposed to film (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C for 4–10 days. The intensity of the 35S incorporated into apoB48 and apoB100 was assessed by densitometry as described above. Density Fractionation of ApoB Secreted from Primary Hepatocytes—To separately isolate VLDL, LDL, and HDL subfractions, a density gradient consisting of 3.0 ml each of 1.065, 1.020, and 1.006 g/ml NaCl solutions was layered onto 4 ml of a mixture of 2.5 ml of hepatocyte medium, 0.5 ml of human plasma, and 1 ml of 1.42 g/ml NaBr (final density 1.10 g/ml) (33.Karpe F. Hamsten A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1311-1317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This density gradient was ultracentrifuged in an SW40 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for at least 14 h at 10 °C to float Svedberg flotation >20 at the top of the gradient and LDL (Svedberg flotation 12–20) at 29 mm from the top. After isolation of the VLDL and LDL subfractions, the density of the remaining 4 ml of the bottom fraction was increased to 1.21 g/ml with NaBr and transferred to another ultracentrifuge tube for an additional run to isolate the HDL subfraction, as described above. All apolipoproteins within the density fractions were immediately delipidated and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Plasma and Liver Lipids—pI-pC-treated littermate mice (Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ versus Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox, and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ versus Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox) were fed a chow diet (4.0% fat) until week 7, when all mice were used for experiments (2 weeks after the final pI-pC injection). The liver-specific recombination of Mttp reduced the plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides (Table I). The reduction in plasma triglycerides was similar in Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice, but the plasma cholesterol reduction was greater in the Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice (100 versus 65 mg/dl). Fast-performance liquid chromatography of plasma cholesterol revealed an LDL-cholesterol peak in Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice but not in Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 1). In addition, the HDL-cholesterol peak was about 2-fold higher in Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice than in Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice (Fig. 1). The liver weight and hepatic triglyceride content were higher in Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice than in Mttpflox/flox controls (Table I). Of note, livers lacking the LDL receptor weighed less and had a lower triglyceride content than livers with intact LDL receptors independent of Mttp.Table IBasic characteristics of the study miceLdlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox (n = 10)Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ (n = 10)Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox (n = 10)Ldlr-/- MttpΔ/Δ (n = 10)Body weight (g)26 ± 224 ± 223 ± 222 ± 2Liver weight (g)1.21 ± 0.121.43 ± 0.15ap < 0.05 compared to Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox.1.13 ± 0.081.25 ± 0.24Liver TG (mg/g wt tissue)216 ± 82648 ± 216bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.161 ± 62318 ± 84bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.Plasma TG (mg/dl)99 ± 26cn = 13.43 ± 15bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.,dn = 19.136 ± 24en = 16.42 ± 24bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.,fn = 14.Plasma chol (mg/dl)119 ± 23cn = 13.54 ± 22bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.,dn = 19.174 ± 36en = 16.73 ± 25bp < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.,fn = 14.a p < 0.05 compared to Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox.b p < 0.005 compared to Ldlr-/- Mttpflox/flox.c n = 13.d n = 19.e n = 16.f n = 14. Open table in a new tab Plasma ApoB, Liver Mttp mRNA Levels, and MTP Activity— The plasma apoB48 levels were similar in Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox mice, whereas apoB100 was almost undetectable in the plasma of Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice, as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the plasma of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice contained apoB100 (Fig. 2). Assessment of the apoB100 and the apoB48 bands by densitometry showed that the average plasma apoB100/B48 ratio was 0.68 ± 0.15 (n = 8) in Ldlr+/+ Mttpflox/flox mice and 1.75 ± 0.53 (n = 8) in Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox mice. Only in two of the eight Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice examined was an apoB100 band detectable. In both of these cases, the intensity of the apoB100 band was less than 5% of the intensity of the apoB48 band. In contrast and very much to our surprise, the apoB100/B48 ratio in plasma of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice was 1.40 ± 0.39 (n = 7). To ensure that the presence of apoB100 in the plasma of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice was not a result of less efficient pI-pC-mediated Mttp recombination related to the absence of Ldlr, the level of hepatic Mttp mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Mttp mRNA expression in the liver of both Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ mice was reduced by no more than 95% compared with control Mttpflox/flox mice (data not shown). For the pulse-chase experiments we also measured MTP activity. The MTP activity in MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes was less than 3% of the wild-type and did not differ between Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (62 ± 40 versus 47 ± 39 pmol/100 μg/hr, p = 0.55 (n = 4 + 4)). ApoB100 Secretion from Primary Hepatocytes—Intestinal cells secrete only trace amounts of apoB100-containing lipoproteins (34.Hoeg J.M. Sviridov D.D. Tennyson G.E. Demosky Jr., S.J. Meng M.S. Bojanovski D. Safonova I.G. Repin V.S. Kuberger M.B. Smirnov V.N. Higuchi K. Gregg R.E. Brewer Jr, H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1761-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of apoB100-containing lipoproteins in the plasma of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice, therefore, indicated that the livers of these mice still were capable of secreting apoB100-containing lipoproteins. However, to rule out the possibility that the presence of these apoB100-containing lipoproteins was caused by their accumulation in the absence of the LDL receptor rather than by reemerging secretion, we analyzed apoB100 secretion from labeled primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine, and the incorporation of this label into apoB was measured in the medium. The secretion of apoB48 seemed to be unaffected in both Ldlr+/+MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (104 ± 7% versus 93 ± 4%, n = 3). ApoB100 in the medium of Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes was undetectable by densitometry (Fig. 3). In contrast, the amount of apoB100 in the medium of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes was only reduced by ∼30%, compared with the medium of Ldlr–/– Mttpflox/flox hepatocytes (69 ± 23%, n = 4) (Fig. 3). Density of ApoB100-containing Lipoproteins Secreted by Primary Hepatocytes—To determine the density of the secreted apoB100-containing lipoproteins, the medium of primary hepatocytes was subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation to examine the secretion of apoB in the VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions (33.Karpe F. Hamsten A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1311-1317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suspected that the apoB100-containing lipoproteins secreted by primary hepatocytes from Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice would, like the apoB48-containing lipoproteins secreted by MttpΔ/Δ primary hepatocytes (9.Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), be of HDL size. Surprisingly, however, an equally intense apoB100 band appeared in the LDL fraction (Fig. 4). The secretion of LDL-sized lipoproteins by hepatocytes from Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice is consistent with the LDL cholesterol and triglyceride peaks shown by fast-performance liquid chromatography of their plasma (Fig. 1). In contrast, Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes did not secrete any VLDL (Fig. 4). Apo100 Synthesis, Turnover, and Sub-cellular Location—To investigate plausible mechanisms underlying the LDL receptor-mediated prevention of dense apoB100-containing lipoprotein secretion from Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes, we performed two pulse-chase experiments: a short 15-min pulse followed by 15- and 30-min chase periods (to estimate the rate of apoB100 de novo synthesis), and a 2-h pulse followed by 1, 2, and 3 h chase periods (to estimate apoB100 turnover). As indicated by the intracellular levels of labeled apoB100 after a 15-min pulse and after the subsequent chase periods (Fig. 5A), the biosynthesis of apoB100 appeared similar in Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes. In contrast, the intracellular turnover of apoB100 seemed more rapid in Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ than in Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (Fig. 5B, black versus white sections of bars at each time point). In contrast to Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes, labeled apoB100 was detected in the medium of Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (Fig. 5B, gray section of the bars). However, the overall recovery of a labeled apoB100 was similar from Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (Fig. 5B, black versus the entire white bar or white and gray bar at each time point). There were no differences in apoB48 biosynthesis or turnover between Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes, nor could we detect a difference in heparin-releasable apoB100 from the cell surface (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that (i) the LDL receptor does not affect the de novo biosynthesis of apoB100, and (ii) the LDL receptor-mediated degradation of apoB100 mainly occurs intracellularly. To investigate the sub-cellular location of the LDL receptor-mediated degradation, we separated hepatic ER and Golgi fractions and measured the relative content of apoB100 in these sub-cellular fractions. As indicated previously (35.Gillian-Daniel D.L. Bates P.W. Tebon A. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the LDL receptor-mediated degradation of apoB100 seemed to occur mainly in the ER, as indicated by the levels of apoB100 in the ER fractions from Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes (100 ± 63% (Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ) versus 330 ± 123% (Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ), n = 4 + 4, p < 0.04). In contrast, there was a tendency to the inverse relation in the Golgi fractions (100 ± 40% (Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ) versus 77 ± 54% (Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ), n = 3 + 3, p = 0.59). This study shows that the secretion of dense apoB100-containing lipoproteins from the liver is prevented by the LDL receptors. In addition, this study suggests that hepatic apoB100 synthesis can occur despite very low levels of MTP. Thus, normal levels of MTP do not seem to be essential for the first step of VLDL assembly. In contrast, and consistent with the notion that MTP is essential for the transformation of the pre-VLDL particle into a buoyant VLDL particle, the secretion of buoyant VLDL particles was abolished. The fact that dense apoB100-containing lipoproteins that escape co-translational degradation were targeted by mainly intracellular hepatic LDL receptors assigns this receptor a novel “gatekeeping” function that may be an important additional mechanism for the cholesterol-lowering and antiatherosclerotic effects of statins. The Lox P system (22.Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) allows the study of genes with important functions in both adult life and embryonic development. However, this conditional targeting technology has its limitations compared with conventional targeting, as the Cre-mediated recombination of the targeted gene is not complete. Using this system, residual activity of the targeted gene will remain. In our case, this is consistent with residual activity of MTP in the Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ and the Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ mice. We found that, on average, 69% of apoB100 secretion remained from Ldlr–/– MttpΔ/Δ hepatocytes despite more than 95% Mttp recombination and less than 3% residual MTP activity. In contrast, the same level of residual MTP activity was insufficient to maintain any VLDL synthesis causing fat to accumulate within hepatocytes. In addition, 3% residual MTP activity was not consistent with any apoB100 secretion when the LDL receptor was present (Ldlr+/+ MttpΔ/Δ). The fact that the secretion of HDL-sized apoB48-containing lipoproteins by MttpΔ/Δ livers occurred despite the presence of the LDL receptor is not surprising, because apoB48 does not bind to this receptor and, hence, escapes LDL receptor-mediated degradation. Previously, liver-specific Mttp-deficient hepatocytes were shown to secrete apoB48 (9.Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and the reduction of apoB48 secretion from primary hepatocytes in the presence of an MTP inhibitor was only marginally reduced (17.Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the smaller size of apoB48 protein relative to apoB100 may decrease its vulnerability to protease-mediated degradation, these studies evoke the possibility of a separate hepatic synthetic pathway for the assembly of apoB48-containing lipoproteins (36.Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our results do not support this possibility. Rather, they support the traditional view of a common pathway for the assembly of both species of apoB, for the first step of which normal levels of MTP do not seem to be essential. Interestingly, Kulinski et al. (17.Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) recently reported only a minor reappearance of apoB100 secretion from LDL receptor-deficient hepatocytes upon incubation with an MTP inhibitor. The authors concluded that the preferential reduction of apoB100 secretion, compared with apoB48, upon inhibition of MTP cannot be attributed to the presence of LDL receptors. The reason why Kulinski et al. (17.Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) only detected a marginal reappearance of apoB100 secretion from LDL receptor-deficient hepatocytes, whereas we, in this study, show that apoB100 secretion remains with an average 69% is most likely because of the fact that they used an MTP inhibitor as compared with our model system, which used a conditional targeting of MTP. It is possible, and even likely, that the presence of MTP together with an inhibitor affects the first step of VLDL assembly differently than the absence of MTP alone. For instance, MTP and the inhibitor could form a complex that hinders the proper folding and lipidation of apoB100. Alternatively, an MTP inhibitor could interact with other proteins that are essential for the proper folding or lipidation of apoB100. Another explanation could be that residual MTP activity in our model was sufficient to support the first step of VLDL assembly. It would be of great interest to determine the secretion of apoB100 from hepatocytes that completely lack both Mttp and Ldlr. An inevitable question is why individuals with the rare dominant disorder abetalipoproteinemia, which is caused by mutations in Mttp (7.Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), have low levels of apoB100 in plasma. If the first step in VLDL assembly does not require MTP, wouldn't these patients have circulating LDL- and HDL-sized apoB100-containing lipoproteins in their plasma? The obvious answer is that these patients have intact hepatic LDL receptors that would, as in the liver-specific Mttp knockout mice, target those particles for degradation before they can be secreted. In theory, a combined abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypercholesterolemia genotype should go with the presence of dense apoB100-containing lipoproteins in plasma. However, to our knowledge, such a patient has not been reported. A similar argument can be used to understand the absence of apoB secretion from cell lines that lack MTP (18.Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the secretion of apoB100 reemerged in the absence of the LDL receptor indicates that hepatic LDL receptors are crucial for regulating the degradation of newly synthesized apoB100. Twisk et al. (15.Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that LDL receptor-deficient hepatocytes secrete 3.5-fold more apoB than wild-type hepatocytes and that the prevention of VLDL secretion by the LDL receptor occurred both intracellularly and after VLDL secretion. In our model, the LDL receptor completely blocked the secretion of dense apoB100 containing lipoprotein from the liver. In addition, our pulse-chase experiments, including the incubation of primary hepatocytes with heparin and the sub-cellular subfractionation studies, indicate that the LDL receptor targets these particles intracellularly, mainly in the ER. Assuming that there is no biological incentive for the liver to secrete lipid-poor particles, this gatekeeping function by the LDL receptor makes sense. In the presence of normal levels of hepatic MTP (as in the study by Twisk et al.), when buoyant VLDL particles also are made, the LDL receptor is likely to prioritize lipid-poor particles for degradation, because these particles have higher affinity for the LDL receptor than VLDL-sized lipoproteins. A gatekeeping function of the LDL receptor could also help explain the anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins that are unrelated to their ability to lower plasma cholesterol levels. These drugs inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a tightly regulated step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (37.Endo A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1569-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells respond to the shortage of cholesterol by up-regulating the transcription of cholesterol-regulated genes, including the LDL receptor (38.Ma P.T. Gil G. Sudhof T.C. Bilheimer D.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The current study indicates that the LDL receptor prevents the secretion of dense apoB100-containing lipoproteins from the liver. Because cholesterol carried in small dense particles is believed to be more atherogenic than cholesterol carried in VLDL particles (39.Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Kim S.K. Ambroziak P. Chu A. Wilson M.D. Hellerstein M.K. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the gatekeeping function of the LDL receptor would prevent hepatic secretion of cholesterol in potentially more atherogenic particles and promote cholesterol secretion in less atherogenic VLDL.

It is a member of the polyglutamine expansion disease family. These diseases are caused by the abnormal lengthening of a CAG triplet repeat in the coding region of the respective gene. In normal individuals, the triplet repeat translates into a polymorphic glutamine tract of fewer than 35∼40 residues. In patients with these diseases, the length of the polyglutamine tract exceeds the 35∼40-residue threshold. This results in a toxic gain of function that leads to tissue-specific neuronal loss. In most cases, nuclear ubiquitinated aggregates of the pathogenic proteins are observed in affected neurons (1Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y.

SCA1 is caused by polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-1, a nuclear protein of ∼800 residues. Transgenic animal models for this disease have contributed significantly to our understanding of polyglutamine expansion diseases in general. The areas addressed have included the role of protein aggregates in neural toxicity, the effects of chaperones and the proteasome in neuropathology, and the role of post-translational modification and protein-protein interactions in disease progression (4Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2307-2311Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that neurodegeneration is mediated by the interaction of ataxin-1 with the 14-3-3 proteins (5Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 457-468Google Scholar). This finding has emphasized the importance of understanding the normal function of the protein. Ataxin-1 appears to be involved in the regulation of gene expression. It has been shown to associate with several proteins involved in controlling transcription, and an expanded allele of ScA1 can down-regulate early gene expression in Purkinje's cells in transgenic mice (6Lin X. Antalffy B. Kang D. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 157-163Google Scholar).

Duvick L.A. Koshy B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 513-518Google Scholar) as well as in binding of a ubiquitin protease (13Hong S. Kim S.-J. Ka S. Choi I. Kang S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 298-306Google Scholar) and p80 coilin (14Hong S. Ka S. Kim S.-J. Park Y. Kang S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 35-42Google Scholar). As part of an effort to understand the structure and function of proteins involved in polyglutamine expansion diseases, we have determined the structure of the AXH domain of ataxin-1. Crystallization and Data Collection—The DNA sequence encoding the ataxin-1 AXH domain (residues 563-694, all residue numbering in this work follows that of ataxin-1 with a 30-glutamine repeat, unless otherwise stated) was subcloned into a modified pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen) that allows overproduction of a C-terminal His-tagged protein with a thrombin cleavage site. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli C41 strain (15Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Google Scholar) for overexpression. A double mutant of the AXH domain containing the I611M and V641M mutations was created to facilitate selenium incorporation. This mutant, SeMet AXH, was overproduced using the protocol of van den Ent et al. (16van den Ent F. Lockhart A. Kendrick-Jones J. Löwe J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1181-1187Google Scholar). Both native and SeMet AXH proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, subjected to thrombin cleavage, and further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences Resource-Q) and gel filtration (Superdex-75). The purified recombinant AXH proteins have 133 residues and contain a non-native Gly residue at their N termini. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The proteins were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0) with 5 mm dithiothreitol. Both native and SeMet AXH crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 290 K with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.8), 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 16% polyethylene glycol 4000 with 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant. A set of native diffraction data consisting of 114 frames of 1° oscillation each was collected from one single crystal. One SeMet crystal was used to collect a complete set of multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data at the peak, edge, and remote wavelengths (Table I). For each wavelength, 100 frames of 1° oscillation image were collected, followed by another 100 frames corresponding to an inverse beam set. All data were collected under a nitrogen stream at 100 K at beamline 14.2 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury Laboratory (Warrington, United Kingdom). The diffraction data were processed with IPMOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EACMB Newsletter Protein Crystallogr.26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and were merged, scaled, and reduced with programs from the CCP4 suite (27Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The statistics for data processing are summarized in Table I. The space group of the native crystal is P212121, with unit cell dimensions a = 48.78, b = 82.44, and c = 137.78 Å. There are four molecules in the asymmetric unit, giving a Vm of 2.4 Å3/Da, which is within the range commonly observed in protein crystals (18Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure of the AXH domain was determined using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. Initial phases were calculated with the program SOLVE and refined with RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar, 20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) and subsequently with the program SHARP (21de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Google Scholar). Phasing statistics are shown in Table II. Solvent flattening with SOLOMON (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Google Scholar) at an optimal solvent content of 42% produced an interpretable electron density map. An atomic model of one monomer chain was built into this 3.0-Å multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental map with the program MAIN (23Turk D. Ph.D. thesis.

The monomer model was then placed into the remaining electron densities corresponding to three other monomers. Because the native and SeMet mutant crystals are isomorphous, the crude structure model could be used for refinement against the native data at this stage. The SeMet data set was not used in further refinement. Each cycle of refinement consisted of manual rebuilding with the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), followed by computational refinement at the early stages with CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Rebuilding was guided by electron density maps calculated with 2mFo - DFc and mFo - DFc coefficients (28Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1986; 42: 140-149Google Scholar). At all stages of refinement, 5% of the data were excluded in refinement for cross-validation. A bulk solvent model was used, and non-crystallographic symmetry was not imposed. A combination of programs ARP and Refmac4 (27Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) was employed in building and refinement of the solvent structure.

Open table in a new tab Quality of Structure Model—The four molecules of the AXH domain in the structure model are of good quality. The N termini are better defined than the C termini in general. The C terminus of chain D is clearly revealed by electron density and can be completely built. Chains A-C have the last five residues disordered. There is a region of chain B that is disordered (residues 600-611), and three residues of chain C (residues 635-637) cannot be modeled because of lack of electron densities. Chain B residues 600-611 were modeled with reference to weak densities calculated from the SeMet data sets. These two regions were allowed to refine to elevated B factors to indicate that they are disordered. The final model was assessed by the program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), and the stereochemistry was found to be excellent (Table III). The overall G-factor is -0.1, which is similar to other structures determined at this resolution. For analysis of the monomer, chain D was used; for dimer, the C·D dimer was used. Sequence Conservation—Five AXH domains (human ataxin-1, CG4547 protein from D. melanogaster (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9W3V7), K04F10.1 protein from C. elegans (Swiss-Prot accession number O44771), human HBP1 (Swiss-Prot accession number O60381), and frog HBP1 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q8JH80)) aligned manually were submitted to the ConSurf server (30Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Google Scholar) 3Available at consurf.tau.ac.il. for analysis. The ConSurf server assigns relative conservation scores to each residue, taking into account the evolutionary relationships among the family of homologs. The scores are normalized such that the average score is zero, and negative and positive deviations represent the degrees of conservation and variation, respectively. Each residue is then assigned a value 1-9 (1 for most variable, 5 for average, up to 9 for most conserved), which is used for mapping the relative conservation on the molecular surface (see figure legends). Dimeric Interface Analysis—The dimeric interfaces were analyzed with the Protein-Protein Interaction server at University College London. 4Available at www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/. Accessible surface areas (ASA) and their differences (ΔASA) were calculated with NACCESS. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical centrifugation experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl at 293 K. Protein sample loading concentrations were 0.5, 1, and 10 mg/ml. Absorbance at 280 nm was measured at 12,000, 18,000, and 24,000 rpm using interference optics and analyzed using UltraSpin software. 5Available at www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk. Quaternary Structure—There are four chains in the crystal asymmetric unit arranged into two spherical dimers (A·B and C·D) in which individual molecules are related by an ∼2-fold rotation (Fig. 2). Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that the AXH domain is a dimer in solution (Fig. 3). The A·B and C·D dimers form similar interfaces with buried surface areas of 1570 and 1645 Å2, respectively. These values agree well with those obtained for other known homodimeric interfaces (Table IV) (31Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Google Scholar). The other intermolecular contacts (B·C) seen in the crystal lattice are most likely an effect of crystal packing.Fig. 3The ataxin-1 AXH domain is dimeric in solution. Analytical ultracentrifugation data (absorbance at 280 nm against the radius) were fit to models describing the sedimentation equilibrium of a dimer model (gray curves) (A) with the residuals of fitting (B). Shown are the results of a protein sample at a loading concentration of 1 mg/ml at three different speeds (see “Experimental Procedures”). The apparent molecular weight is 27,500 ± 1,500 (3σ), which agrees well with the expected molecular weight of an AXH dimer of 29,005. A higher order oligomer or aggregate was also detected (Mr ∼ 115,000 ± 13,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IVDimeric interface analysisData base homodimerAXHA·BC·DB·CASA (Å2)168515701645770Planarity3.54.04.12.1Circularity0.70.80.850.8Gap volume index2.22.22.32.7Nonpolar atoms (%)75767555Hydrogen bonds/100 Å20.30.21 Open table in a new tab Monomer Structure—The main feature of the monomer is an open β-barrel with a Greek key motif formed by strands β3, β4, β5, and β9 (Fig. 4). This is known as an OB (oligomer-binding)-fold and is found in many different proteins (32Arcus V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 794-801Google Scholar, 33Agrawal, V., and Kishan, R. K. V.

When the AXH domain was queried with the DALI server 6Available at www.ebi.ac.uk/dali. for structural homologs, the four top scoring structures were all OB-fold proteins, the most similar being the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L2. The AXH domain lacks the strand corresponding to OB-fold strand 5. In a typical OB-fold structure, the connectivity between strands 3 and 4 forms an α-helix that caps the barrel. In the AXH domain, the loop between strands β5 and β9 also contains a helix. There are, however, insertions at both ends of the loop that form three short strands (β6, β7, and β8) (Fig. 4). The OB-fold is preceded by an α-helix (α1) that packs onto the edge of the β-barrel and two short strands (β1 and β2) (Figs. 4B and 6B).Fig. 6Sequence conservation of the ataxin-1 AXH domain.A, view of the C·D dimer (chain C in blue and chain D in orange) showing charged surface residues that are highly conserved among the AXH domains. These residues may contribute a conserved binding surface of a yet unidentified interaction partner. The RNA-binding site is inferred from the general ligand-binding surface of other OB-fold proteins (see “Discussion”). B, sequence alignment of five AXH domains: human ataxin-1, CG4547 protein from D. melanogaster (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9W3V7), K04F10.1 protein from C. elegans (Swiss-Prot accession number O44771), human (h) HBP1 (Swiss-Prot accession number O60381), and Xenopus laevis (x) HBP1 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q8JH80). Residue numbering is that of the ataxin-1 30-glutamine repeat. The black and gray triangles mark the positions where a 12-residue insertion and a single amino acid insertion are present in the two HBP1 sequences, respectively. The secondary structures corresponding to chain D are shown on top. The IXCXE RB-interacting motif of HBP1 is highlighted in pink. The residues involved in dimer formation are identified by semicircles on top. Blue left-sided and red right-sided semicircles mark the residues of chains C and D, respectively. The number of semicircles is proportional to the change in ASA of that residue upon dimerization, with each semicircle representing 20 Å2 and a maximum cutoff at four semicircles. Purple double-headed arrows identify conserved charged surface residues; cyan double-headed arrows identify putative RNA-binding residues (see A). Relative sequence conservation was analyzed with the ConSurf server (see “Experimental Procedures”). The colors dark green, light green, gray, light orange, and dark orange represent amino acids that are highly conserved (ConSurf color 9), conserved (ConSurf colors 7 and 8), average (ConSurf colors 4-6), variable (ConSurf colors 2 and 3), and highly variable (ConSurf color 1), respectively. The color bar shows how the color numbers assigned by the ConSurf server are represented in this figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Differences among the Four Monomers—There are considerable structural differences among the four chains of the AXH domain in the crystal asymmetric unit. Most noticeably, the 19 N-terminal residues preceding strand β1 (residues 562-580) can have two different structures: the A and C monomers adopt a main chain conformation that is distinct from that of the B and D monomers (Fig. 5, A and B). In chains A and C, residues 565 and 566 constitute a strand (β0), and residues 573-575 constitute a partial 310 helix (h1) (Fig. 5A). In chains B and D, strand β0 is replaced by a 310 helix (h0) formed by residues 568-570 (chain B) or by residues 564-566 (chain D), followed by residues 574-576 constituting the second 310 helix (h1) (Fig. 5A). In a strict structural sense, A·B and C·D are heterodimers, with residues 581-688 being the invariant body of the protein. When chain A is aligned with chains B-D over this range, the root mean square deviations in C-α atomic positions are 3.8, 0.5, and 1.2 Å, respectively. The large deviation between chains A and B is mainly due to the presence of a 13-residue disordered loop (residues 600-612) in the B chain (Fig. 2). This region of chain B is not in contact with other chains of the AXH domain or with any symmetry-related molecules. The Dimeric Interface—The 20 residues at the N terminus are the most important in maintaining the dimeric organization (Fig. 5, A and B). These two extended tails, running parallel to the dyad axis, embrace each other and bind to a mostly nonpolar binding surface. Both main chain and side chain atoms of the N-terminal tails participate in dimerization (Fig. 5B). Apart from the N-terminal tail, residues contributing to the dimeric interface include mostly hydrophobic residues from OB-fold elements β3, β5, α2, and β9. The residues that are most important in forming the dimer are listed in Table V.Table VMost important residues for dimer interactionΔASA (Å2)Sequence conservation scoreChain CChain DAla56667 (MC + SC)−0.28 (conserved)Pro56893 (SC)109 (MC + SC)−0.35 (conserved)Pro569113 (MC + SC)109 (MC + SC)3.57 (highly variable)Thr57093 (SC)0.14 (variable)Pro57394 (SC)−0.22 (conserved)Tyr57480 (SC)77 (SC)−0.25 (conserved)Phe575162 (MC + SC)−0.64 (highly conserved)Met57663 (SC)−0.41 (conserved)Ile58070 (MC + SC)65 (MC + SC)0.53 (highly variable)Gln58272 (MC + SC)0.14 (variable)Leu66978 (SC)−0.09 (variable)Leu68894 (SC)113 (SC)−0.02 (variable) Open table in a new tab Sequence Conservation—Approximately 65% (82) of the residues are conserved among the five AXH domains shown in Fig. 6B. The largest variation occurs in the region at the C terminus of helix α1 and the N-terminal half of strand β3. There are three regions where conservation is high. The first one includes many residues that are N-terminal to and that precede the OB-fold: from helixes h1 to α1. The second region covers from the middle of strand β5 to strand β7, including the two β-strands (β6 and β7) that are extensions of the OB-fold. The third conserved region includes residues from the loop after strand β8 to strand β9. Most of the conserved solvent-exposed residues are clustered on one face of the molecule in an arrangement consistent with a ligand-binding site (Fig. 6A). About half of the residues that are important for dimer formation are conserved (Fig. 6B). Structure and Function of the AXH Domain of Ataxin-1—It has long been established that ataxin-1 dimerizes in vivo (35Koshy B. Matilla T. Burright E.N. Merry D.E. Fischbeck K.H. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1311-1318Google Scholar) and that dimerization is an important requirement for its normal function. The structure of the AXH domain and the analytical ultracentrifugation data provide direct confirmation of this observation. From truncation studies, residues 495-605 have been identified as the minimal self-association region of ataxin-1 (Fig. 1) (12Burright E.N. Davidson J.D. Duvick L.A. Koshy B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 513-518Google Scholar). The boundaries of the self-association region do not coincide with those of the AXH domain: the two regions share ∼40 residues in common, including the 20 residues that are the determinants for dimerization (Fig. 1). The fact that the self-association region can self-associate indicates that the interactions between the two N-terminal tails are strong enough to mediate dimerization in vitro, even without the rest of the AXH domain. A recent study revealed that the first five residues (positions 563-567, SPAAA) can be removed without affecting dimerization, whereas a further deletion of residues 568-573 (PPTLPP) leads to low yield and non-native structure (36de Chiara C. Giannini C. Adinolfi S. de Boer J. Guida S. Ramos A. Jodice C. Kioussis D. Pastore A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 107-112Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these dimerization residues can be exploited in mediating heterodimeric interactions with other proteins. When the 20-residue peptide sequence was queried in BLASTP for similarity, the only significant hits were from the equivalent regions in the mouse and rat ataxin-1 homologs (data not shown). The search did not even pick up the corresponding region in the HBP1 protein, presumably because the overall homology of this 20-residue motif is weak (Fig. 6B). Nevertheless, the best conserved residues (Lys577, Gly578, and Ser579) in this 20-residue motif contribute little to dimerization (Fig. 6B). It is unlikely that the AXH domain and HBP1 interact via this 20-residue motif. The 20 N-terminal residues constitute an interesting motif that can adopt one of two structures, and these two different conformations interact complementarily to form an extensive dimeric interface. Despite the low sequence complexity, these two alternative conformations are well ordered (Fig. 5B). Apparently this structural adaptability is essential in maintaining the AXH dimer. It has been known for some time that some protein or peptide sequences can adopt different conformations dependent on the protein context. The most dramatic demonstration is a"

Calpains have been found in some prokaryotes (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and single cell eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) but are better characterized in multicellular organisms like C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans (2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). They have in common a cysteine protease core region composed of two structural domains, I-II (∼330 residues). Most calpains have additional C-terminal domains, the two most common being a C2-like domain and a Ca2+-binding penta EF-hand (PEF) 1The abbreviations used are: PEFpenta EF-handDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceIWFintrinsic tryptophan fluorescenceSLY-MCAsuccinyl-leucine-tyrosine-aminomethyl coumarinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidwtwild typer.m.s.d.root mean square devation.1The abbreviations used are: PEFpenta EF-handDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceIWFintrinsic tryptophan fluorescenceSLY-MCAsuccinyl-leucine-tyrosine-aminomethyl coumarinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidwtwild typer.m.s.d.root mean square devation. domain (18Hosfield C.M.

N-terminal combinations are also observed such as the zinc finger domains of SOL calpains (2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Several calpain isoforms (μ, m, and nCL-4) form heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed calpain small subunit (ss1), through their homologous C-terminal PEF domains (2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This dimerization was illustrated in the crystal structures of the Ca2+-free m-calpain heterodimer (18Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 21Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G.

In addition to its C-terminal PEF domain, the small subunit contains an N-terminal glycine-rich domain V that is too mobile to see in the x-ray crystal structure.

Although most calpains are complex multidomain proteins, the nCL-2′ splice variant of nCL-2 (calpain 8) and the P. gingivalis calpain contain only the two protease core domains. Consistent with this observation, we have recently shown that the protease core from μ-calpain (referred to here as μI-II or μ-minicalpain) is a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease when expressed in isolation (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Ca2+-bound μI-II revealed two novel non-EF hand Ca2+ binding sites, one in each domain, that are conserved from C. elegans to humans. Neither Ca2+ ion is directly involved in catalysis, but rather Ca2+ binding to these sites appears to drive the realignment of the active site residues to the positions seen in the related papain family of cysteine proteases. Based on comparison with the protease core in the inactive m-calpain heterodimer structure (18Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 21Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), major conformational changes must occur upon Ca2+ binding. Each Ca2+ site is postulated to assemble through the rearrangements of flexible loops, their loading permitting the two domains to switch into the active conformation in a concerted manner (Fig. 1). Although the x-ray structures reveal the starting and end points of the conformational change, they do not explain how the transition is effected. Here we elucidate the order of Ca2+ binding to the core sites, the basis for cooperativity between them, and the overall mechanism for realignment of the active site residues. This activation mechanism is central and fundamental to the calpains. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of μ/m-minicalpain Hybrids and μI-II Mutants—The reciprocal μ/m minicalpain hybrid constructs, μI-mII and mI-μII, were generated by swapping μI or mI coding segments into the corresponding region of the previously described pET24d mI-II or μI-II constructs, both of which have a C-terminal His6 tag (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C. Lim D. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The AgeI unique restriction site, which occurs naturally in μ-calpain at the DI-DII boundary (μ-217FTGG220), was used as the swap site. An AgeI restriction site was engineered by Kunkel mutagenesis into the corresponding location within mI-II without alteration of its amino acid sequence using the primer ctcggcaatgccaccggtgaagtcttcaaag (24Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Swapping NcoI-AgeI fragments produced the desired mI-μII and μI-mII hybrids. Primers used to generate amino acid replacements within pET24d-μI-II are identified by their targeted amino acid substitution. In each case a diagnostic restriction site (underlined) was introduced. The primers were: D106A, NdeI agctccctggcatatggccgttcgggtgg; W298A, SacII ctccacttcacccgcggggttccgcat; E302R, ApaI gtcactccagggccctttccaccgcacttcacttcaccccag; D331A, NaeI gacctccagaattcgccggcttccatcttgacc; and E333A, NarI aaggacatccagaaggcgccgtcttccatct. Two mutations (a double and a single) within the pET24d-m80k construct were achieved using the primers E320A/D321A, SacII atccagaattctcccgcggcctgccgttctg; and R94G, KpnI ccttggcagatgtcggtaccggtagcacctcc. To perform protein crystallization in the presence of Ca2+ without the risk of autolysis, the inactivating cysteine 115 to serine mutation was introduced in the D106A μI-II construct using C115S, PvuII agccaggagccagctgtcccccagagc. Cloned and mutated inserts were sequenced (Cortec DNA Services Laboratory, Inc.) to confirm their identity and integrity. Expression in Escherichia coli, purification, and storage of the above constructs and their mutants followed the previously described protocols (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Correct folding of the minicalpain mutants was verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a VP-DSC calorimeter (Microcal) (25Brewer J.M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 173-175PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature change was at the rate of 90 °C/h, and scans were recorded from 20 °C to 60 °C. Prior to analysis, samples were dialyzed overnight in 4 liters of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dialysis buffer was filtered using a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) and used to obtain a baseline during several buffer-buffer scans. Protein-buffer scans were performed at a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Using Origin 5.1 software, the data was corrected for the buffer transitions and modeled to one thermal transition to obtain the melting temperature. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis of μI-II and its mutants was performed at 22 °C using l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin or 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Sigma). The substrate concentration was 1 mg/ml in a reaction volume of 150 μl or less. Trypsin or chymotrypsin was present at 0.1 mg/ml. To monitor the progress of proteolysis, aliquots at timed intervals were mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Activity and Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Assays—The steady-state kinetics of mutants and μ/m minicalpain hybrids were measured under similar conditions to those originally described for μI-II using the peptide, succinyl-leucine-tyrosine-aminomethyl coumarin (SLY-MCA, Sigma), as substrate (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These conditions were also maintained for the CaCl2 activity titrations, which involved increasing CaCl2 concentrations up to 175 mm for the minicalpains. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (IWF) measurements and data analysis were performed as previously described (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystallization of D106A/C115S μI-II in the presence of Ca2+ was done by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method under slightly different conditions from those established for wild-type μI-II, and produced crystals of a new space group. The well solution contained 1.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), and 10 mm CaCl2. The drop size was less than 5 μl and contained an equal volume of well solution and protein solution (12.5 mg/ml). Crystals were cryo-protected by six serial soakings (each for up to 5 min) in stabilization solutions containing increasing 5-30% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source beamline F1, which was equipped with a Quantum-4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) and a liquid nitrogen cryo unit (Oxford Cryosystems). The diffraction data were processed as previously described for μI-II (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The space group was P212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table I). The structure solution was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe, and the structure of the Ca2+-bound μI-II (PDB accession code 1KXR) as a model. Refinement and analysis of the structure were performed using the software described for μI-II (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The ribbon diagrams were generated using Molscript (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). The electron density diagram was made using Xfit, and all structure figures were rendered in RASTER3D (27McRee D.E. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Validation of Mutants—In this study, the Ca2+-dependent mechanism by which the active site of calpain is aligned for catalysis was investigated using domain swaps and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2) (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Where targeted amino acid changes interrupt or alter a specific step in the process, it is essential to establish that the change in activity is due to the loss of a functional group and not due to the mis-folding of the mini-calpain. In general, mis-folded proteins are either poorly produced in E. coli or accumulate in inclusion bodies. All mutants and swaps used here expressed well in E. coli, remained soluble, and gave final yields of >10 mg/4 liters of culture that are comparable to those obtained with μI-II and mI-II. Another indication of correct folding is that the chromatography profiles of mutant and wild-type proteins were comparable (not shown). All the minicalpains produced discrete, sharp peaks that eluted at similar locations in the profiles. To further validate the mutants, their thermal denaturation profiles were measured using DSC. Each minicalpain, mutant and wild type, showed a single thermal transition (Fig. 3A). The values ranged from 47 °C (wild type) to 44 °C (D106A). The latter mutant was the one for which an x-ray structure was determined, which revealed no significant differences in the protein fold. With the thermal transitions for the other mutants falling in between these flanking values, it can be safely assumed that none of them was structurally compromised. Limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin (Fig. 3B) and trypsin (not shown) confirmed this. The digestion products were essentially the same for each minicalpain after 80 or 320 min, the only difference being a slightly faster rate of breakdown for some mutants like E302R and W298A. The latter and E333A were the subject of NMR analysis by comparison of its HSQC spectra with that of the wild-type μI-II (not shown), which revealed no significant perturbations in the fold of the mutant. Experimental Strategy—In conjunction with the domain swaps and site-directed mutagenesis, we have used two specific biochemical features of the calpain protease core to elucidate its mechanism of activation by Ca2+. One is the large change in IWF that accompanies the Ca2+-driven alignment of the active site for catalysis (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We provide evidence below that this change is, as previously suspected, largely due to the movement of Trp298. The other is the Ca2+-dependent proteolytic activity of the core as measured by SLY-MCA hydrolysis. The gain in enzyme activity for μI-II is biphasic. The first phase is sigmoidal. It reflects the cooperative binding of the two Ca2+ and parallels the IWF change. The second phase is a gradual gain in activity at unphysiologically high Ca2+ levels, which we attribute to general stabilization of the bilobal core. The core lacks the support of the other domains it would have in the whole enzyme. What readily distinguishes the m- and μ-minicalpains as enzymes is the greatly reduced activity of mI-II due to the collapse of a key helix in domain I leading to a rearrangement of hydrophobic core residues (23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C. Lim D. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Minicalpain Domain Swaps Demonstrate the Order of Ca2+ Binding—The increase in IWF during Ca2+ titration was measured for four minicalpains, native μI-II and mI-II, and the reciprocal domain swaps, mI-μII and μI-mII. All four gave characteristic sigmoidal profiles that fitted well to the Hill equation (Fig. 4A and Table II). Ca2+ binding was cooperative between the two domains as indicated both by the upward curvature of the Scatchard plots (Fig. 4A, inset) and by the Hill coefficients of ∼2. Ca2+ concentrations for half-maximal change ([Ca2+]0.5) were ∼27 and 190 μm for μI-II and mI-II, respectively (Fig. 4A and Table II). These values are remarkably close to the Ca2+ requirement for activation of the intact μ- (5-50 μm) and m-calpains (200-1000 μm). The Ca2+ requirements for the mI-μII and μI-mII swaps were 33 and 104 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A and Table II), intermediate between those of μI-II and mI-II. Even more informative was the shape of the sigmoidal IWF profiles. The μII-containing constructs, μI-II and mI-μII, produced very similar profiles that saturated at ∼200 μm, whereas the mII-containing constructs, mI-II and μI-mII, both reached a plateau at ∼1 mm. Thus, it appears domain II controls the end point of the titration and binds Ca2+ second. The initial part of the transition was very similar for the μII-containing constructs, μI-II and mI-μII, with both proteins beginning their change at <10 μm Ca2+. We, therefore, reasoned that DI from either isoform has high Ca2+ affinity and binds Ca2+ first, with μI being a slightly better binder than mI.Table IIHill equation and steady-state SLY-MCA hydrolysis parameters[Ca2+]ia[Ca2+]i is the half-maximal Ca2+ requirement obtained during intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titrations.nHbnH is the Hill coefficient.kcatckcat refers to the nanomoles of MCA released per second per micromole of enzyme.Kmkcat/Kmdkcat/Km is the catalytic efficiency of MCA release.μm× 10−5s−1μm× 10−8 μm·s−1μI-II26.5 ± 1.01.842.7 ± 4.7335 ± 6130mI-mII104 ± 331.423.0 ± 0.3403 ± 957mI-μII32.9 ± 3.41.73.6 ± 0.9460 ± 108mI-II190 ± 41.7NDeND, not determined.NDInactiveD106A μI-II144 ± 211.3NDNDNDW298A μI-II15 ± 31.8NDNDNDE302R μI-II119 ± 31.4NDNDInactiveD331A μI-II103 ± 61.31.4 ± 0.5318 ± 2044(33.1 ± 2.5)fThe parameters obtained at 20 mm CaCl2.(304 ± 9)fThe parameters obtained at 20 mm CaCl2.(109)fThe parameters obtained at 20 mm CaCl2.E333A μI-II292 ± 31.8NDNDNDm80k/21k353 ± 95.63,248 ± 60211 ± 965,000R94G m80k/21k1,485 ± 631.92,246 ± 104189 ± 611,860ED320/321AA8,352 ± 6411.31,341 ± 169131 ± 1210,182a [Ca2+]i is the half-maximal Ca2+ requirement obtained during intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titrations.b nH is the Hill coefficient.c kcat refers to the nanomoles of MCA released per second per micromole of enzyme.d kcat/Km is the catalytic efficiency of MCA release.e ND, not determined.f The parameters obtained at 20 mm CaCl2. Open table in a new tab We further demonstrated the functionality and hybrid nature of the domain swaps by testing their enzyme activity. We have previously shown that μI-II readily hydrolyzes the calpain substrate SLY-MCA (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In contrast, mI-II fails to cleave SLY-MCA because of an intrinsic inactivation mechanism triggered by the collapse of a key α-helix at Gly203 in domain I (23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C. Lim D. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This occurs in the Ca2+-loaded state and leads to the protrusion of Trp106 into the active site cleft. Consistent with this, the activity of the mI-containing swap, mI-μII, was barely detectable with a kcat of 3.6 ± 0.9 × 10-5 s-1, and a Km of 0.46 ± 0.01 mm (Fig. 4B and Table II). In contrast, the μI-containing swap, μI-mII, where there is an alanine in place of Gly203, was quite active. Its kcat (2.3 ± 0.3 × 10-4 s-1) was about half that of μI-II, and its Km was slightly higher (0.403 ± 0.009 mmversus ∼0.3 mm). As seen with μI-II, the activity of μI-mII (but not that of mI-μII) was augmented at higher ionic strength due to general stabilization of the core. We have also modeled the swaps using the Ca2+-bound μI-II and mI-II structures (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 23Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C. Lim D. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The domain interface is highly conserved between the isoforms (not shown), and there are no obvious structural impediments to the hybrids undergoing activation by the same mechanism that brings the two domains together in μI-II. Several inferences can be made from the domain swap analysis. Regardless of isoform, the domain I site has a very similar high affinity for Ca2+, being occupied prior to domain II. In contrast, the affinity of domain II is isoform-specific being the principal determinant of Ca2+ requirement within the protease core. Trp298 Contributes Most to the Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Change of μI-II—Ca2+ loading results in a very substantial IWF increase (∼37% in μI-II and ∼28% in mI-II) that shows the cooperativity of the process and makes the conformational change easy to follow. The prime candidate for the major contributor to the IWF increase is Trp298 (22Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Its indole ring moves from the wedge-like position in between domains, where it is exposed to solvent on both sides, into a Ca2+-induced hydrophobic pocket that fully buries one of its sides (Fig. 1). Because the Trp298 residue remains surface-accessible, rather than contributing to a hydrophobic core, its mutagenesis to alanine is structurally feasible. Its position above the domain II catalytic triad residues (His272 and Asn296) matches that seen in other cysteine proteases, where it shields these residues from solvent exposure and thus facilitates catalysis. We made the W298A mutant in the inactive C115S μI-II, because we predicted that activity would in any case be abolished by exposure of the key catalytic residues to solvent. Indeed, a W288Y mutation within the m-calpain heterodimer resulted in a significantly lower activity (<5% of wild type), despite this being a much more conservative amino acid substitution (29Arthur J.S. Gauthier S. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The correct folding of W298A was validated by differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. 3A), limited proteolysis (Fig. 3B), and two-dimensional NMR (heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy) using 15N-labeled protein (not shown). In all of these tests the mutant was virtually indistinguishable from the wild type. However, this mutation drastically reduced the IWF increase upon Ca2+ saturation from 37% (wild-type value) to 10% (Fig. 5A, gray trace). This increase was still sigmoidal and fitted the Hill equation with [Ca2+]0.5 ∼ 15 μm, being >90% complete at"

In particular, cloning and functional expression of gap junction proteins (connexins (Cx)) from zebrafish retina have shown that this part of the brain possesses a high degree of connexin diversity that may account for differential functional properties of electrical synapses. Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a new connexin, designated zebrafish Cx52.6 (zfCx52.6). This connexin shows little similarity to known connexins from fish and higher vertebrates. By combining in situ hybridization with Laser Capture Microdissection and RT-PCR, we found that this novel fish connexin is expressed in horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Functional expression of zfCx52.6 in neuroblastoma cells and Xenopus oocytes led to functional gap junctional channels and, in single oocytes, induced large non-junctional membrane currents indicative of the formation of hemichannels, which were inhibited in reversible fashion by raising extracellular Ca2+ concentrations.

A wealth of knowledge concerning the molecular composition and functional properties of non-neuronal gap junctions has been accumulated (for review, see Refs. 1.Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur.

In contrast, the identity and role of connexins present at neuronal gap junctions have been less well defined (4.Bennett M.V.L. Barrio T.A. Bargiello T.A. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E. Sáez J.C.

Electrical synapses (gap junctions) in neuronal circuits have become a major focus in the study of network properties such as synchronization and oscillation (7.Galarreta W. Hestrin S.

Knowledge of the full connexin complement expressed by neurons of the central nervous system is an essential prerequisite to our understanding of the contribution of electrical synapses to these fundamental properties of network functioning. The first neuronal connexin was identified by O'Brien et al. (9.O'Brien J. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Ripps H. Mol. Biol.

The retina is a highly ordered laminar structure, comprising three compact layers of neurons separated by two synaptic layers, which has proven a valuable model to study gap junctions and cell specific expression patterns of connexins in neuronal tissues (19.Sohl G.

Nature. 1995; 377: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), supports the idea that multiple types of connexins may exist within the neuronal populations of this tissue. We have recently described a molecular approach to clone novel connexin genes from primary neurons of fish retina, taking advantage of a dissociation procedure that allows for >70% enrichment of horizontal cells (18.Dermietzel R. Kremer M. Paputsoglu G. Stang A. Skerrett I.M. Gomes D. Srinivas M. Janssen-Bienhold U. Weiler R. Nicholson B.J. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8331-8343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By combining rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with the screening of a genomic DNA library from zebrafish, we have isolated a novel connexin gene, designated as zfCx52.6 because of its predicted molecular mass. Sequence analysis revealed only limited homology to other connexins from fish and higher vertebrates, indicating that zfCx52.6 is a distant relative of the known connexin genes. In situ hybridization, laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that this connexin is specifically expressed in the INL of the retina. During development the up-regulation of zfCx52.6 expression parallels the expression profile of the basic helix loop helix transcription factor atonal5, an established marker for retinogenesis (40.Vetter M.L. Brown N.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Functional expression studies in transiently transfected Neuro2A as well as single or paired Xenopus oocytes indicated that it is a functional member of the connexin family that exhibited a moderate degree of voltage sensitivity, a unitary conductance of 41 ± 3 pS and the formation of Ca2+-gated hemichannels. Expression, localization and biophysical properties suggest that zfCx52.6 is a candidate zebrafish horizontal cell gap junction protein. Cloning of Full-length zfCx52.6 —A full-length clone of zfCx52.6 was obtained by screening a zebrafish genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the probe frag50 previously described (18.Dermietzel R. Kremer M. Paputsoglu G. Stang A. Skerrett I.M. Gomes D. Srinivas M. Janssen-Bienhold U. Weiler R. Nicholson B.J. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8331-8343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic clone was sequenced, and RACE extension, using retina RNA as the template, was performed to identify expressed sequences from the zfCx52.6 genomic locus. The molecular procedures used have been described in detail previously (18.Dermietzel R. Kremer M. Paputsoglu G. Stang A. Skerrett I.M. Gomes D. Srinivas M. Janssen-Bienhold U. Weiler R. Nicholson B.J. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8331-8343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Janssen-Bienhold U. Nagel H. Weiler R. Eur. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2057-2064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zfCx52.6 gene sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (GI:21311548). The zfCx52.6 DNA, mRNA, and protein structures were analyzed with the Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI), the protein prediction and analysis tools at the ExPasy home page (www.expasy.ch), SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de), and Predictprotein (www.embl-heidelberg.de/-predictprotein/). Putative phosphorylation motifs were predicted using Phosphobase 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from adult zebrafish tissues and developmental stages after lysis in TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and first-strand cDNA synthesized as described by Zoidl et al. (43.Zoidl G. Meier C. Petrasch-Parwez E. Zoidl C. Habbes H-W. Kremer M. Srinivas M Spray D.J. Dermietzel R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 448-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ZfCx52.6 expression was detected by RT-PCR using upstream (sense) primer Cx52.6-1 (5′-CTCGGCCGACAGAGAAGAACATC-3′) and downstream (antisense) primer Cx52.6–2 (5′-TCACTGCTGCAGGATTGCAGACG-3′). The primers for β-actin (actin-1, nt 226–246, actin-2, nt 448–429) have been described previously (18.Dermietzel R. Kremer M. Paputsoglu G. Stang A. Skerrett I.M. Gomes D. Srinivas M. Janssen-Bienhold U. Weiler R. Nicholson B.J. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8331-8343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA equivalent of 1 ng of total RNA was used as the template for a PCR reaction (50 μl of total volume) in a mixture containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 25 pmol of specific primers, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA-polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To ensure that PCR signals were not the result of contaminating genomic DNA, control samples containing either water or RNA, in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the step of cDNA synthesis, were run in parallel. An initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min was followed by 35 amplification cycles (30 s at 94 °C; 30 s at52 °C; 30 s at 72 °C) and a final extension period of 10 min at 72 °C. Volumes of 10 μl of each amplification reaction were separated on 1% agarose gels and images of ethidium bromide-stained gels were recorded using the Imagemaster documentation system (AP-Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Real time RT-PCR was performed using the 2× Real-time SYBR-Green I Kit (Eurogentec SA, Seraing, Belgium) and the reaction conditions described recently (44.Russwurm M. Mergia E. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Cell. Signaling. 2003; 15: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Primers were selected using the Primer Express®Software (Applied Biosystems). The sense and antisense primers for actin were actin-3 (5′-ACTCCATCATGAAGTGCG-ACG-3′) and actin-4 (5′-TTCCTTCTGCATACGGTCAGC-3′). The sense and antisense primers for zfCx52.6 were zfCx52.6–3 (5′-TGGACAGATGGTACCTTTGCC-3′) and zfCx52.6–4 (5′-GTTGTCTGG-AATGGACCTTCG-3′). The primers for atonal5 (ath5; GI:10566824), notch homolog 1a (notch1a; GI:10859115) and 16 S ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA; GI: 4835956) were Ath5–1 (5′-CGGCCAATGCAAGAGAACGAAAGA-3′) and Ath5–2 (5′-TCCGATTGAGGGCCATGAT-GTAGCT-3′), notch1a-1 (5′-CCCCGCTC-TGCTGCCCAAACA-3′), notch1a-2 (5′-TTGCG-TGTTTTCTTAGCCGTGTTGTTGT-3′), 16s-1 (5′-GGGGCGACCACGGAGTAAAAAACA-3′) and 16s-2 (5′-GGCCGGATCGTCTTTGGTCAGGT-3′). The threshold cycle (Ct-value) was determined as the first amplification cycle with a signal above background. The relative level of zfCx52.6 expression was calculated using the ΔCt-Method using actin or 16 S rRNA expression as the endogenous reference (Applied Biosystems). The different expression levels were graphically expressed as the ΔCt value that was calculated by subtraction of the mean Ct value of the reference gene (actin, 16s rRNA) from the mean Ct value of the gene of interest (zfCx52.6, notch1, zath5). All experiments shown represent two independent sets of samples. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Intraassay and interassay variability was less then 5%. In Situ Hybridization and Laser Capture Microdissection Analysis— For the localization of zfCx52.6 in the zebrafish retina, in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis of laser microdissected samples were performed. Freshly prepared zebrafish eyes were embedded in Tissue-Tek (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Serial cryostat sections of 12-μm thickness were collected on superfrost plus slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and stored immediately at -80 °C. The in situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously except for the anti-DIG antibody incubation step that was performed for 16 h at 4 °C (45.Gillen C. Gleichmann M. Greiner-Petter R. Zoidl G. Kupfer S. Bosse F. Auer J. Müller H.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The antisense probe and the corresponding sense probe were generated from a plasmid containing nt 648–1401 of the zfCx52.6 coding region. The synthesized probe was selected for minimal homologies with published connexin sequences (GenBank™, NCBI, Washington, D. C.). All cRNA probes were hybridized to sections in 50 μl of hybridization buffer for 16 h. Probe concentrations (800 ng/ml) and temperature of pre-hybridization and hybridization (52 °C) were selected for high stringency. After digestion of excess RNA and color development samples were counterstained with Certistain (“Kernechtrot”; VWR International AG, Switzerland) for 1min and mounted in aqueous mounting medium (Shandon, Frankfurt, Germany). For laser capture microdissection, 7-μm cryostat sections were mounted on glass slides covered with polyethylene film (P.A.L.M., Bernried, Germany) and stored at -80 °C until use. After thawing, tissue sections were fixed in 100% ethanol for 2 min, air-dried, stained with toluidine blue (0.5%) for 10 s and dehydrated with sequential immersion in 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol, for 1 min each. After air-drying, the ganglion cell layer (GCL), IPL, INL, and outer nuclear/plexiform layer (ONL/OPL) were laser-microdissected using the UVCut system (SL-Microtest, Jena, Germany). RNA isolation was performed using the PureScript Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) with slight modifications to the manufacturer's recommendations for the 0.2–5 mg animal tissue protocol (www.gentra.com). Samples were picked with sterile injection needles (27-gauge × 3/4′, Braun-Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany) after laser microdissection and transferred into 0.5-ml reaction tubes containing 100 μl of cell lysis solution of the PureScript Kit and 1 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubated for 20 min at 42 °C. Following the addition of DNA precipitation solution (33 μl), samples were incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected and 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol plus 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml) was added. After incubation at -20 °C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was washed with 100 μl of 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 15 μl of DEPC-treated water. RT-PCR was performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reactions were set up in a 20-μl volume, using Q-solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. For detection of zfCx52.6, the zfCx52.6–1 and zfCx52.6–2 primers described above (see RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis) were used, whereas those for the control reaction were the actin-1 and actin-2 primers. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out for 30 min at 50 °C. Then followed a denaturation step of 15 min at 95 °C, and 50 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min. Aliquots (15 μl) from each amplification reaction were separated on 2.5% agarose gels and images of ethidium bromide-stained gels were recorded using Imagemaster (AP-Biotech). Electrical Recordings from Neuro2A Cells—The full-length zfCx52.6 cDNA (nt 1–1401) including the stop codon was cloned into the plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) by TA-cloning. The Neuro2A cell line (46.Olmsted J.B. Carlson K. Klebe R. Ruddle F. Rosenbaum J.R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was cultured and transiently transfected as described in detail previously (47.Hopperstad M.G. Srinivas M. Spray D.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1954-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were dissociated at 8–12 h after transfection and plated at low density on 1-cm round glass coverslips. Junctional conductance was measured between cell pairs by using the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique with Axopatch 1D patch-clamp amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at room temperature. The solution bathing the cells contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 5 mm dextrose, 2 mm pyruvate, and 1 mm BaCl2, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes had resistances of 3–5 MΩ when filled with internal solution containing 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgATP, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Single-channel recordings were filtered at 0.2–0.5 kHz and sampled at 1–2 kHz. Data were acquired by PCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments); analysis was performed with PCLAMP8 and ORIGIN 6.0 software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Each cell of a pair was initially held at a common holding potential of 0 mV. Single-channel currents were investigated in weakly coupled cell pairs (1 or 2 channels) without the use of uncoupling agents by applying 8–16 s voltage pulses between +100 and -100 mV to one cell of a pair to establish a transjunctional voltage gradient (Vj) while the junctional current was measured in the second cell (held at 0 mV). Gating events were recognized as simultaneously occurring events of equal amplitude and opposite polarity in current traces for both cells in the pair. All point amplitude histograms of data were constructed at each voltage and fit to Gaussian functions to determine the mean and variance of the baseline and open channel current. Unitary conductances were measured by fitting a linear function to the single-channel current-voltage relation. In Vitro Transcription and Translation of zfCx52.6 —The entire coding sequence of zfCx52.6 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers corresponding to nucleotides 1–19 (sense: 5′-GGGT-CCAGGAATTCATGGGAGATTGGAACTTGC-3′) and 1401–1382 (antisense: 5′-GC-CCCGGCTCGAGTCAGAATTTTCTTACCATT-3′), containing EcoRI (sense) and XhoI (antisense) linkers. PCR products were purified using Qiaquick columns (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI/XhoI (Roche Applied Science), purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pCS2+ expression vector. The construct was sequenced using the Dye terminator (Applied Bioystems), as recommended by the manufacturer, to verify that PCR amplification did not introduce unwanted mutations. Recombinant plasmid was linearized with NotI (Roche Applied Science), gel purified, and used as template (1–2 μg of DNA) to produce capped RNA using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The purity and yield of transcribed cRNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm. Aliquots (200 ng) of in vitro synthesized connexin RNA were translated (1 h at 30 °C) in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA; 30 μCi/tube) and reactions were quenched by dilution in gel sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 17% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Radioactive products (1/10 of the reaction volume) were separated by electrophoresis on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, fixed in 10% acetic acid/20% methanol for 30 min, soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate for 30 min at room temperature, dried, and visualized by fluorography (Hyperfilm, AP-Biotech). Preparation, Microinjection, and Pairing of Oocytes—Female Xenopus laevis were purchased from the colony of the Institut für Entwicklungsbiologie (Hamburg, Germany). Following anesthesia with benzocaine, ovarian lobes were surgically removed and placed in Modified Barth's medium (MB: 110 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 3 mm NaHCO3, 19 mm HEPES, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mm CaNO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6) at 18 °C overnight. Oocytes were isolated and defolliculated by enzymatic digestion and cultured in Modified Barth's medium at 18 °C, essentially as previously described (48.Swenson K.I. Jordan J.R. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Cell. 1989; 57: 145-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 49.Mitropoulou G. Bruzzone R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 15: 147-157Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For physiological analysis, cells were injected with a total volume of 40 μl of either an antisense oligonucleotide (2.5 ng/cell) to suppress the endogenous Xenopus Cx38 (XenCx38), or a mixture of antisense (as above) plus zfCx52.6 RNA (10–40 ng/cell), using a Picospritzer II (General Valve Corporation, Fairfield, NJ). Following an overnight incubation at 18 °C, microinjected oocytes were immersed for a few minutes in hypertonic solution to strip the vitelline envelope (50.Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pflügers Arch. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), transferred to Petri dishes containing MB medium and manually paired with the vegetal poles apposed. Electrical Recordings from Oocytes—All experiments were carried out at 18 °C. The functional properties of cell-to-cell channels were assessed by a dual voltage clamp procedure that enables direct quantification of junctional conductance (51.Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 75-94Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Current and voltage electrodes (1.2 mm in diameter, Omega dot; Glass Company of America, Millville, NJ) were pulled to a resistance of 1–2 MΩ with a horizontal puller (PB-7, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and filled with a solution containing: 3 m KCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Voltage clamping of oocyte pairs was performed using two GeneClamp 500 amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) controlled by a PC-compatible computer through a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments) was used to program stimulus and data collection paradigms. Current outputs were filtered at 50 Hz and the sampling interval was 10 ms. For simple measurements of junctional conductance, both cells of a pair were initially clamped at -40 mV to ensure zero transjunctional potential and alternating pulses of ± 10–20 mV were imposed to one cell. Current delivered to the cell clamped at -40 mV during the voltage pulse was equal in magnitude to the junctional current, and was divided by the voltage to yield the conductance. To determine the voltage-gating properties of zfCx52.6, transjunctional potentials (Vj) of opposite polarity were generated by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing one cell in 20 mV steps (over a range of ±100 mV), while clamping the second cell at -40 mV. Currents were measured 10 s after the onset of the voltage pulse. At that time they approached steady state (Ijss), and the macroscopic conductance (Gjss) was calculated by dividing Ijss by Vj. Gjss was then normalized to the values determined at ±20 mV, and plotted against Vj. Data describing the relationship of Gjss as a function of Vj were analyzed using Microcal Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, NA) and fit to a Boltzmann relation of the form: Gjss = {(Gjmax - Gjmin)/(1 + exp[A(Vj - V0)]} + Gjmin, where Gjss is the steady-state junctional conductance, Gjmax (normalized to unity) is the maximum conductance, Gjmin is the residual conductance at large values of Vj, and V0 is the transjunctional voltage at which Gjss = (Gjmax - Gjmin)/2. The constant A (= nq/kT) represents the voltage sensitivity in terms of gating charge as the equivalent number (n) of electron charges (q) moving through the membrane, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The junctional conductance of oocyte pairs selected for analysis of voltage sensitivity never exceeded 6 μS, thereby ensuring adequate control of transjunctional potential and avoiding the risk of overestimating the actual Gj at steady state (52.Wilders R. Jongsma H.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 942-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To characterize the hemichannel activity of non-junctional connexons, recordings were obtained from single oocytes with a two-electrode voltage-clamp procedure. Cells were clamped at -40 mV, and whole cell currents were recorded in response to depolarizing vo"

Both the D2s and D2l receptors have been shown to couple to members of the Gαi family of G proteins, but whether each isoform couples to specific Gαi protein(s) remains controversial. In previous studies using Gαi mutants resistant to modification by pertussis toxin (GαiPT), we demonstrated that the D2s receptor couples selectively to Gαi2PT and that the D2l receptor couples selectively to Gαi3PT (Senogles, S. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23120–23127). In this study, two point mutations of the D2s receptor were created by random mutagenesis (R233G and A234T). The two mutant D2s receptors demonstrated pharmacological characteristics comparable with those of the wild-type D2s receptor, with similar agonist and antagonist binding affinities. We used human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with Gαi1PT, Gαi2PT, or Gαi3PT to measure agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation before and after pertussis toxin treatment. The two mutant D2s receptors demonstrated a change in Gi coupling specificity compared with the wild-type D2s receptor. Whereas the wild-type D2s receptor coupled predominantly to Gαi2PT, mutant R233G coupled preferentially to Gαi3PT, and mutant A234T coupled preferentially to Gαi1PT. These results suggest that this region of the third cytoplasmic loop is crucial for determining Gi protein coupling specificity.

Dopamine acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and as a hormone in the periphery, such as its action at the lactotroph cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary, where it mediates the release of prolactin (for review, see Ref. 1.Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). The D2 dopamine receptor family consists of two isoforms, the short form (D2s receptor) 1The abbreviations used are: D2s receptor, D2 dopamine receptor short form; D2l receptor, D2 dopamine receptor long form; GαiPT, pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi mutant; NPA, N-propylnorapomorphine; PTX, pertussis toxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: D2s receptor, D2 dopamine receptor short form; D2l receptor, D2 dopamine receptor long form; GαiPT, pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi mutant; NPA, N-propylnorapomorphine; PTX, pertussis toxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

These isoforms differ only by the presence of an additional 29 amino acids encoded by exon 5 (4.Dal Toso R. Sommer B. Ewert M. Herb A. Pritchett D.B. Bach A. Shivers B.D. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1998; 13: 4025-4034Google Scholar) in the third cytoplasmic loop of the D2l receptor. The D2 dopamine receptor has been shown to couple to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary (5.McDonald W.M. Sibley D.R. Kilpatrick B.F. Caron M.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 36: 201-209Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the striatum (6.Giannatasio G. DeFerraei M.E. Spada A. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 1605-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, agonist activation of the D2 dopamine receptor activates K+ channel activity in isolated lactotrophs and transfected GH4 cells (7.Einhorn L.C. Gregerson K.A. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3727-3737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other investigators have shown that dopamine can also inhibit two distinct voltage-gated calcium currents in isolated lactotrophs (8.Lledo P.M. Homburger V. Bockaert J. Vincent J.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 455-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The expression of the two D2 dopamine receptor isoforms is coincident in all tissues examined to date, although the ratios differ between tissues (9.Mansour A. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. Akil H. Watson S.J. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Weiner D.M. Brann M.R.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Localization studies of the two isoforms have demonstrated that the D2l receptor is strongly expressed in the neurons of the striatum and nucleus accumbens and that the D2s receptor is found in the cell bodies and axons of the mesencephalon and hypothalamus (12.Khan Z. Mrzliak L. Gutierrez A. De La Calle A. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7731-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the D2s receptor is the presynaptic autoreceptor and that the D2l receptor is predominantly found postsynaptically. Evidence from analysis of genetically engineered mice has confirmed this hypothesis. The evaluation of mice deficient in the D2l receptor has suggested discrete functional roles for the D2s and D2l receptors (13.Wang Y. Xu R. Sasaoka T. Tonegawa S. Kung M.P. Sankoorikai E.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8305-8314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Usiello A. Baik J.H. Rouge-Pont F. Picetti R. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Piazza P.V. Borelli E. Nature. 2000; 408: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Overall, it is apparent that the D2 isoforms have unique localization and serve distinct functions. The G protein coupling specificity of the D2s and D2l receptors remains controversial. A variety of experimental approaches, including the expression of pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi mutants (GαiPT) (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 161-170PubMed Google Scholar), and evaluation of high affinity agonist coupling and stimulation of GTPγS binding in Gαi/o knockout mice (21.Jiang M. Spicher K. Boulay G. Wang Y. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3577-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), have yielded disparate results. Some investigations have suggested that the insert region of the D2l receptor may be important for coupling to G proteins, as mutations in this region can impact modestly on signaling (20.Montmayeur J.P. Guiramand J. Borelli E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 161-170PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific amino acids in the third intracellular loop of the D2s and D2l receptors responsible for dictating the specificity of G protein coupling have not been identified. We demonstrate in this work that the Gi protein coupling specificity of the D2s receptor is altered by random point mutants in the third cytoplasmic loop. We have examined the Gαi coupling of two point mutations of the D2s receptor to identify specific amino acids that influence the receptor/G protein coupling specificity. These results suggest that a key region of receptor interaction with G proteins exists in the third cytoplasmic loop and may play a crucial role in determining the specificity of receptor/G protein interaction. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum (certified), and G418 sulfate were obtained from Invitrogen. [125I]Iodosulpiride, [3H]adenine, and [14C]cAMP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All of the ligands, including N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5.0% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin and grown in a 5% CO2 environment at a constant temperature of 37 °C. PCR Amplification in the Presence of Mn2+—The rat D2s receptor (2.Bunzow J.R. Van Tol H.M. Grandy D.K. Albert P. Salon J. Christie M. Machida C.A. Neve K.A. Civelli O. Nature. 1988; 336: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pSelect-1 vector (Promega) using BamHI-PstI sites. This construct was used as the template for the PCR amplification. The PCR amplifications were designed to generate random mutations in the region of the D2s receptor from the beginning of the fifth transmembrane domain through to the C terminus using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GTCACTCTGCTGGTCTATATC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CGTCTTAAGGGAGGT-3′; and primer 3, 5′-TGCATAGGCAGGGAGGT-3′. To amplify only the third cytoplasmic loop, primers 1 and 2 were used. To amplify the third loop onward to the C-terminal tail of the D2s receptor, primers 1 and 3 were used. PCR was performed under the following reaction conditions: 10 ng of purified plasmid (Wizard preps system, Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 250 μm MnCl2. Amplification was performed with 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) under the following cycling conditions: denaturing for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 2 min at 55 °C, and extension for 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR amplification products were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNA sequencing to identify mutations. Cloning of Mutant D2s Receptors—The D2s receptor was cloned into the BamHI-PstI sites of pCR3 (Invitrogen). Interesting point mutants generated by PCR amplification were then cloned into the pCR3-D2s receptor plasmid using appropriate unique restriction sites (MroI, BbsI, and SacI) within the coding region of the receptor. The insert and vectors were ligated and transformed into JM109 bacteria, and the plasmid was isolated using the Wizard minipreps system. The assembly of the plasmid encoding a correct full-length receptor with a point mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Cell Lines Expressing GαiPT Mutants—The full-length cDNAs encoding Gαi1PT, Gαi2PT, and Gαi3PT (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned into pREP8 (Invitrogen). The constructs were used to transfect HEK 293-c18 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL10852) stably expressing the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 gene, which allows for episomal replication of vectors containing the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication. The HEK 293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as described by Cullen (22.Cullen R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar); and after 48 h, the cells were put under selection by inclusion of 400 μg/ml hygromycin in the medium. Clonal lines expressing the specific GαiPT mutants were generated by passaging and expanding the colonies present after 2 weeks of hygromycin selection. Transient Expression of Mutant Receptors in GαiPT-expressing Cells—The cell lines expressing each of the GαiPT mutants were transfected using 20 μg of mutant D2s receptor DNA and Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. At the same time, a parallel transfection was performed using the p-sPort vector (Invitrogen) encoding β-galactosidase to monitor transfection efficiency. Cells were used 48–72 h after transfection. Agonist and Antagonist Binding as Assessed by [125I]Iodosulpiride— Transiently transfected cells were plated and grown to confluence in 75-cm2 dishes. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. Binding was performed by incubating 20 μg of protein with 100 pm [125I]iodosulpiride and concentrations of displacing ligand ranging from 10–10 to 10–5m in a total volume of 250 μl. Incubation was carried out for 1 h at ambient temperature with agitation. Nonspecific binding was defined by the inclusion of 1 μm (+)-butaclamol in parallel incubations. [125I]Iodosulpiride bound to membranes was obtained by filtration through Whatman GF/C membranes and quantified by γ-counting. Displacement curves were modeled with GraphPAD Prism software using nonlinear regression analysis. cAMP Accumulation Assay—Cells were routinely plated at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well cluster plates. On the day prior to assay, the cells were labeled with 1 μCi/well [3H]adenine (20–40 Ci/mmol). The next day, the medium was aspirated and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Agonists and forskolin were added simultaneously after the 15-min incubation, and the assay was allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 100 μm cAMP and a known quantity of [14C]cAMP was added to each well. The cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. [3H]cAMP in the supernatants was purified by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG 1-X4 and neutral alumina following the method of Salomon et al. (23.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The recovery of [3H]cAMP was estimated by following the recovery of the [14C]cAMP tracer. The dose-response curves of NPA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were fit using Prism software. The EC50 values and percent maximal inhibition were obtained for each experiment. Pertussis Toxin Treatment—HEK 293 cells were seeded at the usual density in 24-well cluster dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum. PTX treatment was performed overnight for a minimum of 12 h at 37 °C using a concentration of PTX (20 ng/ml) shown previously to fully ADP-ribosylate the Gi family of G proteins in HEK 293 cells (24.Senogles S.E. Ariano M.A. Surmeier D.J. Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Neostriatal Function. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 103-110Google Scholar). Western Blotting—The cells were washed with PBS, scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The crude pellet was resuspended in sample buffer containing 5% SDS (a modification of Ref. 25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were transferred for 1 h at 100 V onto nitrocellulose using buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 20% methanol (by volume). The blots were blocked by a 1-h incubation at ambient temperature with PBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. The next morning, the blots were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 for 15 min, followed by extensive washing with PBS. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature, followed by extensive washing with PBS. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents and Hyperfilm ECL film (both from Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Binding data (both saturation and competition curves) were modeled using GraphPAD Prism. Protein Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Generation of Point Mutations in the D2s Receptor—Point mutations were generated in the coding region of the D2s receptor by PCR amplification in the presence of Mn2+, followed by DNA sequencing and assembly of the D2s receptor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig. 1, the positions of D2s receptor mutants A234T and R233G are shown in relation to the position of the 29-amino acid insert of the D2l receptor, which begins after amino acid 241 of the D2s receptor. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the third intracellular loop of both the D2s and D2l receptors are shown for comparison. Pharmacology of D2s Receptor Mutants R233G and A234T— After transient expression in HEK 293 cells, both mutant D2s receptors and the wild-type D2s receptor were evaluated for ligand binding (Table I). The transfected wild-type D2s receptor displayed both a high (6.5 nm) and a low (4.2 μm) affinity site for the agonist NPA as assessed by displacement of bound [125I]iodosulpiride (n = 4). The values of the high and low affinity sites of NPA binding calculated for the two point mutants are comparable with the values obtained for the wild-type D2s receptor. In addition, the Kd values for the D2 dopamine receptor antagonists (+)-butaclamol, spiperone, and eticlopride were comparable between the wild-type D2s receptor and mutants A234T and R233G (data not shown).Table ICharacterization of agonist binding of the wild-type D2s receptor and mutants R233G and A234TReceptorKdHLnmnmμmWild-type D2s receptor47 ± 36.5 ± 0.74.2 ± 0.2Mutant R233G43 ± 26.1 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.1Mutant A234T54 ± 56.8 ± 0.44.9 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Coupling of the D2s Receptor in HEK 293 Cells—To demonstrate that functional D2s receptor was expressed in transfected HEK 293 cells, transfected cells were evaluated for agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2). The HEK 293 cells transfected with the D2s receptor showed a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in response to NPA (open circles), whereas there was no response to NPA in the non-transfected control HEK 293 cells (open triangles). The EC50 value of NPA inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in this assay was 0.3 nm (n = 34). To demonstrate that the D2s receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation was completely dependent on the presence of the Gi family of G proteins, cells were treated overnight with 20 ng/ml PTX (closed circles). PTX treatment completely blocked the agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. These results indicate that the D2s receptor modulates cAMP accumulation completely through interaction with G proteins of the Gi family, as moderate concentrations of PTX completely ablated the response (Fig. 2). Coupling of Mutant D2s Receptors in HEK 293 Cells—The two point mutants of the D2s receptor (A234T and R233G) were transfected into HEK 293 for evaluation of NPA-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was indistinguishable between the wild-type D2s receptor and either of the mutant D2s receptors. As shown in Table II, both mutants showed agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, with maximal inhibition ranging from 44 to 51%. In comparison, the wild-type D2s receptor inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 47%. The EC50 values for NPA-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation were comparable between the wild-type and mutant D2s receptors. Thus, the ability of both mutant D2s receptors to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type D2s receptor.Table IICharacterization of NPA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with the wild-type D2s receptor and mutants R233G and A234TReceptorEC50Maximal inhibitionnmm%Wild-type D2s receptor0.3 ± 0.147 ± 534Mutant R233G0.4 ± 0.244 ± 318Mutant A234T0.4 ± 0.351 ± 717 Open table in a new tab Expression of GαiPT in HEK 293 Cells—Cell lines stably expressing GαiPT mutants were generated from HEK 293-c18 cells by transfection with pREP8 vectors carrying the coding region for Gαi1PT, Gαi2PT, or Gαi3PT. To demonstrate that the GαiPT proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells, Western blot analysis was performed. Shown in Fig. 3 are the results from Western blot analysis of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of samples from HEK 293-c18 cells (control) before and after treatment with PTX and from one Gαi2PT-expressing cell line after PTX treatment. The blot shown in Fig. 3 was visualized with both anti-Gαi2 subtype antibody and anti-Gβ antibody to allow for direct comparison. PTX modification of Gi proteins has been reported to result in a slower migrating protein species upon SDS-PAGE analysis (Van Dop, C., Yamanaka, G., Steinberg, F., Sekura, R. D., Manclark, C. R., Stryer, L., and Bourne, M. R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 23–26). In control cells, the Gα subunit migrated with a reduced mobility after PTX modification (compare Control and Control + PTX). In contrast, the Gαi2PT-expressing cell line showed a doublet corresponding to endogenous Gαi2 that was modified by PTX and the unmodified Gαi2PT protein. We obtained similar results for Gαi1PT- and Gαi3PT-expressing cell lines visualized with anti-Gαi subtype antisera (data not shown). Evaluation of Coupling of the D2s Receptor in Cell Lines Stably Expressing GαiPT—We have previously shown that the D2s receptor will preferentially couple to Gαi2PT-expressing cells stably transfected into GH4C1 cells (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used HEK 293 cells stably transfected with each of the GαiPT mutants to demonstrate the G protein coupling of the D2s receptor. The data shown in Fig. 4 (A–C, open symbols) demonstrate that the D2s receptor inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in all three cell lines in the absence of PTX. Under these experimental conditions, the transfected D2s receptor could couple to both the stably expressed GαiPT mutants and endogenous Gi. However, after overnight treatment with PTX to inactivate endogenous Gi proteins, Gαi1PT and Gαi3PT did not couple significantly to the D2s receptor, as evidenced by the lack of NPA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4, A and C, closed symbols). In contrast, Gαi2PT was able to couple efficiently to the D2s receptor in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 4B, closed symbols), with EC50 = 1 nm (n = 13). These results suggest that the D2s receptor signals preferentially through Gαi2 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells. Evaluation of Coupling of the Mutant D2s Receptors in Cell Lines Stably Expressing GαiPT—The D2s receptor mutants (R233G and A234T) were evaluated for Gi coupling in the three cell lines stably expressing a discrete GαiPT mutant. Fig. 5 shows the results from experiments in which mutant R233G was transfected into the GαiPT mutant-expressing cell lines. The assay for NPA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was performed under control conditions (Fig. 5, A–C, open symbols) and overnight PTX treatment conditions (closed symbols). Mutant R233G displayed NPA-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in all three cell lines in the absence of PTX. After treatment with PTX, mutant R233G was capable of significantly inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation only in the Gαi3PT-expressing cell line, with maximal inhibition comparable with that of the wild-type D2s receptor. Mutant R233G inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, with EC50 = 24 nm (n = 9). Mutant R233G was ineffective in modulating agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the Gαi1PT-expressing (Fig. 5A) and Gαi2PT-expressing (Fig. 5B) cell lines after overnight exposure to PTX (n = 6). In contrast, mutant A234T displayed a different pattern of coupling to G proteins. In the absence of PTX treatment, the D2s mutant A234T signaled to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in all three GαiPT-expressing cell lines (Fig. 6, A–C, open symbols). Mutant A234T was ineffective in coupling to Gαi2PT and Gαi3PT under conditions of PTX treatment (Fig. 6, B and C, closed symbols). However, mutant A234T coupled to Gαi1PT with an efficiency comparable with that of the D2s receptor control (Fig. 6A, closed symbols). These combined results demonstrate that the D2s receptor point mutations R233G and A234T are capable of coupling to discrete Gi proteins to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Most notably, these mutants demonstrate an altered G protein specificity compared with each other and with the wild-type D2s receptor. The data suggest that the region of the D2s receptor containing these point mutations appears to be crucial for dictating G protein specificity. Attempts to identify the particular G protein involved in the D2s receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase has yielded disparate results from a number of different laboratories. Work from our laboratory demonstrated that the G protein coupling specificity of the D2s and D2l receptors is distinct (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using GαiPT mutants, the D2s receptor coupled with high affinity to Gαi2, and the D2l receptor coupled with high affinity to Gαi3 as determined by assessment of NPA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Neither receptor could couple significantly to Gαi1 using this same assay. Using a similar approach, other investigators have also demonstrated G protein specificity for the D2 dopamine receptor isoforms. O'Hara et al. (16.O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R.D. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar) used CCL1.3 mouse Ltk– fibroblasts and MN9D mesencephalic cells to demonstrate that the D2l receptor couples to both Gαi2 and Gαi3, but not Gαi1. In agreement with our previous study (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ghahremani et al. (17.Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M.C. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), using Ltk– cells, showed that the D2s receptor couples to Gαi2 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase and extended the initial observations to show that the D2s receptor couples to Gαi3 to inhibit prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. In addition, Watts et al. (18.Watts V.J. Wiens B.L. Cumbay M.G. Vu M.N. Neve R.L. Neve K.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 8692-8699Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrated that the D2l receptor couples selectively to PTX-insensitive Gαo mutants in a neuroblastoma cell line (NS20Y). The different results obtained for D2 dopamine receptor/G protein specificity may be due to differences in the cell line used for investigation. One confounding factor of the GαiPT mutant approach is the cellular response to expression of the GαiPT mutant. We observed that Gβ subunit expression was increased upon expression of GαiPT subunits. 2S. E. Senogles, unpublished data. It is possible that GαiPT expression may result in the formation of different GαiPTβγ heterotrimers depending on the cell line being used for transfection. This phenomenon may underlie some of the disparity found in the literature. Other experimental approaches have also been used to elucidate the receptor/G protein coupling specificity of the D2s and D2l receptors. Using a baculovirus expression system, Grunewald et al. (27.Grunewald S. Reilander H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15162-15173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the D2s receptor prefers Gαi1 over Gαi2. Liu et al. (19.Liu Y.F. Jakobs K.H. Raesnick M.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13880-13886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used an antisense ablation approach to target G proteins and found that partial ablation of Gαi2 affects D2l (but not D2s) receptor signaling. Montmayeur et al. (20.Montmayeur J.P. Guiramand J. Borelli E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 161-170PubMed Google Scholar) observed that transfection of Gαi2 promotes more potent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the D2l receptor in JEG3 cells, a line that has been reported to lack Gαi2 protein. Assessment of D2 dopamine receptor coupling in Goα knockout mice demonstrated that the absence of Gαo abolishes D2 dopamine receptor-stimulated GTPγS binding as well as high affinity agonist binding (21.Jiang M. Spicher K. Boulay G. Wang Y. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3577-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Deletion and chimera analysis has revealed that N- and C-terminal regions of the third intracellular loop appear to be crucial for G protein interaction of many different G protein-coupled receptors (28.Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. Cheung A.H. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16439-16443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2882-2885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the middle of the third loop is critical for the coupling specificity, and we have identified a region that is exquisitely sensitive to modification. We have shown in this study that two point mutants of the D2s receptor (R233G and A234T) have altered G protein specificity as assessed in the GαiPT-specific background. When transfected into HEK 293 cells, the mutants had agonist and antagonist binding properties and signaling properties comparable with those of the wild-type D2s receptor. Only when these point mutants were transfected into a “Gi-specific” background was the change in specificity of coupling to the receptor revealed. The expression of GαiPT mutants has been used by a number of investigators and is a powerful tool for sorting out Gi protein coupling specificity (15.Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R.D. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

We have demonstrated here that GαiPT mutants have an extremely subtle effect on D2s receptor/G protein coupling specificity. The data presented here show that we have uncovered a region of the third loop that is a determinant of G protein specificity. This region of the third loop has a high degree of α-helical character, as analyzed by several secondary structure prediction algorithms such as Predator (32.Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and contains a putative hydrophobic and a hydrophilic face (data not shown). The D2s receptor mutant R233G results in replacement of a charged amino acid with a glycine, and the D2s receptor mutant A234T results in replacement of a hydrophobic amino acid with a polar amino acid. Each of these point mutations may impact on the helical character of this region of the receptor and disrupt the receptor/G protein interface. The helical character of the third cytoplasmic loop may be a defining factor in receptor interaction with Gi proteins. This region is also extremely close to the insert region of the D2 dopamine receptor, which generates the D2l receptor isoform, and may be important for signaling specificity for both isoforms of the D2 dopamine receptor. Future investigations will address these questions. We thank Dr. Mary Dahmer, Ryan Kendall, and Ben Everett for help with manuscript preparation."

Microtubule depolymerization is rapid and results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. However, the functional consequence of NF-κB activation has remained unclear. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that NF-κB transcriptional activity is required to suppress apoptosis. In the present study, we confirm and extend previous findings that microtubule depolymerization leads to the rapid activation of NF-κB and test the hypothesis that the induction of NF-κB regulates cell survival during mitotic cell cycle arrest in order to define its role. Using a range of functional assays, we have shown that microtubule depolymerization correlates with the activation of IKKα and IKKβ; the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα; the translocation of native p65 (RelA) into the nucleus; and increased NF-κB transcriptional activity. By inhibiting either the activation of the IKKs or the degradation of IκBα, we find that the level of apoptosis is significantly increased in the mitotically arrested cells. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling in the nonmitotic cells did not affect their survival. We establish that although NF-κB is activated rapidly in response to microtubule depolymerization, its cell survival function is not required until mitotic cell cycle arrest, when the mitotic checkpoint is activated and apoptosis is triggered. We conclude that NF-κB may regulate the transcription of one or more antiapoptotic proteins that may regulate cell survival during mitotic cell cycle arrest.

We conclude that NF-κB may regulate the transcription of one or more antiapoptotic proteins that may regulate cell survival during mitotic cell cycle arrest. By perturbing microtubule dynamics, certain anticancer drugs cause mammalian cells to arrest in mitosis through activation of the spindle checkpoint (or mitotic checkpoint) (1.Sorger P.K. Dobles M. Tournebize R. Hyman A.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Generally, mitotic arrest is then followed by apoptosis (2.Woods C.M. Zhu J. McQueney P.A. Bollag D. Lazarides E. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 506-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Jordan M.A. Wendell K. Gardiner S. Derry W.B. Copp H. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms by which the anticancer drugs induce toxicity are not clearly understood. We have recently demonstrated that anticancer drugs such as nocodazole, vincristine, and vinblastine (microtubule-depolymerizing agents) and taxol (a microtubule-stabilizing agent) activate intracellular signaling pathways that have opposing effects on cell survival (4.Deacon K. Mistry P. Chernoff J. Blank J.L. Patel R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2071-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another signal transduction pathway that is activated by these anticancer drugs involves the transcription factor NF-κB (5.Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6.Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol.

However, the functional consequence of NF-κB activation by either microtubule-depolymerizing or -stabilizing drugs remains unknown.NF-κB belongs to the Rel family of transcription factors that regulate genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (8.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 9.Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In mammals, the Rel family comprises p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel. The NF-κB subunits homo- and heterodimerize to form transcription factor complexes with a range of DNA binding and activation potentials. In unstimulated cells NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex through association with one of several inhibitory molecules including IκBα, IκBβ, p105/IκBγ, IκBϵ, and p100. NF-κB can be activated by a range of stimuli including inflammatory cytokines, phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, viruses, UV light, and a variety of mitogens (10.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar).

Recent studies suggest that NF-κB can also inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis by inhibiting activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase via a poorly defined mechanism involving increased expression of either GADDβ or XIAP (31.De Smaele E.

In this report, we show that NF-κB is activated in HeLa cells in response to both microtubule-depolymerizing and microtubule-stabilizing anticancer agents. We also show that inhibition of NF-κB using three independent approaches selectively increases the susceptibility of mitotically arrested cells to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that NF-κB activation is linked to cell survival through the activation of NF-κB-responsive antiapoptotic genes and may represent an important survival mechanism during mitotic cell cycle arrest.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) were cultured as described previously (33.Patel R.

To obtain mitotically arrested cells, an asynchronous population of HeLa cells was treated with either nocodazole (3 μm), taxol (1 μm), vincristine (1 μm), or vinblastine (1 μm) for various times (0-30 h). Mitotic cells were collected by mechanical shake-off, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the appropriate buffer depending on the protein kinase being assayed as described previously (33.Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Schulman H. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7958-7968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was used to prepare cell lysates for immunoblotting with the IκBα antibodies. Cells remaining attached to the plates after shake-off were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (containing either nocodazole (3 μm), taxol (1 μm), vincristine (1 μm), or vinblastine (1 μm)) and lysed by scraping into the appropriate buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content of the supernatant was determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Perbio Science UK Ltd., Cheshire, UK) before normalization and solubilization in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Antibodies—IKKα, IKKβ, IκBα, anti-hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA), and phosphospecific histone H3 that was used as a marker for mitotic cells (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).

Bartosch B. Blank J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2247-2255PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins and the cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane using a Hoeffer semidry blotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Protein Kinase Assays—Immunecomplex kinase assays for the IKKs were performed as described previously (35.Patel R. Bartosch B. Blank J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2247-2255PubMed Google Scholar) using glutathione S-transferase-IκBα as substrate.Transfection of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were plated at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate or at 1 × 105 cells/well for coverslips in an 8-well plate. 18-24 h later, the cells were transfected with 1-4 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Sciences). At 18-24 h after transfection, the cells on the coverslips were fixed in cold (-20 °C) methanol, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. The cells in the 6-well plates were either washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the appropriate buffer to make cell extracts or collected (floating and attached cells) for the determination of apoptosis as described above.Reporter Assays—For transient transfection of reporter plasmids, cells were plated in 12-well plates, and the following day, cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing three NF-κB binding sites (Stratagene) in combination with the internal control cytomegalovirus Renilla luciferase plasmid (provided by Anne Willis, University of Leicester). Luciferase activities of reporter plasmids were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega UK, Southampton, UK).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted as described previously (4.Deacon K.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2071-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The amino acid sequence of both the wild type and the mutant (W739A/W714A) NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide fused to the Antennapedia homeodomain was as described (36.May M.J.

Crude synthetic NBD peptides (wild type and mutant) were synthesized by Pepceuticals Ltd. (Leicester, UK). They were further purified using reverse-phase HPLC chromatography (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd., Stockport, Cheshire, UK) and concentrated by freeze-drying. The quality of the purified peptides was assessed using an analytical HPLC column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Micromass Platform-II instrument (Waters Ltd., Manchester, UK).Densitometry—Autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using a β-Imaging Computing Densitometer (Amersham Biosciences) with MD ImageQuant software (version 3.3).Reagents—Nocodazole, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, MG-132 (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal), and ALLN (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) were all obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma.RESULTSNF-κB Activation in Response to Anti-microtubule Drugs Is Mediated by the IKK and IκB Signaling Pathway—To investigate whether microtubule depolymerization activates NF-κB signaling, we treated exponentially growing HeLa cells with nocodazole, a reversible microtubule-depolymerizing compound (1.Sorger P.K. Dobles M. Tournebize R. Hyman A.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were assayed for the activation of both IKKα and IKKβ using immune complex kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, nocodazole treatment rapidly activated (within 15 min) both IKKα (1.8-fold activation above the basal level) and IKKβ (2.1-fold above the basal level). Both IKKα and IKKβ were increasingly activated for up to 6 h after nocodazole addition. From 12 h onward, we were able to separate the nocodazole-treated cells into a mitotic population (as assessed by increased phosphorylation of histone H3) (37.Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and an attached, nonmitotic population (as assessed by low phosphorylation of histone H3). As shown in Fig. 1A, both IKKα and IKKβ were highly activated in the mitotically arrested cells (∼10-14-fold above basal levels, respectively) in comparison with the attached cell population (2.5-2.1-fold above basal levels, respectively). The activation of either IKKα or IKKβ could not be attributed to changes in their expression levels as indicated by immunoblots of the cytoplasmic extracts with the IKK-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). The activation of both IKKα and IKKβ by nocodazole correlated with microtubule depolymerization as determined by immunocytochemistry with an α-tubulin antibody (Fig. 1B). Although considerable microtubule depolymerization was observed within 15 min of nocodazole addition, a more homogeneous distribution of α-tubulin was observed between 1 and 6 h after nocodazole addition (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the activation of both IKKα and IKKβ was nocodazole-specific, we additionally treated exponentially growing HeLa cells with either vincristine or vinblastine (to depolymerize microtubules) or with taxol (to stabilize microtubules). All four treatments caused activation of both IKKα and IKKβ in the attached cells and to a greater extent in the mitotic population (Fig. 1C), indicating that both microtubule depolymerization and microtubule stabilization can cause activation of the IKKs.The activation of both IKKα and IKKβ by nocodazole also correlated with the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. As shown in Fig. 2A, nocodazole treatment increased the phosphorylation of IκBα on serine 32. The increase in the phosphorylation of IκBα above basal levels was observed between 15 and 30 min after nocodazole treatment. The phosphorylation of IκBα was sustained for up to 6 h and correlated with the degradation of IκBα. Our results also show that although the IKKs are highly active in the mitotically blocked cells (Fig. 1A), the phosphorylation of IκBα was reduced in this cell population (Fig. 2A). As observed with nocodazole, treatment of HeLa cells with either vincristine, vinblastine, or taxol also resulted in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Fig. 2B), although IκBα appeared to be degraded slightly less efficiently in the presence of taxol.Fig. 2Anti-microtubule drugs induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα A, exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole (3 μm), and cell extracts were prepared at the indicated times after nocodazole addition. After 12 h, the cells were separated into mitotic and attached populations as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cell extracts were immunoblotted (WB) with a phosphospecific IκBα antibody, an IκBα antibody, a γ-tubulin antibody, or a phosphospecific histone H3 antibody. B, exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with either nocodazole (3 μm), vincristine, vinblastine, or taxol (all 1 μm) for 12 h, and the cells were separated into mitotic and attached populations prior to immunoblotting with a phosphospecific IκBα antibody, an IκBα antibody, a γ-tubulin antibody, or a phosphospecific histone H3 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the degradation of IκBα by nocodazole resulted in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of native p65 (RelA) by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 3A, p65 was distributed uniformly throughout the cell prior to the addition of nocodazole but was found primarily in the nucleus following nocodazole treatment. We performed a time course analysis of the nuclear accumulation of p65 in the nonmitotic, attached cells following nocodazole treatment. Our results indicate that p65 translocated to the nucleus between 30 and 60 min after nocodazole treatment, with maximum nuclear localization occurring 6 h after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3B). Between 6 and 24 h after nocodazole treatment, the number of cells showing a nuclear localization of p65 declined, although this phenotype remained above basal levels. Control cells treated with Me2SO alone did not show any change in the distribution of the p65 protein during the time course examined. In mitotic cells (collected at 12-24 h after nocodazole treatment), p65 was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown).Fig. 3Nocodazole induces the translocation of p65 (RelA) into the nucleus. A, exponentially growing HeLa cells were either treated with nocodazole (3 μm) for 6 h or Me2SO-treated. The attached, nonmitotic cells were then fixed and immunostained with a specific antibody to detect the localization of native p65 (RelA) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Indirect immunofluorescence of p65 (left panels), DNA staining (middle panels), and the merged images (right panels) are shown. B, quantitation of the data shown in A at the indicated times following nocodazole treatment in the attached cell population. Control cells (Con) were treated with an equivalent volume of Me2SO. At least 100 cells were counted in randomly selected fields for each time point, and the bars represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the nuclear accumulation of p65 (RelA) resulted in an increase in NF-κB-dependent transcription, HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene that is regulated by three tandem repeats of an NF-κB enhancer element (3× pNF-κB-Luc). As shown in Fig. 4, nocodazole treatment stimulated a time-dependent increase in luciferase activity in both the attached and the mitotically arrested cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the perturbation of microtubule dynamics leads to the activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression through an IKK/IκBα-dependent signaling pathway.Fig. 4Nocodazole induces expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were co-transfected with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) and a Renilla luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) in duplicate. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with nocodazole (3 μm) for the indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared after separation of the attached and the mitotic populations at the indicated times, and the reporter activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The -fold increase in NF-κB luciferase activity was calculated relative to the expression of Renilla luciferase in Me2SO-treated control cells at each time point. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dominant Negative IKKα, IKKβ, and Nondegradable IκBα Suppress Nocodazole-induced Activation of NF-κB and Reduce the Survival of Nocodazole-blocked Mitotic Cells—To determine whether NF-κB was involved in regulating the survival of nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells, signaling-defective mutants of both IKKα (K44A) and IKKβ (K44A) were used. Transfection of HeLa cells with MEKK1, a known activator of NF-κB (16.Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a 5-fold stimulation of luciferase activity in an NF-κB reporter assay (Fig. 5A). The MEKK1-stimulated luciferase activity was comparable with that observed with either wild type (Fig. 5, wt) IKKα (5.1-fold in the attached cells; 4.3-fold in the mitotic cells) or wild type IKKβ (5.4-fold in the attached cells; 6.3-fold in the mitotic cells) after nocodazole treatment. However, in the presence of either IKKα (K44A) or IKKβ (K44A), both basal and nocodazole-stimulated luciferase activity was reduced when compared with their respective wild type controls (IKKα (K44A) percentage reduction as follows: asynchronous cells, 90%; attached cells, 76%; mitotic cells, 64%; IKKβ (K44A) percentage reduction as follows: asynchronous cells, 90%; attached cells, 95%; mitotic cells, 90%). The reduction of luciferase activity by either dominant negative IKKα or IKKβ could not be attributed to variations in the expression levels of the recombinant proteins as shown by immunoblots of cell extracts with IKK-specific antibodies (Fig. 5B). To determine the function of NF-κB signaling following nocodazole treatment, HeLa cells were transfected with either wild type IKKα or IKKβ or with either dominant negative IKKα or IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 5C, treatment of control, mock-transfected cells with nocodazole caused 27% of the mitotically arrested cells to undergo apoptosis, whereas the attached cells remained viable (2.8% apoptotic cells). Similarly, in cells expressing either wild type IKKα or IKKβ, nocodazole treatment caused ∼41 and 39.5% of the mitotically arrested cells to undergo apoptosis, respectively. However, in cells expressing either dominant negative IKKα or IKKβ, nocodazole treatment resulted in 71 and 74% of the mitotically arrested cells undergoing apoptosis. Neither the wild type nor the dominant negative IKKs greatly affected the survival of the nocodazole-treated attached cells.Fig. 5Dominant negative IKKs inhibit the nocodazole-induced activation of NF-κB and potentiate nocodazole-induced apoptosis in mitotically arrested cells. A, exponentially growing HeLa cells were transfected with either the wild type (wt) or dominant negative (K44A) IKKα or IKKβ or wild type MEKK1 (all 1 μg) together with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) and a Renilla luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) in duplicate. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with either nocodazole (3 μm) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO (Asy) fo"
https://openalex.org/W2085102359,"Bacterial double-stranded RNA-specific RNase III recognizes the A-form of an RNA helix with little sequence specificity. In contrast, baker yeast RNase III (Rnt1p) selectively recognizes NGNN tetraloops even when they are attached to a B-form DNA helix. To comprehend the general mechanism of RNase III substrate recognition, we mapped the Rnt1p binding signal and directly compared its substrate specificity to that of both Escherichia coli RNase III and fission yeast RNase III (PacI). Rnt1p bound but did not cleave long RNA duplexes without NGNN tetraloops, whereas RNase III indiscriminately cleaved all RNA duplexes. PacI cleaved RNA duplexes with some preferences for NGNN-capped RNA stems under physiological conditions. Hydroxyl radical footprints indicate that Rnt1p specifically interacts with the NGNN tetraloop and its surrounding nucleotides. In contrast, Rnt1p interaction with GAAA-capped hairpins was weak and largely unspecific. Certain duality of substrate recognition was exhibited by PacI but not by bacterial RNase III. E. coli RNase III recognized RNA duplexes longer than 11 bp with little specificity, and no specific features were required for cleavage. On the other hand, PacI cleaved long, but not short, RNA duplexes with little sequence specificity. PacI cleavage of RNA stems shorter than 27 bp was dependent on the presence of an UU-UC internal loop two nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site. These observations suggest that yeast RNase IIIs have two recognition mechanisms, one that uses specific structural features and another that recognizes general features of the A-form RNA helix.

These observations suggest that yeast RNase IIIs have two recognition mechanisms, one that uses specific structural features and another that recognizes general features of the A-form RNA helix. The RNase III family consists of a growing number of enzymes that includes at least 33 bacterial and 22 eukaryotic enzymes (1.Lamontagne B. Larose S. Boulanger J. Abou Elela S. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 3: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Nicholson A.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 371-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Conrad C. Rauhut R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The members of this family regulate gene expression by processing and degrading cellular RNAs (1.Lamontagne B. Larose S. Boulanger J. Abou Elela S. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 3: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Nicholson A.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 371-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Nicholson A.W. Prog.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Based on protein structure, the RNase III family has been divided into 4 sub-classes (1.Lamontagne B. Larose S. Boulanger J. Abou Elela S. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 3: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar). Class I includes all bacterial enzymes that possess both the classical nuclease domain and a dsRNA 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsRBD, dsRNA binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsRBD, dsRNA binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide(s). binding domain (dsRBD). The class II enzymes are distinguished by the presence of an N-terminal extension and includes fungal RNase IIIs such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rnt1p (7.Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr, M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe PacI (8.Iino Y. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The class III enzymes possess two nuclease domains and include both plant and vertebrate enzymes. Class IV contains all Dicer-like enzymes involved in RNA-mediated interference and are distinguished by the presence of both N-terminal helicase and PAZ domains (6.Saunders L.R. Barber G.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9.Banerjee D. Slack F. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The homology between the different RNase IIIs varies between 20 to 84% depending on their evolutionary distance, suggesting a low level of primary structure conservation (1.Lamontagne B. Larose S. Boulanger J. Abou Elela S. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 3: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar). This relatively low degree of conservation probably reflects the species specificity of RNase III, which prevents genetic complementation between members of the RNase III family (10.Rotondo G. Huang J.Y. Frendewey D. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1182-1193PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the high selectivity of RNase III cleavage in vivo, many of the enzymes have been shown to cleave RNA duplexes with low sequence complexity in vitro (11.Provost P. Dishart D. Doucet J. Frendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 12.Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 13.Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14.Rotondo G. Frendewey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, except for Rnt1p, no conserved substrate structure has been identified (15.Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16.Lebars I. Lamontagne B. Yoshizawa S. Aboul Elela S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7250-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlike other RNase IIIs, Rnt1p recognizes RNA capped by a conserved NGNN tetraloop and cleaves at a fixed distance from the loop (15.Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that Rnt1p binding and cleavage are regulated by reactivity epitopes grouped into three boxes. These are the initial binding and positioning box, which is located at the tetraloop, the binding stability box adjacent to the tetraloop, and the cleavage efficiency box near the cleavage site (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alterations of the sequence within the initial binding and positioning box and binding stability box inhibit cleavage and reduce binding, whereas alterations in the cleavage efficiency box inhibit cleavage without affecting the binding efficiency. The second nucleotide of the initial binding and positioning box is the only universally conserved nucleotide. The presence of any nucleotide other than G reduces binding and blocks cleavage (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that unlike other RNase IIIs, the Rnt1p primary binding site is an NGNN tetraloop and not an RNA helix (16.Lebars I. Lamontagne B. Yoshizawa S. Aboul Elela S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7250-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In fact, Rnt1p can use the tetraloop to bind DNA helix or direct cleavage within the DNA strand of a DNA/RNA hybrid, 2B. Lamontagne, R. N. Hannoush, M. J. Damha, and S. Abou Elela, submitted for publication.2B. Lamontagne, R. N. Hannoush, M. J. Damha, and S. Abou Elela, submitted for publication. indicating that the presence of an A-form RNA helix is not essential at the site of cleavage. It is not clear if Rnt1p retains the capacity to cleave duplex RNA nor whether or not other eukaryotic RNase IIIs also recognize specific sequence or structural features beyond the form of the RNA helix.To address this question and to understand the general mechanism of RNase III cleavage, we compared the cleavage specificity of S. cerevisiae Rnt1p to that of Escherichia coli RNase III and S. pombe PacI using a fixed set of RNA substrates. Rnt1p binds to RNA duplexes with variable efficiencies but cleaved only substrates capped with NGNN tetraloop under physiological conditions. E. coli RNase III recognized all RNA substrates tested in a similar fashion and was only inhibited by the presence of specific antideterminant sequences. PacI cleaved long RNA duplexes more efficiently than Rnt1p, but unlike E. coli RNase III, the cleavage of short RNA duplexes was restricted to RNAs that contained specific sequence and structural features. Our results suggest that, unlike prokaryotic RNase III, eukaryotic enzymes have evolved a mechanism by which RNA with specific structural features is positively selected, thereby bypassing the requirement for long RNA duplexes.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymatic Assays—Recombinant Rnt1p and the catalytically impaired mutant Rnt1p D247R, PacI, and E. coli RNase III were produced in bacteria and purified as described (30.Lamontagne B. Abou Elela S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 2B. Lamontagne, R. N. Hannoush, M. J. Damha, and S. Abou Elela, submitted for publication. The Rnt1p mutant (D247R) was prepared by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (31.Tremblay A. Lamontagne B. Catala M. Yam Y. Larose S. Good L. Abou Elela S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4792-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using the primer 5′-AGACTAGAATTCCTAGGCAGATCGATCTTAAATTCTG-3′. The RNA transcripts used for binding and cleavage were generated by T7 RNA polymerase using oligonucleotides as templates in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 5′-End-labeled RNA was produced by treating unlabeled RNA produced in vitro with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and then labeling the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using [γ-32P]ATP as described (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The perfect RNA duplex was obtained by pRS316 digestion with KpnI and pRS426 digestion with SacI followed by T7 RNA transcription as described (7.Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr, M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Each strand was labeled at its 5′-end, and equal amounts were incubated together in 1X OPA buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min at 85 °C followed by slow cooling at room temperature for 30 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction. All labeled transcripts were gel-purified. For the in vitro cleavage substrates were incubated in the presence of 10-160 nm enzyme for 20 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm spermidine, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) for Rnt1p and E. coli RNase III or 30 mm CHES (pH 8.5), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for PacI. The reactions were conducted either at 10 or 150 mm KCl in the presence of 1.5 pm RNA substrate. The reactions were either stopped by the addition of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol in formamide) and directly loaded on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel or stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and 20% glycerol (final concentration) and directly loaded on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The cleavage products were detected using Instant Imager detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cleavage rate was quantified relative to the control substrate using the Instant Imager software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mapping of the cleavage sites was accomplished using an RNA ladder produced by alkaline hydrolysis treatment and nuclease P1 digestion (data not shown) as described (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the average was calculated.Mobility Shift Assay and In-gel Cleavage Assay—RNA binding experiments were performed using 2 fmol of internally radiolabeled RNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) for 10 min on ice. For each experiment the protein concentration ranged between 1 and 12 μm. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 mm EDTA and 20% glycerol (final concentration), and fractionated on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels using 0.5 V/cm2 at 4 °C. The in-gel cleavage assay was performed as described before (30.Lamontagne B. Abou Elela S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated three times.Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting Assays—Hydroxyl radical footprinting was carried out as described (25.Li H. Nicholson A.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Recombinant Rnt1p (D247R) was purified as described above, but the final dialysis was performed against MOPS dialysis buffer (30 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm DTT) to ensure the absence of glycerol from the reaction and stored at -80 °C. In the reaction tube 28 fmol of 3′-end labeled RNA were mixed with 0.4-4.8 μm Rnt1p (D247R) in 17 μl of 1× MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The hydroxyl radical generating mix was prepared by the addition of 1 μl of 40 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 80 mm Na2-EDTA (pH 8.0) and 1 μl of 40 mm sodium ascorbate and 1 μl of 2.4% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the reaction tube. The reactions were carried out on ice for 4 min and were quenched by adding 4 μl of 100 mm thiourea. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in RNA loading dye (0.05% xylene cyanol and 0.05% bromphenol blue in formamide). The samples were loaded on 20% PAGE, and the dried gels were exposed to film. The bands were quantified using the Molecular Analyst Software (Bio-Rad). All experiments were repeated at least three times.RESULTSRnt1p Binds RNA Duplexes Lacking an NGNN Tetraloop—Binding assays show that the Rnt1p dependence on the presence of an NGNN tetraloop for interaction with RNA hairpins is proportional to the length of the RNA stem (16.Lebars I. Lamontagne B. Yoshizawa S. Aboul Elela S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7250-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutations that alter the NGNN sequence block the binding of Rnt1p to substrates with 9-bp stems (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but only reduce that to substrates with 24-bp stems by 2-4-fold (15.Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Nagel R. Ares Jr, M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that Rnt1p may still retain the capacity to directly bind RNA duplexes in a manner analogous to other dsRNA-binding proteins. To assess the importance of the NGNN tetraloop for substrate recognition by Rnt1p, we constructed RNA hairpins with different stem lengths or tetraloop sequences and tested their binding and cleavage by Rnt1p (Fig. 1). Two hairpins with identical 33-bp-long stems were constructed with either an AGUC (R31D) or a GAAA tetraloop (R31D-G3A). A similar third hairpin possessing a 27-bp stem capped with an AGUC tetraloop (R31-27) was also constructed to test the effect of the stem length on Rnt1p binding and cleavage. As shown in Fig. 1A, R31-27 and R31D, both of which possess the conserved NGNN tetraloop, bound efficiently to Rnt1p with apparent Kd values of 3.3 ± 0.3 and 2.5 ± 0.3 μm, respectively. In contrast, Rnt1p bound to R31D-G3A 2-3-fold less efficiently, with an apparent Kd of 7.0 ± 0.5 μm. This indicates that Rnt1p can bind RNA stems in the absence of the NGNN tetraloop, albeit inefficiently. Interestingly, the number of ribonucleoprotein complexes formed by Rnt1p binding varied depending on the stem length. Substrates shorter than 27 bp and capped with an NGNN tetraloop formed one complex with Rnt1p, whereas NGNN capped substrates longer than 27 bp formed two complexes with Rnt1p (Fig. 1A). At protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 3 μm the 33-bp substrate R31D formed a single ribonucleoprotein complex with Rnt1p (C1). At concentrations higher than 3 μm, all of the free RNA is shifted, and a second slower migrating RNA complex (C2) is observed. This suggests that in the presence of NGNN the C1 complex is more stable and/or forms earlier than C2. In contrast the C2 complex was much more abundant than the C1 complex when the GAAA-capped substrate (R31D-G3A) was incubated in the presence of the same concentration of Rnt1p. This indicates that the C1 complex is favored or stabilized by the presence of the NGNN tetraloop, whereas the C2 complex formation is tetraloop-independent and requires the presence of a long RNA duplex.Cleavage by Rnt1p was tested by incubating recombinant Rnt1p with 32P-labeled versions of the different substrates in the presence of Mg2+. Rnt1p efficiently cleaved R31-27 and R31D (data not shown and Fig. 1B) but not R31D-G3A, which lacks the NGNN tetraloop (Fig. 1B). Even at low monovalent salt concentrations, which normally permit the cleavage of weak substrates (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Lamontagne B. Tremblay A. Abou Elela S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1104-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), R31D-G3A was not cleaved by Rnt1p. Because the binding reactions are conducted at 4 °C, whereas the cleavage reactions are performed at 30 °C, it is possible that the ribonucleoprotein complex formed between Rnt1p and R31D-G3A (Fig. 1A) does not form in the cleavage reaction. To eliminate this possibility we performed a cleavage reaction using preformed ribonucleoprotein complexes. R31D-G3A and R31D were bound to Rnt1p, and the gel fragments containing either the C1 or C2 complexes were incubated with Mg2+ to initiate cleavage. As shown in Fig. 1C, complexes formed between Rnt1p and R31D were immediately cleaved, whereas those formed with R31D-G3A remained uncleaved even after 20 min of incubation. These results show that Rnt1p binding to RNA does not directly lead to cleavage and that the NGNN tetraloop is necessary not only for binding efficiency but also to correctly position the RNA for cleavage.Members of the RNase III Family Cleave dsRNA with Varying Efficiencies and Sequence Specificity—Although RNase IIIs other than Rnt1p have been shown to cleave generic dsRNA, their affinities for an NGNN-capped RNA stem have never been tested. To determine whether or not Rnt1p NGNN cleavage dependence is shared with other RNase IIIs, we compared E. coli RNase III, S. pombe PacI, and Rnt1p cleavage of R31D and R31D-G3A (Fig. 2A). As expected, Rnt1p only cleaved R31D, whereas bacterial RNase III cleaved both substrates to the same extent regardless of the sequence of the tetraloop. PacI cleaved R31D 12 bp from the tetraloop, and R31D-G3A cleaved both 12 bp and at an additional cleavage site located 17 bp from the tetraloop. At high salt concentrations the PacI cleavage of R31D was also more efficient than that of R31D-G3A, and cleavage 12 bp from the tetraloop was preferred only in the presence of NGNN (data not shown). Thus, at least in the context of certain RNA stems, the presence of NGNN tetraloop may influence the selection of PacI cleavage site. These data indicate that E. coli RNase III is not affected by the tetraloop composition, whereas in context both yeast RNase IIIs are influenced by the tetraloop sequence (albeit to different degrees).Fig. 2Members of the RNase III family cleave long RNA duplexes with varying efficiencies. A, in vitro cleavage of long RNA hairpins with different RNase IIIs. Long 33-bp RNA stems capped with AGUC (R31D) and GAAA (R31D-G3A) tetraloops were 5′ end-labeled and then cleaved with excess bacterial RNase III, PacI, and Rnt1p for 20 min at 30 °C. The RNA products were then fractionated on 20% denaturing PAGE. The substrate secondary structures are illustrated on the left. The black, gray, and open arrowheads represent the Rnt1p, PacI, and bacterial RNase III cleavage sites, respectively. The alkaline hydrolysis ladder of a model substrate is shown on the left of the gel. The average cleavage of the different enzymes observed in three independent experiments relative to that of Rnt1p cleavage of R31D is indicated on the bottom. B, cleavage of long intermolecular RNA duplexes with different RNase IIIs. An excess of 5′ end-labeled 106-bp-long RNA duplex of random sequence was incubated with 20 nm recombinant Rnt1p, PacI, and E. coli RNase III in different KCl concentrations. The resulting bands were fractionated on 4% nondenaturing PAGE. The positions of the gel origin (Ori), dsRNA, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and the product (P) are indicated on the right. C, mapping the cleavage products of long RNA duplexes. Cleavage reactions in the presence of an excess of protein of the 106 RNA duplex were performed as described in B but were fractionated using 12% denaturing PAGE. Increasing concentrations of Rnt1p varying between 10 and 160 nm were incubated with the RNA duplex in 10 mm KCl. The RNA molecular weight marker is shown on the left. The positions of the substrate (S) and the products (P1, P2, and P3) are indicated on the right of the gel. D, sequence of the 106 RNA duplex used to test RNase III cleavage. The cleavage positions corresponding to each product (P1, P2, and P3) are shown in small brackets. Positions that resisted cleavage by Rnt1p (black boxes), PacI (gray boxes), and RNase III (open boxes) were determined using a high resolution sequencing gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The inability of Rnt1p to cleave a 33-bp stem capped with GAAA tetraloop (Fig. 1) was surprising given earlier results showing that Rnt1p could cleave RNA duplexes like other RNase IIIs (7.Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr, M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine the source of this apparent discrepancy we tested the capacity of Rnt1p to cleave 106-bp RNA duplexes of random sequences and compared it to those of E. coli RNase III and PacI. The cleavage was performed in the presence of an excess of either RNA (10:1) or protein (100:1) in either 150 mm KCl (physiological salt conditions for S. cerevisiae) or 10 mm KCl dilution (Figs. 2, B and C). In the presence of an excess RNA Rnt1p did not cleave the RNA duplex even at low salt concentrations. In contrast, both E. coli RNase III and PacI cleaved the same substrate to completion in all salt conditions (Fig. 2C). Under single turnover conditions Rnt1p cleaved the RNA only in the presence of high protein concentrations (Fig. 2C). This result clearly indicates that, unlike RNase III and PacI, Rnt1p has only a rudimentary ability to cleave dsRNA and suggests that Rnt1p has lost the ability to directly cleave an RNA duplex in vivo.To examine whether RNase IIIs cleave dsRNA randomly or if they prefer specific sequences, we mapped the cleavage sites for all three enzymes using a high resolution denaturing gel completed with different RNA markers (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Sollner-Webb B. Cruz-Reyes J. Rusche L.N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). If the cleavage is random and the minimum product size is 11 nt, as suggested by the crystal structure of bacterial RNase III, we expect all three enzymes to cleave long dsRNA every 11 bp in all sequence combinations, leading to a final product of 11 nt. As shown in Fig. 2C, none of the three enzymes produced 11-nt final products. In fact most of the products of E. coli RNase III and Rnt1p digestion were 30 nt long, whereas most PacI products were 60 nt long (very little 30-nt products were detected with PacI). Following the cleavage reaction at different times (data not shown) allowed us to identify potential cleavage sites that are in fact not cut by each enzyme (Fig. 2D). In general all enzymes preferred areas with low G-C content. The most sensitive in this regard was PacI, which did not cleave sites with two consecutive G-C bp. The least sensitive was E. coli RNase III, which was only affected by a stretch of 7 G-C bp. This indicates that all three enzymes are inhibited to varying extents by the presence of G-C bp at the cleavage site. These results show that E. coli RNase III has low sequence specificity but does not cleave dsRNA randomly and that yeast RNase IIIs have more sequence bias than bacterial RNase III. However, a certain conservation of the RNA recognition mechanism that render all enzymes sensitive to G-C contents exists.Identification of Rnt1p-protected Ribose Residues by Hydroxyl Radicals—To determine how Rnt1p binds its substrates we mapped the binding pattern of RNA either with or without the conserved NGNN tetraloop using chemical footprinting. Hydroxyl radicals are small, highly reactive, and are insensitive to both sequences and secondary structures but clearly detect tertiary structure and protein protection. As shown in Fig. 3A, specific and strong footprints were seen within the tetraloop sequence and at the cleavage site. Footprints were consistently strong near the tetraloop, and the strongest footprints were detected at position 38 and 39 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Nucleotides at positions 38 and 39 were also shown by mutagenesis and chemical interference to be crucial for cleavage by Rnt1p (17.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Abou Elela S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In general, the protection pattern of R31D was consistent with the previously determined minimum substrate length of 18 bp. Protection of nucleotides at the 3′ end of the NGNN tetraloop were more pronounced than those at the 5′ end of the tetraloop, consistent with asymmetrical binding of Rnt1p. The level of protections increased as Rnt1p concentration increased and reached a maximum in the presence of 1.2 μm Rnt1p. In contrast protections were not detected with R31D-G3A, which lacks the NGNN tetraloop, in any Rnt1p concentrations (Fig. 3B and Supplemental Fig. 1). The absence of protection is not due to the inability of Rnt1p to bind R31D-G3A, as indicated by mobility shift assay performed under the same conditions used for chemical footprinting (data not shown). This result suggests that Rnt1p binding in the absence of NGNN tetraloop is either too heterogeneous or too weak to produce specific footprint. We conclude the Rnt1p specifically interacts with sequences adjacent to the tetraloop and near the cleavage site in an NGNN dependent manner.Fig. 3Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting of Rnt1p·RNA complexes. Trace amounts of R31D (A) and R31D-G3A (B) RNAs were 3′ end-labeled and incubated with 0, 0.4, 1.2, or 4.8 μm recombinant Rnt1p D247R in the absence (N) or presence of hydroxyl radical-generating reagents on ice. The RNA was extracted, loaded on a 20% denaturing PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography, and the bands were quantified. The positions of the tet"

Mutant mice had normal blood glucose and insulin levels, but elevated leptin concentrations in the fed state. During the transition to fasting, glucose and insulin blood concentrations remained markedly elevated for at least 6 h and returned to control levels after 24 h whereas leptin levels remained high at all times. Hyperinsulinemia in the post-absorptive phase was normalized by atropine or methylatropine indicating an elevated parasympathetic activity on the pancreatic β cells, which was associated with increased levels of hypothalamic NPY mRNA. Euglycemic clamps at both low and high insulin infusion rates revealed whole body insulin resistance with reduced muscle glycogen synthesis and impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production at the low insulin infusion rate. The liver glycogen stores were 2-fold higher in the fed state in the α1b-AR-/- compared with control mice, but were mobilized at the same rate during the fed to fast transition or following glucagon injections. Finally, high fat feeding for one month increased glucose intolerance and body weight in the α1b-AR-/-, but not in control mice. Altogether, our results indicate that in the absence of the α1b-AR the expression of hypotalamic NPY and the parasympathetic nervous activity are both increased resulting in hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance as well as favoring obesity and glucose intolerance development during high fat feeding.

Three β (β1, β2, β3), three α2 (α2A, α2B, α2C), and three α1 (α1a, α1b, α1d) AR subtypes have been characterized at the molecular level. The AR subtypes are widely expressed in different brain regions and peripheral organs (1.Graham R. Perez D. Hwa J. Piascik M.

Res. 1981; 24: 945-966Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). With regard to glucose metabolism, ARs are involved in the regulation of numerous functions such as insulin and glucagon secretion as well as hepatic glucose production and storage (6.Yamaguchi N.

J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by both the β2-AR and α1-AR subtypes via the cAMP and calcium-dependent pathways, respectively, thus leading to hyperglycemia (10.Exton J.H. Blackmore P.F. El-Refai M.F. Dehaye J.P. Strickland W.G. Cherrington A.D. Chan T.M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F.D. Chrisman T.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 491-505PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, catecholamines reduce insulin secretion by binding to the α2-AR on β cells (11.Angel I. Burcelin R. Prouteau M. Girard J. Langer S.Z. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Duval N. Angel I. Oblin A. Eon M. Langer S. Adv. Biosci. 1991; 82: 25-26Google Scholar) and increase glucagon secretion by binding to β2-AR present in pancreatic α cells (13.Schuit F.C. Pipeleers D.G. Science. 1986; 232: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The combined effects of catecholamines on both liver and endocrine pancreas are thus an important component of the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia. The effect of catecholamines on glucose metabolism could either be direct at the postsynaptic ARs on target cells, as for regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion, or indirect, acting on ARs expressed on regulatory neurons in various brain areas. The α1b-AR has been mapped to different brain regions, including several hypothalamic nuclei, in particular the arcuate nucleus, the paraventricular and lateral hypothalamic nuclei as well as in the brain stem (in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius) (2.Acosta-Martinez M. Fiber J.M. Brown R.D. Etgen A.M. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 35: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These brain structures control several important homeostatic functions such as insulin and glucagon secretion, glucose utilization or production, energy expenditure, and food intake. In addition to their sensitivity to catecholamines (14.Pierret P. Haddjeri N. Boyer A. Perrin J. Orsini J. J. Physiol. 1994; 88: 89-90Google Scholar), these central regions, in particular the arcuate nucleus and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, are also regulated by peripheral signals such as insulin, leptin, and glucose levels (15.Kalra S.

Arcuate nucleus neurons secrete the orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti gene-related proteins (AgRP) as well as the anorexigenic peptides α-MSH, derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocain and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Whereas the orexigenic peptide production is decreased by leptin, insulin, and glucose, these factors increase expression of the anorexigenic peptides (19.Schwartz M.W. Baskin D.G. Bukowski T.R. Kuijper J.L. Foster D. Lasser G. Prunkard D.E. Porte Jr., D. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J. Weigle D.S. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 531-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D.

Its intracerebroventricular administration stimulates feeding, increases insulin secretion and fat metabolism and induces insulin resistance (21.Billington C. Briggs J. Grace G. Levine A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R321-R327PubMed Google Scholar). Identifying the specific receptor subtype that mediates the various effects of catecholamines is of considerable therapeutic interest, but has proved difficult because of a lack of subtype specific drugs. In this study we investigated glucose metabolism in knockout mice deficient in the α1b-AR subtype (19.Schwartz M.W. Baskin D.G. Bukowski T.R. Kuijper J.L. Foster D. Lasser G. Prunkard D.E. Porte Jr., D. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J. Weigle D.S. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 531-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results provide the evidence that in the absence of the α1b-AR, the parasympathetic activity is increased leading to increased insulin secretion, higher hepatic glycogen stores and impaired insulin action. This is associated with increased hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA levels in the presence of hyperleptinemia indicating that leptin is inefficient in controlling the expression of these orexigenic peptides in the absence of the α1b-AR. Furthermore, the mice lacking the α1b-AR displayed glucose intolerance and increased body weight under high fat feeding. Animals—12-16-week-old male mice from our colony were housed individually with inverted dark light cycle 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. During the feeding period, blood was collected between 1 and 2 p.m. In fasting experiments the mice were housed at 8 a.m. in clean new cages without food but with free access to water. As previously described (22.Cavalli A. Lattion A.-L. Hummler E. Nenniger M. Pedrazzini T. Aubert J.-F. Martin M. Yang M. Lembo G. Vecchione C. Mostardini M. Schmidt A. Beermann F. Cotecchia C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 11589-11594Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) the genetic background of control and α1b-AR-/- mice was 129xC57Bl/6. For each genotype, mice from different litters were randomly inter-crossed to obtain the control and null progeny. Analytical Determinations—Blood parameters: plasma glucose conentrations were determined by a glucose oxidase method (Trinder kit, Sigma Diagnostic). Plasma insulin concentration was determined by ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden), from 10 μl of plasma sampled from the tail vein during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests or radioimmunoassays in all others instances (Linco, St Charles, MO). Plasma free fatty acids were determined by an enzymatic colorimetric reaction using the acyl-CoA synthase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes (NEFA C, Wako, Neuss, Germany). In all other instances plasma, glucagon, and leptin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassays (Linco). For body composition, the mice were killed, and the whole carcasses were dried until constant weight. Total body fat content was determined by the soxhlet extraction method using petroleum benzine. The liver glycogen content was determined from a slice of the main lobe of the liver. The muscle glycogen content was determined after muscles from the total hind limb have been grounded and pulverized into liquid nitrogen. Briefly, 50-100 mg of the tissues were dissolved in NaOH, 1 m at 55 °C for 1 h, neutralized with HCl (1 m) and spun down. A sample of the supernatant was incubated in the presence of amyloglucosidase (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. After centrifugation the glucose present in the supernatant was assayed by a glucose oxidase method (Sigma). Atropine and methyl-atropine injections were at a dose of 10 mg/kg into the peritoneal cavity of 6 h fasted mice. Blood was collected by retroorbital sampling 30 min after the injections for determination of plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. For glucose turnover measurements, d-[3-3H]glucose enrichments were determined from total blood after deproteinization by a Zn(OH)2 precipitate as described (23.Burcelin R. Crivelli V. Dacosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness to determine the radioactivity corresponding to d-[3-3H]glucose and another aliquot was directly counted to determine the d-[3-3H] water issued from tritiated glucose metabolism. In a second aliquot of the same supernatant, glucose concentration was assessed by the glucose oxidase method. RT-PCR Analysis—For the α1b-AR and cyclophillin mRNA determinations, pancreatic islets were isolated and total RNA extracted as previously described (24.Burcelin R. del Carmen Munoz M. Guillam M.T. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10930-10936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Three micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 42 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 0.7 μm oligo(dT), 1 mm dNTP, 1× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol. Three microliters of the RT reaction were amplified by PCR using 5 units of Taq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) in a 50-μl reaction containing 0.25 μm both forward and reverse primers, 1× PCR buffer (Amersham Biosciences), and 120 μm dNTP. The primer sequences designed using the Genetics Computer Group program suite were as follows: 5′-CAATGACGACAAAGAATGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGGGAGAGCGATGAAGAAG-3′ for the α1b-AR; 5′-GCTCTGAGCACTGGAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCTTGGCAGTGCAGAT-3′ for cyclophillin. PCR was performed as follows: 45 s at 94 °C, 50 s at 62 °C and 45 s at 72 °C. Twenty cycles were performed with a 0.5 °C/decrease in the annealing temperature. Then 20 cycles were performed using an annealing temperature of 52 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, revealed with ethidium bromide and transferred on nylon membranes (Hybond), denatured, and hybridized with a random-primed 32P-labeled probe for the α1b-AR. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced (Microsynth) using M13 as the elongation primer. Quantification of brain neuropeptides mRNA was by real-time RT-PCR analysis. This was performed starting with total RNA obtained from individual mice using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers: F 5′-ATGGGGCTGTGTGGACTGAC-3′ and R 5′-AAGTTTCATTTCCCATCACCAC-3′ for mouse NPY; F 5′-CAGAGTTCCCAGGTCTAAGTC-3′ and R 5′-TTGAAGAAGCGGCAGTAGCAC-3′ for mouse AgRP;. GAPDH mRNA was used as the invariant control using mouse GAPDH primers (F 5′-GTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGG-3′, R 5′-GACTCCACGACATACTCAGC-3′). Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and single-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA with random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR reactions were prepared with a LightCycler reaction kit (Eurogenetec, Belgium) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 250 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA, 500 nm of primers, 10 μl of 2× PCR mix and 0.5 μl of SYBR Green. The reactions were carried out in capillaries in a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) and were cycled 40 times. The relative amount of all mRNAs was calculated using the second derivative maximum method with the LightCycler analysis software version 3.5. Glucose and Glucagon Tolerance Test—For glucose tolerance test, food was removed at 8 a.m. 6 h before the intraperitoneal injection of glucose at 1 g of glucose/kg of body weight (26.Burcelin R. Dolci W. Thorens B. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 252-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were monitored using a glucose meter (Roche Applied Science) from 2.5 μl of tail blood at -30, 0, 30, 60, and 90 min after glucose injection. Plasma insulin concentration was also measured 30 min after glucose injection in 10 μl of plasma from 20 μl of blood collected from the tip of the tail vein. For the glucagon tolerance tests, mice were injected into the peritoneal cavity with human glucagon (1 mg/kg) or saline in the fed state between 1 and 2 p.m. Food was immediately removed after injection but the mice had free access to water. At different times after the injection the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, the liver rapidly removed, frozen into liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C until glycogen measurement. For glucagon determination, blood was collected on aprotinin (1 μg/ml) and EDTA (1 mm), immediately centrifuged, and the plasma stored at -70 °C until assay. Glucose Turnover Analysis—A catheter was indwelled into the femoral vein of the mice under anesthesia, sealed under the back skin, and glued on the top of the skull (23.Burcelin R. Crivelli V. Dacosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This catheter was devoted to infusion of insulin, glucose, and d-[3-3H]glucose. The mice were allowed to recover for 4-6 days. The day of the experiment the mice were fasted for 6 h and whole body glucose utilization was determined in mice infused with saline or insulin. In the basal fasted state mice were continuously infused through the femoral vein with HPLC purified d-[3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a rate of 10 μCi/kg·min for 3 h. Under hyperinsulinemic conditions mice were infused with the hormone at a rate of 4 or 18 milliunits/kg·min, and d-[3-3H]glucose was infused at a rate of 30 μCi/kg·min for 3 h. Euglycemia was maintained by the use of a concomitant intrafemoral glucose (16.5% solution) infusion. Plasma glucose and d-[3-3H]glucose concentrations were determined in 5 μl of blood sampled from the tip of the tail vein each 10 min during the last hour of the infusion as described (23.Burcelin R. Crivelli V. Dacosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). High Fat Diet Feeding—Mice were fed for 1 month with a high fat diet (HF) in which 72% of the energy comes from fat (corn oil, Lard), 28% from protein (Cow milk casein, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), and less than 1% from other origin (mineral salts, vitamin mix and cellulose, ICN, Costa Messa, CA) (26.Burcelin R. Dolci W. Thorens B. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 252-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Body weights were recorded before and after a month. Calculations—Calculations for glucose turnover analyses were made with parameters from the last 60 min of the infusions when a steady state d-[3-3H]glucose enrichment was obtained. Whole body glucose turnover was calculated by dividing the d-[3-3H]glucose infusion rate by the plasma glucose specific activity as described (23.Burcelin R. Crivelli V. Dacosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Endogenous glucose production was calculated as the difference between the glucose turnover rate and the glucose infusion rate in steady state condition during the last hour of the infusion. Statistical Analysis—The significance of the results was calculated using the unpaired Student's t test. Mean values were considered different when p < 0.05. Blood Parameters—Fig. 1, A-D, shows the blood glucose and plasma insulin, glucagon and leptin levels in the fed state and during an initial 6 h period of fasting. In the fed state, blood glucose levels were similar in control and α1b-AR-/- mice (Fig. 1A), they however remained significantly higher in the α1b-AR-/- mice during the first six hours of fasting but eventually returned to the level of the control mice after 24 h of fasting (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 3.7 ± 0.2 mm in mutant and control mice, respectively). The fed plasma insulin levels in the control and α1b-AR-/- mice were identical in the fed state (Fig. 1B). Strikingly however, plasma insulin concentrations during the transition to fasting remained markedly elevated in the mutant mice and were ∼5- and ∼3-fold higher than in control animals after 3 and 6 h of fasting. The plasma insulin concentration in the α1b-AR-/- mice returned to the value of the control mice after 24 h of fast (8.4 ± 1.1 versus 7.3 ± 1.6 μU/ml in mutant and control mice, respectively). Fig. 1C shows that the glucagon levels were identical in mutant and control mice at all time points. In α1b-AR-/- mice, plasma leptin levels were high in the fed state and remained relatively elevated at all times during the transition to fasting (Fig. 1D). After 24 h of fast these levels were still 6.5 ± 2.0 versus 1.9 ± 1.9 ng/ml in mutant and control mice, respectively. The high leptin levels in mutant mice could in part be explained by an elevated total body fat content, which was increased by ∼60% (5.33 ± 0.76 g versus 3.34 ± 0.40 g in mutant and control mice, respectively), even though body weights were similar (34.5 ± 1.0 g versus 34.0 ± 1.3 g for mutant and control mice, respectively). The increased postabsorptive insulinemia may also contribute to the elevated leptin levels. Free fatty acid levels were identical in control and mutant mice in the fed state (0.648 ± 0.060 versus 0.650 ± 0.054 mm, respectively), but were lower in the mutant as compared with control mice after 6 h of fasting (0.838 ± 0.083 versus 1.159 ± 0.116 mm, p < 0.05, respectively). This suggests that the increased body fat mass observed in the mutant mice results, at least in part, from a decreased lipolysis linked to the lack of the α1b-AR, which is known to mobilize free fatty acid from the adipose tissue (8.Fain J. Garcia-Sainz A. J. Lipid. Res. 1981; 24: 945-966Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Increased Parasympathetic Activity in Pancreatic β Cells—In several species, including the mouse, insulin secretion is stimulated by the parasympathetic system via cholinergic muscarinic receptors (27.Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28.Santos R.M. Rojas E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the parasympathetic nervous system plays a role in the postabsorptive hyperinsulinemia of the α1b-AR-/- mice, the insulin plasma levels were measured 30 min after the injection of atropine or methyl-atropine in 6-h fasted mice. Injection of these cholinergic blockers reduced the plasma insulin levels of the α1b-AR-/- mice to the values of the control mice (Fig. 2). The blood glucose concentration was not affected by the injection of the anticholinergic drugs thus excluding that the reduction in insulin concentration resulted from changes in glycemia and that the modest elevation in blood glucose levels in fed mice was the cause of the hyperinsulinemia (5.9 ± 0.2 versus 5.4 ± 0.2 mm in mutant and control mice, respectively). Similar saline or methyl-atropine injections in 6 h fasted control and mutant mice did not reveal any decrease in leptin levels induced by muscarinic blockade. Leptin levels were (ng/ml ± S.E.): control mice, saline: 2.72 ± 074 (n = 7), control mice, m-atropine: 2.79 ± 042 (n = 8), α1b-AR-/- mice, saline: 5.81 ± 0.84 (n = 8), α1b-AR-/- mice, m-atropine: 6.61 ± 1.2 (n = 8). To investigate whether the α1b-AR could play a direct role in the control of normal β cell function, we compared its mRNA expression in liver and pancreatic islets isolated from control mice. Fig. 3 shows, by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis, that the α1b-AR mRNA was expressed at high level in the liver, as expected, whereas it was absent from pancreatic islets of control mice. Thus, this receptor does not play any direct role in regulating insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells and dysregulation of these cells secretory activity mutant islets is best explained by a modification of the parasympathetic nervous activity. Measurements of Hypothalamic Neuropeptide mRNAs—Increase in parasympathetic nervous activity in pancreatic β cells could be due to higher expression of hypothalamic NPY (29.Sainsbury A. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Cusin I. Zakrzewska K.E. Halban P.A. Gaillard R.C. Jeanrenaud B. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the mRNA of NPY and AgRP in hypothalamus by quantitative RT-PCR. The amount of each mRNA, normalized to the GAPDH mRNA content, was significantly increased in the α1b-AR-/- mice (Fig. 4). Thus, the absence of the α1b-AR leads to elevated levels of NPY and AgRP even in the presence of elevated plasma leptin levels. This may cause the observed increase in parasympathetic nervous activity. Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Tests—Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests performed in 6 h fasted control and α1b-AR-/- mice revealed normal tolerance in both groups (Fig. 5A). However, the plasma insulin concentrations were 3-fold higher 30 min after the glucose challenge in α1b-AR-/- than in control mice (Fig. 5B). When expressed as increase over fasting values, glucose-induced insulin plasma concentrations were still 2-fold higher in the α1b-AR-/- than in control mice (Fig. 5C). As a consequence, in the mutant mice the insulin to glucose ratio was almost twice the value of the control mice (Fig. 5D). Glucose Turnover—Normal glucose tolerance in the presence of exaggerated insulin secretion and hyperinsulinemia in the fasted state suggests the presence of insulin resistance in the α1b-AR-/- mice. To directly evaluate this possibility, whole body glucose turnovers were determined in 6-h fasted control and α1b-AR-/- mice, in the basal state as well as during euglycemic clamps with insulin infusion rates leading to physiologic or supraphysiologic insulin levels. The glucose turnover rate in the basal state was significantly reduced by 20% in the α1b-AR-/- compared with control mice, but was however associated with higher glucose levels in the α1b-AR-/- mice than in controls (Fig. 6A). During euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, the plasma insulin concentration in α1b-AR-/- and control mice increased to 51 ± 12 and 73 ± 18 microunits/ml, and to 284 ± 45 and 322 ± 55 microunits/ml, at low and high insulin infusion rates, respectively. Insulin-increased glucose turnover was 20 and 15% lower in the α1b-AR-/- mice at low and high insulin infusion rates, respectively, when compared with control mice (Fig. 6A). The reduced glucose turnover rate was associated with a reduced whole body glycogen synthesis rate in the α1b-AR-/- mice in all conditions studied (Fig. 6D). However, the glycolytic rate was normal (Fig. 6C). Hepatic glucose production was lower in the basal state, but was poorly suppressed by physiological hyperinsulinemia in α1b-AR-/- as compared with control mice (Fig. 6B). High insulin levels however completely suppressed endogenous glucose production. Altogether these data indicate a state of hepatic insulin resistance in the α1b-AR-/- mice. Glycogen Content—Activation of the hepatic α1b-AR is known to stimulate glycogenolysis (7.Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Moore M.C. Cherrington A.D. Tordoff M.G. Friedman M.I. Jungermann K.

Strickland W.G. Cherrington A.D. Chan T.M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F.D. Chrisman T.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 491-505PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the absence of this receptor from the liver would modify glycogen metabolism we compared the hepatic glycogen stores during the fed to fast transition in mutant and control mice. In the fed state, the glycogen stores were 2-fold higher in the α1b-AR-/- than in control mice (Fig. 7, A and B). In control mice the hepatic glycogen content progressively decreased by more than 80% within the first three hours of fasting. In the α1b-AR-/- mice after 6 h of fasting the glycogen stores still represented ∼60% of the initial content and was reduced by 80% after 24 h of fast. However, the initial rates of glycogen degradation, expressed as the amount (μg) of glycogen degraded per minute, during the first 3 h of fasting were similar in control and mutant mice (∼2.2 μg/g·min and ∼1.7 μg/g·min for control and mutant mice, respectively). Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of glucagon at 1 mg/kg, lead to a 70% reduction in glycogen stores within 1 h in control mice whereas a similar reduction required ∼3 h in the mutant mice (Fig. 8, A and B). Again, the rate (μg/mg·min) of glycogen mobilization fo"
https://openalex.org/W1991004688,"Recently, we isolated the Dub-2A gene, which encodes a novel murine deubiquitinating enzyme subfamily member, from a bacterial artificial chromosome library clone by PCR amplification with degenerate PCR primers for the Dub-2 cDNA (Baek, K.-H., Mondoux, M. A., Jaster, R., Fire-Levin E., and D'Andrea, A. D. (2001) Blood 98, 636–642). In this study, we analyzed two more clones from the library to isolate genes encoding other deubiquitinating enzymes. Dub-1A, which encodes the shortest member of the DUB subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes so far, has been identified in both clones and characterized. Sequence analysis showed that Dub-1A encodes a 468-amino acid protein that has a molecular mass of ∼51 kDa and that contains a putative catalytic domain (Cys, His, and Asp) conserved among DUB proteins. The amino acid sequence of DUB-1A is 84.5, 84.7, and 85.3% identical to those of DUB-1, DUB-2, and DUB-2A, respectively. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that Dub-1A is expressed not only in B-lymphocytes in response to interleukin-3 stimulation, but also in T-lymphocytes, brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, ovary, and spleen. This suggests that Dub-1A may play essential roles in each of these organs. In vivo and in vitro deubiquitinating enzyme assays showed that DUB-1A has functional deubiquitinating activity and that the 5′-flanking sequence of Dub-1A has a functional enhancer domain as shown in Dub-1 and Dub-2A. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis revealed that DUB-1A is polyubiquitinated, indicating that it is degraded through proteasome-mediated degradation. In the absence of JAK2, Dub-1A was expressed at a lower level. This suggests that DUB-1A functions downstream of JAK2 kinase in the interleukin-3 signaling pathway.

It is evident that a balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes plays a pivotal role in regulating the destiny of proteins within cells. The deviation of balanced ubiquitination and deubiquitination may lead to the aberration of intracellular processes, including cell cycle progression, transcriptional activation, signal transduction, antigen presentation, apoptosis (or programmed cell death), oncogenesis, preimplantation, and DNA repair (1.Moazed D.

A number of studies have been carried out to investigate ubiquitin conjugation and its role in regulating protein degradation. Ubiquitin, a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids, functions as a tag for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (8.Hochstrasser M.

These include ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; E4, ubiquitin conjugation factor; Ub, ubiquitin; IL, interleukin; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild-type; DN, dominant-negative; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2), and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3). E1 enzymes form a thiol ester bond with the glycine of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent process. Then, E2 enzymes receive ubiquitin from the E1 enzymes by a trans-thiolation process. Finally, the ubiquitin with E2 enzymes is transferred to the lysine residue of the protein substrate by E3 enzymes (3.Ciechanover A.

Thus, the ubiquitin system is hierarchical, and the identified numbers of these enzymes are the highest for E3, followed by E2 and E1 (13.Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L.

Recent investigations demonstrated that deubiquitinating enzymes, which cleave ubiquitin from protein substrates, also regulate protein degradation. This process either rescues proteins from degradation or accelerates protein degradation (20.D'Andrea A.D. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21.Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The deubiquitinating enzymes are cysteine proteases and are classified into two major families: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family and the ubiquitin-processing protease family (20.D'Andrea A.D. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21.Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

According to the Swiss Protein Database, >90 deubiquitinating enzymes identified so far reveal structural diversity, suggesting a broad range of substrate specificity. 23 deubiquitinating enzymes, including the tumor suppressor CYLD1, have recently been identified by chemistry-based functional proteomics in EL4 cells (22.Borodovsky A.

It is expected that with information obtained from genome sequencing projects in various living organisms, including human and mouse, a number of genes encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme will be identified by various methods (23.Baek K.-H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a few members of a novel Dub subfamily in lymphocytes, including Dub-1, Dub-2, and Dub-2A (2.Zhu Y.

D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both Dub-1 and Dub-2 were originally cloned as immediate-early genes and are induced by cytokines in B- and T-lymphocytes, respectively (2.Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. D'Andrea A.D.

Dub-1 is induced by stimulation with interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, whereas Dub-2 is induced by stimulation with IL-2 only (2.Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that DUB-2 is capable of promoting IL-2-mediated signaling and can suppress apoptosis in lymphocytes after withdrawal of growth factor (24.Zhu Y. Lambert K.

Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, substrates for these DUB enzymes have not been identified yet, even though it has been suggested that DUB-2 may be involved in reversal of Cbl-b-mediated p85 ubiquitination (24.Zhu Y.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the cloning of both complementary and genomic DNA for a novel deubiquitinating enzyme, Dub-1A, which is classified as one of the Dub subfamily members. The sequences of the putative polypeptide and enhancer element for Dub-1A are highly homologous to those for previously known Dub subfamily members (Dub-1, Dub-2, and Dub-2A) and reveal deubiquitinating enzyme activity in vivo and in vitro. Screening of the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) Library and Cloning of the Dub-1A Gene—The murine genomic library in the pBe-loBAC11 vector was screened by genomic PCR with two primers (Bam5′, 5′-GCGGATCCTTTGAAGAGGTCTTTGGAAA-3′; and Xho3′, 5′-ATCTCGAGGTGTCCACAGGAGCCTGTGT-3′) derived from the sequence of the Dub-2 gene. Using the same primers, genomic PCR products containing the Dub-1A gene from two of three positive BAC clones were generated, cloned, and sequenced. Cells, Tissues, and Culture Conditions—Ba/F3 cells (IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cells) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10 pm murine IL-3 (R&D Systems), except for those used in cytokine dose-dependent Dub-1A induction experiments. CTLL-2 cells (IL-2-dependent murine pro-T cells) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10 pm murine recombinant IL-2 (R&D Systems). Various tissues (mouse brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, ovary, and spleen; 129w) were obtained. NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A or pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A(C60S) with pMT123-HA-ubiquitin plasmids using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA Extraction and PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from Ba/F3 cells, CTLL-2 cells, and various tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The tissues used for RNA extraction were from brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, ovary, and testis. These RNAs were subjected to templates for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. We preformed RT-PCR using a pair of primers designed as Dub-1A-specific based on the Dub-1A sequence. The nucleotide sequences of these primers are as follows: 1A-S1, 5′-ATGTCACCTCCTAGT-3′; and 1A-S2, 5′-TAAAGCTTTAGGGTC-3′. Degenerate PCR was also performed using a pair of primers designed for DUB enzymes (DUB-1, DUB-2, DUB-2A, and DUB-1A). The nucleotide sequences of these primers are as follows: DUB/CS-down, 5′-GGCAACAGCTGCTACCTGAATG-3′; and 4A/T7-2, 5′-TTCTGTCTACACCTACCA-3′. RT-PCR and degenerate PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 30 cycles. The amplified cDNA was subcloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Dub-1A(C60S) mutant was generated using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 14 min for a total of 14 cycles. The forward primer (5′-CACAGGCAACAGCAGCTACCTGAATGCAGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCTGCATTCAGGTAGCTGCTGTTGCCTGTG-3′) were used for replacing cysteine with serine at position 60 of DUB-1A. In Vivo and in Vitro Deubiquitination Assays—The effect of Dub-1A expression on the ubiquitin/proteasome system was analyzed by transfecting pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A or pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A(C60S) with pMT123-HA-ubiquitin into NIH3T3 cells. After a 24-h transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. 10 μg of total proteins were loaded onto each lane of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis using anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Roche Applied Science). Equal loading was verified by immunoblotting against anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro deubiquitination assay of Ub-β-galactosidase fusion protein has been described previously (28.Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The deubiquitinating activity of DUB-1A was analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antiserum (Cappel) and rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Isopeptidase Assay—To confirm that DUB-1A has isopeptidase activity, the inhibitory effect of ubiquitin aldehyde on the deubiquitinating activity of DUB-1A was analyzed. For the assay, COS-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 36 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline before application of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were then rotated at 4 °C for 1 h followed, by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and combined with protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), followed by rotation at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, once using lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and three times with reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij, and 3 mm dithiothreitol) before 50% of the beads were used in hydrolysis reactions. To inhibit deubiquitinating activity, DUB-1A was preincubated in the presence of 2 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Affiniti Research Products) for 30 min at 37 °C. Mixed polyubiquitin chains (Ub2–7; Affiniti Research Products) were then used as substrates at a final concentration of 1 μm as described previously (29.Evans P.C. Smith T.S. Lai M.-J. Williams M.G. Burke D.F. Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. Blundell T.L. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23180-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Following hydrolysis, ubiquitins were detected by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and the ECL detection kit. In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation for Ubiquitination Assay—For in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-Dub-1A and pMT123-HA-ubiquitin. After a 48-h transfection, co-immunoprecipitation was performed, and precipitates were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blot analysis. Bands were visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit). Stable Transfection of Ba/F3 Cells with Wild-type (WT) Jak2 or Dominant-negative (DN)-Jak2—Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3-containing medium were transfected by electroporation. A cDNA construct (pBOS-WT-Jak2 or pBOS-DN-Jak2) and pSV2neo were applied. G418-resistant Ba/F3 subclones were isolated by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates. Stable expression of WT-Jak2 or DN-Jak2 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Each cell line was starved of IL-3 for 8 h and restimulated with 10 pm IL-3 for 2 h. The relative expression level of Dub-1A in transfected Ba/F3 cells was then determined according to the expression level of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene. The band density of DNA stained with ethidium bromide on a 1% agarose gel was measured using a Gel-Doc image analyzer (Bio-Rad). Average intensities of the DNA band were normalized to those of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase used as a control. Expression levels were tested at least three times by independent transfection. Isolation of an Enhancer Element and Construction of Luciferase Reporter Plasmids—A 1427-bp fragment corresponding to the promoter region of the Dub-1A gene was amplified by PCR from two BAC clones (BAC2 and BAC3). The primers used for PCR were DUB1e1 (5′-CTAGTAAGGATATAACAGG-3′) and T14/CS (5′-CATTCAGGTAGCAGCTGTTGCC-3′). The amplified PCR product was subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and the putative enhancer domain (112 bp) from the promoter region was isolated by PCR with primers DUB1e1 and DUB1Ae2 (5′-TCTTAGTCACTGTTGTATCT-3′) and subcloned into the pGL2 promoter plasmid (Promega), which contains the SV40 basal promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Mutations of Ets, AP-1, and GATA in the Dub-1A enhancer region generated by PCR using mutant oligonucleotide primers are indicated in Fig. 7A. Transient Transfection and Transactivation Experiments—Transient transfection of Ba/F3 cells and luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (30.Jaster R. Zhu Y. Pless M. Bhattacharya S. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3364-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, Ba/F3 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline free of serum and IL-3 and cultured in plain RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h. Afterward, they were resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/0.8 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and transferred to an electroporation cuvette. The cells were incubated with 10 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter vector along with 1 μg of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter gene construct to monitor transfection efficiencies. After electroporation with a Bio-Rad electroporator (350 V, 960 microfarads), the cells were divided into two pools and either restimulated with 10 pm IL-3 for 4 h or left untreated. Luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were then analyzed according to manufacturer specifications (luciferase assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and Galacto-Light kit (Tropix), respectively). Each luciferase reporter construct was tested at least three times by independent transfection. Cloning and Expression of a Novel Dub-1A Gene, the Smallest Dub Subfamily Member—We have previously screened a murine genomic BAC library using Dub-2-specific primers and isolated three BAC clones that may contain a putative genomic Dub-2 gene (25.Baek K.-H. Mondoux M.A. Jaster R. Fire-Levin E. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, one of these BAC clones (BAC1) contains the Dub-2A gene, which is highly homologous to Dub-2 (25.Baek K.-H. Mondoux M.A. Jaster R. Fire-Levin E. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the other two BAC clones (BAC2 and BAC3) were subjected to further analysis in this study. Digestion of both BAC clones with different restriction enzymes revealed that they contain the same genomic fragment (data not shown). Sequence analysis of amplified PCR products derived from these clones showed a novel Dub gene (Dub-1A) composed of two exons and one intron (Fig. 1A). This is similar to the structural organization of the genomic DNAs for other Dub subfamily members, including Dub-1, Dub-2, and Dub-2A (2.Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24.Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. D'Andrea A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25.Baek K.-H. Mondoux M.A. Jaster R. Fire-Levin E. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on the genomic sequence, the full-length Dub-1A cDNA was subsequently isolated from various mouse tissues by RT-PCR and predicted to contain a 1407-bp open reading frame and to encode a protein of 468 amino acids (Fig. 1B), rendering it the shortest protein among DUB subfamily members (Fig. 2). Exon 1 encodes only 9 amino acids, and exon 2 encodes amino acids 10–468, divided by 786 bp of the single intron. The TATA box located 107 bp upstream of the start codon is indicated in Fig. 2. Because the amino acid sequences of DUB subfamily members are highly homologous to one other, we next compared the predicted amino acid sequence of DUB-1A with those previously reported for DUB-1, DUB-2, and DUB-2A (Fig. 2). DUB-1A has 84.5% amino acid identity to DUB-1, 84.7% amino acid identity to DUB-2, and 85.3% amino acid identity to DUB-2A. Like other known ubiquitin-processing protease enzymes, including DUB subfamily members, DUB-1A contains three conserved domains, which are cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid domains (Fig. 2). Previous reports revealed that these domains are required for deubiquitinating enzyme activity, indicating that they are involved in constructing the active sites of the enzymes (25.Baek K.-H. Mondoux M.A. Jaster R. Fire-Levin E. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31.Lee J.-H. Kim Y.-S. Kim M. Baek K.-H. Am. J. Hematol. 2001; 67: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both DUB-1A and DUB-1 lack a short hypervariable region present in DUB-2 and DUB-2A (amino acids 444–463, KHR(I/N)NEILPQEQN-HQK(A/T)GQS) (Fig. 2). The cellular function of this region in DUB-2 and DUB-2A has not yet been elucidated. As shown in Fig. 2, the C terminus of DUB-1A is much shorter than those of other DUB subfamily members. These data support the observation that deubiquitinating enzymes function as long as the polypeptide contains those three conserved amino acids (Cys, His, and Asp). Expression of Dub-1A in Various Tissues and Cytokine-dependent Expression in B- and T-lymphocytes—Due to the presence of Dub-1 in B-lymphocytes, we analyzed the expression pattern of Dub-1A mRNA by RT-PCR using Dub-1A-specific primers (Fig. 1A). We designed specific primers for Dub-1A (1A-S1 and 1A-S2) and demonstrated that they specifically amplified Dub-1A, whereas the degenerate PCR primers recognized all Dub subfamily members (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we used these primers for RT-PCR to determine whether Dub-1A mRNA is expressed in various murine tissues. The sequences of the PCR products showed that Dub-1A is expressed in brain, heart, lung, kidney, ovary, spleen, and B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the expression of Dub-1A in B-lymphocytes was IL-3-dependent. Therefore, we next analyzed the minimal concentration of IL-3 required for Dub-1A to be expressed. After the depletion of IL-3 for 8 h, cells were cultured with different concentrations of IL-3. Dub-1A was not expressed until 10 pm IL-3 or higher was added to the culture medium (Fig. 3C). Dub-1A was constitutively expressed in CTLL-2 cells, indicating that the IL-2 cytokine is not required for the expression of Dub-1A in CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 3D). Because Dub subfamily members are immediate-early genes, we tested whether Dub-1A is expressed very rapidly in response to cytokine stimulation. Fig. 3D shows that Dub-1A was expressed within 30 min and was maximally expressed in 2 h. This is similar to the expression pattern of other Dub subfamily members, including Dub-1 and Dub-2. After 2 h, the expression of Dub-1A slowly decreased and disappeared after 10 h. Dub-1A Encodes a Functional Deubiquitinating Enzyme—To determine whether DUB-1A has deubiquitinating enzyme activity, we examined the ability of DUB-1A to cleave ubiquitin from polyubiquitin chains conjugated with proteins via isopeptide bonds under in vivo conditions. HA-tagged ubiquitin was transiently expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells with and without Myc-tagged Dub-1A and its mutant form (Dub-1A(C60S)), followed by immunoblot analysis of the cell extracts using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4A). The expression of Dub-1A almost completely deubiquitinated polyubiquitinated protein targets in the cells (Fig. 4A, lane 5). However, deubiquitination was hardly seen in cells expressing Dub-1A(C60S) (lane 6), in which the cysteine was replaced in the catalytic triad with serine. In addition, we expressed DUB-1A as a GST fusion protein to determine whether DUB-1A has deubiquitinating enzyme activity. Immunoblot assays showed that the cDNA clone encoding the GST-DUB-1A fusion protein resulted in cleavage of Ub-Methionine-β-galactosidase (Fig. 4B, lane 2) to an extent comparable with that observed with GST-DUB-1 (lane 4), GST-DUB-2 (lane 6), and GST-DUB-2A (lane 8). As a control, cells transformed with the pGEX vector failed to cleave Ub-Methionine-β-galactosidase (lane 1). A mutant form of the DUB-1A polypeptide containing a C60S mutation was unable to cleave the Ub-Methionine-β-galactosidase substrate (lane 3). These results demonstrate that DUB-1A has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and that cysteine at position 60 is essential for its thiol protease activity, as shown for other DUB subfamily members (2.Zhu Y.

To confirm that DUB-1A has isopeptidase activity, the effect of ubiquitin aldehyde, a specific inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes, on the deubiquitinating activity of DUB-1A was investigated. In the presence of ubiquitin aldehyde, DUB-1A proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were not capable of hydrolyzing the ubiquitin from branched polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 4C), suggesting that DUB-1A has isopeptidase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2040723131,"Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are soluble proteins that have highly restricted tissue distribution. Although not fully understood, a role of SFRP1 in the regulation of apoptosis has been suggested. Our previous study disclosed a much greater level of SFRP1 expression in periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs), which have been suggested to maintain a reduced level of apoptosis compared with gingival fibroblasts. We have tested the role of SFRP1 in the regulation of fibroblast apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that SFRP1 was significantly up-regulated in cultured human PDLFs during ceramide-induced apoptosis. In vivo study demonstrated an increased SFRP1 expression in mice periodontal ligament during force-induced apoptosis. While inhibition of endogenous SFRP1 increased the percentage of cell death in cultured human PDLFs, exogenous SFRP1 substantially reduced apoptosis in cultured human gingival fibroblasts, which do not maintain a high level of endogenous SFRP1 expression. The effect of SFRP1 on apoptosis was linked to the regulation of several apoptosis-related genes, including p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and BCL-2-interacting killer (BIK). Furthermore our results indicated that the addition of exogenous SFRP1 could reduce the level of apoptosis in dermal fibroblasts in vivo, and this effect was also linked to the regulation of similar apoptosis-related genes as observed in in vitro studies. Collectively our results suggest that the constitutive up-regulation of SFRP1 could be an adaptive cell survival mechanism inherent to functionally specialized fibroblasts, and the addition of SFRP1 may contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis in fibroblast-related cells.

Studies have indicated that SFRPs are capable of binding to Wnts and frizzled (Fz) receptors to interfere with Wnt signaling, which plays a major role in cell fate determination through the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (12.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Distinctive members of the SFRP family exhibit different expression patterns in vivo, suggesting their ability to modulate diverse aspects of Wnt signaling (13.Bradley L. Sun B. Collins-Racie L.

Although the details are far from clear, a prominent role for SFRP1 in the regulation of apoptosis has been suggested (16.Melkonyan H.S. Chang W.C. Shapiro J.P. Mahadevappa M. Fitzpatrick P.A.

Wild-Bode C. Platten M. Grimmel C. Melkonyan H.S. Dichgans J. Weller M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4210-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and contributes to the development of uterine leiomyomas through an antiapoptotic effect (18.Fukuhara K. Kariya M. Kita M.

It was also suggested that SFRP1 may have proangiogenic effects and appears to protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from apoptosis in vitro (19.Dufourcq P. Couffinhal T. Ezan J. Barandon L. Moreau C. Daret D. Duplaa C. Circulation. 2002; 106: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore expression of SFRP1 has been shown to cause spontaneous adipocyte differentiation (20.Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N. Johnson K.W. Harrison S.D. MacDougald O.A. J.

However, there are also studies suggesting a proapoptotic effect of SFRP1 in breast adenocarcinoma cells (16.Melkonyan H.S. Chang W.C. Shapiro J.P. Mahadevappa M. Fitzpatrick P.A. Kiefer M.C. Tomei L.D. Umansky S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13636-13641Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells (22.Imai K. D'Armiento J. Chest. 2002; 121: 7SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leaves the molecular mechanism responsible for the modulation of Wnt signaling and regulation of apoptosis by SFRP1 open to speculation. Indeed SFRP1 has been shown to be a biphasic modulator of Wnt-induced effects at different concentrations (10.Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S.

The tooth-supporting structure called periodontium is an excellent model to study fibroblastic cells given that all stages of fibroblast differentiation can be observed in close vicinity. These structures comprise a periodontal ligament responsible for tooth anchoring, tissue regeneration, and homeostasis (23.Phipps R.P. Borrello M.A. Blieden T.M. J. Periodontal Res. 1997; 32: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24.Lekic P. McCulloch C.A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and gingival tissues responsible for mounting the appropriate inflammatory process in the event of microbial challenge (25.Dahan M.

Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1997; 8: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our recent studies of fibroblast apoptosis in periodontal ligament and gingival tissues indicate that the periodontium is an excellent model system to study the mechanistic control of apoptosis in fibroblastic cells (27.Han X. Amar S. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A similar model has been used by others to study cell death and mechanoprotection by filamin A in connective tissues after challenge by applied tensile forces (28.Kainulainen T. Pender A.

Since periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) are considered to exhibit more specialized functions for repair and regeneration of the adjacent alveolar bone and cementum (29.Sculean A. Donos N.

Rec. 1996; 245: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31.Howard P.S. Kucich U. Taliwal R. Korostoff J.M. J. Periodontal Res. 1998; 33: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we postulated that these cells are likely to exhibit a reduced level of apoptosis compared with gingival fibroblasts (GFs). Indeed our recent study has demonstrated a significantly lower apoptotic rate in PDLFs compared with GFs (27.Han X. Amar S. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, many questions remain unanswered regarding the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the protection of PDLFs against cell apoptosis. More specifically our data revealed a significantly higher level of SFRP1 expression in PDLFs when compared with GFs (32.Han X. Amar S. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of SFRP1 in the regulation of apoptosis in fibroblasts remains to be established. Given the significant differential expression of SFRP1 in PDLFs compared with GFs, the aim of the present study was to comprehensively address the role of SFRP1 in the regulation of apoptosis in fibroblastic cell populations and determine the significance of its effect on apoptosis. Materials—Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) and C2-dihydroceramide (d-erythro-N-acetylsphinganine) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Recombinant human SFRP1 was a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rubin from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Rabbit anti-human/mouse SFRP1 antibody, rabbit anti-mouse caspase-9 antibody, rabbit anti-mouse BAX antibody, goat anti-mouse p53 antibody, goat anti-human/mouse actin antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, and Western blotting luminol reagent were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Diaminobenzidine substrate was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Cell Culture—Human PDLFs and GFs cells were obtained, cultured, and validated as described previously (32.Han X. Amar S. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All the procedures were performed with appropriate informed consents and were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University. In brief, small pieces of gingival and periodontal ligament tissues were plated and cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. When confluent, the cells surrounding the explants were subcultured and maintained under the same conditions. Cells collected between the fourth and eighth passages were used for all experiments. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—Total RNA was isolated from cultured human PDLFs and GFs with RNeasy isolation columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the standard protocol. For the RT-PCR, 0.2 μg of total RNA was used as template for reverse transcription, and PCR was performed for 25 cycles within the linear range of amplification. For the RPA, probe synthesis and RNA hybridization were carried out by using the RiboQuant RPA system (Pharmingen). Briefly RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Labeled riboprobes were hybridized to target RNAs (20 μg/assay in all experiments) at 56 °C overnight followed by RNase A/T1 digestion at 30 °C for 45 min. Protected fragments were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive signals were recorded and quantified with a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—Protein contents in cultured human PDLFs and GFs were obtained as described previously (33.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). For secreted proteins, spent medium was concentrated, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated as described previously (34.Le H.T. Schaldach C.M. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21136-21145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For the protein extraction from mice tissues, deep-frozen sample (100 mg each) was crushed in liquid nitrogen and then solubilized with sonication in 1 ml of lysis buffer (3% SDS, 68.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered, and the protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of proteins (10 μg each) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary antibodies were added in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and were developed using the ECL system. For the detection of SFRP1 in vivo, frozen tissue sections were first fixed in acetone for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was further achieved by microwave heating with sections bathed in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were blocked for 1 h with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 and then incubated with the anti-SFRP1 antibody for 2 h. The sections were treated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and the slides were developed with diaminobenzidine substrate followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Induction of Apoptosis and Administration of SFRP1—Cells were grown in 6-well culture dishes until they reached 60-70% confluence in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in low serum (1% fetal bovine serum) DMEM. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of C2-ceramide (Cer). C2-dihydroceramide was used as a negative control. To test the effects of exogenous SFRP1 on cell apoptosis, human recombinant SFRP1 protein was added to the cell cultures 1 h after the addition of Cer. As a control, the same concentration of BSA was added to the cultures instead of SFRP1 protein. To test the effects of endogenous SFRP1, the expression of SFRP1 was knocked down by RNA interference for 24 h before Cer-induced apoptosis. In brief, the synthesis and purification of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for SFRP1 were performed using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting double-stranded siRNA (10 nm) was transfected into the cultured cells using siPORT amine transfection agent (Ambion). The sequences of the 21-mer siRNA oligonucleotides are 5′-AACTTCTTGGGGACAATCTTC-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGATTGTCCCCAAGAAG-3′. Detection of Cell Viability and DNA Fragmentation—Equal numbers of cultured cells were collected, transferred into 96-well microtiter plates, and cultured for 24 h. After different treatments, 20 μl of CellTiter 96 solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added into each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 h under the culture conditions. Colored MTS products in the supernatant were then determined on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 490 nm. To assess apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation was determined by cellular DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both attached cells and detached cells floating in the medium were collected by scraping and centrifuging. The BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments in cytosolic fractions were quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 450 nm. Caspase-3 Measurement—After different treatments, caspase-3 in cytosolic fractions was quantified by an ApoAlert caspase-3 colorimetric system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The colorimetric assay uses the spectrophotometric detection of the chromophore p-nitroaniline (pNA) after its cleavage by caspase-3 from the labeled caspase-specific substrate (DEVD-pNA). Briefly cells or tissues were suspended in chilled cell lysis buffer provided in the assay kits. After centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and DEVD-pNA substrate was added for the detection of caspase-3 activity at 405 nm. For each assay, a standard curve with free pNA was generated, and the measured absorbance based on replicates demonstrated an average of less than 5% variance. Apoptotic Gene Expression by cDNA Array—Cells were cultured as described above, and total RNA was isolated after different treatments. Two test groups were included: 1) cells undergoing Cer-induced apoptosis in the presence of exogenous SFRP1 (10 μg/ml) and 2) cells undergoing Cer-induced apoptosis pretreated with siRNA (10 nm) to knock down endogenous SFRP1 expression. Cells treated only with Cer (20 μm) were used as control. Five micrograms of RNA was used in each reverse transcription step, and labeled cDNA was hybridized at 68 °C for 16 h with nylon membranes for human apoptosis gene array (Super Array, Frederick, MD). The signals were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, and the ratios of test and control were expressed as -fold increase or decrease. A minimum of 2-fold change between test and control was considered significant. Evaluation of SFRP1 Expression in Force-induced Cell Death—An experimental model of tooth movement was used to study the biological relevance of SFRP1 expression during force-induced apoptosis in periodontal ligament. Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (20-25 g) were divided into four groups, each containing five animals. The first group served as base-line controls, which did not receive any treatment and were used as day 0 specimens. The other three groups were experimental groups in which an elastic rubber band (3/16-inch diameter) was placed between the left first and second molars of the maxilla. Three time intervals (one per group) were used for tissue collection: 12 h, 1 day, and 2 days. All animal procedures and manipulations were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston University. For the collection of tissues after treatments, mice were sacrificed with an overdose of ethyl ether anesthesia, and their tissues were fixed by intracardiac perfusion with a mixture of 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). The dissected maxillae were decalcified in 10% EDTA solution. Maxilla tissues were cut in half along the palatal suture and then embedded using HistoPrep (Fisher Scientific). Serial mesiodistal sections (7 μm) parallel to the long axis of the teeth were made by cryostat sectioning. Histological examination was focused on the inter-radicular septum of the second molars. In Situ Detection of Apoptosis—The assessment of apoptosis in vivo was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each section, the areas containing the cells were quantified using Image-Pro Plus Version 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Only spindle-shaped cells were counted at 400× magnification and the number of TUNEL-positive cells/mm2 was obtained. Effect of SFRP1 during Dermal Fibroblast Apoptosis in Vivo—Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were used for a calvarial injection model to test the effect of SFRP1 on dermal fibroblast apoptosis in vivo. Briefly the injections were administered subcutaneously with a 30.5-gauge needle at a point on the midline of the skull located between the ears and eyes. The injection volume and concentration of the Cer were established by preliminary experiments. The control group only received a 50-μl Cer (100 μm) injection. The experimental groups were injected first with 25 μl of Cer (200 μm); this was immediately followed by a same-site injection (25 μl/mice) of 5 μg/ml BSA or recombinant SFRP1 protein at a concentration of 5 or 20 μg/ml. Twenty-four hours after each treatment, mice were sacrificed, and the calvarial bone together with the overlying skin tissue was dissected in half. One-half of the tissue was used for histochemical analysis, and the processing of tissues was as described previously (35.Li L. Khansari A. Shapira L. Graves D.T. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3915-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The other half of the tissue was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for subsequent protein assays. Statistical Analysis—For quantitative studies, means and S.D. were computed. Two sample comparisons were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Level of SFRP1 Expression in PDLFs—We analyzed the expression of SFRP1 in cultured human PDLFs and GFs at both the RNA and protein level. RT-PCR revealed significantly higher levels of SFRP1 transcripts (∼18-fold) in PDLFs than in GFs at two different passages (Fig. 1A). The levels of SFRP1 transcripts were also determined by RPA, confirming a similarly high level of SFRP1 expression (∼13.1-fold) in PDLFs compared with GFs (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with our previous data on the investigation of gene expression patterns between cultured human PDLFs and GFs (32.Han X. Amar S. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As measured by Western blot, the cytosolic protein level of SFRP1 was also much higher in PDLFs than in GFs (Fig. 1C). However, the secreted SFRP1 in the medium was not detectable in either PDLFs or GFs (data not shown). These results suggest that SFRP1 accumulates intracellularly in PDLFs but is not secreted under normal conditions. Expression of SFRP1 during Cer-induced Apoptosis—Studies have shown that sphingolipids such as ceramide are important mediators of apoptosis and growth arrest (36.Jelaska A. Korn J.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37.Yang J. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27129-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that both PDLFs and GFs undergo apoptosis after Cer exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner (see supplemental data). Based on that, we elected to use Cer-induced apoptosis as a model to study the role of SFRP1. We have measured the mRNA levels of SFRP1 in cultured PDLFs and GFs after Cer-induced apoptosis at different time points by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). A significant increase of SFRP1 mRNA was observed in PDLFs after apoptotic induction. It peaked at 24 h and remained at a high level 48 h postapoptotic induction. However, the mRNA level of SFRP1 in GFs was undetectable in unchallenged cells. It showed a small increase at 6 h followed by a gradual decrease, reaching an undetectable level again 48 h postapoptotic induction. Protein levels of cytosolic and secreted SFRP1 in cultured PDLFs and GFs were also determined by Western blot (Fig. 2B). The results showed a significant increase of both cytosolic and secreted SFRP1 in PDLFs after Cer-induced apoptosis. This increase was first detected in the cytosolic compartment and observed later in the medium, and both cytosolic and secreted SFRP1 remained elevated 48 h postapoptotic induction. This demonstrates that SFRP1 first accumulates intracellularly and then is secreted extracellularly after Cer-induced apoptosis. However, GFs showed a minimal level of cytosolic SFRP1 in unchallenged cells and a small and short-lived increase of cytosolic SFRP1 after Cer treatment. The secreted SFRP1 protein was barely detectable in GFs throughout the indicated times. Expression of SFRP1 during Force-induced Apoptosis—Studies have shown that periodontal ligament cells undergo apoptosis in the early phase of orthodontic tooth movement (38.Hatai T. Yokozeki M. Funato N. Baba Y. Moriyama K. Ichijo H. Kuroda T. Oral Dis. 2001; 7: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39.Rana M.W. Pothisiri V. Killiany D.M. Xu X.M. Am. J. Orthod. Dentofacial Orthop. 2001; 119: 516-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To assess the biological relevance between SFRP1 expression and the onset of apoptosis, we generated an experimental mouse model using force-induced tooth movement and the subsequent apoptosis of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3A, the apoptotic cells were hardly detectable in periodontal ligament before force application (1.7 ± 0.33 cells/mm2). The number of TUNEL-positive fibroblasts gradually increased in the periodontal ligament 12 h after the application of mechanical stress (7.4 ± 2.48 cells/mm2), sharply raised at 24 h (101.7 ± 25.2/mm2), and peaked at 2 days (124.6 ± 22.9 cells/mm2).

MEKs activate their downstream MAPK by phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine in the T- X-Y motif. MEK5 is the upstream BMK1 kinase and exists as naturally occurring splice variants, MEK5α and MEK5β. The full-length MEK5 (MEK5α) is 89 amino acids longer than MEK5β at the N terminus, but the precise functional difference between the two splice variants is not known. Dual phosphorylation site mutation of MEK5α (Ser-311 → Asp and Thr- 315 → Asp; MEK5α(S311D/T315D)) activated BMK1, but the corresponding dual phosphorylation sites mutant of MEK5β could not induce BMK1 kinase activation or nuclear translocation. Furthermore, MEK5β inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced BMK1 activation and MEK5α(S311D/T315D)-induced MEF2 transcriptional activity. Both MEK5α and MEK5β individually co-immunoprecipitated with BMK1, but the presence of MEK5β prevented association of MEK5α with BMK1 suggesting a mechanistic basis for the dominant-negative behavior of MEK5β on BMK1 activation. The ratio of MEK5α to MEK5β expression was higher in cancer cell lines, and overexpression of MEK5β-inhibited serum-induced DNA synthesis. These data suggest that alternative splicing of MEK5α and MEK5β may play a critical role in BMK1 activation and subsequent cell proliferation.

Big mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BMK1/ERK5, big map kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase 5; MEK5, MAP kinase kinase 5; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEF2C, myocyte elongation factor 2C; CA, constitutively active; OPR, octicosapeptide; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NGS, normal goat serum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PKC, protein kinase C. kinase 1/extracellular-regulated kinase 5 (BMK1/ERK5) is a member of the MAP kinase family that is activated by redox and hyperosmotic stress, growth factors, and pathways involving certain G-protein-coupled receptors (1.Gutkind, J. S. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/40/re1Google Scholar). Like other MAP kinase family members, BMK1 plays a significant role in cell growth and differentiation, although emerging evidence suggests unique functional characteristics. Redox activation of BMK1 exhibits an anti-apoptotic effect (2.Suzaki Y. Yoshizumi M. Kagami S. Koyama A.H. Taketani Y. Houchi H. Tsuchiya K. Takeda E. Tamaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9614-9621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and BMK1 knock-out mice have impaired cardiac and vascular development (3.Regan C.P. Li W. Boucher D.M. Spatz S. Su M.S. Kuida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9248-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, BMK1 is intimately involved in angiogenesis (4.Sohn S.J. Sarvis B.K. Cado D. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43344-43351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and cell cycle progression (5.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and appears to be constitutively activated in breast carcinoma cells (6.Esparis-Ogando A. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Crespo P. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, suppressing BMK1 activation emerges as one potential means to control cell growth. Since MEK5 is the only identified immediate upstream MAPK kinase in the BMK1 signaling pathway (7.Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), understanding MEK5 regulation is equally important. Pharmacological agents, which prevent MEK5 activation (8.Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), block smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis (9.Luo H. Reidy M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and dominant-negative MEK5 blocks serum-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation (10.Zhao M. Liu Y. Bao M. Kato Y. Han J. Eaton J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 400: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), implicating BMK1 activation in vascular cell growth. MEK5 was originally cloned as splice variants MEK5α and MEK5β; both variants have distinct tissue-wide distribution and cellular localization (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MEK5β protein expression is greater than MEK5α in terminally differentiated tissues, whereas MEK5α expression is greater in mitotically active tissues such as the liver (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MEK5α directly stimulates BMK1 kinase activity (12.Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but comparable data for MEK5β are presently lacking. Furthermore, since a transgenic mouse expressing a cardiac-specific constitutively active MEK5α2 exhibited an unexpectedly different phenotype from the earlier reported constitutively active MEK5β transgenic mouse (13.Nicol R.L. Frey N. Pearson G. Cobb M. Richardson J. Olson E.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we investigated for possible differences in MEK5α and MEKβ activation of BMK1. In the present study we demonstrate that MEK5α, but not MEK5β, activates BMK1. In addition to being enzyme-dead, MEK5β acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of BMK1 activation perhaps by preventing MEK5α-BMK1 association. MEK5α expression was greater than MEK5β in cancer cell lines and MEK5β expression could only be detected in growth-arrested but not actively growing breast cancer cells. Finally, ectopic MEK5β expression inhibited the growth of breast carcinoma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MEK5β may be a naturally occurring dominant-negative splice variant protein that prevents excessive BMK1 activation and aberrant cell growth in vivo. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The total plasmid amount was adjusted to 1.5 μg/dish for single plasmid transfections or 3.0 μg/dish for co-transfections with multiple plasmids, with a blank pCI/neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI) used where appropriate. Experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection. COS7 (from ATCC), MCF7, DU145, and T47D cell lines were provided by Dr. Chawnshang Chang (University of Rochester). Molecular Reagents—Mammalian expression plasmids with an Xpress-tagged rat MEK5α (MEK5αAA: Ser-311 → Ala, Thr-315 → Ala) were kindly provided by Dr. Chen Yan (University of Rochester). MEK5α-wt was created through reversion of the MEK5αAA back to the wild type residues. MEK5α constitutively active (CA-MEK5α: Ser-311 → Asp, Thr-315 → Asp), MEK5β constitutively active (CA-MEK5β: Ser-222 → Asp, Thr-226 → Asp), CA-MEK5αΔ1 (deletion of residues 57-83), and CA-MEK5αΔ2 (deletion of residues 1-50) were created by overlap extension PCR based site-directed-mutagenesis (14.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar), and all PCR-derived regions of the constructs were sequenced. All constructs were subcloned into the pCI/neo eukaryotic expression vector with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag reporters and immunofluorescence or Western blot using anti-epitope tag antibodies confirmed successful expression of all constructs. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6). 10-60 μg of protein was loaded per well and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After overnight transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocking in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 3% bovine serum albumin (room temperature for 1 h), the membrane was probed with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin, TBS-T (room temperature for 2 h). After washing three times with TBS-T and secondary antibody exposure (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000, Bio-Rad) or anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in 5% milk/TBS-T, (room temperature for 1 h), the membrane was reacted with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an image obtained by exposing an x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation—Fifty μl of 1:1 mixture of protein G-agarose and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) was incubated with 2 μg of the primary antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. This complex was washed three times with PNPP (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton) buffer to remove unbound antibody. Cells grown to 80% confluence on a 10-cm dish were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, triturated 10 times through a 22-gauge needle, and centrifuged at maximum speed (Eppendorf-Brinkmann, Wesbury, NY) at 4 °C for 20 min. 300 μl of the resulting supernatant was added to the antibody-agarose complex and rocked at 4 °C for 24 h in a total volume of 1 ml in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). After immunoprecipitation, the slurry was centrifuged and washed three times with the above buffer. In Vitro Kinase Assays—HEK293 cells grown in a 10-cm plate were transiently transfected using 8 μg of plasmid per plate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until harvested for an experiment to minimize spurious BMK1 activation. Whole cells lysates were harvested as described above and immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-BMK1 antibody (15.Cameron S.J. Malik S. Akaike M. Lee J.D. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Yan C. Abe J.I. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18682-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This complex was washed, twice each, in cell harvestation buffer described above, LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). After the final wash and pelleting, the BMK1 substrate GST-MEF2C (activation domain, 3 μg) conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose was added with the kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 25 μm cold ATP, 1 μl if 6000 Ci·mmol [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 20 μl. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C with agitation and stopped by the addition of 1× gel loading buffer. Samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred overnight at room temperature to nitrocellulose membranes, and then exposed to an x-ray film between two enhancer filters for 3-6 h. Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were plated on glass coverslips, cells were washed with PBS twice, fixed for 20 min with gentle rocking in 5% glacial acetic acid/95% methanol at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (NGS/PBST) for 20 min at room temperature. Primary antibody (1:500 dilution) in 2% NGS/PBST was incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation with subsequent washes in 2% NGS/PBST. Secondary antibody was applied (anti-rabbit Alexa 594, 1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 2% NGS/PBST for 1 h, room temperature. Following washing three times in PBS, images were captured under a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescent microscope. Gene Transcriptional Activity Reporter Assays—BMK1-induced MEF2C transactivation was conducted as previously described (16.Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using a Dual Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega, Madison) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assays—MCF7 cells were plated onto 24 well plates (1 × 104/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and transfected with MEK5β plasmid or the blank vector (pCI/neo). The following day, the cells were serum-deprived for 24 h for growth arrest. To reinitiate cell growth, 2% FBS was added, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h. Cells were metabolically labeled with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h, washed with ice-cold PBS three times, and fixed in ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%) for 20 min on ice. The trichloroacetic acid was removed, and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS once and lysed with 0.6 ml of 0.5 m NaOH for 20 min at room temperature. A volume of 10 ml of universal scintallant (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA) was aliquoted into a scintillation vial, and the soluble material from the culture dish was added. The liquid scintillation counter was initiated (LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter, Beckman Coulter) and the cell growth rates in triplicate, reflected by [methyl-3H]-thymidine uptake, were reported in arbitrary units. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with the StatView 4.0 package (ABACUS Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Differences were analyzed by the Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered appropriate for rejecting the null hypothesis. Subcellular Localization of MEK5α and MEK5β—We created C-terminal GFP fusion constructs of MEK5α and MEK5β and transiently transfected HEK293 cells. MEK5α-GFP appeared to localize mostly in the cytosol as puncta consistent with the earlier report by English et al. (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, there was no obvious difference in the fluorescence pattern and thus cellular compartmentalization for MEK5β-GFP (Fig. 1, A and B). Cells expressing GFP (lanes 2 and 7), MEK5α-GFP (lanes 3 and 8), MEK5β-GFP (lanes 4 and 9), and TREK-GFP, a transmembrane potassium channel protein (lanes 5 and 10), were fractionated as Nonidet P-40-soluble supernatants and Nonidet P-40-insoluble extracts, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western analysis to most accurately assess subcellular distribution (Fig. 1C). GFP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are cytosolic markers, and TREK-GFP served as a control membrane-targeted protein to confirm correct fractionation of cytosolic and membrane components. MEK5α-GFP and MEK5β-GFP distributed both in the Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions. MEK5α(S311D/T315D), but Not MEK5β(S222D/T226D), Activates BMK1 Kinase Activation and Nuclear Translocation—MEK5α and MEK5β share the same serine and threonine dual phosphorylation sites (Ser-311 and Thr-315 for MEK5α and Ser-222 and Thr-226 for MEK5β) critical for activation through phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. The above residues were replaced by aspartate to create “constitutively activated mutants” of MEK5α (17.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and MEK5β (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged constructs of dual phosphorylation site mutants of MEK5α(S311D/T315D) and for MEK5β(S222D/T226D) were co-transfected with Xpress-tagged BMK1 into HEK293 cells. An in vitro kinase assay was performed with immunoprecipitated BMK1 to assess BMK1 activation by both BMK1 autophosphorylation and MEF2C phosphorylation. MEK5α(S311D/T315D) induced BMK1 autophosphorylation and MEF2C phosphorylation, while MEK5β(S222D/T226D) could not activate BMK1 by both assays (Fig. 2). The same results were obtained when the kinase activity of endogenous BMK1 was assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-BMK1 antibody (data not shown). Since BMK1 translocates to the nucleus upon kinase activation (17.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18.Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we examined whether dual phosphorylation site mutants of MEK5α(S311D/T315D) or MEK5β(S222D/T226D) translocates BMK1 to the nucleus. CA-MEK5α-EGFP and CA-MEK5β-EGFP were individually co-transfected with Xpress-tagged BMK1 and the cellular distribution of BMK1 examined with anti-Xpress antibody immunoreactivity. Control cells were transfected with the EGFP and Xpress-tagged BMK1 plasmids. Fig. 3 shows anti-Xpress immunoreactivity in MEK5α(S311D/T315D)-EGFP (top), MEK5β(S222D/T226D)-EGFP (middle), and control cells (bottom) with the corresponding images of the nucleus on the right column. MEK5α(S311D/T315D)-EGFP transfected cells identified by the EGFP fluorescence demonstrated nuclear as well as cytosolic distribution of BMK1. With MEK5β(S222D/T226D)-EGFP transfected, BMK1 was largely cytosolic and indistinguishable from the control cells consistent with a cellular distribution of basally active BMK1 (17.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Only the dual phosphorylation site mutant of MEK5α, but not MEK5β, can activate BMK1 resulting in nuclear translocation suggesting the critical role of N-terminal region of MEK5α in the downstream activation of BMK1. The N Terminus of MEK5α Is Critical to the Regulation of BMK1 Kinase Activity—A BLAST search of the unique N-terminal 89 residues in MEK5α revealed the presence of a conserved motif present in atypical PKC, cdc24, Par6B, and Par6C. Interestingly, atypical PKC binding to MEK5α was found to be important for MEK5α kinase activity and its subsequent ability to activate BMK1 (28.Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Another commonality among these proteins is the existence of a putative octicosapeptide repeat (OPR) (amino acids 57-83) or the Phox and Bem1P (PB1) domain (amino acids 12-85), although the exact function of the OPR repeat or PB1 domain in proteins is not well defined (19.Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We deleted the OPR region in MEK5α, spanning amino acid residues 57 and 83, MEK5α(S311D/T315D)Δ57-83, and constructed an N-terminal deletion of non-OPR residues of 1-50, MEK5α(S311D/T315D)Δ1-50, and found that both deletion mutants did not activate BMK1 (Fig. 4). Similar expression levels of both N-terminal MEK5α(S311D/T315D) deletion mutants as well as the wild type MEK5α was confirmed by immunoblotting for the EGFP epitope tag. These data suggest that the entire N-terminal 89 amino acids, including the OPR repeat region, present in MEK5α and lacking in MEK5β is required for BMK1 activation. MEK5β Suppresses BMK1 Activation in Vivo—The splice variant ERK5b is shorter than the full-length ERK5 at the N terminus. This truncated splice variant of ERK5 without the ATP binding site is kinase-dead and appears to act as a dominant-negative protein for the MEK5/BMK1 pathway (16.Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since we did not observe any significant BMK1 activation by MEK5β(S222D/T226D), we hypothesized that MEK5β could potentially act as another naturally occurring dominant-negative protein in the BMK1 signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGF activates endogenous BMK1 kinase activity detected by in vitro kinase assay with MEF2C as the substrate. Overexpression of wild type MEK5α has no additional effect on EGF-induced BMK1 activation. In contrast, we found that overexpression of wild type MEK5β significantly inhibited EGF-induced BMK1 activation. Similar results were obtained demonstrating wild type MEK5β inhibition of H2O2-induced BMK1 activation (data not shown). Furthermore, we investigated the role of wild type MEK5β in MEK5α(S311D/T315D)-induced MEF2 transcriptional activity. We found that MEK5α(S311D/T315D) induced MEF2 transcriptional activity, and co-transfection of wild type MEK5β significantly inhibited MEF2 activation (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that wild type MEK5β not only fails to induce BMK1 kinase activity but rather acts as a dominant-negative regulator of the MEK5α/BMK1/MEF2C pathway. MEK5β Disrupts the Association of MEK5α and BMK1—Since only MEK5α activates BMK1 and MEK5β inhibits this activation, we hypothesized that MEK5β may inhibit BMK1 and MEK5α interaction required for subsequent signaling. We examined for MEK5α/β and BMK1 association with co-immunoprecipitation studies using Xpress-tagged BMK1 and EGFP-tagged MEK5α or HA-tagged MEK5β. MEK5α and MEK5β individually associate with BMK1, and H2O2 decreased these associations (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, MEK5α co-immunoprecipitated with BMK1, but co-transfection with MEK5β significantly inhibited this MEK5α and BMK1 association. In contrast, the reciprocal inhibition of MEK5β association with BMK1 by MEK5α was not observed (Fig. 6C, left two lanes); however, selective BMK1 activation by MEK5α(S311D/T315D) transfection inhibited the MEK5β-BMK1 association (Fig. 6C, right two lanes). The results were identical when the epitope tags were reversed with MEK5α-HA and MEK5β-EGFP (data not shown). These observations suggest that MEK5β competes with MEK5α for BMK1 protein-protein interaction and inhibits MEK5α-induced BMK1 activation. MEK5α and MEK5β Expression in Normal and Cancerous Cell Lines—The emerging role of BMK1 appears to be in regulating cell growth (17.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), with a potential role in cancer (20.Weldon C.B. Scandurro A.B. Rolfe K.W. Clayton J.L. Elliott S. Butler N.N. Melnik L.I.

Thilak L. Robson C.N. Neal D.E. Leung H.Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since MEK5β acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of MEK5α-induced BMK1 activation, we examined whether there is a cell line- and cell growth-dependent expression of the MEK5 splice variants. We probed for endogenous MEK5α and MEK5β expression in three different cancer cell lines using a polyclonal anti-MEK5 antibody in which the antibody epitope is common to both MEK5 variants (Fig. 7A). A prostate and two breast cancer cell lines examined expressed ∼4-5-fold greater MEK5α protein than the well characterized transformed cell lines, COS7 (Fig. 7B) or HEK293 (not shown). MCF7 cells were included in this study since these cells are of breast cancer origin and were reported to require BMK1 activity to drive cells through the cell cycle (5.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 6.Esparis-Ogando A. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Crespo P. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Stimulation of MCF7 cells with serum to initiate growth demonstrated that MEK5α protein expression was unchanged over 1 day (Fig. 7C). Minimal MEK5β protein expression was detected in MCF7 cells only when they were growth-arrested in the serum-free condition. Last, MEK5β overexpression in MCF7 cells reduced the growth rate accelerating effect of serum stimulation examined by a measurement of DNA synthesis (Fig. 7D). Taken together, the regulation of MEK5α and MEK5β expression ratio may be critical for BMK1 activation and could determine the growth phenotype of the cells. Through alternative splicing, MEK5 exists as a 50-kDa protein (MEK5α) and a shorter 40-kDa protein (MEK5β) (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

To date, BMK1 is the only kinase that is reported to be downstream of MEK5, so we undertook a study to assess any differences in how the MEK5 splice variant activates BMK1. A thorough kinetic study recently confirmed that MEK5α initiates and sustains BMK1 activation in vitro and in vivo (12.Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, their expression of the wild type MEK5α protein required deleting N terminus 11 amino acids of MEK5α(S311D/T315D) and noted that the N-truncated MEK5α(S311D/T315D) only exhibited weak activation of BMK1. These observations are consistent with our data that the entire N terminus 89 amino acids in MEK5α are essential for BMK1 activation. English et al. (11.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported that the dual phosphorylation site mutant of MEK5β(S222D/T226D) showed little kinase activity and stated “the activity of these mutant proteins assayed with MBP was no greater than that of the wild type proteins.” In the present study, we found that MEK5α activates BMK1 and report the novel conclusion that MEK5β is not only unable to activate BMK1 kinase but acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of BMK1 activation by EGF, H2O2, and MEK5α(S311D/T315D). Published data on the role of MEK5/BMK1 activation using different MEK5 isoforms, in particular the MEK5β(S222D/T226D) as an constitutively active form of MEK5, may require reinterpretation. The PB1 domain is present in many eukaryotic cytoplasmic signaling proteins (19.Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A Swiss-Prot search of the protein shows that this domain adopts a β-grasp fold, similar to that found in ubiquitin and Ras-binding domains. A motif, variously termed OPR, Phox/Cdc motif, and atypical PKC interaction domain, represents the most conserved region of the majority of PB1 domains, and represents the minimal domain necessary for PB1 domain function which includes the formation of PB1 domain heterodimers, and association with other molecules such as atypical PKC (29.Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is possible that binding of another molecule such as atypical PKC to this motif may be necessary for MEK5 activation of BMK1. However, our data suggest that the minimal OPR domain in MEK5 is insufficient for the activation of BMK1. The exact role of the N-terminal residues of MEK5α in the activation of BMK1 requires further investigation. BMK1 is potently activated by growth factors and by redox stress (5.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 30.Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol.

Yoshizumi M. Kagami S. Koyama A.H. Taketani Y. Houchi H. Tsuchiya K. Takeda E. Tamaki T. J. Biol.

MEK5 gene expression was increased 22-fold in apoptosis-resistant breast carcinoma MCF7 cells, although this microarray study could not resolve which MEK5 splice variant was up-regulated (20.Weldon C.B. Scandurro A.B. Rolfe K.W. Clayton J.L. Elliott S. Butler N.N. Melnik L.I. Alam J. McLachlan J.A. Jaffe B.M. Beckman B.S. Burow M.E. Surgery. 2002; 132: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, using an antibody that recognizes an epitope distinct within the N terminus of MEK5α but lacking in MEK5β, MEK5 protein overexpression was noted in human prostate cancer; the presence of presumably MEK5α isoform correlated with a poor clinical outcome (21.Mehta P.B. Jenkins B.L. McCarthy L. Thilak L. Robson C.N. Neal D.E. Leung H.Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our studies corroborate this report, since MEK5α protein expression was 4-5-fold higher in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line compared with the well characterized transformed cell lines. In addition, MEK5α protein expression was similarly 4-5-fold higher in two different breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D. Thus, MEK5α emerges as a possible endogenous upstream splice variant that activates BMK1 to drive cancer cells through the cell cycle. The dominant-negative property exhibited by MEK5β echoes a previous report that the N-terminal BMK1 splice variant, ERK5b, operates as a dominant-negative protein to the full-length ERK5a (16.Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether splice variant regulation of protein kinase activation at different levels within the MAPK cascade is a mechanism shared by other MAPK family members. Since endogenous MEK5β protein expression was detected in growth-arrested but not actively growing cancer cells, we suggest that MEK5β may be a naturally occurring “brake” to prevent excessive BMK1 activation and aberrant cell proliferation in vivo. Further studies are needed to define how the relative amounts of the two MEK5 isoforms are regulated. We thank Drs. Charles Emala and Sarah Giardina for critically reading the manuscript."

Studies have shown that the non-covalent step involves an interaction between the weak lysine-binding sites (WLBS) present within each of apo(a) kringle IV types 6, 7, and 8 (KIV6–8), and two lysine residues (Lys680 and Lys690) within the NH2 terminus of the apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) component of low density lipoprotein. In the present study, we introduced single point mutations (E56G) into each of the WLBS present in apo(a) KIV6–8 and expressed these mutations in the context of a 17-kringle (17K) recombinant apo(a) variant. Single mutations that disrupt the WLBS in KIV6, KIV7, and KIV8, as well as mutants that disrupt the WLBS in both KIV6 and KIV7, or both KIV7 and KIV8, were assessed for their ability to form non-covalent and covalent Lp(a) complexes. Our results demonstrate that both apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8, but not KIV6, are required for maximally efficient non-covalent and covalent Lp(a) assembly. Single mutations in the WLBS of KIV7 or KIV8 resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the affinity of 17K recombinant apo(a) for apoB, and a 20% reduction in the rate of covalent Lp(a) formation. Tandem mutations in the WLBS in both KIV7 and KIV8 resulted in a 13-fold reduction in the binding affinity between apo(a) and apoB, and a 75% reduction in the rate of the covalent step of Lp(a) formation. We also showed that KIV7 and KIV8 specifically bind with high affinity to apoB-derived peptides containing Lys690 or Lys680, respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrate that specific interactions between apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 and Lys680 and Lys690 in apoB mediate a high affinity non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and low density lipoprotein, which dictates the efficiency of covalent Lp(a) formation.

The LDL moiety of Lp(a) is similar to plasma-derived LDL both in lipid composition as well as in the presence of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB). As such, the apo(a) component likely confers the unique structural and functional properties that have been attributed to Lp(a). Apo(a) contains tandem repeats of a sequence that closely resembles plasminogen kringle IV, followed by sequences that are highly homologous to the kringle V and protease domains of plasminogen (3.McLean J.W.

Based on amino acid sequence, apo(a) contains 10 distinct subclasses of plasminogen kringle IV-like domains (3.McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar); the kringle IV type 2 domain (KIV2) is present in a variable number of identically repeated copies, which is the molecular basis for the observed isoform size heterogeneity of Lp(a) (4.van der Hoek Y.Y.

Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). An unpaired cysteine residue in apo(a) KIV9 (Cys67) is involved in disulfide linkage with apoB to form covalent Lp(a) particles (1.Koschinsky M.L. Côté G. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Numerous epidemiological studies (both case-control and prospective designs) have identified elevated plasma Lp(a) concentrations as a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disorders including coronary heart disease (reviewed in Refs. 6.Marcovina S.M. Hegele R.A. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 1999; 1: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 7.Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Conventional therapies such as lifestyle changes and statin therapy, which are highly effective in lowering plasma LDL concentrations, have been relatively unsuccessful in reducing Lp(a) concentrations (7.Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As such, alternative strategies for lowering plasma Lp(a) levels have been suggested, including inhibition of the assembly of Lp(a) particles (8.Frank S. Durovic S. Kostner K. Kostner G.M.

It is generally accepted that Lp(a) assembly is a two-step process in which initial non-covalent interactions between apo(a) and apoB precede disulfide bond formation (10.Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J.

Although previous data indicate that the efficiency of the covalent step of Lp(a) assembly is dictated by the affinity of the non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB (11.Gabel B.R. May L.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have recently demonstrated that the conformation of apo(a) is also an important determinant of the rate of covalent Lp(a) particle formation (15.Becker L.

Apo(a) adopts a closed conformation that inhibits covalent Lp(a) assembly, possibly by restricting access to the free sulfhydryl group in apo(a) KIV9 (15.Becker L. Webb B.A. Chitayat S. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have previously shown that the addition of the lysine analog ϵ-aminocaproic acid (ϵ-ACA) elicits a conformational change in apo(a) to a more open structure, which results in a 6-fold enhancement in its ability to form covalent Lp(a) particles. Sequences have been identified within both the NH2 and COOH termini of apoB that mediate its non-covalent interaction with apo(a) (9.Sharp R.J. Perugini M.A. Marcovina S.M. McCormick S.P.

Previous data from our group underscore a role for sequences within the NH2-terminal 18% of apoB (apoB-18) in mediating its lysine-dependent, non-covalent association with apo(a) (16.Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More recently, using a combination of citraconic anhydride modification and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified two lysine residues (Lys680 and Lys690) within apoB-18 that are required for non-covalent binding to apo(a) (18.Becker L.

With respect to sequence requirements in apo(a) that mediate its non-covalent interaction with apoB, several groups have shown that the weak lysine-binding sites (WLBS) present within apo(a) KIV5–8 are likely involved in mediating this interaction (11.Gabel B.R.

Previous data from our group also suggest that the WLBS in apo(a) KIV8 plays a major role in non-covalent binding to LDL (14.Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); all studies to date have demonstrated no role for apo(a) KIV5. In the above studies, domains in apo(a) involved in non-covalent binding to apoB were identified by sequential truncation of full-length apo(a), followed by assessment of binding to immobilized LDL. Using this approach, however, neither the individual contribution of each WLBS to the non-covalent interaction with apoB in the context of full-length apo(a) nor the quantitative relationship between apo(a)/LDL non-covalent interactions and covalent Lp(a) assembly can be assessed. Indeed, based on our recent studies, the truncated derivatives previously used would lack the closed conformation that is adopted by full-length apo(a). 2L. Becker and M. L. Koschinsky, unpublished results. In the present study, we generated mutations in the WLBS of apo(a) KIV6, KIV7, and KIV8, as well as tandem WLBS mutants in both KIV6 and KIV7, or KIV7 and KIV8; all of these mutations were made in the context of a 17-kringle-containing apo(a) variant (17K; Ref. 22.Koschinsky M.L.

The apo(a) variants were assessed for their ability to associate with LDL in solution and for the efficiency with which they form covalent Lp(a) particles. We further determined whether lysine residues (Lys680 and Lys690) within apoB-18 are important for binding to the WLBS in apo(a) by measuring solution phase interactions between bacterially expressed apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8, and synthetic peptides containing apoB Lys680 and Lys690. Taken together, our data identify a critical role for the WLBS in both apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 in mediating non-covalent association with the Lys690 and Lys680 residues in apoB, respectively, and demonstrate that these interactions are required for the covalent step of Lp(a) formation.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were used as PCR templates in the construction of an expression plasmid encoding the 17KKIV8E56G variant; primer pair 1 and 6 and pair 8 and 9, respectively, were used for the PCR reaction (see Table I). Mutated fragments were cloned into pRK5ha17 to generate the expression vector pRK5ha17KIV8E56G. Constructs encoding the 17KKIV6/7E56G and KIV17KKIV7/8E56G were generated via a number of cloning steps making use of fragments derived from the plasmids encoding single mutations in the WLBS of KIV6, KIV7, and KIV8, described above. Human embryonic kidney (293) cells stably expressing each of the r-apo(a) derivatives were generated as previously described (22.Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method using 10 μg of each r-apo(a) plasmid and 1 μg of a plasmid encoding the neomycin resistance gene per 100-mm plate. Stable transformants were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) until foci developed. At this time, the foci were picked and screened for apo(a) expression by Western blot analysis. Construction and Expression of Apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 in Escherichia coli—Sequences encoding apo(a) KIV7 were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET16b (Stratagene) as previously described (23.Rahman M.N. Becker L. Petrounevitch V. Hill B.C. Jia Z. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the construction of KIV8 in pET16b, a similar strategy was employed as for KIV7. Briefly, sequences corresponding to the KIV8 domain were amplified from the pRK5-SK8 vector. 3M. L. Koschinsky, unpublished data. using primers 10 and 11 (Table I) and were cloned into the NdeI site in pET16b. For both KIV7 (23.Rahman M.N. Becker L. Petrounevitch V. Hill B.C. Jia Z. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and KIV8, the expression plasmids contain sequences corresponding to the respective kringle domains, as well as the entire NH2- and COOH-terminal interkringle sequences (3.McLean J.W.

Purification of LDL—LDL was purified from the plasma of a normolipidemic volunteer as previously described (18.Becker L. McLeod R.S. Marcovina S.M. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36155-36162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified LDL was determined using a modified Bradford assay, and the lipoprotein was stored at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA for a maximum of 3 days prior to use. Purification of Recombinant Apo(a) Variants—All r-apo(a) variants used in this study, with the exception of KIV7 and KIV8, were purified from the conditioned medium of stably expressing 293 cell lines using lysine-Sepharose chromatography as previously described (24.Sangrar W. Gabel B.R. Boffa M.B. Walker J.B. Hancock M.A. Marcovina S.M. Horrevoets A.J.G. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10353-10363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for all r-apo(a) derivatives were obtained by absorbance measurements at 280 nm (corrected for Rayleigh scattering) using previously determined extinction coefficients (25.Fodor S.P.A. Copeland R.A. Grygon C.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein integrity and purity were assessed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Single kringle constructs encoding KIV7 or KIV8 were used to transform BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen); LB containing ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight culture of transformed BL21 (DE3) cells and grown to an A600 of ∼0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1mm, and cultures were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation, the insoluble pellet was then solubilized by the addition of a buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The purification of the single kringles was performed essentially as we have previously described for KIV7, using Ni2+-Sepharose chromatography and gel filtration (23.Rahman M.N. Becker L. Petrounevitch V. Hill B.C. Jia Z. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with a few minor modifications. Following gel filtration, proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA for 2 h, and were then dialyzed against double-distilled H2O. Purified proteins were concentrated by lyophilization; before use, protein pellets were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and protein concentrations were determined by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm (corrected for Rayleigh scattering), using calculated extinction coefficients (E0.1% = 2.12 and 2.24 for KIV7 and KIV8, respectively) (25.Fodor S.P.A. Copeland R.A. Grygon C.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5509Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein integrity and purity were assessed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Apo(a)—Sedimentation velocity experiments on the 17K and 17K variants were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge as previously described (15.Becker L.

Modification of LDL 5′-Iodoacetamidofluorescein—LDL was labeled with 5′-iodoacetamidofluorescein as previously described (15.Becker L. Webb B.A. Chitayat S. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The concentration of fluorescein-labeled LDL (flu-LDL) was determined using a modified Bradford assay, and the modified lipoprotein was stored at 4 °C for no longer than 3 days prior to use. Binding of Recombinant Apo(a) to Flu-LDL—Apo(a) binding to flu-LDL was performed as previously described (15.Becker L. Webb B.A. Chitayat S. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescein fluorescence measurements of flu-LDL were performed using an LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Flu-LDL (50 nm) was titrated with 17K, 17KKIV6E56G, 17KKIV7E56G, 17KKIV8E56G, 17KKIV6/7E56G, and 17KKIV7/8E56G. Titrations were performed in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette, which had been conditioned with this buffer prior to use. Fluorescein was excited at a wavelength of 495 nm and a slit width of 2.5 nm, whereas fluorescein emission was detected at a wavelength of 530 nm and a slit width of 5 nm, with a 510-nm cut-off filter placed in the emission beam. Ligand solutions, containing 50 nm flu-LDL to eliminate dilution effects, were added in a stepwise manner until saturation of the fluorescence change was attained. To determine the KD for the interaction between apo(a) and flu-LDL, titration curves were subjected to non-linear regression analysis using the following quadratic equation (Equation 1). ΔI=0.5×dI×(KD+[A]0+[B]0-(KD+[A]0+[B]0)2-4[A]0[B]0)(Eq. 1) ΔI is the measured fluorescence change, dI is the difference between the fluorescence coefficient for LDL in the free and apo(a)-bound states, KD is the dissociation constant, and [A]0 and [B]0 are the total concentrations of apo(a) and flu-LDL, respectively. Transient Transfection and Metabolic Labeling of 17K and Recombinant Apo(a) Variants with [35S]Cysteine—Plamids encoding 17K, 17KKIV6E56G, 17KKIV7E56G, 17KKIV8E56G, 17KKIV6/7E56G, and 17KKIV7/8E56G were transiently transfected into 293 cells and metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine as previously described (15.Becker L.

Labeled conditioned medium was harvested and stored at –70 °C prior to use. Covalent Lp(a) Assembly Assays—In vitro covalent Lp(a) assembly assays were performed essentially as previously described (15.Becker L. Webb B.A. Chitayat S. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified native LDL (50 nm) was incubated with conditioned medium containing 2 nm 17K or each of the 17K variants at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl. At selected time points (0–8 h), a 30-μl aliquot was removed, added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in the absence of a reducing agent, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were placed in fixing solution (25% methanol, 12.5% acetic acid in double-distilled H2O) for 20 min, followed by incubation in Amplify solution (Amersham Life Sciences) for 30 min. The gels were then dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Bio-Rad) for 16 h. The screen was developed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX, and the bands were quantified using Quantity One 4.0.1 densitometry software. The extent of covalent Lp(a) particle formation was quantified according to the following formula: %Lp(a) = [Lp(a)]/([Lp(a)] + [apo(a)]) × 100. The data were fit according to an exponential rise to maximum formula given in Equation 2, which was derived from first principles assuming that covalent Lp(a) formation occurs as a two-step process. &percnt;Lp(a)=100×(1-e-at)(Eq. 2) %Lp(a) is the amount of Lp(a) formed at time t, t is the time of reaction, and a is a constant is described by the following relationship. a=[B]0×k[B]0+KD(Eq. 3) [B]0 is the total concentration of LDL, KD is the dissociation constant for the interaction between apo(a) and LDL, and k is the rate constant for disulfide bond formation. ApoB Peptide Synthesis and Purification—ApoB peptides corresponding to amino acids 675–689 (apoB675–689) and 685–699 (apoB685–699) in the primary sequence of apoB were synthesized by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Both of the peptides were purified using high performance liquid chromatography, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C. Peptides were reconstituted in 20 mm Tris base, and the solution was adjusted to pH 7.9 by the dropwise addition of 1 m HCl. Reconstituted peptides were stored at –70 °C prior to use. Measurement of the Binding of ϵ-ACA and ApoB Peptides to KIV7 and KIV8 Using Intrinsic Fluorescence—Intrinsic fluorescence experiments were conducted using an LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Apo(a) KIV7 and KIV8 were each titrated with ϵ-ACA, apoB675–689, or apoB685–699. Titrations were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.01% Tween 20 in a quartz cuvette, which had been conditioned with this buffer prior to use.

We show here that several CsA derivatives substituted in position 3 can inhibit calcineurin without prior formation of a complex with cyclophilin 18. [Methylsarcosine3]CsA was shown to inhibit calcineurin, either in its free form with an IC50 value of 10 μm, or in its complex form with cyclophilin 18 with an IC50 of 500 nm. [Dimethylaminoethylthiosarcosine3]CsA ([Dat-Sar3]CsA) was found to inhibit calcineurin on its own, with an IC50 value of 1.0 μm, but was not able to inhibit calcineurin after forming the [Dat-Sar3]CsA-cyclophilin 18 binary complex. Despite their different inhibitory properties, both CsA and [Dat-Sar3]CsA suppressed T cell proliferation and cytokine production mainly through blocking NFAT activation and interleukin-2 gene expression. Furthermore, to demonstrate that [Dat-Sar3]CsA can inhibit calcineurin in a cyclophilin-independent manner in vivo, we tested its effect in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (Δ12), in which all the 12 cyclophilins and FKBPs were deleted.

The drugs alone do not inhibit the enzymatic activity of calcineurin. CsA and FK506 bind to and inhibit calcineurin only after interaction with their respective peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) (EC 5.2.1.8), cyclophilins (Cyps), and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) through a gain-of-function mechanism. Therefore, these particular PPIases were also termed immunophilins. Among the many known human PPIases, the most abundant cytosolic members cyclophilin 18 (Cyp18) and FKBP12 were found as major receptor proteins for CsA and FK506, respectively (2.Schreiber S.L.

The inertness of the inhibitor to the catalytic subunit provides the basis for the high specificity of the drug-immunophilin complexes for calcineurin inhibition, as compared with the inhibition of other Ser/Thr protein phosphatases by their corresponding inhibitors. CsA derivatives could be grouped according to their inhibitory properties toward Cyp18 and calcineurin (8.Sigal N.H. Dumont F. Durette P. Siekierka J.J. Peterson L. Rich D.H. Dunlap B.E. Staruch M.J.

Whereas CsA inhibits Cyp18 and the CsA-Cyp18 complex inhibits calcineurin, some CsA derivatives, e.g. [N-methyl-Ala6]CsA, neither in their uncomplexed forms, nor in the complex with Cyp18, are able to inhibit calcineurin (8.Sigal N.H.

The studies with these compounds helped to reveal the immunosuppressive mechanism of CsA, as well as the signal transduction pathways in activated T cells, in which the calcineurin phosphatase activity is involved (8.Sigal N.H.

For instance, the activation of one of the major transcription factors of antigen-receptor signaling in lymphocytes, NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), is among the known activities of calcineurin. NFAT is a substrate of calcineurin and directly dephosphorylated at multiple sites (11.Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have suggested the different importance of two major isoforms of calcineurin in T cell development and function, because of their different expression levels in T cells (12.Bueno O.F.

The phenotypic analyses of calcineurin Aβ-deficient mice demonstrated a defective immune response that was similar to CsA treatment, whereas only a modest immunologic phenotype was observed in calcineurin Aα-deficient mice. Whereas targeted disruption of the gene of single calcineurin isoform greatly improved our knowledge concerning calcineurin participation in immunosuppression, the indirect mode of action of CsA via a presenter protein renders the drug effect less clear in vivo. For instance, both calcineurin Aα–/– and calcineurin Aβ–/– T cells remained sensitive to CsA inhibition (12.Bueno O.F. Brandt E.B. Rothenberg M.E. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fortunately, chemical genetic studies would provide an alternative approach to answer these questions (14.Schreiber S.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1127-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Small molecule compounds with inhibitory potency and specificity toward Cyp18 and calcineurin different from that of CsA could help us to distinguish between the Cyp18 and calcineurin inhibition involved in cellular effects of CsA. As a first step, the design of CsA derivatives that could inhibit calcineurin in a Cyp18-independent manner, and thus render calcineurin inhibition independent of the intrinsic cyclophilins of the targeted cells, would seem to be ideal to dissect the numerous biological effects of CsA. Here we describe CsA derivatives, in which a single hydrogen atom of sarcosine at position 3 (Sar3) has been replaced by either alkyl or alkylthio groups (15.Seebach D. Beck A.K. Bossler H.G. Gerber C. Ko S.Y. Murtiashaw C.W. Naef R. Shoda S. Thaler A. Krieger M. Wenger R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1564-1590Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), bypassing the requirement for Cyp18 binding in calcineurin inhibition. Sar3 had been chosen for modification because of its importance in the control of the CsA conformation (16.Wenger R.M. France J. Bovermann G. Walliser L. Widmer A. Widmer H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). [Dimethylaminoethylthiosarcosine3]CsA ([Dat-Sar3]CsA) was found to inhibit calcineurin on its own in the low micromolar range, but was unable to inhibit calcineurin after forming the [Dat-Sar3]CsA-Cyp18 binary complex. [Methylsarcosine3]CsA ([Me-Sar3]CsA) was shown to inhibit calcineurin, either in its complex form with Cyp18, or in its free form. To the known CsA derivatives, we added two new types of compounds with different inhibitory properties. Like CsA, [Dat-Sar3]CsA suppressed T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and blocked the activation of NFAT. Calcineurin is conserved in eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. Calcineurin also functions in fungi to control a myriad of physiological processes including cell cycle progression, cation homeostasis, and morphogenesis (17.Fox D.S. Heitman J. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CsA and FK506 exert potent antifungal effects against a variety of pathogenic fungi. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin null mutants fail to recover from α-factor pheromone-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and are sensitive to high concentrations of Na+, Li+, or Mn2+ ions (18.Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 115-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that [Dat-Sar3]CsA can inhibit calcineurin in a Cyp-independent manner in vivo, we took advantage of yeast genetics (19.Cardenas M.E. Lorenz M. Hemenway C. Heitman J. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 2: 103-126Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and tested its effect in a S. cerevisiae strain (Δ12) (20.Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which lacks all cyclophilins and FKBPs. We could demonstrate that [Dat-Sar3]CsA, but not CsA, bypassed the requirement for cellular Cyps and caused growth inhibition in salt-stressed Δ12 strain. Expression and purification of recombinant human calcineurin was performed as published (21.Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1 (recombinant rabbit muscle α-isoform) was purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and protein phosphatase 2C (recombinant human α-isoform) from Upstate Biotechnology (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). Protein phosphatase 2A was isolated from porcine brain and purified to homogeneity as described (22.Tung H.Y. Alemany S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase and IL-7 were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Calmodulin, buffers, and salts were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human Cyp18 and human FKBP12 have been prepared as described elsewhere (23.Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The biotinylated and nonbiotinylated 19-residue peptides of a partial sequence of the RII subunit of the bovine protein kinase A (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE-OH) were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis. The cytokines IL-15 and IL-7 were from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Cell media and all supplements were purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). The wild-type strain JK93da (wt) and isogenic strain KDY98.4a (Δ12) of S. cerevisiae were kindly provided by J. Heitman (20.Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The synthesis was performed by a method previously described (15.Seebach D. Beck A.K. Bossler H.G. Gerber C. Ko S.Y. Murtiashaw C.W. Naef R. Shoda S. Thaler A. Krieger M. Wenger R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1564-1590Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, a series of CsA position 3 side chain derivatives were synthesized by generation of an enolate at the sarcosine residue and reaction with various electrophiles. The reactions occurred in the presence or absence of LiCl for obtaining S or R diastereoisomers selectively. [N-Methyl-Asp(O-tert-But)3]CsA (Table I, entry 6) is a mixture of S and R diastereoisomers. The identities of products were confirmed with ESI-MS. We analyzed the samples with reverse phase analytic high performance liquid chromatography and the purities of all CsA derivatives are higher than 95%.Table IInhibition constants of CsA derivatives for inhibition of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of Cyp18 and of CsA derivatives or CsA derivative-Cyp18 complexes for inhibition of phosphatase activity of calcineurinInhibition of enzyme activities by CsA derivativesEntryAbbreviationsCompoundCyp18aS.D. ≤ 20%.KiCalcineurin (in the presence of Cyp18)bS.D. ≤ 10%.,cNI, ≤ 10% inhibition of calcineurin by a preformed complex of CsA derivative-Cyp18 (10 μm/10 μm).

Open table in a new tab RII Phosphopeptide-based Calcineurin Activity Assay—The biotinylated and nonbiotinylated 19-residue peptides of a partial sequence of the RII subunit of the bovine protein kinase A were phosphorylated at residue 15 as previously described (24.Baumgrass R. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Liu J.O. Wunderlich D. Grabley S. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47914-47921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For all calcineurin activity assays, the 33P-labeled RII phosphopeptide was used. Calcineurin activity was measured using a scintillation proximity assay (24.Baumgrass R. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Liu J.O. Wunderlich D. Grabley S. Fischer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47914-47921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, preincubation of calmodulin (50 nm), calcineurin (1.32 nm), and inhibitor at the required concentrations in the phosphatase assay buffer (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was carried out at 22 °C for 30 min in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). 10 pmol of biotinylated [33P]RII phosphopeptide was added to each well in a total assay volume of 100 μl. After dephosphorylation of RII phosphopeptide by calcineurin at 30 °C for 20 min, 90 μl of the reaction mixture were transferred to a scintillation well coated with streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Biotinylated RII phosphopeptide was allowed to bind to streptavidin for 20 min at 22 °C. The well was washed once with water, and the RII phosphopeptide associated 33P was measured in a MicroBeta top counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The obtained data were fitted and computed with the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc., San Rafael, CA). The calcineurin inhibition was measured at a concentration range of 0.5 to 30 μm CsA (AWD, Dresden, Germany) or CsA derivatives. For determination of the calcineurin inhibition by drug-Cyp18 complexes, the assay was also carried out in the presence of varying concentrations of Cyp18 and 10 μm CsA or CsA derivatives. For competition experiments, the mixture of calcineurin and [Dat-Sar3]CsA was pre-equilibrated in the assay buffer at 22 °C for 30 min. Subsequent use of the incubation mixture in the RII phosphopeptide calcineurin activity assay yielded a final concentration of 1.32 nm calcineurin, 10 μm [Dat-Sar3]CsA. Increasing concentrations of Cyp18 from 0.01 to 10 μm were used to compete with calcineurin for [Dat-Sar3]CsA. Simultaneous inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 (1 μm) and [Me-Sar3]CsA (5 μm) or [Dat-Sar3]CsA (0.75 μm) was examined dependent on the FKBP12 concentration (0.5–250 nm). For kinetic studies, biotinylated RII phosphopeptide and nonbiotinylated RII phosphopeptide were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:200 in assay buffer. A total RII phosphopeptide concentration of 5 to 15 μm was used for each concentration of [Dat-Sar3]CsA (0.25–1.5 μm) with a calcineurin concentration of 0.66 nm. p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (pNPP)-based Calcineurin Activity Assay— Phosphatase activity was measured at room temperature using pNPP as substrate in phosphatase assay buffer (see above). After preincubation of calcineurin with the inhibitor in phosphatase assay buffer at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of pNPP to a final concentration of 10 mm. The release of p-nitrophenol was continuously measured using a Dynatec MR7000 microtiter plate reader at 410 nm for 45 min. Inhibition of Other Protein Ser/Thr Phosphatases—The activities of the protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2C were measured with RII phosphopeptide, as described for calcineurin. For assaying PP2C a final concentration of 30 mm MgCl2 was additionally included. The protein phosphatase concentrations were adjusted to an activity level of ∼80% dephosphorylation of 10 pmol of RII phosphopeptide within 20 min. Protein phosphatase 1 and PP2A were assayed by using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate (Sigma) (25.Pelech S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and 32P-labeled casein was used for calcineurin and PP2C as previously described (26.Waelkens E. Goris J. Di Salvo J. Merlevede W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein phosphatase inhibition was evaluated for [Me-Sar3]CsA and [Dat-Sar3]CsA in a concentration range of 1 to 100 μm. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-Isomerase Assay—PPIase activity was determined with oligopeptide substrates using protease-coupled assays as described elsewhere (27.Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Typically, experiments were performed with PPIase concentrations in the low nanomolar range and CsA or CsA derivatives within the assay. The effect of the inhibitors on the PPIase activity was calculated from the remaining activity after preincubation of the enzyme and the inhibitor at 22 °C for 20 min. The pre-equilibrated mixture of [Dat-Sar3]CsA and calcineurin (50 μm/13.2 nm stock solution) in assay buffer containing calmodulin (50 nm) was used to examine the reversibility of inhibition by dialysis experiments. The mixture was placed on a Pierce system microdialyzer equipped with a Mr 3000 cut-off dialysis membrane and dialyzed against the assay buffer at 4 °C. Reference activity was determined with a calcineurin sample treated similarly but without addition of [Dat-Sar3]CsA. Aliquots of 10 μl of dialyzed enzyme or [Dat-Sar3]CsA-enzyme complex were assayed using RII phosphopeptide substrate. Cyp18 was fused to the C-terminal of GST. The fusion protein (25 μm) was incubated with calcineurin (50 μm) in the presence of Me2SO, CsA, or [Dat-Sar3]CsA (25 μm) in 200 μl at 22 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. The GST-Cyp18 and all bound proteins were precipitated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by heating at 90 °C for 10 min after the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The supernatants after centrifugation were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membrane by the tank blotting procedure and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using polyclonal antibodies specific for calcineurin or Cyp18. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. The cells from one buffy coat (∼2 × 108 cells) were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture. The washed cells were homogenized in 7 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 500 nm okadaic acid, and a protease inhibitor mixture) on ice, with a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated with 200 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) with constant agitation for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by gravitation and washed twice with the homogenizing buffer. The beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of assay buffer (see above) and immediately used to assay calcineurin. The final amount of enzyme isolated from 106 cells gave an activity of 0.087 pmol min–1 using the RII phosphopeptide substrate. T Cell Separation and Culture—CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated by positive selection from human PBMCs using magnetic Multisort MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) (28.Miltenyi S. Muller W. Weichel W. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar) with a purity of >97%. The cells were cultured at 3 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture overnight. Splenic cells were prepared from mice homozygously transgenic (tg) 1 mice, homozygous for the DO11.10 a/b-TCR (OVA-TCRtg/tg) (29.Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) on BALB/c background (gift from Dennis Y. Loh, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Proliferation—PBMCs were labeled with 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidylester before stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ABs (2 × 106 cells/ml) (30.Richter A. Lohning M. Radbruch A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) in the presence of inhibitors, or Me2SO as control in 24-well plates. Stock solutions of all inhibitors were in Me2SO (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and added to a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO in each cell sample. The cells were cultured for 5 days and directly analyzed on viable cells by flow cytometry. OVA-specific splenic cells were stimulated with the antigenic peptide OVA323–339 in the presence of inhibitors or Me2SO as control in 96-well plates and cultured for 4 days. For experiments with additional cytokines, sorted T cells were used and IL-2 (10 IU/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml), and IL-15 (10 ng/ml) were added just before stimulation. Intracellular Cytokine Production—PBMCs (2 × 106/ml) were preincubated with one of the following compounds at various concentrations as indicated: CsA (AWD, Dresden, Germany), [Dat-Sar3]CsA, [Me-Sar3]CsA, or Me2SO at 37 °C for 10 min in 24-well plates. Stock solutions of the inhibitors in Me2SO (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 0.5% Me2SO in each cell sample. PBMCs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin (both from Sigma) for 5 h with the addition of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) for the last 3 h of stimulation. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized by washing in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% saponin and 1% fetal calf serum, incubated with anti-IL-2 phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody, and measured by flow cytometry. Sorted T cells were used in experiments with exogenous cytokines, and IL-2 (10 IU/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml), and IL-15 (10 ng/ml) were added just before stimulation. Sorted T cells transfected with the NFAT-reporter gene plasmid (Stratagene, Netherlands) by electroporation (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 5 h. After cell lysis the level of the extracted luciferase from these cells was determined by bioluminescence measurement using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). In addition, a β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected as internal standard. To investigate cyclophilin-independent relative sensitivity of cells to the growth inhibition by [Dat-Sar3]CsA, the wild-type strain JK93da (wt) and the isogenic strain KDY98.4a (Δ12) lacking the 12 authentic immunophilins were used (20.Dolinski K.

Samples of cell suspensions with similar A600 of the strains to be tested were used in the presence of CsA or [Dat-Sar3]CsA under lithium cation stress. The yeast strains were grown to early log phase at 30 °C. Serial 100-fold dilutions were spotted onto YPD medium with or without 100 mm LiCl and with or without 10 μm inhibitor (32.Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in ethanol. All media contained 1% ethanol (31.Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Incubation was performed at 22 °C for 5 days. Biochemical Characterization of Sar3-modified CsA Derivatives—CsA derivatives with a modified Sar3 residue were prepared by established chemical procedures (Fig. 1) (15.Seebach D. Beck A.K.

RIP140-mediated suppression was reversed most effectively by overexpressing the coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (P/CAF). Immunoprecipitation demonstrated coexistence of holoreceptors complexed with RIP140 or P/CAF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed rapid RA-enhanced recruitment of RIP140, but delayed P/CAF recruitment, to an RA-targeted promoter in COS-1 cells supplemented with RIP140. In RA-induced P19 cells, endogenous RIP140 was rapidly (within 4 h) and significantly recruited to both the RARβ2 and TR2 genes, whereas the peak of endogenous P/CAF recruitment occurred much later (48 h) and to a lesser degree. Consistent with these observations, significant histone acetylation of endogenous RA receptor (RAR) targets was only observed 48 h following RA treatment. In vitro experiments confirmed RA-induced transcription from a chromatin template, which was reduced by adding RIP140. This study presents evidence for coexistence of multiple RAR-coregulator complexes and a preferential RA-induced recruitment of RIP140 to endogenous RAR-targeted promoters after short term RA treatment, which correlates with suppressed induction of RA-regulated gene expression in the presence of RIP140.

Eukaryotic gene regulation is achieved by a complex network of events that results in alteration of chromatin structures and coregulator recruitment to the transcription machinery (1.Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2.McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). These changes are achieved by the coordinated action of complexes such as ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling and histone-modifying complexes (3.Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). The histone-modifying complexes act on the tails of histones to produce covalent alterations such as methylation of specific arginine or lysine residues and acetylation of specific arginine residues (4.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 5.Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Coordinated modification has been observed for several model genes, such as the chicken β-globin locus (6.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These highly specific modifications are the result of an ordered recruitment of various factors (7.Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8.Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M.

Although the “on/off” switch of transcription regulation by hormones can be explained by recruitment of different types of coregulators, the question of how hormones activate genes at different levels remains to be addressed. Current models propose that transcription activation is stimulated when hormones occupy their receptors, inducing conformational changes that result in alteration of coregulator recruitment. Recruitment of coregulators, called coactivators or corepressors, is critical for nuclear receptor-mediated gene regulation (10.Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11.Freedman L.P. Trends Endocrinol.

Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Without hormones, aporeceptors are primarily associated with corepressors, whereas hormone-occupied receptors are usually associated with coactivators. These coregulators modulate gene transcription mainly by regulating enzyme activities, such as those involved in histone acetylation, e.g. histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase for coactivators and corepressors, respectively. Recently, other protein modification pathways such as methylation (13.Kraus W.L. Wong J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have also been identified.

For hormone-regulated genes, induction of gene expression is attenuated by RIP140 expression, which itself occurs in a hormone-dependent manner. Our recent studies on retinoic acid (RA)-inducible systems suggested a model for the novel action of RIP140 in hormonal regulation of gene expression (22.Chen Y. Kerimo A. Khan S. Wei L.-N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2528-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23.Farooqui M. Franco P.J. Thompson J. Kagechika H. Chandraratna R.A.S. Banaszak L. Wei L.-N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This involves two features of RIP140: its interaction with nuclear hormone receptors in a hormone-dependent manner and its ability to recruit histone deacetylase to the nuclear receptors and to their target DNAs in the presence of hormones. However, it is unknown how RIP140-receptor complexes operate in the presence of other coactivator complexes also recruited by hormone-bound receptors. Preliminary examination of the receptor-interacting domains of RIP140 originally revealed nine copies of the typical receptor-interacting motif LXXLL (where L is a leucine and X is any amino acid) (25.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) found in many coactivators. Our recent studies identified a novel atypical receptor-interacting motif in the carboxyl terminus of RIP140 (amino acids 1063–1076, LTKTNPILYYMLQK) that exhibits a high affinity (2 nm) toward hormone-occupied RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and is responsible for the hormone-dependent suppression of gene activation (20.Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22.Chen Y. Kerimo A. Khan S. Wei L.-N. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We propose that RIP140 regulates the level of hormonal induction of gene activation by antagonizing or attenuating the recruitment of coactivators to nuclear receptors such as RAR. Multiple coregulatory complexes with antagonistic biological functions could be recruited to the same target in a mutually exclusive manner. Differences in the composition of transcription factor complexes on the target gene at specific time points might translate to quantitative regulation of gene expression. In this study, results using RA-regulated gene systems are presented to support this hypothesis. Several issues are addressed, including altered levels of RA-induced receptor-mediated gene activation as a result of changing levels of coregulators, the dynamics of RIP140 and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (P/CAF) recruitment to an RA reporter gene and two endogenous RA-regulated gene promoters, and the direct effect of RIP140 on the in vitro transcription efficiency of RA-responsive genes assembled into chromatin templates. Transfection and Reporter Assays—The reporter IR0-tK-luciferase (IR0-tK-Luc), RAR, RXR, RIP140, and FLAG-P/CAF expression vectors as well as the transfection procedure for COS-1 have been described previously (26.Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8820-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RA (0.5 μm each of all-trans- and 9-cis-RA) was added for 30 h in induction experiments. Protein Purification—For in vitro transcription, FLAG-p300, FLAG-P/CAF, FLAG-RAR, and His-RXR were each expressed and purified from Sf21 insect cells. FLAG-tagged proteins were purified with anti-FLAG-M2 affinity resin (Sigma) and eluted with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptides (27.Wu S.-Y. Thomas M.C. Hou S.Y. Likhite V. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23480-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heterodimers of FLAG-RAR·His-RXR were copurified with a Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech, BD Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells were transfected with IR0-tK-Luc and different combinations of expression vectors for RAR, RXR, FLAG-P/CAF, and RIP140. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle or 0.5 μm all-trans- and 9-cis-RA and harvested 48 h later. The holoreceptor complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-RAR (Affinity BioReagents) or anti-FLAG (Sigma), and the coregulators or RAR was detected on Western blots using anti-RIP140 (24.Wei L.-N. Farooqui M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), anti-RAR, or anti-FLAG (for P/CAF). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—COS-1 cells were transfected with IR0-tK-Luc and different combinations of expression vectors for RAR, RXR, and RIP140. Samples were harvested at 15-min intervals following RA treatment over a 2-h period. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (21.Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify the precipitated promoter region were 5′-AGC GTC TTG TCA TTG GCG-3′ and 5′-GTT AAG CGG GTC GCT GCA G-3′. The expression levels of introduced RA receptors and RIP140 were monitored by Western blot analyses. To determine the ability of two endogenous RA-regulated genes (RARβ2 and TR2) to recruit endogenous RIP140 and P/CAF, P19 cells were induced with 0.5 μm all-trans- and 9-cis-RA. Cells were collected at 15-min intervals over a 2-h period or 4 and 48 h for immunoprecipitation with anti-RIP140, anti-P/CAF (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-RAR. Samples were also immunoprecipitated with anti-acetylated H4 (Upstate Biotechnology) to determine whether the promoters were acetylated. The primers 5′-GAT GTC AGA CTA GTT GGG TCA TTT-3′ and 5′-TGC GTT CCG GAT CCT ACC CCG-3′ were used to amplify the endogenous RARβ2 promoter region (containing DR5). The primers 5′-CCG CCG CTG GAC TCC GGG GCC CTC-3′ and 5′-CGC TGG GCT GGA GAG AGC AGA GGC-3′ were used to amplify the TR2 promoter region (containing IR0). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from P19 cells treated with vehicle or 0.5 μm all-trans- and 9-cis-RA for 4 and 48 h. Five μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One hundredth of reverse transcription products was used as template in PCR reaction using primer pairs 5′-ATG ATC ATT TGG ATC-3′ and 5′-CTG CAA AAG TGC TTA TCC-3′ to amplify about 270 bp of RARβ2 cDNA. Primers for the mouse TR2 transcripts are 5′-GTG CTG GCA AGT GAT GAA CG-3′ and 5′-AGT TGT AAT CTG CAG GCT CC-3′, which allowed TR2 transcripts to be amplified in fragments of 450 bp in size. Chromatin Assembly and in Vitro Transcription—An RA-responding G-less template, X121, was constructed by inserting four copies of an inverted repeat with zero nucleotide in the spacer (IR0) derived from the TR2 promoter region (26.Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8820-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and SmaI site of pMLΔ53 (28.Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) located upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter and 280-bp G-less cassette. The chromatin was reconstituted on X121 using Drosophila S190 chromatin assembly extract (29.Kamakaka T.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and purified HeLa core histones (30.Owens-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Steger D.J. West J.M. John S. Cote J. Havas K.M. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (27.Wu S.-Y. Thomas M.C. Hou S.Y. Likhite V. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23480-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was performed by incubating chromatin (containing ∼100 ng of DNA) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm all-trans- and 9-cis-RA, 2 nm RAR/RXR heterodimers, 1 nm p300, 1 nm RIP140 carboxyl-terminal domain, and 1 nm P/CAF at 27 °C for 30 min. To deplete endogenous P/CAF, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-P/CAF for 60 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated by addition of protein G-agarose at 4 °C for another 30 min. Native or P/CAF-depleted nuclear extracts were then added, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of transcription mixture including nucleoside triphosphates as described previously (31.Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transcription was conducted at 30 °C for 45 min and terminated by the addition of 90 μl of a stop solution (0.5 m EDTA, 3 m NaOAc, pH 5.2, 10% SDS, 2 μl of 10 mg/ml glycogen). The samples were then processed as described previously (31.Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the transcription signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuan software (Molecular Dynamics). Suppression of RA Induction by RIP140 —Several major RAR·RXR coactivators have been reported, including the p300/CREB-binding protein-P/CAF complex and members of the p160 family such as TIF2, its mouse homolog GRIP1, and Src-1. The effects of these coregulators were analyzed in transient transfection experiments conducted in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1A). As predicted, the activation of reporter gene activity by introduction of RAR·RXR and RA could be further enhanced by overexpression of TIF2, p300, and P/CAF (Fig. 1A, columns 3, 5, and 6 versus column 2). To identify the most likely target of RIP140 suppressive effect among the known coactivators, RIP140 was cotransfected into COS-1 cells together with each known individual coactivator (Fig. 1B). The suppressive effect of RIP140 (Fig. 1B, column 10) on RA-induced reporter expression (column 8) was most effectively reversed by P/CAF (column 14), although it was not a full reversal under these experimental conditions. This may be due to the possibility of RIP140 acting toward several coactivators, which would be able to be reversed by adding back a single coactivator. In the control experiment when no additional RAR·RXR was added, RIP140 had no effect on this reporter (Fig. 1B, column 9). To further confirm the RAR·RXR-specific suppressive effect of RIP140, an identical reporter with the RARE deleted was used to test the effect of RIP140 on this reporter system. As shown in Fig. 1C, this reporter was not affected by RA, exogenous RAR·RXR, or RIP140 expression, confirming that the suppressive effect of RIP140 was through RAR·RXR and the RARE. To assess further the potential antagonism between P/CAF and RIP140, the concentration dependence of the effects of both coregulators on RA-induced expression was examined (Fig. 2). Panel A of Fig. 2 shows the dose dependence of the activation mediated by P/CAF. Without RIP140, P/CAF enhanced RA activation of the reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, line of filled squares). However, in the presence of RIP140, the activating effect of P/CAF was dramatically reduced, although a negligible dose dependence of P/CAF was still observed (Fig. 2A, line of open squares). Panel B of Fig. 2 shows the dose dependence of suppression mediated by RIP140. Without additional P/CAF, RIP140 suppressed RA activation of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, line of filled triangles). With additional P/CAF expressed, RA activation apparently was to a much higher degree. As predicted, RIP140 still suppressed RA activation of the reporter in a dose-dependent manner even in the presence of additional P/CAF (Fig. 2B, line of open triangles). If there was only the endogenous P/CAF, the RA induction level was lower with a different amount of RIP140 (Fig. 2B). Thus, the specific antagonistic effect of RIP140 toward P/CAF was also confirmed in these experiments where clear dose dependence of both the coactivating activity of P/CAF and the suppressive activity of RIP140 was demonstrated. Coexistence of P/CAF- and RIP140-containing Receptor Complexes in the Presence of RA—The strong antagonism of RIP140 toward P/CAF with regards to RA induction prompted us to examine the RIP140- and P/CAF-containing receptor complexes in vivo. A competitive immunoprecipitation experiment was conducted using COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). Neither RIP140 nor P/CAF could be detected in the absence of RA (Fig. 3, lane A, columns 2–5), which confirmed the ligand dependence of the recruitment of RIP140 and P/CAF. With the introduction of ligand, RIP140 was detected efficiently in cells expressing RIP140 and receptors (Fig. 3, lane A, column 8) but was detected at a much lower level in cells also harvesting additional P/CAF (column 9). As expected in the negative control, RIP140 was not detected in cells harvesting only receptors or together with P/CAF (Fig. 3, lane A, columns 6 and 7). The same Western blot was probed with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3, lane B). FLAG-P/CAF was efficiently detected in cells harvesting receptors and P/CAF (Fig. 3, column 7). Interestingly, the FLAG-P/CAF signal was also dramatically reduced in cells harvesting additional RIP140 (Fig. 3, column 9). In negative controls, FLAG-P/CAF was not detected in cells harvesting only receptors or together with RIP140 (Fig. 3, columns 8 and 9). The input of each experiment was shown in Fig. 3, lanes C and D. Thus, both RIP140 and P/CAF efficiently formed complexes with RAR·RXR in the presence of hormones. However, when both RIP140 and P/CAF were present, although both complexes existed, they were clearly detected at much lower levels, suggesting mutually exclusive recruitment of these two coregulatory complexes to the RAR-targeted promoter. To examine whether the detection of both RIP140 and P/CAF in the RAR complexes was caused by the direct interaction of RIP140 with P/CAF, immunoprecipitation was conducted with α-FLAG followed by detecting the complexes with α-RIP140. As shown in Fig. 3, lane E, no RIP140 was detected in the P/CAF precipitates with or without ligand, suggesting that RIP140 and P/CAF did not interact directly. In the positive controls, RAR was detected in these complexes in the presence of RA (Fig. 3, lane F, columns 7 and 9), but less RAR was associated with P/CAF in the presence of RIP140 (comparing column 9 to column 7), further confirming the mutually exclusive nature of receptor complexes recruiting P/CAF or RIP140. The input controls clearly showed that RIP140 and RAR were expressed in comparable levels (Fig. 3, lanes G and H). RA-dependent Recruitment of Coregulator Complexes to an RA Reporter Gene Promoter—Previous studies have revealed that the suppressive activity of RIP140 is due to its ability to recruit histone deacetylase to receptor-bound promoters of the target genes (21.Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). P/CAF, on the other hand, has been reported to have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (32.Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 33.Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 559-606Crossref Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Therefore, complexes containing RIP140 or P/CAF could possess opposing enzyme activities and potentially exert antagonistic effects on chromatin remodeling. To examine this possibility, ChIP assays were performed to determine the time dependence of receptor/coregulator recruitment to a reporter gene promoter (IR0-tK-Luc) as well as histone acetylation of the promoter. In COS-1 cells containing sufficient endogenous P/CAF and exogenous RIP140, it appeared that RAR (regardless of the presence or absence of RIP140) was expressed at constant levels (Fig. 4E) and associated consistently with the targeted promoter without any obvious cycling (Fig. 4A). In contrast, both P/CAF and RIP140 exhibited more complex binding patterns over time (Fig. 4B). RIP140 was recruited as early as 15 min following RA treatment and remained strongly associated with receptor DNA until 30 min later when it dissociated from the receptor DNA complex. RIP140 subsequently reassociated with receptor DNA at 90–105 min following RA treatment (Fig. 4B, top). Without exogenous RIP140, P/CAF was clearly recruited to the targeted promoter 45 min following RA treatment with a cycle lasting ∼60 min. Interestingly, P/CAF recruitment was dramatically reduced when RIP140 was present (Fig. 4B, bottom). Note that RIP140 was not recruited during the same period as P/CAF. However, RIP140 apparently delayed P/CAF recruitment as well as reduced the amount of P/CAF associated with the receptor DNA complexes. Finally, we examined the pattern of histone acetylation induced by RA on the target gene promoter with or without additional RIP140 expression (Fig. 4C). RA-induced hyperacetylation occurred in a cyclic fashion, with the first cycle peaking at 30 min following RA treatment (Fig. 4, column 3). The subsequent cycles each spanned ∼40–50 min. With the addition of RIP140, the same pattern occurred with a similar time course for each cycle, but the level of acetylation was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the first reduction in histone acetylation (30–60 min) occurred shortly after the first peak of RIP140 recruitment to the promoter (15–30 min), whereas a dramatic reduction in histone acetylation during the second cycle coincided with the second peak of RIP140 recruitment (90–105 min) (Fig. 4, B and C, columns 7 and 8). Conversely, the second and third cycles of histone acetylation roughly coincided with the recruitment of P/CAF to the promoter (Fig. 4, columns 6 and 9). The cycling of receptor and coregulators on the endogenous RARβ2 promoters was also examined in P19 cells (Fig. 4F). Because this cell line expressed all these components, the experiments were designed to examine the behavior of endogenous factors on the endogenous target gene. Similar to the cycling pattern observed on the artificial promoter in the COS-1 cell system (Fig. 4, A–E), RIP140 was recruited to the endogenous RAR target promoter earlier than P/CAF, with the first peak appearing at 15 min after RA treatment (Fig. 4, column 2). The first peak of P/CAF occurred at 30 min following the addition of RA, coinciding with the first peak of histone acetylation (Fig. 4, column 3). Interestingly, the cycling time of the cofactor recruitment and the acetylation status was about 45 min, slightly shorter than that of the artificial promoter. As seen in the reporter system, RAR was also constantly associated with the DR5 element of the endogenous RARβ2 promoter. RA-dependent Recruitment of Endogenous Coregulator Complexes to the Endogenous RA-regulated Gene Promoters in P19 Cells—To examine the temporal dynamics of coregulator recruitment to different endogenous RA target promoters, we examined the recruitment of endogenous RIP140 and P/CAF to two previously reported RA-regulated genes, a rapidly induced gene RARβ2 and a slowly induced gene TR2 in P19 cells. Similar to what we observed in COS-1 cells, endogenous RAR was associated with both the RARβ2 and TR2 promoters constitutively in P19 (Fig. 5, ChIP lanes, columns 10–12). There was a dramatic increase of RIP140 association to both RARβ2 (Fig. 5, ChIP lanes, bottom) and TR2 (ChIP lanes, top) at 4 h following RA treatment (column 2). RIP140 recruitment to both promoters was decreased by 48 h (Fig. 5, column 3), corresponding to the decreased expression level of RIP140 after long term RA treatment in P19 cells (Western lane) (34.Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P/CAF recruitment to the TR2 promoter occurred to a much lesser degree at both 4 and 48 h (Fig. 5, ChIP lanes, columns 5 and 6). P/CAF recruitment to the RARβ2 promoter was more significant, particularly at 48 h (Fig. 5, column 6). The status of histone acetylation of both promoters was also examined (Fig. 5, columns 7–9). RARβ2 clearly exhibited a higher level of histone acetylation, in particular at 48 h. Histone acetylation of the TR2 promoter was much weaker. Consistently, an early increase of RARβ2 mRNA was readily detected at 4 h of RA induction (Fig. 5, RT-PCR lane, column 2 versus column 1), whereas the mRNA level of TR2 remained largely unchanged at this early time (RT-PCR lane, column 4 versus column 5). At 48 h of RA treatment, both RARβ2 and TR2 transcripts were more dramatically increased (Fig. 5, RT-PCR lane, columns 3 and 6). Suppression of Gene Transcription on in Vitro-reconstituted Chromatin Templates by RIP140—To determine the effect of RIP140 on transcriptional activation by RAR·RXR, we generated a template containing four copies of an IR0 element fused to a G-less cassette (28.Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which could be transcribed into RNA of 280 nucleotides in length. The template was assembled into chromatin, and in vitro transcription was conducted as described under “Materials and Methods.” Without RA, RAR·RXR heterodimers could not activate transcription (Fig. 6, bottom, column 2). The addition of RA alone activated low levels of transcription (Fig. 6, bottom, column 3), possibly due to the presence of endogenous receptors in the nuclear extract. By providing additional receptors, RA induction was more significant (Fig. 6, bottom, column 4). Addition of P/CAF triggered a slightly stronger activation (Fig. 6, bottom, column 5). In contrast, the addition of RIP140 reduced transcription (Fig. 6, bottom, column 6). Adding both RIP140 and P/CAF returned transcription efficiency to levels comparable with those without additional coregulators (Fig. 6, bottom, compare columns 7 and 4), suggesting the presence of sufficient endogenous coactivators. To determine whether P/CAF was one of these factors, nuclear extracts were depleted of P/CAF with an anti-P/CAF antibody and used in transcription assays (Fig. 6, bottom, columns 8–10). Indeed, P/CAF-depleted nuclear extract was much less efficient in promoting transcription (Fig. 6, bottom, compare columns 9 and 4), which could be partially recovered by addition of P/CAF to the transcription reaction (column 8). Current models of hormonal action describe the on/off switches triggered by the recruitment of either coactivators in the presence of hormones or corepressors in their absence. RIP140 has been shown to be a novel coregulator for a number of hormone receptor systems, but its actions seemed contrary to those of either coactivators or corepressors. Like most coactivators, RIP140 is recruited to holoreceptors. However, this recruitment usually leads to a suppression of hormone target genes, consistent with the activity of a corepressor. By using an RA reporter system in our previous studies (22.Chen Y. Kerimo A. Khan S. Wei L.-N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2528-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23.Farooqui M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we formulated a model to explain the action of RIP140 and attributed this novel action to its high affinity toward holoreceptors and its associated histone deacetylase activity. The in vitro transcription assays on reconstituted chromatin templates presented in the current study confirm the suppressive effect of RIP140 on transcription. This suppressive effect may in part be due to a novel receptor-interacting motif, LYYML, in its carboxyl terminus (23.Farooqui M. Franco P.J. Thompson J. Kagechika H. Chandraratna R.A.S. Banaszak L. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24.Wei L.-N. Farooqui M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, because this motif is not capable of recruiting histone deacetylase, it might repress activation only by interfering with the recruitment of coactivators in the in vitro transcription assays. This might explain why the suppressive effect of RIP140 in the in vitro transcription assay was not as pronounced as that observed in the reporter assay. P/CAF has been shown to be a coactivator for a wide variety of transcription factors (35.Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

By using in vivo systems, the current study identifies P/CAF as an important antagonistic target of RIP140 for RAR-targeted genes. Both P/CAF and RIP140 can interact with receptors directly. However, the results of coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays suggest that the receptor complexes containing RIP140 or P/CAF might be mutually exclusive. It is unknown whether these two coregulators can interact with the same receptor simultaneously. It also remains to be determined whether the antagonistic nature of RIP140 toward P/CAF recruitment applies to other RA-regulated genes. ChIP assays revealed an interesting pattern of RIP140 and P/CAF recruitment to the target DNA in COS-1 cells. As predicted, RA receptors are constantly associated with the DNA, whereas the coregulators associate with receptor DNA in a differentially cyclic fashion. On the artificial promoter of RARE-tK, RIP140 recruitment occurs in the very early phase of RA induction (as early as 15 min), and its association peaks at 30 min in the first cycle and 90–105 min in the second cycle. P/CAF recruitment occurs much later, with the first cycle peaking at 60 min and the second cycle beginning at 120 min. Interestingly, despite variations in the recruitment of different coregulators, RA-induced histone hyperacetylation of the gene promoter cycles constantly. Indeed, the initial cycle of histone acetylation occurred despite the recruitment of RIP140 expression, suggesting the involvement of other histone acetyltransferase-containing coactivators in the initial step of histone acetylation. The second and third peaks of acetylation occur at 75 and 120 min, roughly corresponding to the time of P/CAF recruitment. This suggests a role for P/CAF recruitment in the RA-induced acetylation of the promoter, at least for the second and third cycles. On the endogenous RARβ2 promoter in P19, the cycling pattern of the coregulators is similar to that of the artificial promoter in COS-1 cells. However, one cycle took only 45 min, and the cycling of P/CAF parallels closely gene acetylation status. Regardless of the slight difference in the duration of factors cycling in the two cell lines and different target gene systems, the mutually exclusive nature of RIP140 and P/CAF recruitment to the RAR-targeted promoter was consistent. Significantly, in the presence of RIP140, the degree of hyperacetylation is dramatically reduced, mostly between the peaks of acetylation. Moreover, on the artificial promoter, introduction of RIP140 delays and reduces the amount of P/CAF recruited. Apparently, both coactivator (P/CAF) and corepressor (RIP140) complexes can associate with the receptor-targeted promoter following RA treatment, but RIP140 is preferentially recruited and seems to antagonize or attenuate P/CAF recruitment. This effect of RIP140 on the dynamics of P/CAF recruitment could explain, at least partially, its suppressive activity on RA induction of gene activation. One apparent discrepancy in the ChIP assays conducted on COS-1 cells is the significant drop in acetylation between the first and the second peaks despite the lack of significant RIP140 recruitment during this period. It is possible that other unidentified factors are present in these cells to deacetylate histones between the first and the second peaks of acetylation. Alternatively, this may be an effect of the first peak of RIP140 recruitment (30 min), which occurs just prior to hypoacetylation of the promoter. Similar cycles of histone acetylation have been observed in other hormone-inducible gene systems in which the mechanism of acetylation is well studied but the deacetylation between the peaks of acetylation is not as well understood (8.Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 9.Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because RIP140 is recruited in a cyclic fashion to hormone receptor-targeted genes, presumably it could exert its activity repeatedly as long as the levels of hormones and RIP140 are both sufficient. In the ChIP assays conducted to examine endogenous RA-regulated genes in P19 cells, RIP140 was rapidly and effectively recruited to the promoters for both the RARβ2 and TR2 genes. The subsequent decline in association of RIP140 with receptor DNA after long term RA treatment may be due to decreased RIP140 levels in P19 cells, possibly caused by negative feedback on its own expression (34.Kerley J.S. Olsen S.L. Freemantle S.J. Spinella M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, RA-dependent P/CAF recruitment to the RARβ2 promoter seemed to be greater than its recruitment to the TR2 promoter, suggesting gene-dependent variations in cofactor recruitment. This is also reflected by the more obvious induction of histone hyperacetylation on the RARβ2 promoter at 48 h of RA treatment and is in agreement with the much stronger effect of RA induction on RARβ2 than on TR2 (26.Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8820-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Likewise, reduced P/CAF (i.e. coactivator) recruitment coupled with enhanced RIP140 (corepressor) recruitment to the TR2 promoter correlates with the much weaker induction of TR2 by RA in P19 cells. In currently accepted models of hormone actions, the hormone-induced “on” switch for gene transcription elicits an extremely efficient and rapid response in the mammalian genome from a silenced state to an activated state. In contrast, the “off” switch remains somewhat passive and inefficient because it requires the termination of hormone production and, possibly, the degradation of receptors and/or the coactivator complexes. We propose that RIP140 serves as a negative modulator, or a “brake,” for the stimulatory effect of hormones. By rapidly forming complexes with receptors, RIP140 could reduce rapidly and efficiently the levels of hormone-induced expression of certain target genes at an early stage, enabling a smooth transition from a silent to an activated state of transcription instead of an abrupt change in the level of target gene expression. That is, already activated transcription factors could be altered in terms of their enzymatic activities or capacities to accommodate other coregulators. If this model were correct, the ultimate control would reside with the dynamic and kinetic behavior of these coregulator complexes. This may be particularly relevant in a physiological setting where different kinds of complexes are formed in the same cell. It remains unclear whether RIP140 plays a role in transcription initiation. The current study demonstrates a unique role for RIP140 in hormone receptor-mediated events caused by its antagonistic activity toward other coregulators, especially P/CAF. However, RIP140 may exert other functions in other gene activation systems. Indeed, with nine copies of the LXXLL motif scattered throughout the molecule, RIP140 has great potential to interact with numerous receptors. Future challenges include determining how these specific domains interact with other transcription factors, defining their binding affinity and the time course of their association with specific promoters, as well as examining whether the associated histone deacetylase activity provides a common mechanism for the gene-suppressive activity of RIP140.

The arrangement of domains within Bid suggested that Bid function might be regulated in part by alternative splicing. We have determined the gene structure of human Bid and identified a number of novel exons. We have also demonstrated endogenous mRNA and protein expression for three novel isoforms of Bid, generated using these exons. BidS contains the N-terminal regulatory domains of Bid without the BH3 domain; BidEL corresponds to full-length Bid with additional N-terminal sequence; and BidES contains only the Bid sequence downstream of the BH3 domain. Expression of these isoforms is regulated during granulocyte maturation. In functional studies BidEL induces apoptosis, whereas BidS abrogates the pro-apoptotic effects of truncated Bid and inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis. BidES induces apoptosis but is also able to partially inhibit the pro-apoptotic effects of truncated Bid. These three novel endogenously expressed isoforms of Bid are distinct in their expression, their cellular localization, and their effects upon cellular apoptosis. Differential expression of these novel Bid isoforms may regulate the function of Bid following cleavage and thus influence the fate of cells exposed to a range of pro-apoptotic stimuli.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved program of changes in cell biochemistry and structure (1.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar) leading to the loss of cellular functions and to engulfment and removal by phagocytes (2.Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). This process is essential during normal development, in homeostasis, and also in disease pathogenesis (3.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs following activation of specific caspases that amplify apoptotic signals in a cascade of proteolysis leading to cleavage of specific substrates. Caspase activation may be initiated in a number of ways, including ligation of cell surface death receptors (4.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar) or activation of the apoptosome (a large multiprotein complex containing caspase-9) by cytochrome c released from mitochondria (5.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is in turn regulated by the interaction of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins at the mitochondrial surface (6.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian Bcl-2 family members share homology with the prototypic protein Bcl-2 and with the nematode CED-9 protein, across four conserved regions, termed the Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4). Bcl-2 proteins can be broadly divided into three groups according to their ability to either induce or inhibit apoptosis and their structural relationship to Bcl-2 (7.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). In addition to the BH3 domain, all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins described to date contain BH1, BH2, and sometimes BH4 domains. Pro-apoptotic family members either share the multidomain structure (e.g. Bax and Bak) or contain only the BH3 domain (e.g. Bim and Bid). Bcl-2 proteins containing only the BH3 domain have been suggested to play an important role in initiating mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Bid is a 22-kDa “BH3-only” protein with similarity to other Bcl-2 family proteins only within the death-inducing BH3 region (8.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Bid has a unique role in signaling of apoptosis, because it links the death receptor signaling pathway to the mitochondrial signaling pathway mediated by Bcl-2 proteins. Death receptor ligation activates caspase-8, which cleaves Bid, freeing the C-terminal moiety (tcBid) to cooperate in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Examination of the crystal structure of Bid reveals that the hydrophobic face of the BH3 domain, which is exposed in other family members, is enclosed by the N-terminal of Bid and only exposed following proteolytic cleavage of Bid (9.McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10.Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). There appears to be a second functional domain in Bid, in the N terminus, termed the BH3B domain (11.Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which has activity to suppress the apoptogenic activity of the BH3 domain. The region between these two opposing domains is extremely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage, containing cleavage sites for caspases, granzyme B, and various lysosomal proteases. The action of these proteases leads to the creation of two cleavage products (termed tnBid and tcBid). tcBid translocates to mitochondria, where it interacts with other Bcl-2 family proteins to bring about the release of cytochrome c (12.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 13.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that alternative gene splicing may regulate the function of other Bcl-2 family members (14.Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar, 15.Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25255-25261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The structure of Bid, with opposing Bcl-2 homology domains, would potentially be readily regulatable by alternative gene splicing. We therefore investigated the functional regulation of this gene at the molecular level. Antibodies, Reagents, and Cell Lines—All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Culture media (Hanks' balanced salt solution, RPMI 1640, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), LipofectAMINE, and Optimem were from Invitrogen. The antibody against Bid has been described previously (12.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cos, HeLa, Jurkat, HL 60, 293T, and HepG2 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). mRNA from NB4 cells was kindly supplied to us by Dr. M. Lanotte (Paris, France) from cells cultured and stimulated as previously described (18.Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R.

The primers used were BidF4 (exon 2, CTG GGA GAC GCT GCC TCG), BidF7 (exon 3, TGC TGG GAA ACT GTT GAG TG), BidF10 (exon 6, CAA GTG CTG AGG AAG AAA CG), BidR2 (exon 9, AGC CAG TCA CAC TTC TGG AAC), GAPDH 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, green fluorescent protein. forward (AAC TTT GGT ATC GTG GAA GGA C), and GAPDH reverse (TGG TCG TTG AGG GCA ATG). 5′ RACE was performed using the SMART™ RACE kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), using a modification of the protocol to include reduction of nonspecific base pair interaction (GC-Melt™; BD Biosciences Clontech). Gel extraction (Qiaquick; Qiagen), cloning (pCRII-TOPO; Invitrogen), and isolation of plasmid DNA (Concert Rapid; Invitrogen) were performed using commercially available kits according to the manufacturers' instructions. Preprepared mRNA (Premium RNA) was from BD Biosciences Clontech, and cDNA was prepared using standard reverse transcription techniques.

The PCR product obtained was purified, and was cloned directly into pCR3.1. Correct orientation and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing. The inserts were subcloned by restriction enzyme digestion from these vectors into suitable pEGFP vectors (Living Colors; Clontech). pcDNA3.1.tBid.myc-His was generated by subcloning from pCR3.1.tBid into pcDNA3.1(+)myc-His (Invitrogen). pCR3.1.FLAGBcl-2 and pCR3.1.FLAGBax were generated by subcloning from the appropriate pEF FLAG puro vector, kindly supplied to us by Dr. D. Huang (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). Transfection—A549 cells maintained in RPMI and 10% fetal calf serum were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105/ml into 6-well plates and were transfected using LipofectAMINE in Optimem. The day after transfection, the presence of green fluorescent protein (transfection control) was examined by fluorescence microscopy. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum and seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105/ml into 6-well plates. Transfection was with the calcium phosphate method (20.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysates were prepared as previously described (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A8.40-A8.55Google Scholar), and in vitro translation was performed using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein samples were loaded on polyacrylamide gels such that protein from 1 × 106 cells (or in the case of preprepared samples, 50 μg of protein) was loaded per lane. Electrophoresis, transfer, and probing were performed using standard methods. Confocal Microscopy and Cell Staining—The cells were examined under magnifications in the range of 100× to 1000- using a Molecular Dynamics CLSM 2010 coupled to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Excitation was with the 488- or 568-nm line of the krypton-argon laser. Mitochondrial staining was with Mitotracker Red 580 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Golgi staining was performed with BODIPY TR ceramide analogue (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear staining was performed using propidium iodide on formaldehyde fixed cells at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Endoplasmic reticulum staining was with rhodamine 6G chloride (Molecular Probes) and was performed according to the published protocol (22.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E.

Statistical Analysis—Where appropriate the results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of the number (n) of independent experiments, with each experiment performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni (see Figs. 5, A and C, and 7) and Dunnett (see Fig. 5B) post-test correction for multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Significance was assumed at levels of p < 0.05.Fig. 7Interaction of Bid-isoforms with other Bcl-2 family proteins. A, A549 cells transfected with the vectors expressing the inserts shown were assessed for rates of apoptosis, as described under “Experimental Procedures”. BidL and BidEL significantly increased rates of apoptosis compared with empty vector control (p < 0.001 in each case), that is inhibited by co-transfection with Bcl-2 (p < 0.001 compared with either isoform alone), consistent with functional interaction between these proteins in vivo. In contrast, the pro-apoptotic effects of BidES were not significantly abrogated by Bcl-2. B, A549 cells transfected with the vectors expressing the inserts shown were assessed for rates of apoptosis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bax shows significantly increased rates of apoptosis compared with empty vector control (p < 0.01). This can be abrogated by co-transfection with Bcl-2 (p < 0.05 compared with Bax alone) but not by co-transfection with BidS or BidES (p > 0.5 compared with Bax alone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Novel Bid-related Proteins in Human Cells—A search of the known sequence for human Bid against the genomic sequence of chromosome 22 identified five coding exons analogous to those coding for murine Bid (23.Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). In addition, a sixth noncoding exon is present, which lies ∼25 kilobase pairs 5′ of the Bid gene, which we have designated as exon 2 (Fig. 1). This exon has been previously recognized to be part of the Bid gene (24.Sax J.K. Fei P. Murphy M.E. Bernhard E. Korsmeyer S.J. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A second previously undescribed 5′ exon of the Bid gene exists within an expressed sequence tag (accession number AA338833) that maps to chromosome 22 just 5′ of exon 2 and that we have designated exon 1. To identify mRNA species utilizing exon 1 or 2 in association with other bid exons, 5′ RACE was performed. Neutrophil mRNA was chosen as the source of transcripts, because of our interest in death receptor signaling in these cells (25.Renshaw S.A. Timmons S.J. Eaton V. Usher L.R. Akil M. Bingle C.D. Whyte M.K. J. Leukocyte. Biol. 2000; 67: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26.Renshaw S.A. Parmar J.S. Singleton V. Rowe S.J. Dockrell D.H. Dower S.K. Bingle C.D. Chilvers E.R. Whyte M.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and because transcripts of alternatively spliced products were abundant in myeloid cell lines in preliminary experiments (data not shown). Using 5′ RACE, a number of alternatively spliced transcripts were isolated, including transcripts utilizing two further previously undescribed exons. The third of these novel exons we refer to as exon 3, the genomic locus of which is located 3′ of exon 2. mRNA transcripts contained exon 3 as the most 5′ exon, and this was identified either in continuity with exons 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, or in alternatively spliced isoforms “missing” exon 4 or exons 4 and 5. The fourth novel exon, which we refer to as exon 6 was isolated between sequences corresponding to exons 2, 4, and 5 and exons 7, 8, and 9. Translation of these novel transcripts creates three potential novel proteins, which we have named BidS (accession number AY005151) for “short,” BidEL (accession number AF250233) for “extra long,” and BidES for “extra short.” BidES is generated from a number of splice variants that share the common feature of loss of the first AUG together with the potential for translation from an internal AUG within exon 7 of the Bid gene. A summary of all the splice variants of bid isolated by PCR, RACE, and searching the GenBank™ data base is shown in Fig. 1A. For the sake of clarity, we will use “BidL” to refer specifically to the previously described gene product of the Bid gene (8.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) and “Bid” where the reference is to a more general property of the gene and its products. Putative protein products of these splice variants are shown in Fig. 1B. BidEL is predicted to have an additional 45 amino acids at the N terminus that do not contain any recognized conserved domains. BidS contains only the unopposed regulatory BH3-B domain, omitting the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain. There are an additional 63 amino acids at the C terminus of BidS that are entirely novel and that contain no recognized conserved domains. BidES contains the final 99 amino acids of BidL, beginning with the terminal amino acids of the BH3 domain and including the sequence likely to be involved in mitochondrial targeting of Bid (27.Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Differential Expression of Bid Isoforms—Using specific primers, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” PCR was performed using a commercially available RNA panel (Premium RNA; Clontech) to screen a variety of tissues. Using primers in exons 2 and 9 of bid (BidF4, BidR2), a three-banded pattern was seen in all of the tissues studied (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of cDNA extracted from these bands confirmed that these correspond to cDNA for BidL and two transcripts for BidES (designated BidES (2.Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar) and BidES (3.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar) in Fig. 1A). Using primers in exons 3 and 9 (BidF7 and BidR2), transcripts encoding BidEL were detected predominantly in tissues with large numbers of hemopoetic cells (e.g. spleen and bone marrow). BidEL was also expressed at high levels in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, as might be expected given the importance of Bid in regulating neuronal cell death (28.Plesnila N. Zinkel S. Le D.A. Amin-Hanjani S. Wu Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Transcripts corresponding to cDNA for BidES (4.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar) and BidES (5.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were also detected. PCR using primers to exon 6 and 9 (BidF10 and BidR2) shows expression of cDNA for BidS in a similar distribution to cDNA for BidEL. In addition, a range of transformed cell lines was screened for the presence of mRNA for Bid isoforms. mRNA for BidL, BidES (2.Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), and BidES (3.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar) were seen in Cos, HeLa, HL60, Jurkat, and 293T cells. mRNA for BidS was seen in all of the above cell lines, and mRNA for BidEL was seen only in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). There is therefore evidence of endogenous mRNAs expressing all of the isoforms identified by RACE. To demonstrate endogenous protein expression, we screened a panel of primary tissues by Western blotting. Immunoreactive bands of appropriate size were seen for BidEL in spleen, placenta, and pancreas; for BidS in lung, pancreas, and spleen; and for BidES in lung and pancreas (Fig. 3A). Transformed cell lines with high levels of mRNA expression of various Bid isoforms were also screened for Bid protein expression. Both HeLa cells and 293T cells contain an immunoreactive band that migrates at the same size as in vitro translated BidS (Fig. 3B). Jurkat cells contain a low intensity protein band of ∼27 kDa on Western blotting with an anti-Bid antibody that migrates at an identical size to BidEL overexpressed in the 293T cell line (Fig. 3B) and to in vitro translated BidEL (data not shown). We were thus able to identify protein bands on Western blotting that correspond to either in vitro translated or transfected BidEL and BidS, confirming endogenous expression of these proteins. Recently, a role for BidL in regulation of myeloid homeostasis, including peripheral blood neutrophil numbers, has been demonstrated using Bid-/- mice (29.Zinkel S.S. Ong C.C. Ferguson D.O. Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Bronson R.T. Kutok J.L. Alt F.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore examined expression of Bid isoforms in two models of neutrophil maturation. NB4 cells are members of a myeloid leukemia cell line that, following treatment with retinoic acid, undergo biochemical and functional differentiation along the neutrophil lineage, such that by 24 h these cells share many characteristics with mature neutrophils (18.Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ruchaud S. Duprez E. Gendron M.C. Houge G. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Doskeland S.O. Lanotte M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). With progressive maturation, NB4 cells expressed higher levels of BidEL (Fig. 4). BidS levels did not consistently change in these experiments. In addition, we studied BidL, BidEL, and BidS expression in myeloid precursors extracted from bone marrow by density gradient centrifugation (19.Bjerregaard M.D. Jurlander J. Klausen P. Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 4322-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31.Cowland J.B. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells extracted in this way represent progressively more mature neutrophil precursors and are here compared with circulating neutrophils from the same donor. Mature neutrophils express more of both BidEL and BidS (Fig. 4), in part paralleling the data from NB4 cells. Thus, not only are transcripts for BidEL and BidS expressed in a variety of primary tissues, they are differentially regulated between tissue types and, during maturation of a single cell type, the neutrophil granulocyte. Effects of Bid Isoforms on Cellular Apoptosis—Based on the predicted protein structure determined for the Bid isoforms (Fig. 1B), each of the three novel isoforms would be predicted to behave in different ways to modulate the activity of Bid following cleavage and activation. We hypothesized that BidS, containing only the inhibitory BH3B domain, could act as a naturally occurring inhibitor of tcBid-induced apoptosis. BidEL is identical to BidL at the C terminus, contains the BH3 domain, and differs only in the N-terminal fragment. BidEL might therefore induce apoptosis in a similar way to BidL, but the additional N-terminal sequence might influence the subcellular localization of BidEL or perhaps alter the cleavage and activation of BidEL. Because BidES, which again lacks a BH3 domain, corresponds to the portion of Bid that localizes to the mitochondrial surface, we hypothesized that BidES might interrupt the action of cleaved BidL at the mitochondria. To test these hypotheses we first assessed the potential of BidS, BidEL, and BidES to modulate apoptosis in an overexpression assay. Apoptotic morphology was assessed in A549 cells transfected with the following constructs: pCR3.1.empty vector, pCR3.1.BidEL, pCR3.1.BidS, pCR3.1.BidL, or pCR3.1.BidES as described under “Experimental Procedures” (16.Bingle C.D. Craig R.W. Swales B.M. Singleton V. Zhou P. Whyte M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22136-22146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In keeping with our predictions, transfection with constructs expressing BidL or BidEL induced high levels of apoptotic morphology, whereas BidS did not (Fig. 5A). BidS did not protect against cell death caused by the transfection process. In contrast to the hypothesis based on predicted structure, BidES, which contains no functional BH3 homology domains, appeared to induce apoptosis, albeit to a lesser degree than BidL and BidEL. We then tested the ability of the novel isoforms to interfere with BidL signaling. To simulate the specific effects of Bid activation, the cells were transfected with a construct expressing tcBidL (pCR3.1.tcBidL). This mimics the effects of isolated BidL cleavage, without direct activation of caspase pathways, as might occur with death receptor ligation. The ability of BidS and BidES to inhibit tcBidL-induced cell death was tested in comparison with a construct expressing the N terminus of BidL (pCR3.1.tnBidL), which has previously been shown to inhibit the effects of tcBidL (32.Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). BidS and BidES both significantly inhibited tcBidL-induced apoptosis to a similar degree to tnBidL (Fig. 5B). These studies also included an investigation of a further construct, corresponding to the N-terminal fragment of BidEL, to assess the effects of the additional N-terminal sequence on the ability of the cleavage product tnBidEL to inhibit tcBidL-induced apoptosis. tnBidEL, unlike tnBidL, did not significantly inhibit tcBidL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). We further explored the ability of BidS to inhibit apoptosis by investigating whether BidS could inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in a “type II” cell, which requires Bid activity to complete the apoptotic program following Fas ligation. HepG2 cells are a hepatocellular line, with a type II phenotype (23.Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Transient transfection with pCR3.1.BidS protected HepG2 cells from CH-11 (an anti-Fas agonistic antibody)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C), consistent with a role for BidS in direct inhibition of tcBidL-induced apoptosis. Subcellular Distribution of Bid Isoforms—Because the function of Bid is thought to relate to the ability of the active C-terminal cleavage fragment to translocate from cytoplasm to mitochondria, we investigated the subcellular localization of the various Bid isoforms using GFP fusion proteins. Transfection of a construct expressing GFP-BidL into A549 cells showed the expected diffuse distribution (Fig. 6a). When the cells were transfected with constructs for GFP-BidS, the fluorescence was similarly distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 6b), suggesting that the additio"

Here we show that the p35 transcript and protein are also present in the testis, and an active Cdk5·p35 complex exists in this tissue as well. Cdk5 and p35 are prominently observed in elongating spermatid tails, particularly over the tail outer dense fibers (ODF). The appearance of Cdk5·p35 proceeds from the proximal to the distal end of elongating spermatids, coinciding with the proximal to distal assembly of ODF along the length of the tail axoneme. Incidentally, increased Cdk5·p35 activity is observed in isolated elongating spermatids and at a time when elongating spermatids appear in the developing testis, suggesting a role for Cdk5·p35 in spermiogenesis. The presence of Cdk5 and p35 in ODF isolated from rat sperm tails implies a strong association among these proteins. In vitro ODF phosphorylation by Cdk5·p35 and decreased in vivo sperm tail ODF phosphorylation in p35-deficient mice indicate that Cdk5·p35 is an integral component of ODF and that ODF is a functional Cdk5·p35 target in the testis. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Cdk5·p35 may participate in the regulation of sperm tail development via a mechanism involving ODF phosphorylation.

Apparently, as in brain development, Cdk5·p35 plays a part in testis development. Activity of Cdk5·p35 is crucial for normal brain development. It has been demonstrated that brains of Cdk5-/- mice lack cortical and hippocampal lamination as well as cerebellar foliation (1.Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in p35 likewise show disruptions in cortical lamination but display only mild hippocampal defects and have a fairly normal cerebellum (2.Chae T. Kwon Y. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). There are indications that phenotypic alterations in Cdk5-/- or p35-/- mice are due to specific errors in neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and neuronal migration (3.Ohshima T. Gilmore E.C.

Germ cell morphogenesis and migration during testis development are reminiscent of neuronal morphogenesis and migration during brain development. The spermiogenic phase of spermatogenesis, in which small round nondescript spermatids elongate and transform into highly specialized spermatozoa capable of coordinated swimming motions (5.Grootegoed J.A.

Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar), seems to particularly recapitulate the leading edge extension process and migration of neurons, which accounts for their proper positioning in the brain (7.Lambert de Rouvroit C.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In concurrence with its role in neuronal development, many of the identified Cdk5 substrates are cytoskeletal proteins such as neurofilament (9.Lee K.Y. Johnston R.N. Brain Res. 1997; 773: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), actin-associated proteins such as Pak1 (10.Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and microtubule-associated proteins such as Map1b (11.Paglini G. Pigino G. Kunda P. Morfini G. Maccioni R. Quiroga S. Ferreira A. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9858-9869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tau (12.Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Anzai K. Imahori K. Uchida T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cdk5·p35 also phosphorylates Nudel, which interacts with the LIS1-dynein complex to regulate dynein-mediated axonal transport along microtubules (13.Niethammer M. Smith D.S. Ayala R. Peng J. Ko J. Lee M.S. Morabito M. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 697-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). LIS1, the protein product of a gene mutated in lissencephaly, a human neuronal migration defect, can modulate microtubule organization and dynein distribution (14.Reiner O. Neuron. 2000; 28: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nudel, on the other hand, is a LIS1-interacting protein that has sequence homology to gene products implicated in fungal nucleokinesis (15.Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both LIS1 and Nudel are enriched in neuronal growth cones (13.Niethammer M. Smith D.S. Ayala R. Peng J. Ko J. Lee M.S. Morabito M. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 697-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Cdk5·p35 contributes to the overall neuronal architecture and function through the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics including those of actin, microtubules, and microtubule-associated proteins.Spermiogenesis is characterized by major structural transformations in the round spermatid, including chromatin condensation, nuclear shaping, acrosome development, and tail formation. These transformations involve structures that are chiefly associated with spermatids such as the perinuclear theca, manchette, fibrous sheath, and outer dense fibers (ODF). 1The abbreviations used are: ODF, outer dense fiber(s); RT, reverse transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: ODF, outer dense fiber(s); RT, reverse transcription. The perinuclear theca is composed of a range of proteins of varying functions (16.Tovich P.R. Oko R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32431-32438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in a number of essential cellular processes during spermiogenesis (17.Oko R. Aul R.B. Wu A. Sutovsky P. Robaire B. Chemes H.E. Morales C.R. Andrology in the 21st Century: Proceedings of the VIIth International Congress of Andrology. Medimond Publishing Co.

Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The manchette, comprised of a specialized microtubule array, has in particular been implicated in nuclear shaping (19.Russell L.D. Russell J.A. MacGregor G.R. Meistrich M.L. Am. J. Anat. 1991; 192: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the sperm tail contains in its core a contractile axoneme composed of microtubules, similar to the motile cilia or flagella, it is far more complex than both. Indeed, the fibrous sheath, consisting of longitudinal columns and associated ribs, and the ODF, composed of nine coarse fibers, are the most prominent cytoskeletal elements of the tail and give the spermatozoa motile apparatus its distinctive morphological features (20.Oko R. Clermont Y. Gagnon C. Controls of Sperm Motility: Biological and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 3-27Google Scholar). Thus, as in neuronal architecture and function cytoskeletal dynamics clearly play a major role in the morphogenesis and function of the spermatozoa.Three ODF cDNAs from rat, encoding the 26-kDa ODF1 (51.Morales C.R. Oko R. Clermont Y. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 84-kDa ODF2 (21.Shao X. Tarnasky H.A. Schalles U. Oko R. van der Hoorn F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6105-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and ∼110 kDa ODF3 (22.Petersen C. Aumuller G. Bahrami M. Hoyer-Fender S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) proteins, have been cloned and characterized. However, analysis of the polypeptide composition of the rat ODF based on relative mobilities on polyacrylamide gels suggests the existence of six major and several minor polypeptides (23.Vera J.C. Brito M. Zuvic T. Burzio L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5970-5977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The major ODF polypeptides are rich in aspartic and glutamic acids, leucine, tyrosine, cysteine, glycine, serine, and proline (23.Vera J.C. Brito M. Zuvic T. Burzio L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5970-5977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kim Y.H. McFarlane J.R. O'Bryan M.K. Almahbobi G. Temple-Smith P.D. de Kretser D.M. J. Reprod.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5970-5977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies indicate that ODF functions in maintaining the passive elastic structures and elastic recoil of the sperm tail (26.Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1975; 44: 394-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), improving the bending torque of the tail (27.Lindemann C.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and/or protecting the sperm tail against shear forces during epididymal transport and ejaculation (28.Baltz J.M. Williams P.O. Cone R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation state of the ODF polypeptides may influence such functions and possibly affect sperm motility. Indeed, multiple protein kinases have been implicated in the activation of sperm tail motility (29.Chaudhry P.S. Creagh S. Yu N. Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30.NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, to date, no specific kinase has been associated with sperm tail ODF phosphorylation. In this study we explored a potential function for the proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, Cdk5, in the developing testis, particularly in differentiating spermatids. We provide evidence that the Cdk5 activator, p35, and p35-associated Cdk5 activity exist in elongating spermatids and show for the first time that Cdk5·p35 is a sperm ODF kinase that may regulate sperm tail development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Antibodies—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the University of Calgary Biological Sciences Animal Facility. p35+/- and p39+/- breeding pairs that were kindly provided by Dr. Inez Vincent (University of Washington) and Dr. Li-Huei Tsai (Harvard University), respectively, were used to generate wild type, p35-/-, and p39-/- mice. The Cdk5 (polyclonal C-8 and monoclonal DC-17), p35 (C-19), cyclin D1 (72–13G), cyclin E (HE-12), and actin (I-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The proline-directed phosphothreonine antibody was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The ODF antibody was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Richard Oko (24.Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).PCR/RT-PCR—To detect the specific PCR products of Cdk5 (650 bp), p35 (268 bp), p39 (365 bp), and actin (414 bp), cDNAs generated from DNase 1-treated RNAs (isolated using Trizol, Invitrogen) by RT reaction were used as the template for PCR reactions. PCR was carried out using Taq from Invitrogen. The following primers were used: Cdk5 forward primer (TGAGGGTGTGCCAAGTTCAGC) and reverse primer (GGCATTGAGTTTGGGCACGAC); p35 forward primer (CAGGACCAGGGTTTCATCACACC) and reverse primer (GTGGGTCAGCATTGATCTGCAGC), p39 forward primer (AGTCGCTTCGTGGGGACGAGCT) and reverse primer (GTTCATAGTCCAGTGCTTGGCTC), β-actin forward primer (GAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGA) and reverse primer (AGGAA GAGGATGCGGCAGTGG).Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with radiolabeled RT-PCR product generated using the primers indicated above. DNA probes were radiolabeled by random priming (31.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar) using the rediprime DNA labeling system (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 65 °C in hybridization buffer containing 5× sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA or SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1–3× Denhardt's solution, 0.1–0.5% SDS, 100–200 μg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 5 m saturated tetrapyrophosphate sodium salt in double distilled H2O. The blot was exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak-Biomax-LS) for 24–72 h.Immunohistotochemistry, Immunogold Labeling, and Identification of Stages of the Cycle and Steps of Spermiogenesis—Immunohistochemistry, immunogold labeling, and identification of stages of the cycle and steps of spermiogenesis were performed as described previously (32.Oko R.

A single cell suspension was obtained by repeated pipetting of tubules and filtration through a 120-μm nylon mesh. Pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongating spermatids were then isolated by centrifugal elutriation (33.Grootegoed J.A. Grolle-Hey A.H. Rommerts F.F. van der Molen H.J. Biochem.

Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C and filtration of supernatants through 0.45 μ m filters. Tissue homogenates (1 mg) or gel filtration samples (500 μg) were precleared with protein A-agarose beads and incubated with fresh beads (preadsorbed with either anti-Cdk5 (C-8) or anti-p35 (C-19)) for2hona rotating platform at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with the indicated primary antibody and corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce or Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

The amount of [γ-32P]phosphate incorporated into histone was measured using a Beckman LKB 1215 scintillation counter.Sperm Tail Isolation and ODF Purification—Isolation of sperms and sperm tails and ODF purification were performed as described previously (32.Oko R. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Dephosphorylation and ODF Phosphorylation Assay—Samples of purified ODF were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Dephosphorylation of immobilized ODF was performed as we described previously (52.Rosales J.L. Nodwell M.J. Johnston R.N. Lee K.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-Cdk5 and glutathione S-transferase-p25 (2 μg each) were then added to kinase assay buffer (35.Lee K.Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of nitrocellulose-bound ODF was allowed to proceed for 1 h at RT in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. ODF phosphorylation by Cdk5·p25 was detected by autoradiography.RESULTSCdk5 and p35, but Not p39, Are Expressed in Mouse and Rat Testes—Initially we examined adult rat and mouse testes for Cdk5, p35, and p39 (a p35 isoform) transcript expression. As shown in Fig. 1A, RT-PCR revealed the presence of transcripts of Cdk5 (upper right panel) and p35 (upper left panel), but not p39 (lower left panel), in rat and mouse testes. These findings were supported by a parallel analysis of brain (positive control) and testes from p35-/- and p39-/- mice (negative controls for p35 and p39, respectively). Because p35 and p39 are intronless single exon genes, genomic DNA contamination will result in false positive PCR products. To prove that the PCR products are indeed derived from p35 or p39 cDNAs from the RT reaction and not from potential genomic p35 or p39 DNA contamination, isolated DNase 1-treated RNAs were used as template for each PCR negative control reaction (-), although the overall negative control contained double distilled H2O instead of DNA. RT-PCR amplification with rat β-actin gene primers spanning intron II was used to confirm the success of reverse transcriptase reactions using cDNA as template. The RT-PCR findings concurred with results from Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B), which showed that the transcript for p35 (upper left panel) but not p39 (upper right panel) was present in testis. Densitometric analysis showed that the expression level of p35 mRNA in rat brain is ∼10-fold more than in the testis (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis also revealed that both Cdk5 and p35 proteins are expressed in rat (Fig. 2A) and mouse (Fig. 2B) testes. Consistent with p35 mRNA levels, p35 protein expression in rat brain was ∼10-fold more than in the testis (Fig. 2C, right panel). Cdk5 protein expression in rat brain was 5-fold that in testis (Fig. 2C, left panel).Fig. 2Cdk5 and p35 proteins are expressed in rat and mouse testes. Rat (A, lane 2) and mouse (B) testes homogenates (100 μg) were analyzed by Western blot analysis using Cdk5 (C-8), p35 (C-19), and actin (I-19) antibodies. Rat brain served as the positive control, and p35-/- mouse served as the negative control for p35. p25 is an active truncated form of p35. The asterisk denotes an intermediate processing product of p35. Wt, wild type.

Cdk5 and p35 were immunoprecipitated from adult rat testis homogenates, and kinase assays were performed using histone H1 as substrate. Fig. 3A shows that both p35 and Cdk5 immunoprecipitates from testis had significant kinase activity. The specificity of Cdk5·p35 activity in the testis was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using blocked antibodies or addition of roscovitine, a potent Cdk5 inhibitor (36.Bibb J.A. Chen J. Taylor J.R. Svenningsson P. Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Yan Z. Sagawa Z.K. Ouimet C.C. Nairn A.C. Nestler E.J. Greengard P. Nature. 2001; 410: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 37.Kesavapany S.

Coimmunoprecipitation of Cdk5 with p35 (Fig. 3B, lane 2) supports the existence of active Cdk5·p35 complexes in the testis. Analyses for histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 3C) and presence (Fig. 3D) of Cdk5 in p35 immunoprecipitates from brain and testis further revealed that the specific activity of Cdk5·p35 in testis was comparable with that in brain (Fig. 3E). Thus, although both Cdk5 and p35 expression in testis are considerably lower than that in brain as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the Cdk5·p35-specific activity in these tissues is similar. Together, the above data provide the first evidence for the presence of the Cdk5 activator, p35, and p35-associated Cdk5 activity in testis.Fig. 3p35-associated Cdk5 activity is present in testis. A, Cdk5 and p35 immunoprecipitates from rat testis homogenates (500 μg) were analyzed for histone H1 kinase activity. The remaining activity in blocked immunoprecipitates (ip) may be attributed to incomplete blocking by the peptide antigen. B, Western blot analysis of the p35 immunoprecipitate (lane 2) using a Cdk5 antibody (C-8); lane 1 is a blocked p35 immunoprecipitate. C–E, the specific activity of Cdk5·p35 in testis is comparable with that in brain. Cdk5·p35 was immunoprecipitated from rat testis (1) and brain (2) homogenates (500 μg) using a p35 antibody (C-19).

In spermatids, diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining was first observed in steps 7/8 (stage VII/VIII; Fig. 4, A and D), became stronger by step 12 (stage XII; Fig. 4B), and plateaued from steps 13 to the end of step 17 (stages XIII-V; Fig. 4, A and C). In steps 18 and 19 (stages VI-VIII; Fig. 4, A and D), the cytoplasmic staining became more intense as residual p35 became progressively concentrated in the shrinking cytoplasmic lobe. At spermiation, the superfluous spermatid cytoplasm containing p35 was phagocytosed as residual bodies (arrow, Fig. 4D) by the Sertoli cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase labeling of the elongating spermatid tail progressed in a proximal to distal direction, reaching the edge of the tubular lumen in stage XI (step 11 spermatids) and the center of the lumen in stage XII/XIII (Fig. 4, A and B). Thereafter, the tail labeling became progressively more intense, peaking between stages II-V (steps 16 and 18; Fig. 4, A and C) and remaining intense in mature spermatids that were ready to be extruded into the tubular lumen (Fig. 4, A and D). At higher magnification p35 appeared to surround the axoneme of tails cut in cross-section (arrow, Fig. 4E) or line the axoneme on either side in longitudinal tail sections (Fig. 4F). Immunostaining for p35 in adult mouse testis showed a similar pattern as that in rat (data not shown). Staining for Cdk5 also revealed immunoreactivity in Leydig cells (asterisk, Fig. 4G), Sertoli cells (arrow, Fig. 4H), and elongating spermatids (Fig. 4, G, I, and J) throughout all stages of the seminiferous epithelium. As with p35, Cdk5 was distinctly present in elongating spermatids with staining becoming increasingly prominent as the spermatids mature. Tail staining was similarly observed surrounding the axoneme (arrows, Fig. 4, I and J), and cytoplasmic staining likewise became stronger in the shrinking cytoplasmic lobes that were phagocytosed as residual bodies (arrows, Fig. 4G; asterisk, Fig. 4J) by the Sertoli cell cytoplasm.Fig. 4p35 and Cdk5 in the testis are distinctly localized to elongating spermatids.

https://openalex.org/W2020211791,"DNA topoisomerase II is a multidomain homodimeric enzyme that changes DNA topology by coupling ATP hydrolysis to the transport of one DNA helix through a transient double-stranded break in another. The process requires dramatic conformational changes including closure of an ATP-operated clamp, which is comprised of two N-terminal domains from each protomer. The most N-terminal domain contains the ATP-binding site and is directly involved in clamp closure, undergoing dimerization upon ATP binding. The second domain, the transducer domain, forms the walls of the N-terminal clamp and connects the clamp to the enzyme core. Although structurally conserved, it is unclear whether the transducer domain is involved in clamp mechanism. We have purified and characterized a human topoisomerase IIα enzyme with a two-amino acid insertion at position 408 in the transducer domain. The enzyme retains both ATPase and DNA cleavage activities. However, the insertion, which is situated far from the N-terminal dimerization area, severely disrupts the function of the N-terminal clamp. The clamp-deficient enzyme is catalytically inactive and lacks most aspects of interdomain communication. Surprisingly, it seems to have retained the intersubunit communication, allowing it to bind ATP cooperatively in the presence of DNA. The results show that even distal parts of the transducer domain are important for the dynamics of the N-terminal clamp and furthermore indicate that stable clamp closure is not required for cooperative binding of ATP.

DNA topoisomerase II is a multifunctional and highly complex enzyme that is able to change the topological conformation of DNA in response to different physiological alterations (1.Burden D.A.

Topoisomerase II enzymes mediate topological changes by introducing a transient break in one DNA duplex, the G segment, while another duplex, the T segment, is coordinately transported through the gated DNA. During the process, ATP is required to drive the enzyme through a series of dramatic conformational changes dependent on both interdomain and intersubunit communication (4.Bjergbaek L. Kingma P.

The N-terminal and core regions, containing the two catalytic entities, are highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms and also share homology with DNA gyrase, which represents the bacterial DNA topoisomerase II counterpart. The active site for ATP hydrolysis is encompassed in the N-terminal region, whereas that of DNA cleavage and ligation is located in the central region. The C-terminal part shows no sequence conservation and is dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro (9.Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21335-21343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell.

The N-terminal region of topoisomerase II forms an ATP-operated clamp that closes upon ATP binding, allowing trapping of the T segment (6.Roca J. Wang J.C.

The crystal structures of the yeast and bacterial N-terminal topoisomerase II fragments reveal that the dimeric N-terminal clamp contains two domains in each protomer (8.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 12.Classen, S., Olland, S., and Berger, J. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 12.Classen, S., Olland, S., and Berger, J. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar, 13.Lamour V. Hoermann L. Jeltsch J.M. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18947-18953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This domain shares homology with the GHKL-type ATPases including topoVI-B (14.Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and MutL (15.Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), for which a similar clamp operation has been observed. The second domain, called the transducer domain, bridges the N-terminal ATPase domain and the core region. Based on the yeast topoisomerase II structure, the transducer domain comprises the walls in a 6-Å-wide hole formed upon clamp closure, and it has been suggested to push the T segment through the DNA gate (12.Classen, S., Olland, S., and Berger, J. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar). The domain furthermore contains a loop that extends into the ATP-binding pocket and harbors a highly conserved lysine that contacts the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide (8.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 12.Classen, S., Olland, S., and Berger, J. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on structural and biochemical analyses of the loop region, communication between the ATP-binding GHKL domain and the central domain of the enzyme responsible for DNA cleavage/ligation has been suggested to go through the transducer domain (13.Lamour V. Hoermann L. Jeltsch J.M. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18947-18953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16.Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Upon nucleotide binding and closure of the N-terminal clamp, the transducer domain undergoes a large domain rotation, probably facilitating opening of the DNA gate in the G segment bound by the central domain (14.Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent studies surprisingly revealed that the transducer domain also bears structural homology to MutL and the archea topoVI-B, and similar conformational effects of nucleotide binding have been reported for the transducer domain of these GHKL-ATPases, indicating that the structure and motion of this domain play a conserved role in the clamp mechanism (14.Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). According to the available structures of the yeast topoisomerase II core, it is a heart-shaped dimer comprised of two domains, A′ and B′, showing homology to the subunits of DNA gyrase, gyrase A and gyrase B, respectively (17.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The A′ domain contains the active site tyrosine covalently attached to the 5′ end of the DNA during cleavage (18.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and encompasses a large cavity holding the transported DNA after passage through the G segment (17.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The B′ domain constitutes the interface between the transducer domain and the A′ domain (17.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). It is essential for DNA cleavage (17.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 19.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has a proposed role in the separation of the cleaved DNA ends moving the A′ domain by undergoing large rearrangements in response to signals from the ATPase domain (5.Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Minimization of energy usage in DNA topoisomerase II requires a tight coupling between ATP consumption and DNA strand passage (20.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations have indicated that this is obtained through an extensive interdomain and intersubunit communication facilitating an appropriate temporal order of catalytic steps and conformational changes. Thus, binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain stimulates cleavage of the G segment bound by the core region, and DNA binding increases the turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis (4.Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7.Skouboe C. Bjergbaek L. Oestergaard V.H. Larsen M.K. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5768-5774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP binding occurs cooperatively only in the presence of a DNA substrate, meaning that DNA is required for intersubunit communication between the two ATP-binding sites in topoisomerase II (20.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ATP per se induces clamp closure and triggers enzyme catalysis (6.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 21.Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas hydrolysis of ATP is believed to accelerate the DNA strand passage event as well as enzyme resetting (7.Skouboe C. Bjergbaek L. Oestergaard V.H. Larsen M.K. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5768-5774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22.Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we have demonstrated that deletion of amino acids 351–408 located in the C-terminal part of the transducer domain of human topoisomerase IIα disturbs interdomain communication (4.Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To further dissect the role of the transducer domain, we have characterized a human topoisomerase IIα enzyme with two amino acids, leucine and glutamic acid, inserted at position 408. The insertion leaves both catalytic domains active, but strand passage is abolished. The clamp function is severely disrupted, even though the insertion is situated far from the dimerization domain, demonstrating the importance of the transducer domain for the clamp mechanism. The clamp-deficient enzyme is disturbed in domain communication, because the ATPase activity of the mutant enzyme lacks the normal response to DNA, and the DNA cleavage activity is unaffected by nucleotide binding. However, to our surprise, the DNA-mediated cooperativity in ATP binding seems to persist in 408i, indicating that stable clamp closure is not a prerequisite for intersubunit communication. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ201 (Matα ura3 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 can1 top2::TRP1) and JEL1ΔTop1 (kindly provided by J. C. Wang) were used for complementation and overexpression of topoisomerase II constructs, respectively. Plasmid pBY105 contains the yeast TPI promotor inserted into the polylinker region of the LEU2/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS315, which was used as the backbone for pHT212, pHT300, and pHT408i, carrying the wild-type human TOP2α cDNA with a C-terminal hexahistidine tail, the untagged human TOP2α cDNA, and the human TOP2α cDNA with an insertion of two amino acids (LE) at position 408, respectively. Modified versions of YEpWOB6 were used for overexpression of the hexahistidine-tagged human topoisomerase IIα and 408i enzymes. Construction of Plasmids—The construction of pHT300 and pHT408i (pHT407-2) was described by Jensen et al. (10.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For overexpression of the hexahistidine version of the human topoisomerase IIα wild-type and 408i enzymes, the topoisomerase IIα cDNA of YEpWOB6 was first modified with a hexahistidine tail at the C terminus. For this purpose, a C-terminal fragment of topoisomerase IIα fused to a hexahistidine tail was generated via polymerase chain reaction using pHT212 as template. The 3′ primer was designed with a stretch of 54 overhanging nucleotides containing the hexahistidine tail and three restriction sites for cloning. The annealing segment of the primer was the reverse complementary sequence of the human c-Myc epitope (5′-TCC CCC CGG GGC GGC CGC CTC GAG CTA ATG ATG GTG GTG ATG GTG GCT CCC ACG GTT CAA GTC TTC TTC AGA GAT CAA C-3′). The 5′ primer sequence was identical to nucleotides 2973–2991 of the human topoisomerase IIα cDNA sequence (5′-GAG AGA GTT GGA CTA CAC-3′). The generated polymerase chain reaction fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of human topoisomerase IIα in YEpWOB6 employing BlnI and XmaI as 5′ and 3′ cloning sites, respectively. Yeast Transformation and Complementation—Yeast cells were transformed using a modified version of the LiAc method of Ito et al. (23.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of 408i to complement the lack of endogenous topoisomerase II in BJ201, the LEU2-based pHT408i construct was transformed into BJ201, and the cells were transferred to media plates containing 5′fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/ml) to select against the URA3 plasmid carrying the Schizosaccharomyces pombe top2+ gene (10.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pHT300 was used as a positive control. Human Topoisomerase IIα Induction, Overexpression, and Purification—The recombinant human topoisomerase II enzymes were overexpressed in yeast strain JEL1ΔTop1 by the addition of galactose to glucose-free medium (18.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were extracted with 2 volumes of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma). Further preparation of yeast extracts was done according to the procedure of Jensen et al. (10.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The initial purification step using a 6-ml Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid-agarose column was as described previously by Biersack et al. (24.Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For further purification, the fractions pooled from the Ni2+ column were loaded onto a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), and elution was performed by a 15-ml linear NaCl gradient ranging from 400 to 1500 mm. The peak fractions were further applied to a phosphocellulose column (P11 cellulose phosphate; Whatman) for concentration of the enzyme. Elution was performed in 750 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7. Fractions containing topoisomerase II enzyme were pooled and stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. Homogeneity of the topoisomerase II preparations was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis after staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA Relaxation—DNA relaxation was performed by incubating 2 or 10 nm topoisomerase II and 6.5 nm supercoiled pUC19 DNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 1 mm ATP. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped after 20 min by the addition of SDS and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.1% and 10 mm, respectively. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TBE buffer (100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Clamp Closing Assay—For clamp closing experiments, 10 nm topoisomerase II was preincubated with 6.5 nm negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA for 5 min in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2. After preincubation, AMPPNP 1The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP, adenylylimidophosphate. (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 5 min. The reactions were next stopped by the addition of either NaCl or SDS to final concentrations of 800 mm and 1%, respectively. The sample volume was increased to 70 μl by adding 50 μlofan800mm NaCl solution. To trap enzyme-DNA catenanes, phenol extraction was performed by adding 1 volume of phenol. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The water phase was removed, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for gel analysis. The combined phenol phase and phenol/water interphase was washed one time in high salt washing buffer (2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 5 mm MgCl2) and one time in 0.6 m LiCl. Upon removal of the water phase after the last wash, the remaining material was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. The samples were next subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Clamp Closing Analyzed by Analytical CsCl Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—The technique used is essentially that described previously by Morris et al. (25.Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures of 30 μl containing 150 nm topoisomerase II, 250 nm relaxed pBR322 (topoGEN), or linearized pUC19 plasmid DNA in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. AMPPNP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 10 min. To each sample, 130 μl of sample buffer and 334 μl of saturated CsCl solution were added. The samples were run at 20 °C and at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Scans were taken at 260 and 280 nm until equilibrium was reached (about 40 h). ATP Binding Assay—100 nm topoisomerase IIα was incubated with 0.3 nm [γ-35S]ATP (600 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 4.5 nm pUC19 plasmid DNA or 20 μm AMPPNP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and loaded onto a nitrocellulose filter using a slot blot apparatus (PR 648 Slot Blot Manifold; Amersham Biosciences). The filter was washed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 800 mm KCl. Loading of samples were performed at a rate of 1 ml/min. A Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) was used for quantification. For measure of protein retention, a similar experiment was performed in the absence of [γ-35S]ATP, but in this case the filter was subjected to Western blot analysis with the pentahistidine antibody (Qiagen) recognizing the His-tagged topoisomerase II enzyme. Topoisomerase II-mediated Hydrolysis of ATP—The ATPase assay was based on the method of Osheroff et al. (26.Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions contained 100 nm topoisomerase II in the presence or absence of 20 nm negatively supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA. The reactions were carried out in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2 containing a final concentration of 1 mm cold ATP and 2 μCi (0.033 μm) of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 2.5-μl aliquots were spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates impregnated with polyethylenimine (Merck). Chromatography was performed using freshly made 0.4 m NH4HCO3. Levels of free phosphate were quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides—DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA Technology Corp. and purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Andersen et al. (27.Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 28-mer used as the bottom strand in the suicide substrate was modified at the 3′ end by a phosphate group to inhibit ligation to this end. Topoisomerase II-mediated Cleavage of Suicide Substrates—Hybridization and labeling of the synthetic oligonucleotides were done according to the procedures described by Andersen et al. (27.Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, 20 nm topoisomerase II was incubated with 0.05 pmol of labeled substrate in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to 1%. Covalent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were recovered from a phenol/water interphase according to Gocke et al. (28.Gocke E. Bonven B.J. Westergaard O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7661-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The complexes were subsequently ethanol-precipitated and treated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 3 h at 42 °C. One volume of gel loading buffer (50% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanole, 5 mm EDTA) was added, and the material was subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Topoisomerase II-mediated Ligation—A topoisomerase II-mediated suicide cleavage reaction was performed as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of NaCl to 0.4 m, thereby preventing further cleavage during the ligation reaction. Ligation was initiated by the addition of 50 pmol of 45-mer ligation substrate. After 15 min of further incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS to 1%. The samples were ethanol-precipitated, proteinase K-digested, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Topoisomerase II-mediated Cleavage of Circular DNA—Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage was performed by incubating 100 nm of topoisomerase II and 6.5 nm negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA in a total volume of 20 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 7 min, and the cleavage products were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%. After proteinase K digestion (0.8 mg/ml), the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 nm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining (1 μg/ml). When reactions were carried out in the presence of ATP or AMPPNP, the concentration of the nucleotide was 1 mm. Human Topoisomerase IIα Containing a Two-amino Acid Insertion at Position 408 Is Unable to Complement Growth in a Yeast top2 Deletion Strain—To study the role of the transducer domain in DNA topoisomerase II, we have characterized a human topoisomerase IIα enzyme (408i) having an insertion of two amino acids at position 408 in the transducer domain (Fig. 1A, left panel). Based on alignment to the homologous part of yeast topoisomerase II, the insertion is located in the lower part of the transducer domain, as indicated in the structure of the N-terminal yeast fragment (Fig. 1A, right panel). The insertion has been presented earlier in a linker scanning analysis of human topoisomerase IIα (10.Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), where it was found to be among the few that abolished the ability of the human enzyme to sustain growth in an S. cerevisiae top2 deletion strain. This conclusion was confirmed by the complementation analysis shown in Fig. 1B. For studies of the in vitro capabilities of 408i, the enzyme fused to a hexahistidine tail at the C-terminal end was overexpressed in a top1 null strain and purified to homogeneity as seen from the Coomassie-stained gel in Fig. 1C. Purified 408i Is Unable to Perform Relaxation of Supercoiled Plasmid DNA—To investigate whether the inability of 408i to complement is due to a defect in the DNA strand passage activity of the enzyme, a DNA relaxation assay was performed, and the catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme was compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Although 10 nm of the wild-type enzyme relaxed all the supercoiled DNA within 20 min, the insertion mutant showed no sign of relaxation in these molar ranges (Fig. 2). Thus, consistent with the lack of in vivo complementation, these results reveal that insertion of two amino acids at position 408 is detrimental to the overall enzyme activity. Either the mutant enzyme fails to perform one or more of the steps involved in strand passage and catalytic turnover, or alternatively, the two-amino acid insertion disrupts correct folding of the protein. Insertion at Position 408 Severely Disturbs the Function of the N-terminal Clamp—Preceding strand passage, topoisomerase II binds ATP and changes into the closed clamp conformation. To test whether the enzyme, bearing an insertion in the N-terminal transducer domain, has retained this important function of the N terminus, a clamp closing assay was performed (modified from Bjergbaek et al. (4.Bjergbaek L. Kingma P. Nielsen I.S. Wang Y. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13041-13048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). The enzyme was preincubated with supercoiled plasmid DNA before the addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP. With the wild-type enzyme this leads to the formation of salt stable topoisomerase II-DNA interlinked complexes, which can be collected from a phenol-water interph"
https://openalex.org/W1979050518,"The oncoprotein gankyrin plays a central role in tumorigenesis and cell proliferation. Gankyrin interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), increases phosphorylation at specific residues of Rb by CDK4/6 in vivo, and promotes tumorigenesis. The phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6 leads to the deregulation of the cell cycle during G1/S transition. Although how phosphorylation occurs on Rb has been studied extensively, the mechanism of site-specific phosphorylation of Rb remains unclear due to a lack of information on the structural arrangement of Rb and CDK4/6. Here, we have determined and refined to 2.3-Å resolution the crystal structure of a gankyrin homolog, the non-ATPase subunit 6 (Nas6p) of the proteasome from yeast. The crystal structure reveals that Nas6p contains seven ankyrin repeats. The number of the repeats is different from that predicted from the primary structure. Nas6p also possesses an unusual curved structure with two acidic regions at the N- and C-terminal regions separated by one basic region, suggesting that it has at least two functional surfaces. The tertiary structure of Nas6p, together with the previous biochemical studies, indicates that the CDK4/6 and Rb binding surfaces of gankyrin are located at the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, and face the same side of gankyrin. These observations suggest that gankyrin brings Rb and CDK4/6 together through gankyrin-Rb and gankyrin-CDK4/6 interactions and determines the relative positioning of the substrate (Rb) and the enzyme (CDK4/6). Our findings provide mechanistic insight into site-specific phosphorylation of Rb caused by CDK4/6. The oncoprotein gankyrin plays a central role in tumorigenesis and cell proliferation.

Our findings provide mechanistic insight into site-specific phosphorylation of Rb caused by CDK4/6. Tumorigenesis is mainly regulated by both oncoproteins and tumor suppressors in the G1/S transition during the cell cycle. In this regulatory pathway one of the key factors is the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; INK, CDK inhibitor; ANK, ankyrin repeat; Nas6p, non-ATPase subunit 6. 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; INK, CDK inhibitor; ANK, ankyrin repeat; Nas6p, non-ATPase subunit 6. (1.Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Rb binds to the transcription factor E2F, which is required for the expression of genes involved in the G1/S transition and inhibits its transactivation function. The hyperphosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) leads to the release of E2F from the Rb·E2F complex and degradation of Rb by the proteasome via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. The release of E2F triggers activation of a number of genes required for G1/S transition and tumorigenesis. Therefore, to better understand the regulatory mechanism of the cell cycle and tumorigenesis, regulation of site-specific phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6 must be clarified. Rb phosphorylation by CDK4/6 is regulated mainly by proteins containing ankyrin repeats, gankyrin (gann ankyrin: gann means cancer in Japanese) for positive regulation and INK4 (CDK4/6 inhibitor) for negative regulation (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in addition to cyclin for activating CDK4/6 (4.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Cyclin interacts on one side of the CDK catalytic cleft, inducing large conformational changes in its active center and activating the kinase by broadening the entrance of the catalytic cleft (5.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Rb contains at least 16 consensus sequences for CDK phosphorylation, and the significance of these residues has been demonstrated (6.Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Rb phosphorylation at specific residues by CDK4/6 remains unclear. Recent studies reveal that gankyrin also interacts with CDK4/6 and enhances CDK4/6 phosphorylation activity toward Rb by competing with INK4 (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to cyclin, gankyrin interacts with Rb in addition to CDK4/6 (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and increases Rb phosphorylation at specific residues in vivo (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that gankyrin has different or additional roles from cyclin for activating CDK and determining site specificity for Rb. Although the mechanism of Rb phosphorylation at specific residues by CDK4/6 in this pathway is still unclear, the tertiary structure of gankyrin will provide insight into the mechanism of site-specific phosphorylation of Rb for the following reasons. The interaction of gankyrin with the substrate (Rb) and enzyme (CDK4/6) is simultaneously involved in the determination of the site-specific phosphorylation of Rb (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and likely adjusts the relative position of those molecules to facilitate Rb phosphorylation. Additionally, the mechanism of negative regulation has been clarified by analysis of the tertiary structure of the CDK4/6·INK4 complex (7.Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8.Brotherton D.H. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X. Parisini E. Smith B.O. Archer S.J. Serrano M. Brenner S.L. Blundell T.L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). INK4 binding to CDK4/6 is well known to induce conformational change around the ATP-binding site of CDK4/6, to interfere with ATP binding, and to inactivate CDK4/6 phosphorylation activity (7.Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8.Brotherton D.H. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X.

Therefore, the tertiary structure of gankyrin provides a mechanism for site-specific phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6. Here, we present the tertiary structure of the non-ATPase subunit 6 (Nas6p) and gankyrin homolog refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å. Our results reveal that Nas6p has a concave structure with seven ankyrin repeats. The CDK4/6 and Rb binding surfaces of Nas6p are located at N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, and are facing on the same side, suggesting that gankyrin promotes the correct placement of Rb and CDK4/6. These structural results provide a gankyrin-mediated mechanism of site-specific phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Yeast Nas6p was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified and crystallized as described elsewhere (9.Adachi N. Padmanabhan B. Kataoka K. Kijima K. Yamaki M. Horikoshi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 859-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—All diffraction data were collected at the beamlines BL6A and BL18B of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The structure was determined by the MIR method at 3.0-Å resolution and refined to 2.3 Å with data from a native crystal (Table I). The native and derivative data were indexed and processed with DPS (10.Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two platinum sites and one gold site were found and refined using SOLVE (11.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The experimental map at 3.0 Å produced by SOLVE was improved by solvent flattening and extended to 2.7 Å with SOLOMON incorporated in CCP4 (12.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). After solvent flattening and phase extension, the map was good enough to trace the secondary structure elements using O (13.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The map was further improved by combining the experimental phases with the calculated phases obtained from initial fitting. After the first refinement round, the R-factor was 27.4%, and Rfree was 32.3%. The model was refined with CNS (14.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar) using a maximum likelihood target that included amplitude and phase probability distributions. Phase-combined, σA-weighted electron density maps were used throughout to guide further model building and to determine the location of water molecules. The current refined model at 2.3-Å resolution consists of 228 residues, 104 water molecules with a final R-factor of 19.4% and an Rfree of 22.9%. Electron density for side chains of the first two residues at the N terminus was absent. The stereochemistry of Nas6p is excellent as checked with PROCHECK (15.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Gankyrin was also isolated as a p28 subunit of the human 19S proteasome (16.Hori T. Kato S. Saeki M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Takeuchi J. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nas6p, which is similar to gankyrin, is also a subunit of the yeast 19S proteasome (16.Hori T. Kato S. Saeki M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Takeuchi J. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and shares high sequence similarity with gankyrin. Sequence comparison studies showed that gankyrin possesses 35% identity and 52% similarity with Nas6p (Fig. 1). These structural and functional observations have indicated that Nas6p is a yeast homolog of gankyrin. The crystal structure of yeast Nas6p composed of 228 residues was solved by the MIR method at 2.7-Å resolution and was refined to 2.3-Å resolution (Fig. 2A). The tertiary structure of Nas6p is an elongated structure with overall dimensions 74 Å × 36 Å × 33 Å (Fig. 2B). Previous primary structure analysis suggested that Nas6p and gankyrin have five or six ankyrin repeats with flexible N- and C-terminal segments (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16.Hori T. Kato S. Saeki M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Takeuchi J. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the predicted number of ankyrin repeats of Nas6p is different from its crystal structure, which consists of seven ankyrin repeats (ANK1 to ANK7 in Fig. 2C). Each ankyrin repeat is formed by ∼30 amino acid residues with a β-hairpin and helix-loop-helix motif (the only exception is ANK1, which lacks the β strand β1) (17.Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Many conserved residues have been found between the ankyrin repeats (Fig. 2D). Hydrophobic interactions caused by conserved residues Leu-6, Ala-9, and Leu-21 occur within and between the repeats. A motif, PLH is conserved among the ankyrin repeats and is positioned at the start of the α1 helix. However, in ANK7, this PLH motif is absent; also, the helix α1 corresponding to this region is shorter compared with the equivalent helix in other ankyrin repeats. ANK2-6 possess hydrophobic faces on either side formed by preceding and successive repeats, whereas ANK1 and -7 are highly exposed to the solvent and contain a high proportion of charged residues. An Unusual Curved Structure of Ankyrin Repeats in Nas6p—To obtain further insight into the tertiary structure of Nas6p, we compared Nas6p to another ankyrin repeat protein. Among the tertiary structures of known ankyrin repeat proteins, the oncoprotein Bcl-3 also contains seven ankyrin repeats (18.Michel F. Soler-Lopez M. Petosa C. Cramer P. Siebenlist U. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6180-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bcl-3 is a member of the IκB protein family that can enhance NFκB-dependent transcription. The primary structure of Bcl-3 has 29% identity and 43% similarity with that of Nas6p and 29% identity and 55% similarity with that of gankyrin. Although both proteins, Nas6p and Bcl-3, have the same number of ankyrin repeats, the overall tertiary structures of these proteins are quite different (Fig. 3A). Superposition of the Nas6p (red in Fig. 3A) and Bcl-3 (cyan in Fig. 3A) structures reveals that Nas6p has a more concave structure than does Bcl-3. The seven ankyrin repeats in Nas6p possess uniform backbone conformations, as expected from the relatively high degree of sequence similarity between the motifs (Fig. 2D) except for ANK7. ANK1 lacks the β strand β1 and possesses a shorter linker region that connects ANK2 compared with the other repeats (ANK2-7). In ANK2, -3, and -5, the linker chain is relatively longer compared with that found in ANK1, -4, and -6. This insertion of a longer chain causes more bending, and thus, the overall shape of Nas6p resembles a concave structure (called “banana-shaped” structure). The helix α2 in ANK1 is not parallel to its equivalent helix in ANK2 (Fig. 3B). Region 27-30 forms a sharp turn toward the α2 region of ankyrin repeats, and thus, the side chains of Leu-29 and Leu-30 undergo hydrophobic interactions with residues in the linker region of ANK2. In addition, more bulky side chain residues (Phe, Lys, Gln, Glu, and His) are found in helix α2 of these two repeats (ANK1 and -2). These arrangements might be the reason for the wider separation of the C-terminal ends of these two helices. Similarly, helix α2 in ANK3 is also not parallel to its equivalent segment in ANK4 (Fig. 3C). A wide separation between these two segments at the C-terminal end is probably due to Arg-94 and Pro-95. The side chain of Arg-94 has strong electrostatic interactions with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Met-59, Glu-60, and Val-62, which are positioned in the linker region of ANK2. These electrostatic interactions favor inclination against α2 of ANK4 by pulling the C-terminal end of helix α2 of ANK3 segment toward ANK2. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, the presence of bulky side chains in these helices also favors this type of arrangement; otherwise severe clashes would occur if these two segments are in parallel. Also, the axes of equivalent helices α2 in ANK5 and -6 are slightly widened at C-terminal ends from each other, probably due to the presence of a bulky side chain Tyr-197 in ANK6. The equivalent residue in other repeats possesses a small hydrophobic residue, except in ANK2 and -3 (Lys-58 and Arg-94), where they contribute to similar structural arrangements in these regions. Another interesting feature is that the linker region between ANK2 and -3 is longer, whereas that between ANK4 and -5 is shorter than those found in other repeats. Thus, the above structural arrangements are key factors that contribute to the overall tertiary structure of Nas6p, which looks more bent and in a concave-like structure. Features of the Molecular Surface of Nas6p—Electrostatic surface potential analysis of Nas6p showed that the regions of ANK1-4 and ANK6-7 have negatively charged surfaces (Fig. 4A). In addition, the central region contains mainly basic residues, like a stepping-stone (Nas6p: Lys-117, Lys-118, Arg-134, Lys-136, Lys-138, Arg-146, Lys-154, Lys-164, and Lys-172). These residues seem to be a boundary that divides the function of the N- and C-terminal regions. Comparison of Nas6p and INK4 Tertiary Structures—The tertiary structure of Nas6p reveals a long and concave structure with two acidic and one basic region. Because gankyrin is a human homolog of Nas6p, gankyrin might also possess similar structural features. Intriguingly, the tertiary structure of gankyrin 2A. J. Wilkinson, personal communication. is similar to that of Nas6p. In addition, the amino acid distributions on the molecular surface, including the N-terminal, boundary, and C-terminal regions, are also conserved through evolution between Nas6p and gankyrin (Figs. 1 and 4B). Therefore, we have attempted to predict the tertiary structure of the CDK4/6·gankyrin complex based on the tertiary structures of Nas6p and the CDK4/6·INK4 complex. Recent biochemical studies show that the N-terminal region of gankyrin (corresponding to ANK1-4) is responsible for CDK4/6 binding (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To understand the characterization of the gankyrin-CDK4/6 interaction, we have superimposed ANK1-4 of Nas6p and ANK1-4 of INK4 (Fig. 5A) (7.Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8.Brotherton D.H. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X. Parisini E. Smith B.O. Archer S.J. Serrano M. Brenner S.L. Blundell T.L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The superimposition reveals that the folds of ANK1-4 of both proteins are quite similar (Fig. 5B). Thus, gankyrin and INK4 would bind to CDK4/6 in a similar manner. The crystal structures of CDK4/6·INK4 complexes showed that ANK2 and -3 are mainly involved in intermolecular interactions. ANK2 and -3 in gankyrin, therefore, might be good candidates for interactions with CDK4/6. Unique features of INK4 are, compared with other ankyrin repeats in this family of inhibitory factors, a shorter helix α1 of ANK2 and a long loop that connects helices α1 and α2. These regions of INK4 alter the tertiary structure of the ATP-binding site of CDK4/6, interfering with ATP binding and inhibiting the phosphorylation activity of CDK4/6 (7.Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8.Brotherton D.H. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X. Parisini E. Smith B.O. Archer S.J. Serrano M. Brenner S.L. Blundell T.L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, ANK2 of Nas6p does not have these features. This suggests that structural deviation of the ANK2 in gankyrin from INK4 might be important for the interaction between gankyrin and CDK4/6 without CDK inactivation. Comparison of Nas6p and INK4 Molecular Surface—The surface charges of the interacting surface (ANK1-4) of both Nas6p and INK4 with CDK4/6 are quite different; Nas6p is acidic, and INK4 is hydrophobic (Fig. 5C, yellow circle). Gankyrin is also acidic, as the residues exposed on the surface as well as the distribution of charged amino acids in this region are well conserved with Nas6p (Fig. 1, cyan box, and Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the surface charge of the CDK4/6-interacting surface of INK4 is weakly basic, whereas the surface charge of the predicted CDK4/6-interacting surface of gankyrin is acidic. Thus, the interaction between gankyrin and CDK4/6 might be stronger than the interaction between INK4 and CDK4/6. These findings agree well with previous biochemical studies showing that gankyrin counteracts the inhibition of CDK4/6 by INK4 (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we propose a model that gankyrin and INK4d bind to the same surface of CDK4/6 through an almost similar binding fashion but compete with different surface charge. The elucidation of the structure of the CDK4/6-gankyrin complex and biochemical and mutational studies are necessary to further understand how gankyrin interacts with CDK4/6 by competing with INK4. Model for Interaction of Gankyrin with Rb and CDK4/6—In the proposed structure of the gankyrin-CDK4/6 complex (Fig. 5B), the C-terminal region of gankyrin extends and bends toward the active center of CDK4/6. This free C-terminal region might interact with some target molecules and recruit them to CDK4/6 as substrates. The C-terminal region of gankyrin contains an LXCXE motif, which is responsible for the binding of Rb in vivo (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies indicate that the LXCXE motif region of gankyrin is sufficient for Rb binding in vitro (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the binding of CDK4/6 and Rb with gankyrin is independent (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, gankyrin is physically associated with CDK4/6 and Rb at its N- and C-terminal regions, respectively (Fig. 5D). The LXCXE peptide binding to Rb is an extended β strand-like conformation (19.Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas the LXCXE motif in Nas6p and gankyrin is an α helical conformation. These results suggest three possibilities for gankyrin-Rb interaction through the LXCXE motif; they are (i) conformation of the LXCXE motif in a peptide and in a protein are different, (ii) the LXCXE motif of gankyrin is induced to fit to Rb and subsequently alters its structure in the β strand-like conformation, or (iii) gankyrin binds Rb through other surfaces. The dual independent functional roles of gankyrin are most likely due to structural features. Therefore, our proposed complex structure model of CDK4/6 binding to ANK1-4 and of Rb binding to ANK6 and ANK7 of gankyrin would logically fit well with both biochemical and mutational studies in vitro (3.Li J. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and previous studies reveal that overexpression of gankyrin induces Rb phosphorylation in vivo (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The region of Rb whose structure is solved contains at least two consensus sequences for CDK phosphorylation (19.Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this proposed complex structure model the residue in Rb (Thr-373) that is phosphorylated depending on gankyrin overexpression (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is close to the active center of CDK4/6 (Fig. 5D, orange circle). In contrast the residue in Rb (Ser-780) that is not phosphorylated by the dependence of gankyrin overexpression (2.Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S. Nonoguchi K. Kido T. Mayer R.J. Arii S. Fujita J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is located in the opposite side of the active center of CDK4/6 (Fig. 5D, cyan circle). This model indicates that gankyrin bridges Cdk4/6 and Rb and makes the active center of Cdk4/6 and the phosphorylation site of Rb face each other. Rb also interacts with E2F. Previous studies show that E2F and the LXCXE binding motifs are located in different regions of Rb (19.Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20.Ikeda M.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7029-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21.Wu E.W. Clemens K.E. Heck D.V. Munger K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that, using another surface for INK4 interaction, CDK4/6 might also interact with cyclin D (5.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies along with our proposed model suggest that gankyrin bridges Rb·E2F and CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes in a large regulatory complex (Fig. 5E). These issues will be clarified by the elucidation of the crystal structure of the CDK4/6·Rb·gankyrin complex, the CDK4/6·cyclin D·Rb·E2F·gankyrin complex, and so on. We thank Dr. A. J.

Deduced amino acid sequences of the α- and β-subunit of E. histolytica FT (EhFT) were 298- and 375-residues long with a molecular mass of 35.6 and 42.6 kDa, and a pI of 5.43 and 5.65, respectively. They showed 24% to 36% identity to and shared common signature domains and repeats with those from other organisms. Recombinant α- and β-subunits, co-expressed in Escherichia coli, formed a heterodimer and showed activity to transfer farnesyl using farnesylpyrophosphate as a donor to human H-Ras possessing a C-terminal CVLS, but not a mutant H-Ras possessing CVLL. Among a number of small GTPases that belong to the Ras superfamily from this parasite, we identified EhRas4, which possesses CVVA at the C terminus, as a sole farnesyl acceptor for EhFT. This is in contrast to mammalian FT, which utilizes a variety of small GTPases that possess a C-terminal CaaX motif, where X is serine, methionine, glutamine, cysteine, or alanine. EhFT also showed remarkable resistance against a variety of known inhibitors of mammalian FT. These results suggest that remarkable biochemical differences in binding to substrates and inhibitors exist between amebic and mammalian FTs, which highlights this enzyme as a novel target for the development of new chemotherapeutics against amebiasis.

Ras small GTPases function as a molecular switch of signal transduction in cell proliferation and differentiation (1.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Ras small GTPases require a post-translational lipid modification called protein farnesylation in order to become membrane-associated and functional (2.Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Kikuchi A. Kawata M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133: 187-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).

Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). FT and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGT-I) catalyze the transfer of the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, respectively, to the cysteine residue of a C-terminal CaaX of small GTPases including Ras, Rac, and Rho, where C is cysteine, a is usually an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid. Marked differences in substrate specificity have been shown between FT and GGT-I, i.e. FT mainly utilizes, as substrates, small GTPases possessing the terminal CaaX motif, when X is serine, methionine, glutamine, cysteine, or alanine (4.Moores S.L.

Among well characterized Ras proteins that terminate with a CaaX motif, human H-Ras-CIMF, N-Ras-CVVM, K-RasA-CIIM, and Rap2-CNIQ are known to be farnesylated by FT, while Rap1A-CLLL, as well as Rho family proteins are geranylgeranylated by GGT-I. It has also been shown that K-RasB-CVIM can be either farnesylated by FT or geranylgeranylated by GGT-I (5.James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Since constitutively active mutations of Ras proteins have been shown to induce carcinogenesis (6.Tabin C.J. Bradley S.M. Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. Papageorge A.G. Scolnick E.M. Dhar R. Lowy D.R.

The completion of the E. histolytica genome data base will help us to comprehensively understand the presence and complexity of these small GTPases in the ameba.

In this report, we describe the molecular and biochemical characterization of the α- and β- subunits of FT of E. histolytica (EhFT) using recombinant proteins co-expressed in Escherichia coli. We also show that only one amebic Ras protein among the many small GTPases tested is farnesylated by EhFT. In addition, we show that the amebic FT exhibits marked resistance to a variety of compounds that are known to inhibit mammalian FT, indicating that the amebic FT possesses distinct biochemical properties from the mammalian FT. Parasite—Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS cl6 (23.Diamond L.S. Mattern C.F. Bartgis I.L. J. Virol. 1972; 9: 326-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured axenically in BI-S-33 medium at 35.5 °C (24.Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Chemicals—Recombinant human H-Ras-CVLS (wild type), H-Ras-CVLL (mutant type), FPT inhibitor-I {(E,E)-2-[(dihydroxyphosphinyl)methyl]-3-oxo-3-[(3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrienyl)-amino]propanic acid, trisodium salt}, FPT inhibitor-II {(E,E)-2-[2-oxo-2-[[(3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrienyl)oxy]amino]ethyl]phosphonic acid, disodium salt}, Gliotoxin, α-hydroxyl farnesylphosphonic acid, and a peptidomimetic inhibitor FTI-276 {N-[2-phenyl-4-N-[2(R)-amino-3-mercaptopropylamino]benzoyl]-methionine]} were obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). [3H]FPP (16.1 Ci/mmol) and [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (23.0 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA), and [35S]GTPγS (1,173 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Biochemical (Tokyo, Japan). The other chemicals and reagents used were from either Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan) or Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise mentioned and of the highest purity available. cDNA Library of E. histolytica—A trophozoite cDNA library of E. histolytica was constructed using the poly(A)+ RNA and λZAP II phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (25.Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Identification and Cloning of FTα and FTβ of E. histolytica—We designed oligonucleotide primers to amplify FTα and FTβ protein-coding regions from E. histolytica by PCR based on a homology search using yeast and mammalian FT in the E. histolytica genome data base available at The Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org/tdb/). The sense primer for EhFTα was 5′-ATGGAAGAAGACGAAGAAATCACATTTG-3′. Sense and antisense primers for EhFTβ were 5′-ATGGAAATTGAAGAAGTAGAAGTAGAAACTGTTAC-3′ and 5′-TTAGAGCGAACGGAAATACTCACAACGCTTATC-3′, respectively. Since we did not find a sequence containing the C terminus of FTα in the data base, we used T7 primer, located downstream of the cloning site of our cDNA library, to amplify the FTα-coding region. PCR was performed using a one-hundredth volume of the cDNA phage lysate as template with the following parameters. An initial step of denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. A final step at 72 °C for 10 min was used to complete the extension. The amplified DNA fragments were electrophoresed, purified using a Geneclean II kit (BIO101, La Jolla, CA), and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 using a SureClone Ligation Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed with an ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. Identification and Cloning of Ras Small G Proteins of E. histolytica—To identify substrates for the amebic FT, we searched for putative Ras homologues in the E. histolytica Genome data base via a TBLASTN search using amebic (EhRas1and EhRas2) and mammalian Ras as inquiry sequences. We identified 8 previously uncharacterized putative full-length Ras genes. The C terminus of these Ras proteins ended with Phe (four genes), Leu (two), Met (one), or Ala (one). The two latter genes encoding putative Ras proteins containing the CSVM- or CVVA-C terminus (identical to EH02830 and EH01021 in the E. histolytica genome data base) were assumed to be good candidates to be farnesylated by the amebic FT, designated EhRas3 and EhRas4, respectively, and characterized further. A protein coding region of EhRas1-4, and EhRacC were amplified by PCR using cDNA as template and appropriate primers based on the sequences in the genome data base. Sequence Analysis—FTα and FTβ protein sequences from E. histolytica and 9 other organisms, and 20 putative Ras and Ras-related proteins of E. histolytica were retrieved from the TIGR and the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases (www.ncbi.nih.gov/) using the BLASTP and TBLASTN algorithms. The protein alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed with ClustalW version 1.81 (26.Tompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method (27.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with the Blosum matrix created using the ClustalW program (26.Tompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Unrooted NJ trees were drawn with TreeView ver.1.6.0 (28.Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Branch lengths and bootstrap values (1000 replicates) (29.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from the NJ analysis. Construction of a Plasmid to Express Recombinant EhFT—A plasmid containing the protein-coding regions of FTα (without the stop codon), FTβ (with the stop codon), and the ribosome binding sequence (GAGGAGTTTTAACTT) between them were constructed by three rounds of PCR using the recombinant approach (30.Higuchi R. Innnis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar, 31.Omer C.A. Diehl R.E. Kral A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, two sets of initial PCRs were conducted to amplify the FTα and FTβ protein-coding region using a sense primer, 5′-ATGGAAGAAGACGAAGAAATCACATTTG-3′ and an antisense primer, 5′-ATGATTAGTAATTTTTGTTAAATACCAATCCC-3′ (for FTα); a sense primer, 5′-ATGGAAATTGAAGAAGTAGAAGTAGAAACTGTTAC-3′ and an antisense primer, 5′-TAAGAGCGAACGGAAATACTCACAAGCCTTATC-3′ (for FTβ). Two sets of second PCRs were conducted using the respective product of the first reaction as a template. To amplify the FTα protein-coding region (excluding the stop codon), flanked by a BamHI site (italicized) and the ribosome binding site (underlined), a sense primer, 5′-GGAGGATCCCATGGAAGAAGACGAAGAAATCACATTTG-3′ (primer 1) and an antisense primer, 5′-AAGTTAAAACTCCTCATGATTAGTAATTTTTGTTAAATACCAATCCC-3′, were used. To amplify the FTβ sequence including the stop codon, flanked by the ribosome binding site (underlined) and a HindIII site (italicized), sense, 5′-GAGGAGTTTTAACTTATGGAAATTGAAGAAGTAGAAGTAGAAACTGTTAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCAAAGCTTTAAGAGCGAACGGAAATACTCACAAGCCTTATC-3′ (primer 2) were used. The third round of PCR was conduced using a mixture of the products of the second round, and primers 1 and 2. The resulting 2.1-kb PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into BamHI- and HindIII-double digested pQE31 to construct pEhFTαβ. In pEhFTαβ, the FTα and FTβ protein-coding regions placed in tandem were presumably translationally coupled, facilitating co-expression of these two subunits at similar levels. An N-terminal histidine tag was also engineered in EhFTα to facilitate purification. Construction of Plasmids to Express Recombinant Small GTPases—A protein-coding region of EhRas1-4, and EhRacC flanked by additional BamHI and SalI sites (italicized), were amplified by PCR using cDNA as a template and sense and antisense primers: 5′-GGA-GAATCCCATGACTGCCAATACATATAAATTAGTTATG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCGACTTAGAACATTATGCATTTCTTTTCTTTCTT-3′ (EhRas1); 5′-GGAGAATCCCATGACTACAAATACTTATAAATTAGTTATGCTTG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCGACTTATAACAATTCACACTTTGATTTAGAAGG-3′ (EhRas2); 5′-GGAGAATCCCATGAGTTTAAAAAGAATTGTTATGCTTGGA and 5′-CCAGTCGACTTACATAACAGAACATCCAATTTTCTTATA-3′ (EhRas3); 5′-GGAGAATCCCATGAACTCAACAATAAAAAGAATATCTGTT-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCGACTTAAGCAACCACACATGAAGTATTATTCTC-3′ (EhRas4); 5′-GGAGAATCCCATGAGTGAAAAACCCACATCAAT-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCGACTTATAAAAGAGCACACTTTGACCTTTG-3′ (EhRacC), where restriction sites are italicized. PCR products were electrophoresed, purified, and cloned into BamHI- and SalI double-digested pQE31 plasmid to obtain pEhRas1-4 and pEh-RacC. The resulting plasmids were designed to contain an N-terminal histidine tag to facilitate purification. Plasmids to express an N-terminal Nus fusion protein of EhRap2 and a glutathione S-transferase-EhRab5 or glutathione S-transferase-EhRab7 fusion protein were constructed using pET-43.1a and pGEX4T-1 with appropriate restriction sites included in PCR primers. The characterization of EhRab5, EhRab7, and EhRap2 and details of the construction of these expression plasmids are described elsewhere. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Plasmids constructed as described above were introduced into E. coli M15 cells. A 12-ml seed culture was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. The overnight culture was then inoculated into 250 ml of fresh medium containing the antibiotics. The bacteria were grown for 1 h, and then another 4 h after the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was stored at -20 °C until purification. The recombinant proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the bacterial cells were resuspended in cold lysis buffer, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole and 1% lysozyme, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), washed extensively with the wash buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with the lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The recombinant FT proteins were further purified with Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min as described (32.Nepomuceno-Silva J.L. Yokoyama K. de Mello L.D.B. Mendonça S.M. Paixão J.C. Baron R. Faye J.-C. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Gelb M.H. Lopes U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29711-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant FT and Ras proteins were then dialyzed against the enzyme assay buffer described below and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 90 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored with 20 and 50% glycerol, respectively, at -80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using Protein Assay CBB solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. Protein Analyses—The expression and purity of recombinant proteins were evaluated by standard SDS-PAGE as described (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.57Google Scholar). To prepare E. histolytica extracts, trophozoites were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at 107/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamino-(4-guanidino)butane, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, and 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride), and subjected to 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to further analyses. Enzyme Assays—The enzymatic activity of recombinant FT and the whole lysate of E. histolytica trophozoites were assayed for incorporation of [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate into the recombinant small GTPases prepared as described above, human H-Ras-CVLS, or H-Ras-CVLL. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (35.Pompliano D.L. Rands E. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Anthony N.J. Gibbs J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3800-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, in standard assays, the reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 50 μl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 20,000, 187 nm [3H]FPP (3 μCi/ml), or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (3 μCi/ml), and 240 to 750 μm of the purified recombinant FT or 1.9 mg/ml of the E. histolytica lysate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of either the recombinant enzyme or cell extracts, run at 30 °C for 20 min, and terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% HCl in ethanol. The quenched reactions were allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 min. After the addition of 200 μl of 100% ethanol, the reactions were vacuum-filtered through glass filter GF/C (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) using a Sampling Manifold (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were washed with 4 ml of 100% ethanol and then subjected to scintillation counting (LS 6,000IC, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The Km value was calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. FT assays were also conducted in the presence of known FT inhibitors: farnesylpyrophosphate analogues (FPT inhibitor-I, FPT inhibitor-II, Gliotoxin, α-hydroxyl farnesylphosphonic acid) and a peptidomimetic inhibitor (FTI-276) under the condition described above. Guanine Nucleotide Binding Assays—GTP binding activity was measured using [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) and a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HA filter, Millipore Corporation) as previously described (36.Manne V. Yamazaki S. Kung H.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Features of FTα and FTβ of E. histolytica—Nucleotide sequences of EhFTα and EhFTβ obtained by PCR were identical to sequences available from the genome data base (EH02829 and EH04188, respectively). The putative protein-coding region of EhFTα and EhFTβ, consisting of 894 and 1,125 bps, encodes proteins of 298 and 375 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.6 and 42.6 kDa and a pI of 5.4 and 5.7, respectively. A search for previously identified domains and motifs (37.Boguski M.S. Murray A.W. Powers S. New Biologist. 1992; 4: 408-411PubMed Google Scholar) using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search revealed that both EhFTα and EhFTβ contained well conserved signature domains shared by other organisms. EhFTα contained one BET4 domain and five “protein prenyltransferase α-subunit repeats”; EhFTβ possessed one CAL1 domain and five “prenyltransferase and squalene oxidase repeats” (Fig. 1). The deduced protein sequences of EhFTα and EhFTβ were aligned with those from other organisms using the ClustalW program (Fig. 1). Both EhFTα and EhFTβ were the smallest in size, and lack any recognizable secretory signal sequence, an organelle targeting signal, and any domain implicated in membrane association including the transmembrane domain and myristylation signal. EhFTα and EhFTβ also lack the N-terminal extension of 15-58 amino acids found in these subunits from other organisms. EhFTα showed 29, 30, 27, and 24% positional identity with FTα of human, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and T. brucei, respectively; EhFTβ revealed 36, 35, 28, and 31% positional identity with the FTβ of these organisms, respectively. All the residues implicated to be essential for catalysis (Fig. 1, A and B) (39.Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. deSolms S.J. Williams T.M. Kohl N.E. Omer C.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12254-12265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are conserved in both EhFTα and EhFTβ. Phylogenetic Analysis of EhFTα and FTβ—Phylogenetic trees of EhFTα and EhFTβ were constructed (Fig. 2). Neither the α- nor β-subunit of the amebic FT showed statistically significant (i.e. supported with high bootstrap values) affinity to those from other organisms while trypanosomal, mammalian, and plant proteins encoding α- and β-subunits formed well supported independent clades, representing distinct groups. These results were compatible with the notion that both subunits of EhFT developed independently from other eukaryotes, suggestive of the presence of unique biochemical properties of EhFT (see below). Expression of EhFT in E. coli—A complex consisting of EhFTα and EhFTβ was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified proteins revealed two major proteins with an equal intensity of an apparent molecular mass of 38 and 43 kDa (Fig. 3), which likely correspond to EhFTα and EhFTβ, respectively. The apparent molecular mass of α- and β-subunits agreed well with a theoretical value of 37.6 kDa with the N- and C-terminal addition of MRGSHHHHHHTDP and EEF, respectively, for the recombinant EhFTα and 42.6 kDa for EhFTβ. When histidine-tagged EhFTα or EhFTβ were expressed separately, the apparent molecular mass of these proteins agreed well with their identity (data not shown). Densitometric quantitation of these two bands also supported that they contain an equal number of protein molecules (data not shown). Gel filtration chromatography of the recombinant EhFT using Sephacryl S-300 revealed a molecular mass of about 80 kDa (data not shown). Thus, the recombinant EhFTα and EhFTβ were present as a stable dimer during the process of purification by Ni-NTA agarose and Q Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography (Fig. 3). After the purification, recombinant EhFT was estimated to be >95% pure by densitometric quantitation (data not shown), and further utilized for enzymatic assays. Demonstration of FT Activity of the Recombinant EhFT against Human Ras Proteins—When assayed for incorporation of [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate, the recombinant EhFT showed FT activity [1.03 ± 0.012 nmol of FPP/mg of protein (mean ± S.E.)] against human recombinant wild-type H-Ras-CVLS, whereas it showed ∼20-fold less activity against mutant H-Ras-CVLL (0.05 ± 0.01 nmol of FPP/mg of protein) (Fig. 4), which was previously shown to be predominantly geranylgeranylated by human GGT-I. The addition of EDTA (10 mm) to the reaction mixtures completely abolished the enzymatic activity of the recombinant EhFT (data not shown), suggesting, as shown for mammalian and yeast FT, that EhFT also requires Zn2+ and Mg2+ for its activity. Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Novel Ras Proteins in E. histolytica—To identify the protein substrates of EhFT in the parasite, we searched for putative Ras proteins in the genome data base based on homology to the EhRas1 and human H-Ras. In addition to EhRas1, EhRas2, EhRap1, and EhRap2, which have already been reported (12.Shen P.-S. Lohia A. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we found 8 additional putative ras proteins previously uncharacterized, with the C-terminal CaaX motif. Of these 8 proteins, 6 possess Phe or Leu (4 with Phe, 2 with Leu) at the C terminus, while 1 each has Met or Ala. We tentatively designated proteins possessing Met or Ala as EhRas3 or EhRas4, and the other proteins as EhRas5-10. The nucleotide sequence of the EhRas1 cDNA we cloned was identical to that previously reported; the nucleotide sequence of our EhRas2 cDNA differed at one nucleotide (A368G) from the sequence previously reported (12.Shen P.-S. Lohia A. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Par"

These expression profiles may be regulated by integrin-mediated cell signaling pathways. In the current study, an α2β1 integrin triple helical peptide ligand derived from type I collagen residues α1(I)496–507 was examined for induction of human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) activation. In addition, a “miniextracellular matrix” composed of a mixture of the α1(I)496–507 ligand and a second, α-helical ligand incorporating the endothelial cell proliferating region of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) was studied for induction of HAEC activation. Following HAEC adhesion to α1(I)496–507, mRNA expression of E-selectin-1, vascular and intercellular cell adhesion molecules-1, and monocytic chemoattractant protein-1 was stimulated, whereas that of endothelin-1 was inhibited. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis demonstrated that E-selectin-1 and monocytic chemoattractant protein-1 expression was also stimulated, whereas endothelin-1 protein expression diminished. Engagement of the α2β1 integrin initiated a HAEC response similar to that of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced HAECs but was not sufficient to induce an inflammatory response. Addition of the SPARC119–122 region had only a slight effect on HAEC activation. Other cell-extracellular matrix interactions appear to be required to elicit an inflammatory response.

Blood vessels are lined with a contiguous endothelial cell layer. The endothelium lies just inside the medial cell layer of vascular smooth muscle cells, which, in turn, is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue. The location of the endothelial cell lining is such that it provides the interface between the flowing blood and the medial layer of the vessel.The endothelium, under normal physiological conditions, does not bind elements in the flowing blood but instead associates with smooth muscle cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAM, cell adhesion molecule; EDN1, endothelin-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase; HAEC(s), human aortic endothelial cell(s); ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IL-1, interleukin-1; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody(ies); MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MCP-1, monocytic chemoattractant protein-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR, quantitative PCR; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VCAM, vascular cellular adhesion molecule. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAM, cell adhesion molecule; EDN1, endothelin-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase; HAEC(s), human aortic endothelial cell(s); ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IL-1, interleukin-1; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody(ies); MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MCP-1, monocytic chemoattractant protein-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR, quantitative PCR; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VCAM, vascular cellular adhesion molecule.

Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Most integrins bind multiple ECM proteins, and ECM proteins typically have multiple integrin binding sites. Integrins allow the cell to adhere to a substrate and, in turn, make the cell responsive to growth factors, stimulating cell survival and proliferation (9.Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6753) Google Scholar). The roles that integrins play in such fundamental cellular binding and survival processes implicate them in a spectrum of pathological states which include cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.During endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease, cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions are altered at the endothelial cell surface. Endothelial cell activation involves the elevated expression of CAMs on the endothelium surface (including ICAM, VCAM, E-selectin, and P-selectin), chemoattractants (such as platelet-activating factor), chemokines (such as MCP-1), and cytokines (including IL-1 and TNF). Together, these elevated CAMs and secreted molecules act to mediate adhesion to inflammatory cells and are believed to play critical roles in promoting atherosclerosis (11.Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J. Science. 1996; 272: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12.Gonzalez-Amaro R. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Sanchez-Madrid F.

Up-regulation of endothelial CAMs and other molecules is coordinately controlled by transcription factors (including nuclear factor-κB) which, in turn, can be activated by integrin-mediated cell signaling pathways (11.Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J. Science. 1996; 272: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15.Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins C. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar).Blood vessel wall injury often results in additional exposure of the endothelium to ECM components such as collagen (16.Lafont A. Durand E. Samuel J.L. Besse B. Addad F. Lévy B.I. Desnos M. Guérot C. Boulanger C.M. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Most collagens assist in anchoring cells to the ECM. Type I collagen is the most abundant and ubiquitous of the collagens and is found in most connective and embryonic tissues (for review, see Ref. 17.Cole W.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 29-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is well known to stimulate adhesion and migration of endothelial cells directly (18.Fields G.B. Connect.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4223-4231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The collagen family is a diverse group of ECM proteins distinguished by a native triple helical structure. Cell binding to collagen and subsequent signaling can be modulated by the triple helical structure of the protein (18.Fields G.B. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Koseki N. Yoshizato K. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 1: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21.Koyama H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6054-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To locate endothelial cell binding sites, a conservative library of type I collagen-derived triple helical sequences was screened for promotion of endothelial cell adhesion and spreading (24.Sweeney S.M.

From this library, a triple helical peptide incorporating the human α1(I)496–507 sequence (Gly-Ala-Arg-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg) was the most efficient at promoting endothelial cell binding and spreading (25.Malkar N.B. Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This peptide contains one of the α2β1 integrin binding sites found in type I collagen (27.Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar).The α2β1 integrin represents a collagen receptor with multiple functions, implicating its crucial role in both normal and pathological states. Indeed, mAbs directed against this integrin have been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses in animal models of delayed-type hypersensitivity, contact hypersensitivity, and arthritis (30.de Fougerolles A.R. Sprague A.G. Nickerson-Nutter C.L. Chi-Rosso G. Rennert P.D. Gardner H. Gotwals P.J. Lobb R.R. Kotelianshy V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin is stimulated in fibroblasts during wound healing, leading to speculation that this integrin may be required for matrix remodeling as well as scar formation and contraction (31.Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32.Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).The role that the α2β1 integrin assumes in endothelial cell signaling and activation has not been well defined. Because changes in cellular biosynthesis are often dictated by the ECM substrate to which cells are bound (33.Lafrenie R.M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the present study has examined the changes induced by endothelial α2β1 integrin binding using well defined “peptide-amphiphile” substrates. Peptide-amphiphiles consist of peptide sequences covalently linked to hydrocarbon chains and are designed to house discrete binding sites (such as those found in various ECM proteins) (23.Malkar N.B.

These small biomolecules assume stable “miniprotein” structures (α-helical or triple helical) at physiological temperatures, allowing for the study of cellular behaviors in response to discreet binding sites that maintain the three-dimensional structure of the parent protein.HAECs have been allowed to adhere to surfaces coated with the peptide-amphiphile C10-(α1(I)496–507). Temporal changes in gene expression, at the levels of both mRNA and protein, were studied. PCR was used to measure the levels of E-selectin-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, EDN1, and MCP-1 gene expression over 24 h. Protein expression of the same five targets was examined by ELISA analysis. HAECs were also allowed to adhere to a mixture of peptide-amphiphiles, one incorporating the α1(I)496–507 sequence and the second incorporating the endothelial cell proliferation site (residues 119–122) from SPARC. Experiments utilizing both peptide-amphiphiles representing a “mini-ECM” were designed to evaluate the influence of a collagen-associated ECM protein, SPARC, on α2β1 signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide-amphiphile Sequences—The C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile consisted of amino acid sequence (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Ala-Arg-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2 lipidated with a CH3-(CH2)8-CO2H (designated C10) alkyl chain. This peptide-amphiphile includes the α2β1 integrin binding motif found in type I collagen (Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg) as well as two triple helix-inducing sequences ((Gly-Pro-Hyp)4). In total, it incorporates the human type I collagen α1(I)496–507 amino acid sequence.The C18-16r-Tyr-SPARC119–122 peptide-amphiphile consisted of amino acid sequence Lys-Ala-(Glu-Ile-Glu-Ala-Leu-Lys-Ala)2-Tyr-Lys-His-Gly-Lys-NH2 lipidated with a CH3-(CH2)16-CO2H (designated C18) alkyl chain. This peptide-amphiphile includes the endothelial cell proliferating region of SPARC (Lys-His-Gly-Lys, SPARC residues 119–122) as well as an α-helical inducing sequence Lys-Ala-(Glu-Ile-Glu-Ala-Leu-Lys-Ala)2 (16r) (40.Forns P. Lauer-Fields J.L. Gao S. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).A mixture containing 2.5 μm C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile, 2.5 μm C18-16r-SPARC119–122 peptide-amphiphile, and 50 μm decanoic acid causes optimal HAEC adhesion and spreading (25.Malkar N.B. Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This mixture promoted HAEC adhesion and spreading at levels similar to that of type I collagen and is thus referred to as the “mini-ECM.”Reagents, Peptide-Amphiphile Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—All reagents and procedures used for peptide-amphiphile synthesis and purification have been described previously (25.Malkar N.B. Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ligand characterization, which included circular dichroism and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, has also been described previously (25.Malkar N.B. Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile was found to form a triple helical structure with Tm = 52.5 °C, whereas the C18-16r-SPARC119–122 peptide-amphiphile formed a continuous α-helical structure with Tm = 86.4 °C (25.Malkar N.B. Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Cells—HAECs were obtained from Cambrex, Inc., Walkersville, MD. Two primary cell lines were used, HAEC-7425 and HAEC-8213. HAEC-7425 came from a 59-year-old Caucasian male donor. HAEC-8213 came from a 57-year-old Asian female donor. PCR experiments on mRNA isolated from cells grown on the C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile, as well as the mini-ECM, were performed on both cell lines. ELISA analysis was performed using the HAEC-7425 cell line.Cells were cultured in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex, Inc.) that consisted of endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2) with added heparin, hydrocortisone, human recombinant epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, gentamycin, amphotericin, ascorbic acid, long human recombinant insulin-like growth factor, human fibroblast growth factor-basic with heparin, and fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in a CO2-humidified air (1:19) atmosphere at 37 °C and discarded at passage 9, as recommended by the supplier. Cells between passages 4 and 9 were harvested for induction assays when 70–90% confluent.Cell Adhesion and Inhibition Studies—The C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 μm and absorbed directly onto 96-well Pro-Bind™ plates (BD Biosciences) overnight at room temperature as described previously (39.Lauer-Fields J.L. Malkar N.B. Richet G. Drauz K. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14321-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were released with PBS containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, washed twice with adhesion medium (20 mm HEPES in EBM-2), and labeled with 5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Unincorporated fluorophore was removed by repeated washings with adhesion medium. Cells were resuspended in adhesion medium and added to the plate. The plate was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with adhesion medium. Adherent cells were lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 and quantified using λ excitation = 485 nm and λ emission = 538 nm with a SpectraMAX GeminiEM 96-well plate spectrafluorometer and SoftMax Pro 4.3LS software (both from Molecular Devices).For inhibition studies, cells were harvested and preincubated with 2.5 μg/ml of either mouse anti-human α2 integrin subunit mAb (MAB1950Z) or mouse anti-human α1 integrin subunit mAb (MAB1973Z) (both from Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were dispensed into the C10-(α1(I)496–507) peptide-amphiphile-coated wells to evaluate their adhesion in the continued presence of mAb. Cells were allowed to adhere for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and their adhesion was quantified as in the adhesion assay.Induction Studies—Peptide-amphiphiles were dissolved in PBS and adsorbed directly onto 96-well Pro-Bind™ plates or 6-well/25-cm2 polystyrene Falcon nontissue culture treated plates/flasks (BD Biosciences) overnight at room temperature as in the cell adhesion assays. Either 10 μm C10-(α1(I)496–507) or 10 μm C18-16r-Tyr-SPARC119–122 was used to coat the plates/flasks. As described above, the mini-ECM consisted of 2.5 μm C10-(α1(I)496–507), 2.5 μm C18-16r-Tyr-SPARC119–122, and 50 μm decanoic acid. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were released from tissue culture flasks with PBS containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA. Cells were added to the wells of 96-well plates at a density of 75,000 cells/ml in 100 μl of adhesion medium (or to wells of a 6-well plate at the same density in 3 ml or to 25-cm2 flasks at 117,000 cells/ml in 5 ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Three washes of adhesion medium were used to remove nonadherent cells. Cells were grown on various substrates for a total of 8–24 h. Cell supernatants and total mRNA or total cellular lysate were isolated at regular intervals (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h) to evaluate the initial stages of the binding process.TNF-α Induction Studies—Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Chemicon and resuspended in PBS. TNF-α was added to HAECs at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml in growth medium.Semiquantitative PCR—Total mRNA (free of genomic DNA) was isolated from cells with either the Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System or the SNAP™ Total RNA Isolation Kit (both from Invitrogen). To evaluate changes in gene expression for cells grown on peptide-amphiphiles, mRNA was isolated from 90,000 cells/time point. The mRNA yield was determined by measuring the A260 of the final preparation. Typical mRNA yield, on the order of 1–2 μg of total mRNA, provided ample mRNA for multiple cDNA syntheses. Reverse transcription of total mRNA was carried out in 20-μl reactions consisting of 100 ng of mRNA, 25 ng of oligo(dT) (12–18), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNaseOUT™ (recombinant RNase inhibitor), first strand buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3), and 200 units of SUPERSCRIPT II reverse transcriptase (all from Invitrogen).Primers were designed to amplify a panel of endothelial cell-specific transcripts from cDNA corresponding to induced cellular mRNA. When designing PCR primers, homology BLAST searches were performed across known gene sequences, minimizing the likelihood of cross-hybridization to other human cDNA sequences. Using GenBank-derived human sequences (with accession numbers as of November 2001) for ICAM-1 (XM_049516), VCAM-1 (XM_035774), E-selectin-1 (NM_000450), MCP-1 (NM_002982), and EDN1 (XM_043856), primers were designed and purchased from Invitrogen. PCR primers for ICAM-1 were 5′-GCAGTCAACAGCTAAAACCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGCAGGACAAAGGTCTGG-3′; VCAM-1, 5′-CCTCCTTAATAATACCTGCCATTG-3′ and 5′-CCATAGGTTGAGGTATTTAGTACC-3′; E-selectin-1, 5′-CCACGGTGAATGTGTAGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCATGGTCTCCATGCTGCTTGG-3′; MCP-1, 5′-GGAGATCTGTGCTGACCCCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTAGAACTGTGGTTCAAGAGG-3′; and EDN1, 5′-GGATAAAGAGTGTGTCTACTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGCTATGGCTTCAGACAGG-3′. GAPDH, a housekeeping gene whose expression should be constitutively expressed across all time points, was used as a control for each PCR for semiquantitative purposes. The primers used for PCR of GAPDH were 5′-GCTCAGACACCATGGGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′.The PCRs were performed in 50 μl consisting of PCR buffer (50 mm KCl and 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTPs, a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, 2.5 units of Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 10% of the cDNA made from the reverse transcription reactions above. PCR cycles consisted of a 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at an optimized temperature (58 °C for E-selectin-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1; 62 °C for MCP-1 and EDN1) for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s.Standardizing for Semiquantitative PCR—To ensure semiquantitative measurement of PCR products, a number of steps were taken. Equal amounts of RNA (100 ng of RNA, determined by A260 reading) were used for reverse transcription for each time point. PCR of the control GAPDH product was performed on every cDNA sample to standardize the cDNA concentration in subsequent PCRs. PCR was performed on all samples from a given time point with a master mix that contained all of the reagents and the template cDNA. Following PCR on target and control genes, GAPDH PCR products were electrophoresed first, and the other sample volumes were standardized according to the GAPDH samples.PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, and gels were stained with ethidium bromide. Images of UV absorbing bands were captured with a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad) and quantified with Quantity One® version 4.2.2 software.ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin-1, MCP-1, and EDN1 were PCR amplified and gel purified using the Invitrogen SNAP gel purification kit. The isolated DNA was sent to the Biotechnology Program at the University of Florida for sequencing.Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on a Roche LightCycler, using a human TNF-α PCR primer pair (R&D Systems, Minneapolis). Each 20-μl reaction consisted of the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-uracil deglycosylase (final concentrations of 1.5 units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dCTP, 400 μm dUTP, 1 unit of uracil deglycosylase, (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml ultra-pure nonacetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and a 300 nm concentration of each primer). PCR cycles consisted of a 5-s denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. Melting curve analysis was performed using continuous acquisition and a slope of 0.1 °C/s. The control for all qPCRs was GAPDH using the primers described above.Immunoprecipitation and Blotting Analysis—Protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) were incubated with the mAb recognizing the phosphorylated MAP kinase (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) for at least 4 h at 4 °C with mixing. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Cell lysate was added to the beads and incubated overnight (18 h) at 4 °C with mixing. The lysate was removed and the beads washed three times with lysis buffer. Reducing buffer (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205973) Google Scholar) was added, and the beads were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Pierce) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA). The nitrocellulose was incubated in TBST (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% BSA for at least 4 h and incubated with mAb recognizing total MAP kinase proteins (Cell Signaling Technologies) diluted in TBST with 2% BSA overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) diluted in TBST with 5% BSA for 1 h and washed with TBST. Chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) were used to develop the membrane.Endothelial Cell-specific Protein Expression—Conditioned medium was isolated by withdrawal of the medium from growing cells, centrifuging at 200 × g (to remove any floating cells), and freezing at –20 °C. Cell lysates were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma),"
https://openalex.org/W1979013212,"A new system has been developed capable of monitoring conformational changes of the 240s loop of aspartate transcarbamoylase, which are tightly correlated with the quaternary structural transition, with high sensitivity in solution. Pyrene, a fluorescent probe, was conjugated to residue 241 in the 240s loop of aspartate transcarbamoylase to monitor changes in conformation by fluorescence spectroscopy. Pyrene maleimide was conjugated to a cysteine residue on the 240s loop of a previously constructed double catalytic chain mutant version of the enzyme, C47A/A241C. The pyrene-labeled enzyme undergoes the normal T to R structural transition, as demonstrated by small-angle x-ray scattering. Like the wild-type enzyme, the pyrene-labeled enzyme exhibits cooperativity toward aspartate, and is activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP at subsaturating concentrations of aspartate. The binding of the bisubstrate analogue N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), or the aspartate analogue succinate, in the presence of saturating carbamoyl phosphate, to the pyrenelabeled enzyme caused a sigmoidal change in the fluorescence emission. Saturation with ATP and CTP (in the presence of either subsaturating amounts of PALA or succinate and carbamoyl phosphate) caused a hyperbolic increase and decrease, respectively, in the fluorescence emission. The half-saturation values from the fluorescence saturation curves and kinetic saturation curves were, within error, identical. Fluorescence and small-angle x-ray scattering stopped-flow experiments, using aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate, confirm that the change in excimer fluorescence and the quaternary structure change correlate. These results in conjunction with previous studies suggest that the allosteric transition involves both global and local conformational changes and that the heterotropic effect of the nucleotides may be exerted through local conformational changes in the active site by directly influencing the conformation of the 240s loop.

The binding of the bisubstrate analogue N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), or the aspartate analogue succinate, in the presence of saturating carbamoyl phosphate, to the pyrenelabeled enzyme caused a sigmoidal change in the fluorescence emission. Saturation with ATP and CTP (in the presence of either subsaturating amounts of PALA or succinate and carbamoyl phosphate) caused a hyperbolic increase and decrease, respectively, in the fluorescence emission. The half-saturation values from the fluorescence saturation curves and kinetic saturation curves were, within error, identical. Fluorescence and small-angle x-ray scattering stopped-flow experiments, using aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate, confirm that the change in excimer fluorescence and the quaternary structure change correlate. These results in conjunction with previous studies suggest that the allosteric transition involves both global and local conformational changes and that the heterotropic effect of the nucleotides may be exerted through local conformational changes in the active site by directly influencing the conformation of the 240s loop. Allosteric regulation of enzymatic activity is manifested by the ability of the enzyme to exist in at least two different structural and functional forms (1.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6149) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity can therefore be modulated by changing the form in which the enzyme exists, by altering the dynamic equilibrium between multiple forms at a given time, or by causing more localized changes in the structure. Allosteric enzymes are also characterized by the regulation of their activity by effectors that bind at sites remote from the active sites. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) is a paradigm of allosteric enzymes in the study of allosteric regulation. This enzyme catalyzes the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the carbamoylation of the amino group of l-aspartate by carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate (2.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Allosteric regulation is manifested in two different ways: homotropic cooperativity for the substrate l-aspartate and heterotropic regulation by ATP, CTP (2.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and UTP in the presence of CTP (3.Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aspartate transcarbamoylase from E. coli is a dodecamer composed of six catalytic (C) 1The abbreviations used are: C, catalytic chain; R, regulatory chain; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; PALA, N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate; [Asp]0.5, the aspartate concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity; C47A/A241C, the double mutant aspartate transcarbamoylase holoenzyme with Cys-47 replaced by Ala and Ala-241 replaced by Cys in each of the catalytic chains; C47A/A241C-pyrene, the double mutant labeled with pyrene; C47A/A241C-c, the double mutant aspartate transcarbamoylase catalytic subunit with Cys-47 replaced by Ala and Ala-241 replaced by Cys in each of the catalytic chains; C47A/A241C-c-pyrene, the double mutant catalytic subunit labeled with pyrene; 240s loop, a loop in the catalytic chain of aspartate transcarbamoylase comprised of residues 232–246; Fc, fluorescence coefficient. chains organized as two trimeric subunits, and six regulatory (R) chains organized as three dimeric subunits. The active sites are shared between catalytic chains on the same trimer, and the nucleotide effectors bind to the same site on each of the regulatory chains (4.Gerhart J.C. Schachman H.K.

The two different structural and functional states of aspartate transcarbamoylase are the low affinity, low activity conformation of the enzyme, or the T state, and the high affinity, high activity conformation of the enzyme, or the R state (9.Gerhart J.C.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), have provided evidence of a quaternary structural change upon the binding of the natural substrates or substrate analogues. In the Thr to Arg quaternary structural transition, the enzyme elongates by at least 11 Å along the 3-fold axis, the upper and lower catalytic trimers rotate 15° relative to one another, and the regulatory dimers rotate 15° around their respective 2-fold axes (17.Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. Cho Y. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. Fetler L. Vachette P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to these quaternary structural changes, several tertiary changes also occur during the T to R state transition. One example of a tertiary change that is of importance to this study is the reorientation of the 240s loop, which facilitates the domain closure in the catalytic chains, resulting in the formation of high activity high affinity active sites (19.Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, the position of the two 240s loops at the C1-C4 2Within the E. coli holoenzyme, the catalytic chains of the top catalytic trimer are numbered C1, C2, and C3, whereas the catalytic chains of the bottom catalytic trimer are numbered C4, C5, and C6, with C4 under C1. The regulatory dimers contain chains R1–R6, R2–R4, and R3–R5. A regulatory chain is in direct contact with the same numbered catalytic chain. interface changes from lying sideways and apart in the T state, to a position in which the loops are stacked on top of one another in the R state (see Fig. 1). Thus, the quaternary structural transition is tightly correlated with the conformational change of the 240s loop. To create a fluorescent-labeled enzyme, which could monitor the allosteric transition, we conjugated a fluorophore site specifically via a Cys residue at position 241 of the 240s loop (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that when Ala-241 in the wild-type enzyme is converted to Cys the modified enzyme has wild-type like properties (20.West J.M. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47300-47304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The fluorophore used in this study, pyrene, fluoresces not only from an excited monomer state, but also from an excited-state dimer, or excimer; excimer fluorescence results from a specific interaction between the excited monomer and a ground-state monomer (21.Birks J.B. Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley Interscience, London1970Google Scholar). Pyrene site specifically attached to multiple sites on a protein has been utilized in a number of studies as a “molecular ruler” with a range of ∼0–20 Å. Hence it is capable of sensitively monitoring a conformational change in proteins (22.Lehrer S.S. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23.Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 240s loop was chosen as the site of attachment for pyrene because of the relatively large conformational change it undergoes in the T to R state transition (13.Stevens R.C. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7691-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the excimer should only form in the R state, thus providing a unique and specific signal for the R state. Here we used the pyrene-labeled aspartate transcarbamoylase to monitor the allosteric transition and the movement of the 240s loop into the R state conformation, induced by the binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and allosteric effectors. Chemicals—ATP, CTP, dithiothreitol, l-aspartate, N,N-dimethylformamide, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and were obtained from Sigma. 5,5-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) was obtained from Pierce. Sodium dodecyl sulfate and the protein assay dye were purchased from Bio-Rad. Carbamoyl phosphate dilithium salt, obtained from Sigma, was purified before use by precipitation from 50% (v/v) ethanol and was stored desiccated at –20 °C (2.Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). N-(Phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strain MV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), supE, thi, Δ(sri-recA)306::Tn10(tetr)/F′ traD36, proAB, lacIq, lacZΔM15) and M13 phage M13K07 were obtained from J. Messing. EK1104 (F– ara, thi, Δ(pro-lac), ΔpyrB, pyrF±, rpsL) was previously constructed in this laboratory (25.Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pEK613 and pEK614, containing the DNA for the C47A/A241C holoenzyme and C47A/A241C catalytic subunit, respectively, were previously constructed in this laboratory (20.West J.M. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47300-47304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of the Mutant Enzymes—The C47A/A241C mutant and wild-type holoenzymes, and C47A/A241C catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity as previously described (25.Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After concentration, the purity of the enzymes was checked by non-reducing (in which dithiothreitol is omitted from the sample buffer) SDS-PAGE (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and nondenaturing PAGE (27.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 28.Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration—The concentration of the wild-type holoenzyme was determined by A280 nm based upon an extinction coefficient of 0.59 cm2 mg–1 (29.Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled enzyme was determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye binding assay (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Labeling of the C47A/A241C Holoenzyme and C47A/A241C-c Catalytic Subunit—Fluorescent labeling of the mutant enzymes was performed according to the procedure provided by Molecular Probes. The purified mutant enzymes were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and dialyzed overnight into 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.2. After dialysis, a 100-fold molar excess of solid tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was added with stirring to the enzyme solution, at 20 °C. One hour after addition of the tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, a freshly prepared 20 mm solution of N-(1-pyrene)maleimide in N,N-dimethylformamide in 60-fold molar excess was slowly dripped into the vigorously stirred enzyme solution. After addition of the N-(1-pyrene)maleimide solution, the reaction mixture was shielded from light by covering the reaction vessel with foil. After 2 h, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to pellet out the N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. The supernatant was dialyzed four times against 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA to remove the unreacted N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. Efficiency of Pyrene Attachment—The completeness of the labeling of the C47A/A241C enzyme with pyrene was assessed by mass spectrometry and also by determination of unreacted thiol with Ellman's reagent (31.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The C47A/A241C and C47A/A241C-pyrene holoenzymes were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Micromass TofSpec-2E mass spectrometer operating in positive mode and using a sinaptic acid matrix. Aspartate Transcarbamoylase Assay—The aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measured at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (32.Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Saturation curves were performed in duplicate, and data points shown in the figures are the average values. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, in the presence of saturating carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm). Data analysis of the steady-state kinetics was carried out as described previously (33.Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fitting of the experimental data to theoretical equations was accomplished by non-linear regression. When substrate inhibition was negligible, data were fit to the Hill equation. If substrate inhibition was significant, data were analyzed using an extension of the Hill equation that included a term for substrate inhibition (34.Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Lipscomb W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4624-4630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide saturation curves were fit to a hyperbolic binding isotherm by non-linear regression. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 ± 1 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, on a Shimadzu 1000 spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 338 nm; the emission wavelength collected was 360–560 nm; the excitation and emission bandwidths were set to 5 nm. To approximate the degree of quaternary structure change for the enzyme population from the fluorescence emission spectra, a unitless fluorescence coefficient (Fc) was calculated from the following expression, Fc=∑i=440560IF(λi)∑i=360440IF(λi) where IF is the fluorescence intensity at wavelength λi sampled over the entire emission spectrum at 0.4-nm intervals. The ratio of the sums of the intensities of the excimer to the monomer fluorescence was used to significantly reduce the signal to noise. All fluorescence experiments were performed with the enzyme in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. Saturation curves with the bisubstrate analogue PALA and aspartate analogue succinate (plus saturating carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm)) were performed by incremental addition to the pyrene-labeled enzyme ([C47A/A241C-pyrene] = 1 μm) until there was no further change in the fluorescence emission spectrum. To normalize the data, the Fc for all data points was divided by the Fc at 0 ligand (PALA or succinate) concentration, and then subtracted by 1. The experimental data were analyzed in the same manner as the data from the activity assays. Nucleotide saturation curves ([C47A/A241C-pyrene] = 1 μm) were performed at a subsaturating PALA concentration ([PALA]:[C47A/A241C-pyrene] = 1), a subsaturating succinate concentration ([succinate] = 1 mm and [carbamoyl phosphate] = 4.8 mm), and also in the absence of ligands. ATP or CTP were added incrementally until the enzyme was completely saturated with nucleotide, as indicated by no further change in the fluorescence spectrum. To normalize the data, the Fc for all data points was divided by the Fc at 0 nucleotide concentration. The experimental data were analyzed in the same manner as the data from the activity assays. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—The SAXS experiments were performed at Beam Line 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (3.0 GeV, 50–100 mA). The experimental setup and procedures were performed as described (35.Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36.Tsuruta H. Vachette P. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A Cys Residue on the 240s Loop for Covalent Attachment of a Fluorescent Probe—The distance between identical residues in the 240s loop in the C1 and C4 chains of aspartate transcarbamoylase changes significantly in the transition from the T to R states (13.Stevens R.C. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7691-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 527-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 240s loop was chosen as the location for placement of a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to conformation. We chose to conjugate pyrene site specifically to our previously constructed 240s loop mutant, C47A/A241C (20.West J.M. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47300-47304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The substitution of the one naturally occurring cysteine in the catalytic chain, Cys-47, by alanine ensured site-specific labeling. After labeling the C47A/A241C holoenzyme with pyrene, the degree of labeling as determined by mass spectrometry appeared nearly complete. The molecular mass of the catalytic chain for the C47A/A241C holoenzyme, as determined by mass spectrometry, was 33,958 Da. The mass spectrum for the C47A/A241C-pyrene holoenzyme showed a single peak for the catalytic chain, which had a molecular mass of 34,292 Da. This is a difference in molecular mass of 342 Da, close to the molecular mass of pyrene maleimide (297.3). The degree of labeling with pyrene, as determined by the amount of unreacted thiol using Ellman's reagent, was 70 ± 10%. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme is shown in Fig. 2A. Steady-state Kinetics of the Wild-type and Fluorophore-labeled Enzymes—The kinetic parameters calculated from the aspartate saturation curves shown in Fig. 3A are displayed in Table I. The parameters for wild-type holoenzyme were a maximal activity of 17.5 mmol h–1 mg–1, an [Asp]0.5 of 13.0 mm, and Hill coefficient of 2.4. The C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme exhibited a sigmoidal aspartate saturation curve similar to that of the wild-type curve, with a maximal activity of 15.8 mmol h–1 mg–1, an [Asp]0.5 of 12.5 mm, and somewhat reduced cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.4.Table IKinetic parameters of the wild-type and modified forms of aspartate transcarbamoylaseEnzymeVmax[Asp]0.5nHmmol·h-1·mg-1mmWild-type17.5 ± 1.513.0 ± 0.92.4 ± 0.2C47A/A241CaThe data for the C47A/A241C is reported under reducing conditions that prevent the cysteines from forming a disulfide bond between corresponding residues in the upper and lower catalytic subunits (20).25.4 ± 2.310.8 ± 0.81.3 ± 0.1C47A/A241C-pyrene15.8 ± 2.512.5 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.2a The data for the C47A/A241C is reported under reducing conditions that prevent the cysteines from forming a disulfide bond between corresponding residues in the upper and lower catalytic subunits (20.West J.M.

Open table in a new tab Influence of the Allosteric Effectors on the Wild-type and Labeled Enzymes—Nucleotide saturation curves with either CTP or ATP were determined for the wild-type and C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzymes at one-half the [Asp]0.5, because the effect of the nucleotides are observed only at subsaturating concentrations of aspartate. This concentration of aspartate was selected because the nucleotides exert a larger influence on the activity of the enzyme as the aspartate concentration is reduced (37.Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D. Thiry L. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based upon the nucleotide saturation curves shown in Fig. 4, the maximal extent of activation or inhibition at infinite nucleotide concentration was calculated. The parameters obtained from fitting these curves are given in Table II. ATP activates and CTP inhibits the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme. However, the magnitude of the nucleotide effect is reduced both for ATP and CTP to approximately one-half that exhibited by the wild-type holoenzyme. Considering that the same reduction in the heterotropic effects of ATP and CTP was observed for the unlabeled C47A/A241C holoenzyme (20.West J.M. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47300-47304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the reduced effects are because of the mutations and not to the pyrene labeling.Table IIATP activation and CTP inhibition of the wild-type and modified forms of aspartate transcarbamoylaseEnzymeATPaPercent activation is defined as 100 (AATP/A), where AATP is the activity in the presence of ATP and A is the activity in the absence of ATP.KATPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect.CTPcPercent residual activity is defined as 100 (ACTP/A), where ACTP is the activity in the presence of CTP and A is the activity in the absence of CTP.KCTPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect.%%Wild-type4501.1250.12C47A/A241C-pyrene2201.6590.033C47A/A241C-pyrenedValues derived from fluorescence coefficient, Fc, measured by nucleotide saturation curves (Fig. 5) of C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme liganded with an equimolar amount of PALA at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3.1501.3810.029a Percent activation is defined as 100 (AATP/A), where AATP is the activity in the presence of ATP and A is the activity in the absence of ATP.b K is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect.c Percent residual activity is defined as 100 (ACTP/A), where ACTP is the activity in the presence of CTP and A is the activity in the absence of CTP.d Values derived from fluorescence coefficient, Fc, measured by nucleotide saturation curves (Fig. 5) of C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme liganded with an equimolar amount of PALA at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. Open table in a new tab Monitoring the Structural Change by Steady-state Fluorescence—To determine whether the fluorescence of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme was sensitive to alterations in quaternary structure, steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of PALA. There was a significant change in the fluorescence emission peaks with increasing PALA concentrations (see Fig. 2A). The intensity of the peak at 380 nm decreased, concomitant with the increasing intensity of a broad peak at ∼480 nm. Shown in Fig. 2B is a plot of the Fc of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme as a function of PALA concentration. The sigmoidal data were fit to the Hill equation that gave a Hill coefficient of 1.8. The Fc increased until a ratio of approximately six PALA molecules per molecule was attained. At higher concentrations of PALA there was only a slight increase in the Fc. When PALA was added to the C47A/A241C-C-pyrene-labeled catalytic subunit no change in fluorescence was observed (data not shown). The change in fluorescence emission of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme was measured as a function of succinate concentration in the presence of saturating carbamoyl phosphate (see Fig. 3B). The change in the Fc with increasing succinate concentration was also sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.0. The change in fluorescence emission of the C47A/A241C-pyrene-labeled holoenzyme was also measured as a function of the concentration of the nucleotide effectors ATP and CTP. Saturating with ATP caused little change in the fluorescence emission, as the Fc increased only ∼2%. Saturating with CTP also caused no change in the fluorescence emission. To observe the influence of the nucleotides on any structural alterations, experiments were also performed at a subsaturating concentration of PALA or succinate (plus saturating carbamoyl phosphate), setting the [T]/[R] ratio close to 1. With either PALA or succinate, the Fc increased with increasing ATP concentration, and decreased with increasing CTP concentration. When the fluorescence curve ([PALA]:[C47A/A241C-pyrene] = 1) from the ATP saturation was normalized to the ATP saturation curve (kinetic assay), the curves could be overlaid almost exactly (see Fig. 4). From the ATP saturation fluorescence curves for both succinate and PALA, the half-saturation values (KATP = 1.3 ± 0.6) were equal, but the Fc values at saturating [ATP] was greater with succinate (85 versus 50%) than with PALA.

The CTL response is critical in clearance and prevention of HIV infection. Yet, there are no descriptions of physiological peptides derived from the viral envelope protein. In the few reports on endogenous MHC class I viral peptidic ligands from HIV internal proteins, definitive positive identification by mass spectrometry is lacking. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 induces a strong specific CTL response restricted by several human and murine MHC class I molecules, including H-2Dd. Previous analyses showed that this response can be optimally mimicked with the synthetic decameric peptide 318RGPGRAFVTI327. We aim to identify the endogenous natural peptides mediating the response to this epitope. Our data indicate the presence of, at least, two peptidic species of different length and sharing the same antigenic core, which are associated with the Dd presenting molecule in infected cells. One species is at least, probably, the optimal decapeptide. The second species, identified by mass spectrometry for the first time in HIV, is, unexpectedly, a nonamer, which lacks the correctly positioned N-terminal group to bind to Dd. And yet, it is present in similar amounts and, notably, is equally antigenic. Thus, the physiological set of HIV-derived MHC class I ligands is richer and different than expected from studies with synthetic peptides. This may help raise the plasticity and thus the effectiveness of the immune response against the viral infection. These data have implications for HIV vaccine development.

Med. 1995; 332: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In addition, in SIV-infected macaques the abrogation of the CD8+ population induces a high increase in viral load that in turn causes animal death (7.Schmitz J.E. Kuroda M.J. Santra S.

Nelson G.W. Martin M.P. Kissner T. Vlahov D. Goedert J.J. Kaslow R. Buchbinder S. Hoots K. O'Brien S.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1748-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In addition, some loci such as HLA-B35 (8.Carrington M. Nelson G.W. Martin M.P. Kissner T. Vlahov D. Goedert J.J. Kaslow R. Buchbinder S. Hoots K. O'Brien S.J.

The virus escapes this CTL response (10.Goulder P.J.R. Phillips R.E. Colbert R.A. McAdam S. Ogg G. Nowak M.A. Giangrande P. Luzzi G. Morgan B. Edwards A. McMichael A.J. Rowland-Jones S. Nat.

Brunak S. Chigaev A. Detours V. Korber B.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8757-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This evidence indicates a protective role of CTL in preventing and controlling HIV infection. For this reason, characterization of epitopes recognized by CTL represents an important contribution in the development of therapeutic agents such as vaccines against the virus. Identification of the naturally processed epitopes will assure their correct inclusion in vaccine formulations, and help improve the efficiency of endogenous antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules to potentiate the CTL response. Notably, there are no reports of identification of endogenous peptides derived from any epitope recognized by CTL in the HIV envelope protein, and very few descriptions from HIV internal proteins (13.Tsomides T.J.

In the BALB/c mouse model, the HIV-1 strain IIIB envelope glycoprotein gp160 induces a CTL response restricted by the H-2Dd class I molecule (16.Takahashi H. Cohen J. Hosmalin A. Cease K.B. Houghten R. Cornette J.L. DeLisi C. Moss B. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Analysis of overlapping synthetic peptides covering practically all the gp160 sequence revealed that the 15mer peptide 315RIQRGPGRAFVTIGK329 (then named p18) was the major one recognized by CTL (16.Takahashi H. Cohen J. Hosmalin A. Cease K.B. Houghten R. Cornette J.L. DeLisi C. Moss B. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Afterward, additional experiments described the short 318RG PGRAFVTI327 synthetic peptide (herein named R10I) as the most antigenic within this sequence (17.Shirai M. Pendleton C.D. Berzofsky J.A. J.

This region is particularly interesting because it contains epitopes for at least 13 different MHC class I molecules from various species (6 murine, 5 human, 1 chimpanzee, and 1 macaque), including HLA alleles frequent in the human population (HLA-A2, -A3, -A24, -A11, and -A30) (22.Korber B.T.M. Brander C. Haynes B.F. Koup R. Kuiken C. Moore J.P. Walker B.D. Watkins D. Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM2001Google Scholar). Thus, this viral region, known as V3, is recognized by CTL from an important fraction of patients, which is a paradox because it is one of the regions of the HIV genome that is more variable among virus strains. However, all experiments have been performed with synthetic peptides. We are interested in the study of the natural peptides responsible for this Dd-restricted, envelope glycoprotein-specific, CTL response. This report shows that the endogenous proteolytic processing of gp160 protein for presentation to CTL generates at least two viral-derived peptidic species bound to the presenting molecule in infected cells. One of them may correspond to the optimal synthetic peptide, while a second one is an unexpected shorter species. In addition, our results exclude as natural Dd ligand at least one synthetic peptide that is as antigenic as the natural peptides. These results underscore the need to study the peptides resulting from physiological processing, because the natural situation can be more complex than the optimum detected with synthetic peptides. Mice—BALB/c mice (H-2d haplotype) were bred in our colony. Cell Lines—All cell lines were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 × 10-5m 2-mercaptoethanol. The P13.1 cell line is a derivative from mouse mastocytoma P815 cells (H-2d) by transfection with the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase (23.Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). For infection, untransfected murine kidney L cells (Ltk- cells) and L cells transfected with Dd were used (24.Abastado J.P.

For stability assays, the TAP-deficient human lymphoblastoid T2 cells were employed (25.Salter R.D. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized in a peptide synthesizer (model 433A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and purified, when needed, by cation-exchange and/or reversed-phase HPLC (RPHPLC). They were quantitated by A280 absorbance using peptide R10I as a standard, and the identity confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. All peptide sequences were derived from the sequence 313KIRIQRGPGRAFVTIGKIGNMRQAH337, which forms part of the V3-loop antigenic area from HIV-1 strain IIIB envelope glycoprotein. They are named indicating the first amino acid, the length, and the last amino acid. Thus, R10I refers to the decamer of sequence 318RGPGRAFVTI327.

The negative control rVV-HBe encodes the carrier protein HBe, the hepatitis B virus secretory core protein (29.Del Val M. Schlicht H.J. Ruppert T. Reddehase M.J. Koszinowski U.H. Cell. 1991; 66: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). rVV-encoded proteins relevant to this study contain their respective signal sequences for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. All foreign genes cloned into the rVV used in this study are under the control of the vaccinia early-late promoter 7.5k. rVV-HBe and rVV-eC-10env are based on vaccinia Copenhagen strain, whereas rVVENV and rVV-Dd (30.Kulkarni A.B. Morse H.C. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Murphy B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) present vaccinia Western Reserve (WR) background. T Cell Lines and Cytotoxicity Assays—Polyclonal ENV-IIIB-mono-specific CTL were generated by immunization of mice with 5 × 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of rVV-ENV, followed by weekly restimulation of splenocytes with 10-6m G9I synthetic peptide and interleukin 2, as described elsewhere (28.López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5070-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They were used as effector cells in standard 6-h cytotoxicity assays. Identical cytolytic pattern with different IIIB ENV 317-327 epitope peptides was found by restimulation with R10I (data not shown). As targets, L/Dd cells were infected overnight with rVV as described (31.Del Val M. Volkmer H. Rothbard J.B. Jonjic S. Messerle M. Schickedanz J. Reddehase M.J. Koszinowski U.H. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3965-3972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For peptide titrations, P13.1 targets and peptides were incubated for 20 min and CTL were then added. When brefeldin A (BFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) was employed to block transit of MHC/peptide complexes along the secretory pathway, the percentage of specific inhibition was calculated as shown in Equation 1, &percnt;Specificinhibition=[E-N]-[Eb-Nb][E-N]×100(Eq. 1) where E is lysis rVVENV, N is lysis rVVNEGATIVE CONTROL, Eb is lysis rVVENV + BFA, and Nb is lysis rVVNEGATIVE CONTROL + BFA. BFA was used as described (28.López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5070-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except that it was added in a 5-fold higher concentration during the preincubation time (30 min before addition of the virus) than throughout infection. Isolation of Naturally Processed Peptides—L cells (3 × 109 in 30 roller bottles) were infected with rVV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3.5 PFU per cell, and 16 h later naturally processed peptides were extracted from whole cells with trifluoroacetic acid (29.Del Val M.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and purified by RP-HPLC (33.Montoya M. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1914-1922PubMed Google Scholar). Control extractions were performed identically, except that pellets of 109 P13.1 cells received 10 nmol of R10I and Q11I peptides immediately after addition of trifluoroacetic acid. Pooled RP-HPLC fractions that tested positive in cytotoxicity assays with P13.1 target cells and ENV-specific CTL were newly chromatographed by cation-exchange chromatography in a MonoS PC1.6/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Elution was accomplished with a NaCl gradient in 7mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 30% acetonitrile. Fractions from this second column and dilutions thereof were analyzed in new cytotoxicity assays. As internal standard, an ENV-unrelated peptide was included in all HPLC runs. To ensure comparability of different runs, the actual conductivity gradient was always monitored. Contamination of the HPLC columns was excluded by testing preceding HPLC runs with CTL. For standardization, serial dilutions of synthetic peptides were tested always in parallel. Mass Spectrometry—HPLC fractions containing peptides from the cellular extracts were dried and dissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% formic acid in methanol:water 1:1 and sequenced by Dr. J. Vázquez (Centro de Biología Molecular, Madrid, Spain) by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San José, CA). The charge and the mass of the ionic species were determined by high-resolution sampling of the mass/charge rank. Collision energy and ion-precursor resolution were improved to optimize the fragmentation spectrum. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed in a Reflex instrument (Brucker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) operating in the positive ion reflection mode, by Dr. J. P. Albar (Centro Nacional de Biotecnología, Madrid, Spain). Twenty-five microliters of a given HPLC fraction were dried, resuspended in 2 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a 2:1 solution of water:acetonitrile, and mixed with 2 μl of saturated α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix in the same solution. One microliter of the mixture was dried and subjected to analysis. MHC/Peptide Stability Assays—TAP-deficient T2 cells were infected at 26 °C with rVV-Dd at a m.o.i. of 3, and 14 h later they were washed and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0,1% bovine serum albumin and 500 μm of the different peptides, as described (32.López D. Samino Y. Koszinowski U.H. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After washing (time point 0), the cells were further incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots removed at different time points were stained with mAb 34-5-8S, which recognizes Dd bound to peptides (34.Ozato K. Mayer N.M. Sachs D.H. Transplantation. 1982; 34: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), followed by flow cytometry (32.López D. Samino Y. Koszinowski U.H. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells incubated without peptide had peak fluorescence intensities close to background staining with second Ab alone. Fluorescence index was calculated at each time point as the ratio of peak channel fluorescence of the sample to that of the control incubated without peptide. Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)—Intracellular cytokine staining assays were performed as described previously (35.Chen W. Antón L.C. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Splenocytes were obtained from BALB/c mice 7 or 33 days after infection with 5 × 107 PFU of rVV, stimulated with 10-5m peptide for 30 min or for 2 h, respectively, and stimulated for a further 3 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml BFA. The assays were performed in the absence of fetal calf serum. Following stimulation, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD8+ (clone 53-6.7) mAb for 30 min at 4 °C, fixed with Intrastain kit (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) reagent A, and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-IFN-γ mAb in the presence of Intrastain kit permeabilizing reagent B for 30 min at 4 °C. All antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Events were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Infection of L/Dd cells with a rVV that codes for the full-length glycoprotein, rVV-ENV, induces specific recognition by CTL (Fig. 1A, squares). In addition, the decamer 318RGPGRAFVTI327 (named R10I thereafter) is efficiently presented both as exogenous synthetic peptide (66% specific lysis versus 0% without peptide at an E:T ratio of 5:1) and also when included in the C terminus of the heterologous HBe secretory protein and expressed endogenously by rVV-eC-10env (Fig. 1A, circles). In order to confirm that the presentation of the envelope glycoprotein in L/Dd cells requires endogenous processing, cytotoxicity assays were performed in the presence of BFA. This drug blocks class I export beyond the cis-Golgi compartment (36.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), thus preventing the expression of newly endogenously assembled MHC/peptide complexes at the membrane. Exogenously added peptides are not affected by BFA, and thus no inhibition was found when WR-infected cells pulsed with R10I peptide were treated with BFA (data not shown). In contrast, Fig. 1B shows a significant decrease in the recognition of the native glycoprotein (73 ± 9.5%) and the chimeric construct (100 ± 4.2%) when infection with the respective rVV was performed in the presence of BFA. Thus, CTL recognition of this ENV epitope in association with the Dd molecule requires processing of endogenously synthesized proteins in infected L/Dd cells, similarly to other cell lines (28.López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5070-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37.Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Castaño A.R. López D. Del Val M.

The Endogenously Processed Peptides Are Associated with Dd in the Infected Cell—In order to identify the natural endogenously processed peptides of the gp160 protein that are associated with the Dd molecule, an acid extraction of the peptides generated after infection of L/Dd cells with rVV-ENV was performed. The peptides were separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2) and analyzed in cytotoxicity assays. This analysis showed a major antigenic activity around fraction 16 (Fig. 2, closed symbols). The CTL d"

(2003) Biochem. J. 374, 175–184). Inclusion of this exon decreased the translation of glutamine synthetase (GS) in human, dog, and mouse. When translated in vitro with the canine GS transcript containing the exon, we obtained two different species of GS enzymes. Besides the known 45-kDa protein, the extended form of GS was identified with additional 40 amino acids on its N-terminal end. An upstream ATG in the extra exon served as a translation initiator for the long form of GS. When the long transcript was translated in vivo in animal cells, only the long GS was expressed. On the other hand, the long GS is less predominant relative to the short one in canine tissues including brain and liver. Subcellular fractionation of canine brain revealed that the long GS is present in all cellular compartments as is the short one, which is consistent with fluorescence microscopy data obtained with green fluorescent protein fused to GS. The short (SGS) and long (LGS) forms of canine GS were purified in Escherichia coli and shown to have similar Km values for l-glutamate and hydroxylamine. However, the Km values for ATP were slightly altered, 1.3 and 1.9 mm for the short and long GSs, respectively. The Kis for l-methionine-S-sulfoximine (MSOX), a highly potent ATP-dependent inactivator of GS, were considerably different such that the values are 0.067 and 0.124 mm for the short and long forms, respectively. When the intrinsic fluorescences of tryptophans were monitored upon bindings of chloride and metal ions without any effect on the oligomeric state, the pattern of quenching in LGS was significantly different from that of SGS. Taken together, the N-terminal extension in the long isoform of GS induces a conformational change of core enzyme, leading to a change in affinity to its substrates as well as in the effector-induced conformational alterations. It was found that an extra exon exists in the first intron of glutamine synthetase gene, generated by means of alternative splicing (Shin, D., Park, S., and Park, C. (2003) Biochem. J. 374, 175–184).

Glutamine synthetase (GS 1The abbreviations used are: GS, glutamine synthetase; SGS, short form of GS; LGS, long form of GS; UTR, untranslated region; uATG, upstream ATG; MSOX, l-methionine-S-sulfoximine; nt, nucleotide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(Cholamidopropyl) dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. ; EC 6.3.1.2; l-glutamate ammonia ligase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamate and ammonia into glutamine, and thus plays a critical role in eliminating the excitotoxic glutamate in animal brains (1.Meister A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 10. Academic Press, London1974: 699-754Google Scholar). The expression of eukaryotic GS is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and becomes unstable with oxidation mediated by metal or free radical peptides, generated from a fragmentation of β-amyloid, and by growth hormone or glutamine (2.Lie-Venema H. Hakvoort T.B.M. van Hemert F.J. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 243-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian GS protein has been reported to form an eight-subunit oligomer (3.Haschemeyer R.H. Trans. New York Acad. Sci. 1968; 30: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with unknown three-dimensional structure. The bindings of chloride and manganese/magnesium ions to allosteric and activator sites of GS, respectively, cause changes in GS conformation, without affecting its oligomerization (4.Maurizi M.R. Pinkofsky H.B. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5023-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As an essential trace metal in vivo, the manganese ion is mostly (∼80%) bound to GS in astrocytes (5.Takeda A. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 41: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), although its concentration is variable in other mammalian tissues. Magnesium is also bound to mammalian GS in vivo (6.Maurizi M.R. Pinkofsky H.B. McFarland P.J. Ginsburg A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). l-methionine-S-sulfoximine (MSOX), a structural analogue of l-glutamate, is converted to MSOX-phosphate, mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate formed between an enzyme-bound γ-glutamyl phosphate and ammonia at the active site of GS (7.Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2333-2338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction product becomes an irreversible and noncovalent inhibitor of the enzyme. MSOX was originally isolated from nitrogen chloride-treated zein and characterized as a toxin causing induction of convulsions, hysteria, and epileptic fits in a number of animals (8.Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The Ki values of MSOX are 105, 1, 161, and 100 μm for GS proteins of sheep, Escherichia coli, pea, and spinach, respectively (8.Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Despite its crucial role in many neurological diseases (9.Carlsson M. Carlsson A.

Int. 2000; 36: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), information on mammalian GS is rather scarce, and inconsistencies are found in various reports on its mass and subunit arrangements (8.Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In vertebrate, compartment-specific GS isozymes are produced from a single gene and targeted to either mitochondria or cytosol in a tissue-specific manner (14.Laud P.R. Campbell J.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The N terminus of GS is variable in size and sequence and serves as a subcellular targeting signal (15.Campbell J.W. Smith Jr, D.D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 787-805PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the known 44-kDa protein, the GS-like protein of 54 kDa was reported from human brain. This enzyme is mostly found in crude mitochondrial fractions and possesses higher hydroxylamine-l-glutamine transferase activity than the 44-kDa GS (16.Boksha I.S. Tereshkina E.B. Burbaeva G.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17.Boksha I.S. Schönfeld H.J. Langen H. Müller F. Tereshkina E.B. Burbaeva G.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Modulation of the translational efficiency of mammalian GSs by 5′ transcript leader region has been suggested as a mechanism for regulating its expression (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was studied in detail with the canine GS, a 45-kDa enzyme with 373 amino acids, which is translated from the gene of ∼10 kb in length, being organized into seven exons and six introns. An extra exon is found in the first intron of glutamine synthetase gene, which is subjected to an alternative splicing. The long transcript with extra 5′-UTR is translated less efficiently than the short one. This translational regulation is partially due to an abortive initiation at the upstream ATG located in the extra exon (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is known that the 5′ transcript leader regions in most vertebrate mRNAs are less than 100 nucleotides long (19.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). However, two thirds of the oncogenes and other genes associated with growth and differentiation have several hundred nucleotides of transcript leader region. An ATG within this leader sequence is suggested to be involved in the regulation of downstream translation either by generating a peptide (20.Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) or by promoting an alternative in-frame translation (21.Uhlmann-Schiffler H. Rössler O.G. Stahl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1066-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During the analysis of translation of GS gene in canine brain, we found that the long transcript with the extra 5′-UTR is exclusively translated into the 49-kDa of GS protein. This protein was characterized to have different enzymatic properties, presumably due to a conformational alteration. Reagents and Primers—All reagents used in the present study were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. PCR primers for subcloning were synthesized by Genotech co. (Taejon, Korea). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction kits (Qiagen). All plasmid constructs were sequenced using the Big Dye termination kits for the ABI-Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Animal Tissues—Tissues from the frontal lobe, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver of dog (Sapsari, a Korean breed, 22.Kim K.S. Lee S.E. Jeong H.W. Ha J.H. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1998; 10: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were obtained from an adult animal, with an approval by the University Animal Care and Use Committee at KAIST (Taejon, Korea). The mouse brain was obtained from an adult animal of the FVB strain, which was purchased from Daehan Breeding Center Co. Ltd (Seoul, Korea) and housed under controlled temperature and lighting (22 °C with 12-hour light-dark cycle) with free access to food and water, according to the National Institutes of Health guideline for the care and use of laboratory animals. The brain tissue of human was a mixture of samples from the parietal lobe, cortex, and white matter, kindly provided by Chong-Jai Kim (Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea), with an informed consent of 16-year-old male who died of primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the chest wall and with an approval by the Ethical Committee of Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Korea). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The short and long transcripts of canine GS, covering the exon 1 to exon 7, were reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)30, amplified with primers cGSBamHI-f (5′-GGGGGATCCAGAGCCGAGAATGGGAGCGG-3′; AF544242, nt 1–20) and cGSXhoI-r1 (5′-GGGCTCGAGTTAGTTTTTGTACTGGAAGGG-3′; AF544242, nt 1369–1349), and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen), yielding pSGS and pLGS, respectively. The linearized templates of 5 μg by digestion with XhoI restriction enzyme were used for in vitro transcription using the mMESSAGEmMACHINE™ kit (Ambion) to obtain capped transcripts. The integrity of transcripts was ascertained by visualizing on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In vitro translations were carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Equimolar amounts of capped in vitro transcripts were used as templates for protein synthesis in a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 35 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), amino acid mixture (without methionine), and 40 units of RNasin (Promega). After 90 min incubation at 30 °C, the synthesized protein products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Western Blotting Analysis—Protein samples were heat denatured in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and SDS and separated electrophoretically on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. The proteins were then transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and reacted sequentially with a mouse anti-glutamine synthetase monoclonal antibody (CHEMICON international) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The GS protein bands were visualized with ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) on an x-ray film. Transient Expressions in Mammalian Cells—293T (human kidney) and SK-N-SH (human brain neuroblastoma) cells were grown to ∼15% confluence as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum on 3.5 cm dishes for 24 h prior to transfection with either 2 μg of pSGS or pLGS, using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol. After 12-hour of transfection, complete medium was removed from the cells, and the induction medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (plus 10% fetal bovine serum) without l-glutamine was added (23.Santoro J.C. Harris G. Sitlani A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After 24 h of media change, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline once, harvested in 10 mm imidazole-HCl/2 mm EDTA/5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.2), and sonicated, from which soluble supernatants were collected for Western blotting. Localization of GS-GFP—The canine GS coding sequences were amplified with primers of cSGSHindIII-f (5′-GGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGCCACCTCTG-3′; AF544242, nt 248–260)/cLGSHindIII-f (5′-GGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACCAGCGGGAGCCC-3′; AF544242, nt 128–145) and cGSBamHI-r (5′-GGGGGATCCCGGTTTTTGTACTGGAAGGGTTC-3′; AF544242, nt 1366–1346), and cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), yielding pEGFP-SGS and pEGFP-LGS, which expressed the GS-GFP fusion protein from the cytomegalovirus promoter. The Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (dog kidney) cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h prior to transfection with either pEGFP-N1, the GFP-expressing control vector, or pEGFP-SGS/pEGFP-LGS, using LipofectAMINE plus reagent. After 24 h of transfection, the GFP fluorescence was observed in a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, ECLIPSE TE2000-U). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Subcellular fractionation of brain tissue was performed as described previously (24.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The canine brain of 1.2 grams was placed in 5 volumes of ice-cold “buffered sucrose” (320 mm sucrose/4 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3)/1 mm MgCl2/0.5 mm CaCl2) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and the mixture solution of protease inhibitors, and the material was kept at 4 °C throughout the preparation. The tissue was homogenized in a glass-Teflon homogenizer using 12 up-and-down strokes at 900 rpm, to which the same volume of buffered sucrose was added. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × gav. The resulting pellet (P1) was stored, whereas supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × gav. The supernatant (S2) was stored, and the pellet was washed in 5 ml of buffered sucrose and re-centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × gav to obtain a pellet (P2). The S2 was centrifuged for 2 h at 250,000 × gav to yield a pellet (P3) and a cytosol fraction (S3). The P1 contained nuclei, and P2 with mitochondria/lysosomes/peroxisomes, P3 with plasma membrane/endoplasmic reticulum, and S3 with cytosol. Purification of the Recombinant GS Enzymes—The short and long coding sequences of canine GS were amplified with primers cGSNdeI-f1 (5′-GGGCATATGGCCACCTCTGCGAG-3′; AF544242, nt 248–264)/cGSNdeI-f2 (5′-GGGCATATGGACCAGCGGGAG-3′; AF544242, nt 128–142) and cGSXhoI-r2 (5′-GGGCTCGAGGTTTTTGTACTGGAAGGG-3′; AF544242, nt 1366–1349), and subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21b (Novagen) to obtain the pET-SGS and pET-LGS plasmids. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET-SGS or -LGS to produce recombinant GSs. The GS protein was induced with a treatment of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-f-galactopyranoside to cells of 0.3–0.4 O.D. at A600. The cells were then allowed to grow 4 h more at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation with JA14 rotor at 4 °C and 8000 rpm for 15 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 mm imidazole/0.5 M NaCl/20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged 25,000 rpm in SW41Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm pre-sized membrane, and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 15 volumes of the previous buffer and 6 volumes of 60 mm imidazole/0.5 M NaCl/20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9). The GS protein was eluted in 1 m imidazole/0.5 M NaCl/20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), collected with the fractions of 1 ml each, and pooled for the active fractions. Purity was assessed by 10% SDS-PAGE as described by Sambrook and Russell (25.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A8.40-A8.51Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined with a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole-HCl/2 mm EDTA/5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.2) and stored at 4 °C, as reported by Listrom et al. (26.Listrom C.D. Morizono H. Rajagopal B.S. McCann M.T. Tuchman M. Allewell N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—For measuring GS activity, the synthetase reaction was carried out using a colorimetric method as described by Meister (27.Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mixture consisted of 100 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm sodium l-glutamate (pH 7.2), 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm ATP (pH 7.2), 20 mm MgCl2, and 125 mm of freshly titrated hydroxylamine (pH 7.2). The reaction mixture of 500 μl was pre-incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 nm of enzyme. The reaction was quenched after 15 min with 750 μl of 0.37 m FeCl3/0.67 m HCl/0.2 m trichloroacetic acid, and the absorbance was read at 535 nm against a blank lacking the enzyme. The controls containing purified GS without ATP or l-glutamate showed no absorbance. All absorbance measured were within the range of the γ-glutamylhydroxamate standard curve. A unit of GS activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 37 °C under the conditions given above. The kinetic velocity was expressed as units per nm of protein. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—1 μm of GS protein in 10 mm HEPESKOH (pH 7.2) was mixed with KCl, MnSO4, or MgSO4 at the indicated final concentration and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Intrinsic fluorescence was monitored with the 8100 Series 2 spectrofluorometer (SLM-AMINCO) equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette compartment maintained at 25 °C. The tryptophan fluorescences after being excited at 295 nm were monitored in the range of 310–400 nm. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—The GS protein was passed through 0.2-μm nylon filter (Whatman) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (bed dimensions, 10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) at 25 °C. The protein peaks were detected with a ÄKTAprime Chromatography system and PrimeView software (Amersham Biosciences) with an absorbance at 280 nm. The apparent molecular masses were estimated using intrapolation in the plots of Ve (elution volume) - Vo (void volume) versus log [molecular weight] from standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences) of chymotrypsinogen A (19.9 kDa), albumin (64.7 kDa), catalase (219 kDa), and thyroglobulin (699 kDa). The void volume (6.2 ml) was determined using blue dextran 2000 (1 mg/ml). Novel Translation Initiation from the Alternative Transcript of Canine Glutamine Synthetase Gene—It was found previously that alternatively spliced GS transcript acquiring extra 5′-UTR decreased the normal translation (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In an effort to obtain further evidences on this observation, we carried out an in vitro translation of transcripts made from the GS plasmids in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Although the short transcript generated a 45 kDa protein (SGS), the long one with extra 5′-UTR gave rise to a 49-kDa protein (LGS) with a small amount of SGS (Fig. 1A). This indicates that translation occurs from an upstream ATG (uATG at -120) located in the extra exon, resulting in an in-frame 40 amino acids extension of the N-terminal SGS (Fig. 2).Fig. 2The sequence of extra exon and its corresponding peptide. The exon 1′ contained in the long transcript is shaded with its encoded amino acids shown below the codon sequences. The translation of SGS is initiated from the start codon (+1), whereas the one for LGS is located at -120.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the rabbit reticulocyte, a highly specialized cell, is known to have ill-balanced translation system (28.Kozak M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), expressions of the GSs were analyzed transiently in 293T cells (Fig. 1B). The 293T cells transfected with the plasmid containing cDNA for SGS (pSGS) produced a band of expected size (45 kDa) on Western blot, whereas the LGS plasmid (pLGS) generated only the 49-kDa protein band, which is different from the result of in vitro translation (Fig. 1A). When both pSGS and pLGS were transfected, equal amounts of proteins were expressed. The same patterns of GS expressions were obtained for cDNAs of SGS and LGS in SK-N-SH cells (data not shown), suggesting that the primary role of long GS transcript is to produce the LGS protein in vivo. The Long Form of GS Is Found in Canine Brain and Liver Tissues—To examine the presence of LGS in the canine tissue, soluble extracts from the frontal lobe, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver tissues were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted with monoclonal antibody raised against the mouse GS. The canine GSs are highly expressed in brain, moderately in liver, and barely in other tissues (Fig. 3A), with lower amounts of the long from. In human and mouse brains, only the 45-kDa GS bands were detected (Fig. 3B), presumably due to an absence of an in-frame uATG. Similar to canine GS expression in animal cells, the expressions of the human and mouse GSs were analyzed transiently in 293T cells. The 293T cells transfected with the plasmid containing cDNA for the short transcript of human GS produced the band of expected size (45 kDa), so did the long one with less amount of protein (data not shown). The short transcript of mouse GS expresses the 45-kDa protein, whereas the long one produces none (not shown), presumably due to translational repression as described previously (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Intracelluar localization of GS protein was analyzed by subcellular fractionation of the canine brain, which were blotted with GS antibody. Absolute amounts of both enzymes were varied in different fractions, i.e. cytosol (S3), endoplasmic reticulum/plama membrane (P3), nuclei (P1), and other particulate fraction (Fig. 4A, P2). However, their ratios are about the same, suggesting that the extra 40 amino acids are not associated with specific targeting. This pattern of SGS/LGS distribution is consistent with the result of subcellular localization of the GS proteins fused to GFP, produced from pEGFP-SGS and pEGFP-LGS. When two constructs were transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, the GS-GFP fusion proteins were expressed evenly in all subcellular regions (Fig. 4B). The Glutamine Synthetase Isoforms Differ in Their Enzymatic Properties—The two different canine GS genes were cloned into an inducible pET21b vector, from which the enzymes were purified to homogeneity. The colorimetric synthetase reaction assay with l-glutamate, hydroxylamine, and ATP as substrates revealed that Km values of SGS and LGS are 1.1 ± 0.12 and 1.3 ± 0.14 mm for l-glutamate, 1.6 ± 0.41 and 1.7 ± 0.31 mm for hydroxylamine, and 1.3 ± 0.24 and 1.9 ± 0.23 mm for ATP, respectively (Table I). The values for l-glutamate and hydroxylamine are similar in both enzymes, but the affinity for ATP is higher in SGS than in LGS. It is known that MSOX, with the presence of ATP, is phosphorylated by GS, leading to an irreversible and non-covalent inhibition of the enzyme (27.Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When MSOX was titrated in the presence of 50 mm l-glutamate, the Ki values were 0.067 and 0.124 mm for SGS and LGS, respectively (Table I), indicating that the affinity for MSOX is lower in LGS than in SGS. The affinity changes for ATP and MSOX suggest that the binding sites for both substrates are altered due to the presence of N-terminal 40 amino acids of LGS.Table IComparisons of Km and Vmax in SGS and LGS Units for Vmax are μmol/min per nm of protein, while units for Km are millimolar.

(4.Maurizi M.R. Pinkofsky H.B. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5023-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated that bindings of various effectors, such as chloride, manganese, and magnesium, to allosteric or activator site of the bovine brain GS cause a conformational change as monitored by fluorescence quenching, without affecting the oligomerization state. There are seven tryptophans and fifteen tyrosines in the short GS protein, whereas the long one contains an extra tryptophan in the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 2). To assess whether the extended peptide of LGS affects the conformation of GS, we monitored fluorescence quenching by the presence of KCl, MnSO4, or MgSO4, each treated alone or combined together. The fluorescence changes are shown here as the ratio of fluorescence (F) for the sample to that of SGS enzyme itself (Fig. 5, Fo). When excited at 295 nm for tryptophan, addition of MnSO4 to SGS resulted in fluorescence quenching of about 15%, whereas MgSO4 increased fluorescence of 30% (Fig. 5). In contrast, LGS shows 34% quenching with MnSO4, and only 8% increase with MgSO4. Nevertheless, the patterns of fluorescence changes are similar. However, the tryptophan fluorescence of SGS increased ∼133% by an addition of 10 mm chloride, whereas no change was observed in LGS. Further addition of MnSO4 and MgSO4 to the chloridetreated SGS resulted in 85% quenching relative to the untreated. For LGS, quenching was 17% with MnSO4, whereas MgSO4 increased fluorescence of about 5–6%. The notable differences in fluorescence between SGS and LGS were observed upon chloride binding, with enormous increase in SGS. Based on the fact that chloride ion binds to the allosteric sites of GS, such fluorescence changes may reflect conformational differences between the two enzymes. On the other hand, the basal levels of tryptophan fluorescences are different between SGS and LGS such that the emission of LGS at 338 nm is 1.5-fold higher than that of SGS. The difference could be due to either the presence of extra tryptophan residue in LGS or the change in microenvironment of other tryptophans, or both. To exclude the possibility that the LGS is caused by its oligomerization, we examined oligomeric states of the enzymes by gel-filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig. 6, the degrees of multimerization in both proteins are similar, in which the majority exists as octamer of 70–73%. This suggests that the fluorescence changes in the GS proteins are not associated with their quaternary structures. We characterized two isoforms of GS proteins, 45 and 49 kDa, translated from one functional gene. The long form was generated by in-frame translation from the upstream ATG located in the extra exon of long GS transcript. The extra peptide did not reveal any sequence similarity in the data base search. Because the sequence analysis predicted O-linked glycosylation site for N-acetylglucosamine at +40 position (threonine) of LGS, we treated LGS with β-acetyl hexosaminidase or with sodium hydroxide for β-elimination (29.Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the result was negative (data not shown), although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of other modifications including phosphorylation. In a previous study (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was shown that the ratio of the short to long transcripts of canine GS was similar in various brain tissues. However, relative ratio of the proteins was different, with far more SGS (Fig. 3A), implying that there is a difference in stability or translation between the transcripts of LGS and SGS. The known regulators of GS expression at post-transcriptional level include glutamine, growth hormone, and oxidations mediated by metal or free radical peptides generated by a fragmentation of β-amyloid (2.Lie-Venema H. Hakvoort T.B.M. van Hemert F.J. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 243-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain a short recognition sequence that facilitates initial binding of mRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome (19.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The sequence information of the long UTR (Fig. 2) as well as the analyses of in vitro (Fig. 1A) and in vivo (Fig. 1B) translations indicated that the synthesis of LGS depends on the uATG codon located at -120. Efficiency of translation from the ATG codon in eukaryotes relies on an optimal translation initiation context (particularly A-3 and/or G+4). Unlike the regular ATG at +1, the translation start site of LGS (-120ATG) has a G at +4, but not A at the -3 position, presumably serving as less efficient translation initiators. Nevertheless, LGS seems to be expressed from the long transcript at higher concentration in vitro than SGS. Interestingly, the long GS transcript produces only LGS in vivo (Fig. 1), although the SGS contains an ATG codon with conserved Kozak sequence (both A-3 and G+4). This might be due to a readthrough translation of LGS from uATG without stopping at the SGS initiation codon (+1 position in Fig. 2). In the case of human GS, two uATGs exist at -326 and -317 nucleotides upstream of the authentic ATG (18.Shin D. Park S. Park C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a stop signal is found at -248 position, which is 78 and 69 nucleotides downstream of the uATGs. This stop signal may allow the re-initiation of SGS translation in the long transcript of human GS. In the mouse GS exon, one uATG is located at -83 nucleotides upstream of ATG, which is in out-of-frame from the coding sequence. The translation from uATG may encounter a stop codon appeared after the initiation ATG, and thus we speculated that the abortive translation from uATG inhibits the authentic SGS translation by skipping the normal initiation. The heterogeneity of GS, i.e. existence of several forms inside one taxon, is well known and widespread (14.Laud P.R. Campbell J.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most of subtypes of GS are compartmentalized in different subcellular organelles (15.Campbell J.W. Smith Jr, D.D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 787-805PubMed Google Scholar). The human genome contains at least five GS homologs (30.Wang Y. Kudoh J. Kubota R. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1996; 37: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There are at least two enzymes possessing GS activities in the human brain, one oligomeric enzyme consisting of 44 kDa subunits (GS) and the other with 54 kDa subunits (GS-like protein) that is enriched in mitochondrial fraction (16.Boksha I.S. Tereshkina E.B. Burbaeva G.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One may speculate that the addition of N-terminal amino acids affects functional activities or intracellular location of the GS protein. When we examine subcellular localizations of SGS and LGS in mammalian cell or brain tissue, we were unable to find any differences in compartmental localization between LGS and SGS in canine brain (Fig. 4). We compared enzymatic properties of the two enzymes, in which the affinities for l-glutamate and hydroxylamine are similar, although those for ATP and MSOX were different (Table I). This may indicate that there is a difference in enzyme conformation, at least in the substrate binding sites for ATP and MSOX. To further investigate this, we examined chloride and divalent metal ion bindings to allosteric and activator sites, respectively, which induce the conformational changes of GS (4.Maurizi M.R. Pinkofsky H.B. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5023-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The most prominent differences in fluorescence change were found in the chloride binding, in which a considerable increase was observed for the short protein compared with the long one, suggesting a conformational difference between the two proteins. Because the fluorescence change could also be due to a nonspecific binding of chloride on the substrate site if there is a fluorophore located in the substrate site of GS, we examined the fluorescence changes upon bindings of ADP, l-glutamate, and MSOX. The marginal difference in fluorescence was detected below the level of 5%, indicating that there is no tryptophan residue in the substrate site that significantly alters its fluorescence upon substrate binding (data not shown). On the other hand, to assess whether the fluorescence change is due to the oligomerization of enzyme, we detected fluorescence in the sample with only monomers, obtained by treating 1% CHAPS (zwitterionic detergent). Here, the fluorescence change was less than 10% of the values obtained for purified protein with mostly oligomeric forms, indicating that the tryptophan fluorescence is not probing the oligomerization (data not shown). We attempted to detect any structural difference due to an extension of N-terminal amino acids in LGS using circular dichroism spectroscopy. However, an analyzable spectra were not obtained because of the high propensity of GS oligomerization that disturbs circular dichroism measurement. At any rate, we already presented other enzymatic and spectroscopic data indicating the conformational alteration by an extension of N-terminal amino acids in LGS, although physiological relevance of this structural variation still remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1981287243,"A number of studies suggest that blood-clotting factor X (FX) uses secondary site(s) to interact (as a substrate) with its activators. Numerous pieces of evidence also imply that, within prothrombinase (as an enzyme), activated FX (FXa) uses exosite(s) for cofactor Va and/or prothrombin recognition. Similarly, FXa exosite(s) seem to govern interaction with inhibitors. An obvious difference between FXa and thrombin resides within a region called exosite-1: positively charged in thrombin and clearly of opposite polarity in FXa. To investigate the role of this potential cation-binding exosite, we prepared a series of mutants within loops 34-40 and 70-80 of FX. Overall, the mutations induced relatively subtle, non-synergistic modulation. The potential exosite was dispensable for FX activation and is unlikely to constitute a critical region for factor Va binding, albeit it is clearly important for prothrombin activation. Our data also implicate loop 34-40 of FXa in the interaction with the tissue factor pathway inhibitor, in prevention of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 binding, and in tempering inhibition by heparin-activated antithrombin. Compared with FX, mutants with reduced electrostatic potential potentiated thrombin production in FX-depleted plasma, whereas mutants with inverted electrostatic potential impeded clotting. Despite the definite consequences observed, disruption of the potential cation-binding exosite of FX had rather weak effects, far from what would be expected if this region was as crucial as in thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2086265455,"Venoms from 14 snakes and four scorpions were screened for inhibitory activities toward store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. An inhibitory activity was found in venom from the African scorpion Pandinus imperator. The active agent of this venom was purified by gel filtration and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography methods. Sequence information on the purified fraction, by automatic Edman degradation and mass spectrometry analysis, identified the activity as being contained in two tetrapeptides, which we have named tetrapandins. We demonstrate that synthesized tetrapandins have inhibitory activity for SOCE in human embryonic kidney-293 cells while having no effect on either thapsigargin- or carbachol-stimulated release of Ca2+ stores. These toxins should be extremely useful in future studies to determine downstream events regulated by SOCE as well as to determine whether multiple pathways exist for thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry.

A large number of receptors utilize Ca2+ as a second messenger to initiate downstream physiological processes. In the case of G protein-coupled receptors, the Ca2+ response generally is biphasic with an initial rapid spike of Ca2+, due to release of internal Ca2+ stores, followed by a longer, more sustained response. In some cases, the sustained response takes the form of a stable Ca2+ plateau, while in other cases sustained Ca2+ oscillations are observed; both the Ca2+ plateau and sustained Ca2+ oscillations are dependent on a continued influx of external Ca2+. Generally this Ca2+ influx is mediated by non-voltage-gated channels (1.Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2.Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3.Parekh A.B. Penner R.

There appear to be multiple types of non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels stimulated by agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, one of which, the store-operated channels (SOCs), 1The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated channel; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; OAG, 1-oleolyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; CCh, carbachol. mediates what was originally referred to as capacitative Ca2+ entry (5.Putney Jr, J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar) but now often called store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). These channels are activated in response to depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. While there are a number of plausible theories on the mechanism by which store depletion activates these channels (6.Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), there is still no complete model for this process. Likewise some progress has been made in identifying members of the TRPC channel family as the likely protein mediators of SOCE, but there is still much controversy in the literature concerning which of the TRPC family members are store-operated and which are receptor-operated. In addition, there is some question as to whether more than one subtype of SOCE might exist (8.Dietl P. Haller T. Wirleitner B. Friedrich F. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as a relative dearth of information concerning the downstream consequences of SOCE. One limitation in the characterization of SOCs and the investigation of the downstream consequences of SOCE has been the lack of an inhibitor with high affinity and high specificity for SOCs. While a number of substances have been used to inhibit SOCE, these agents in general lack the specificity required to fully characterize these channels and to determine unequivocally which downstream physiological events are regulated by Ca2+ entering via SOCs. For example, SKF96365 has frequently been used to inhibit SOCE and to investigate events regulated downstream of SOCE (9.Jenkins R.E. Hawley S.R. Promwikorn W. Brown J. Hamlett J. Pennington S.R. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1092-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, SKF96365 has been demonstrated to inhibit Na+ channels (10.Hong S.J. Lin W.W. Chang C.C. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), K+ channels (11.Schwarz G. Droogmans G. Nilius B.

In Vivo. 1996; 10: 153-160PubMed Google Scholar) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (16.Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Peppiatt C.M.

Given all of the side effects of existing inhibitors of SOCs, there is a clear need for a potent, specific inhibitor of SOCE. One fertile source of ion channel inhibitors has been the venom of poisonous snakes, scorpions, spiders, and sea snails. Peptide toxins have been purified from complex venoms that block Na+ channels (26.Kao C.Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1966; 18: 997-1049PubMed Google Scholar), K+ channels (27.Carbone E. Wanke E. Prestipino G. Possani L.D. Maelicke A. Nature. 1982; 296: 90-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (28.Olivera B.M. Imperial J.S. Cruz L.J. Bindokas V.P. Venema V.J. Adams M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 635: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and receptor-operated channels such as the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (29.Keith R.A. Mangano T.J. Salama A.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). From the utilization of these peptide toxins, much has been learned about the subunit composition of these channels, their mode of activation and inactivation, and the downstream events regulated by ion movements through these channels. To date, toxins for non-voltagegated channels such as SOCs have not been identified. Clearly the discovery of a peptide toxin specific for SOCs would allow a level of study of these channels that has not been possible with current inhibitors. In this report, we describe our search for a peptide toxin in venoms of snakes and scorpions, the purification of the toxin from the Pandinus imperator scorpion venom, the identification of the toxin sequence, and the synthesis and functional effect of the peptide toxins we have named tetrapandins. These toxins should be extremely useful in future studies to determine downstream events regulated by SOCE as well to determine whether multiple pathways exist for thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Materials—Fura-2 free acid, fura-2 AM, and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes; thapsigargin was purchased from LC Laboratory. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), Ca2+-free, Mg2+-free, HCO3-free HBSS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Invitrogen. Chelex-100 came from Bio-Rad, and 1-oleolyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), along with other chemicals, were purchased from Sigma. Venom Purification Procedure—All snake species, kept alive at the Kentucky Reptile Zoo (Slade, KY), were milked manually by having them bite into a rubber membrane, which was stretched over a glass funnel. The venom was collected in a glass vial, and the harvest was immediately frozen after extraction and lyophilized within 1 week. The powdered venom from each species was dissolved in 1 ml of double distilled water and kept at –20 °C. Scorpions of the species P. imperator, kept alive in the laboratory, were milked by electric stimulation, and their venom was dissolved in twice distilled water and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was freeze-dried and kept at –20 °C until used. When required, samples of the soluble venom were loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 column (medium size, from Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.7, following earlier published results (30.Zamudio F.Z.

The active fraction (see below) was further separated using a semipreparative C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac, Hisperia, CA) of an HPLC system using a linear gradient from solution A (0.12% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 60% solution B (0.10% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The active fraction was further subjected to HPLC separation using an analytical Vydac C18 reverse-phase column eluted with the same gradient. Two pure peptides were obtained from this column and were further characterized. Amino Acid Sequence and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The peptides obtained from the HPLC system were sequenced using automatic Edman degradation in a ProSequencer apparatus (Beckman LF3000) following the protocol described by the manufacturer. The molecular weights of purified components were determined by means of a Finnigan LCQDuo ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Confirmation of sequence and molecular masses were obtained using a MALDI-TOF MS apparatus (Voyager DE-PRO, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Peptides were crystallized using the dried droplet technique and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic as matrix. Postsource decay fragment ion spectra were acquired after isolation of the appropriate precursor by using timed ion selection. Fragment ions were refocused onto the detector by stepping the voltage applied to the reflectron and acquiring distinct spectral segments using an Acquiris digitizer at a digitization rate of 500 MHz. Individual spectra were superimposed by using the Data Explorer Version 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Peptide Synthesis and Aggregation—The chemical synthesis of the peptides was performed by the solid phase method of Merrifield (31.Merrifield B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2144-2154Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-derivatized amino acids. NovoSyn TGA resins (600 mg, 0.126 meq) were used for each peptide. Once the peptides were synthesized, they were detached from the resins, and the corresponding protecting groups of the residues were eliminated by means of reactive K (84% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% H2O, 5% thioanisole, 1% dithiothreitol) for 1 h. Deprotected peptides were precipitated with t-butyl methyl ether, washed three times with ether, redissolved in 20% acetic acid, and lyophilized as described. After synthesis, the peptides were purified by HPLC using the same conditions described for purification of the native peptides (see above). Their structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The exact amino acid sequence for each one of the peptides was confirmed by dissolving them to a final concentration of 500 pmol/5 μl of 50% acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid and directly applying them into the Finnigan LCQDuo ion trap spectrometer using a Surveyor MS syringe pump delivery system. The eluate at 10 μl/min was split to allow only 5% of the sample to enter the nanospray source. The spray voltage was set to start at 1.7 kV, and the capillary temperature was set at 115 °C. For MS/MS experiments, the fragmentation source was operated with 25–35V of collision energy and 35–45% (arbitrary units) of normalized collision energy, and the scan was operated with wide band activated. All spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode. The data acquisition and the deconvolution of data were performed with the Xcalibur (Sequest) software. The MS/MS spectra were analyzed manually. The synthetic peptide was dissolved in either HBSS or Ca 2+-free HBSS (pH 7.4) and then filter-sterilized. The sterile peptide solutions were either used directly, or they were mixed for 2 days at room temperature on a Glas-Col rotator (Fisher) and then used for calcium imaging experiments. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C with humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. Ca2+ Imaging—The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in cells loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura-2. Cells were plated onto 25-mm coverslips 1 day before the experiment. On the next morning, cells were washed twice with HEPES-buffered HBSS, loaded for 30 min with 5 μm fura-2 AM that was dissolved in HBSS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin + 0.025% Pluronic F-127, and then unloaded in HBSS for another 30 min. The coverslips were mounted as the bottom of a chamber that was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Fluor 10× objective. Cells in the chamber were perfused via an eight-channel syringe system. A suction pipette maintained a constant volume of solution (∼0.5 ml) in the chamber. An InCyt IM2™ fluorescence imaging system (dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was used to measure [Ca2+]i during the experiment. Excitation light from a xenon light source was alternately passed through 340 and 380 narrow pass filters mounted in a Sutter filter wheel (Lamda 10-C). The 510 nm emissions were captured by a cooled CCD camera (Cohu 4915). The images were transmitted to a computer and processed with the imaging software InCyt IM2™ Version 4.6. [Ca2+]i was calculated by measuring the ratio of the two emission intensities for excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Calcium standard solutions, which were prepared with fura-2 potassium salt, were used to create a graph of fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) as a function of Ca2+ concentration (nm). This graph was then used to convert fluorescence ratios in an experiment to calcium concentrations. In experiments in which Ba2+ influx was measured, the data are reported as the ratio (F340/F380) since the Ba2+ calibrations curves for fura-2 differ from the calibration curve for Ca2+. During the experiment, an averaged response of ∼800 cells from a single field on each coverslip was represented as one trace. For initial experiments, intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and the effect of the toxin was monitored by measuring the amount of reduction of the Ca2+ plateau. In later experiments where Ba2+ entry was monitored as a measure of the level of SOCE, the thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry was obtained by subtracting the slope of the Ba2+ leak (before stimulation) from the slope of Ba2+ influx (after stimulation) for each coverslip. Nominally Ca2+-free HBSS was prepared by stirring Ca2+-free, Mg2+-free, and HCO3-free HBSS with Chelex-100 beads. After filtering out the Chelex-100 beads, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Our initial step was to screen a variety of snake and scorpion venoms in search of an inhibitory effect on SOCE in HEK-293 cells. This was done by investigating the effect of the various venoms on thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry. HEK-293 cells were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin in the presence of HBSS. After an initial peak of Ca2+, the cells establish a stable Ca2+ plateau phase that is rapidly dissipated upon the removal of external Ca2+, indicating that the plateau is strictly dependent on continued influx of external Ca2+. Various dilutions of snake and scorpion venoms were added during the Ca2+ plateau phase to test whether an inhibition of Ca2+ entry occurred. We screened a total of 14 snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix, Agkistrodon contortrix mokeson, Crotalus durissus culminatus, Crotalus durissus cumanensis, Crotalus durissus terrificus, Daboia russelli russelli, Ophiophagus hannah, Naja haje, Naja kaouthia, Naja naja, Naja nivea, Naja pallida, Naja sputatrix, and Bothrops jararaca) and four scorpion (Hadrurus gertschi, Centruroides limpidus limpidus, Centruroides noxius, and P. imperator) venoms and found effects from only one snake venom and one scorpion venom. We undertook an in-depth investigation of the inhibitory agent present in the scorpion venom. The effects of various dilutions of the venom from the African scorpion P. imperator are shown in Fig. 1A. Increasing doses of the P. imperator venom resulted in an enhanced inhibition of the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ plateau. At this point, we were concerned that the reduction in Ca2+ levels might be due to membrane depolarization that resulted from inhibition or activation of some other ion channel by the venom. Although SOCs are not directly regulated by membrane depolarization, the level of SOCE can be affected by a reduction of the driving force following membrane depolarization. To determine whether this was the case, we investigated whether the addition of valinomycin, which locks the membrane in a hyperpolarized state, would eliminate the effect of the P. imperator venom. The data in Fig. 1B show that the addition of valinomycin led to a slight increase in plateau Ca2+ levels but did not block the effect of the P. imperator venom on Ca2+ plateau levels. We also investigated the effect of the P. imperator venom on thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry to rule out the possibility that the venom is working on Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms rather than on Ca2+ entry pathways. Since Ba2+ is not pumped by Ca2+-ATPases (32.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Kwan C.Y. Putney Jr, J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 678-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an inhibition of Ba2+ entry by the venom would indicate that the effect is on a Ca2+ entry pathway. We observed that the venom had a significant inhibitory effect on Ba2+ entry (venom data not shown, but data for purified toxin shown later). The initial step in characterization of the active agent in the P. imperator venom was to fractionate the venom on a gel filtration column. The Sephadex G-50 column separated several families of components based on molecular sizes (Fig. 2). Tubes corresponding to five subfractions (I–V) were pooled and lyophilized. They were all screened to determine their activity for reducing the thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ plateau levels. We observed that only fraction V from the filtration column had an effect on the thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ plateau phase. The data in Fig. 3 illustrate the effects of several doses of fraction V (F5) on the Ca2+ plateau level. We performed additional experiments in the presence of valinomycin and found that fraction V still inhibited Ca2+ plateau levels even in the presence of this hyperpolarizing agent (data not shown, but data for purified toxin shown later).Fig. 3Inhibition of thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry by a partially purified fraction of the P. imperator venom. Fraction V collected from the gel filtration column was diluted in HBSS, and its effect on thapsigargin (TG)-stimulated Ca2+ entry was determined. As described in Fig. 1, once the stable calcium plateau was established, different dilutions of the fraction V (F5) were added, and its effect on the Ca2+ plateau was monitored as a measurement of its effect on Ca2+ entry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fraction V was further fractionated by running samples on a reverse-phase HPLC column and eluting samples with increasing strengths of acetonitrile as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At least 35 distinct components were resolved by this chromatographic step (Fig. 4) that were collected as 13 individual subfractions for bioassay. Inhibition of the thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ plateau phase was observed only with subfraction 7 (Fig. 4, asterisk). Effects of three dilutions of subfraction 7 (SF7) are shown in Fig. 5 where increasing doses of subfraction 7 produced more extensive reduction of the Ca2+ plateau phase.Fig. 5Inhibition of thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry by an HPLC-purified subfraction of the P. imperator venom. Fraction V from the G-50 filtration column was further fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, and the eluted subfraction 7 was diluted in HBSS for fura-2 imaging experiments. As described in Fig. 1, once the stable calcium plateau was established, different dilutions of the subfraction 7 (SF7) were added, and its effect on the Ca2+ plateau phase was monitored as a measurement of its effect on Ca2+ entry. TG, thapsigargin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subfraction 7 was then submitted to automatic Edman degradation, giving the amino acid sequence Leu-Trp-X-X where X was a mixture of amino acids (Lys, Ser, Gly, and Thr). This was an indication of the presence of more than one peptide in this subfraction 7. For this reason another chromatographic separation was conducted (see Fig. 4, inset), allowing the separation of two peptides for which the sequence was confirmed by post-source decay experiments using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Two distinct sequences were finally obtained. Peptide 1 eluting at 23.27 min had the amino acid sequence Leu-Trp-Ser-Gly with a molecular mass of 461.5 atomic mass units, and peptide 2 eluting at 23.82 min had the amino acid sequence Leu-Trp-Lys-Thr with a molecular mass of 546.6 atomic mass units. These short peptides are in small abundance in the venom. Peptide 1 is ∼0.30%, whereas peptide 2 is only 0.17% of the total soluble venom. Significant amounts of peptide analogues containing N-formylkynurenine, an amino acid derivative resulting from Trp oxidation, were also detected in each fraction. Since the amount of native peptides purified from the venom was too low for an extensive biological characterization and because we knew the amino acid sequences of the peptide toxins, we decided to synthesize both peptides. Approximately 30 mg were obtained for each peptide toxin. They were further separated by HPLC (data not shown) giving a yield of 60% for peptide 1 and 72% for peptide 2. The correct amino acid sequence of the synthetic peptides was confirmed by MS/MS analysis using the ion trap spectrometer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effects of the synthetic peptides were investigated on SOCE. Initial studies demonstrated that both peptides had inhibitory activities in terms of reducing the thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ plateau phase (data not shown). However, the potency of the peptides seemed to be somewhat low. Data for inhibition by peptide 2 showed that a dose of 1 μm was required to see measurable inhibition, and maximum inhibition was not observed until a dose of 20 μm was reached (Fig. 6A). Since subfraction 7 from the HPLC separation yielded two small peptides, we explored the possibility that these peptides might be associated into a complex that was responsible for the inhibitory activity in the P. imperator venom. We mixed peptide 1 and peptide 2 in a tube and submitted them to constant rotation for various periods of time ranging from hours to days and then tested the potency of the mixture at various time periods. We found that after 2 days of constant rotation a substantially lower dose of peptide was required for inhibition of SOCE. However, this observation was not unique to the mixture of peptide 1 and peptide 2 as we found that placing either peptide 1 alone or peptide 2 alone under similar conditions resulted in a substantial increase in their potency. The data in Fig. 6B show a representative dose response for peptide 2 treated under such conditions. With this material, one can observe a slight inhibitory effect at a peptide dose as low as 1 nm and a maximum effect at a peptide dose of 1 μm. At this maximum dose the Ca2+ plateau is reduced by ∼50%. To confirm that the modified peptide is inhibiting Ca2+ entry and not stimulating Ca2+ pumps, its effect on Ba2+ entry was measured. For this experiment, we incubated the cells in HBSS and then switched to a Ba2+-containing, Ca2+-free medium to obtain a brief measure of Ba2+ leak flux. The cells were then switched to 0 Ca2+ medium followed by 0 Ca2+ with 1 μm thapsigargin to deplete internal stores. Following the return of Ca2+ to basal levels, 2 mm Ba2+ was again added to monitor total Ba2+ entry. The SOCE was determined by subtracting the Ba2+ leak from the total Ba2+ entry. As is shown in Fig. 7A, the peptide at a dose of 1 μm inhibited Ba2+ entry by ∼50%. A statistical analysis of a series of experiments at a peptide toxin concentration of 1 μm is shown (Fig. 7B). The slope of Ba2+ entry in the control was 0.00072 ± 0.00004 s–1 (n = 13), and in the presence of modified peptide toxin 2 (1 μm) it was 0.00038 ± 0.00002 s–1 (n = 11). These values are significantly different (p = 0.00005). To determine whether the peptide toxin was having its inhibitory effect by depolarizing the cells and thereby decreasing the driving force for Ca2+ entry, we ran similar experiments in the presence of valinomycin, which locks the membrane potential in a hyperpolarized state. We found that the addition of valinomycin slightly increased the thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry, consistent with the predicted effect of membrane hyperpolarization. However, in the presence of valinomycin the modified synthetic peptide 2 still inhibited SOCE by a comparable percentage (Fig. 8). In the presence of valinomycin, Ba2+ entry increased to 0.00084 ± 0.00001 s–1 (n = 4); the addition of modified peptide toxin 2 (1 μm) in the presence of valinomycin reduc"
