https://openalex.org/W2161594732,"The lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy has a crucial role in defence against infection, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and ageing. Accordingly, agents that induce autophagy may have broad therapeutic applications. One approach to developing such agents is to exploit autophagy manipulation strategies used by microbial virulence factors. Here we show that a peptide, Tat-beclin 1-derived from a region of the autophagy protein, beclin 1, which binds human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef-is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a newly identified negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR-1 (also called GLIPR2). Tat-beclin 1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens (including HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya or West Nile virus. Thus, through the characterization of a domain of beclin 1 that interacts with HIV-1 Nef, we have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2128308786,"From the masses of planets orbiting our Sun, and relative elemental abundances, it is estimated that at birth our Solar System required a minimum disk mass of ~0.01 solar masses within ~100 AU of the star. The main constituent, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk mass reservoir, so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally probes the disk surface, while the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires knowledge of the grain properties and gas-to-dust mass ratio, which likely differ from their interstellar values. Thus, mass estimates vary by orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3--10 Myr) star TW Hya, with estimates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.06 solar masses. Here we report the detection the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride, HD, toward TW Hya. HD is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total mass. The HD detection, combined with existing observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass >0.05 solar masses, enough to form a planetary system like our own."
https://openalex.org/W1966897326,"Riverine carbon-14 measurements show that anthropogenic disturbance of peat swamp forest in southeast Asia is causing increased release of carbon that has been stored in the peat for thousands of years. Tropical peatlands contain a large pool of terrestrial organic carbon, but in some locations disturbance by deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This paper quantifies the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from intact and disturbed peat swamp forests in Indonesia and finds that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat forests is 50% larger than that from intact peat forest, and is dominated by century- to millennia-old carbon from the deeper layers of the peat column. The inclusion of the often overlooked fluvial carbon loss term in the peatland carbon budget increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands by 22%. Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams1 (1 Tg is a billion kilograms). Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide1,2,3. Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia—an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances."
https://openalex.org/W1977785594,"Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, is considered to be an obligate diploid that carries recessive lethal mutations throughout the genome. Here we demonstrate that C. albicans has a viable haploid state that can be derived from diploid cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and that seems to arise through a concerted chromosome loss mechanism. Haploids undergo morphogenetic changes like those of diploids, including the yeast-hyphal transition, chlamydospore formation and a white-opaque switch that facilitates mating. Haploid opaque cells of opposite mating type mate efficiently to regenerate the diploid form, restoring heterozygosity and fitness. Homozygous diploids arise spontaneously by auto-diploidization, and both haploids and auto-diploids show a similar reduction in fitness, in vitro and in vivo, relative to heterozygous diploids, indicating that homozygous cell types are transient in mixed populations. Finally, we constructed stable haploid strains with multiple auxotrophies that will facilitate molecular and genetic analyses of this important pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2035286228,"Stroking of the skin produces pleasant sensations that can occur during social interactions with conspecifics, such as grooming. Despite numerous physiological studies (reviewed in ref. 2), molecularly defined sensory neurons that detect pleasant stroking of hairy skin in vivo have not been reported. Previously, we identified a rare population of unmyelinated sensory neurons in mice that express the G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRB4 (refs 5, 6). These neurons exclusively innervate hairy skin with large terminal arborizations that resemble the receptive fields of C-tactile (CT) afferents in humans. Unlike other molecularly defined mechanosensory C-fibre subtypes, MRGPRB4(+) neurons could not be detectably activated by sensory stimulation of the skin ex vivo. Therefore, we developed a preparation for calcium imaging in the spinal projections of these neurons during stimulation of the periphery in intact mice. Here we show that MRGPRB4(+) neurons are activated by massage-like stroking of hairy skin, but not by noxious punctate mechanical stimulation. By contrast, a different population of C fibres expressing MRGPRD was activated by pinching but not by stroking, consistent with previous physiological and behavioural data. Pharmacogenetic activation of Mrgprb4-expressing neurons in freely behaving mice promoted conditioned place preference, indicating that such activation is positively reinforcing and/or anxiolytic. These data open the way to understanding the function of MRGPRB4 neurons during natural behaviours, and provide a general approach to the functional characterization of genetically identified subsets of somatosensory neurons in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2112914350,"A hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the brain. Considerable evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers are responsible for the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficit observed in AD. However, the mechanism by which these oligomers exert their neurotoxic effect remains unknown. Recently, it was reported that Aβ oligomers bind to the cellular prion protein with high affinity. Here, we show that N1, the main physiological cleavage fragment of the cellular prion protein, is necessary and sufficient for binding early oligomeric intermediates during Aβ polymerization into amyloid fibrils. The ability of N1 to bind Aβ oligomers is influenced by positively charged residues in two sites (positions 23-31 and 95-105) and is dependent on the length of the sequence between them. Importantly, we also show that N1 strongly suppresses Aβ oligomer toxicity in cultured murine hippocampal neurons, in a Caenorhabditis elegans-based assay, and in vivo in a mouse model of Aβ-induced memory dysfunction. These data suggest that N1, or small peptides derived from it, could be potent inhibitors of Aβ oligomer toxicity and represent an entirely new class of therapeutic agents for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2049334016,"Genetic and biochemical analyses of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways have revealed proteins such as Argonaute and Dicer as essential cofactors that process and present small RNAs to their targets. Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA- or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins. The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species."
https://openalex.org/W2026218209,"Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) genes encode a broadly conserved family of multipass integral membrane proteins in animals. Human TMC1 and TMC2 genes are linked to human deafness and required for hair-cell mechanotransduction; however, the molecular functions of these and other TMC proteins have not been determined. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans tmc-1 gene encodes a sodium sensor that functions specifically in salt taste chemosensation. tmc-1 is expressed in the ASH polymodal avoidance neurons, where it is required for salt-evoked neuronal activity and behavioural avoidance of high concentrations of NaCl. However, tmc-1 has no effect on responses to other stimuli sensed by the ASH neurons including high osmolarity and chemical repellents, indicating a specific role in salt sensation. When expressed in mammalian cell culture, C. elegans TMC-1 generates a predominantly cationic conductance activated by high extracellular sodium but not by other cations or uncharged small molecules. Thus, TMC-1 is both necessary for salt sensation in vivo and sufficient to generate a sodium-sensitive channel in vitro, identifying it as a probable ionotropic sensory receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1984625008,"The development of collective long-range order via phase transitions occurs by the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries. Magnetism is a consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry while superfluidity results from broken gauge invariance. The broken symmetry that develops below 17.5K in the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2 has long eluded such identification. Here we show that the recent observation of Ising quasiparticles in URu2Si2 results from a spinor order parameter that breaks double time-reversal symmetry, mixing states of integer and half-integer spin. Such ""hastatic order"" hybridizes conduction electrons with Ising 5f^{2} states of the uranium atoms to produce Ising quasiparticles; it accounts for the large entropy of condensation and the magnetic anomaly observed in torque magnetometry. Hastatic order predicts a tiny transverse moment in the conduction sea, a collosal Ising anisotropy in the nonlinear susceptibility anomaly and a resonant energy-dependent nematicity in the tunneling density of states."
https://openalex.org/W2077994489,"Mechanical strain and estrogens both stimulate osteoblast proliferation through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated effects, and both down-regulate the Wnt antagonist Sost/sclerostin. Here, we investigate the differential effects of ERα and -β in these processes in mouse long bone-derived osteoblastic cells and human Saos-2 cells. Recruitment to the cell cycle following strain or 17β-estradiol occurs within 30 min, as determined by Ki-67 staining, and is prevented by the ERα antagonist 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride. ERβ inhibition with 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-β]pyrimidin-3-yl] phenol (PTHPP) increases basal proliferation similarly to strain or estradiol. Both strain and estradiol down-regulate Sost expression, as does in vitro inhibition or in vivo deletion of ERα. The ERβ agonists 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile and ERB041 also down-regulated Sost expression in vitro, whereas the ERα agonist 4,4′,4″-[4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazol-1,3,5-triyl]tris-phenol or the ERβ antagonist PTHPP has no effect. Tamoxifen, a nongenomic ERβ agonist, down-regulates Sost expression in vitro and in bones in vivo. Inhibition of both ERs with fulvestrant or selective antagonism of ERβ, but not ERα, prevents Sost down-regulation by strain or estradiol. Sost down-regulation by strain or ERβ activation is prevented by MEK/ERK blockade. Exogenous sclerostin has no effect on estradiol-induced proliferation but prevents that following strain. Thus, in osteoblastic cells the acute proliferative effects of both estradiol and strain are ERα-mediated. Basal Sost down-regulation follows decreased activity of ERα and increased activity of ERβ. Sost down-regulation by strain or increased estrogens is mediated by ERβ, not ERα. ER-targeting therapy may facilitate structurally appropriate bone formation by enhancing the distinct ligand-independent, strain-related contributions to proliferation of both ERα and ERβ. Mechanical strain and estrogens both stimulate osteoblast proliferation through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated effects, and both down-regulate the Wnt antagonist Sost/sclerostin.

Sost down-regulation by strain or increased estrogens is mediated by ERβ, not ERα. ER-targeting therapy may facilitate structurally appropriate bone formation by enhancing the distinct ligand-independent, strain-related contributions to proliferation of both ERα and ERβ. Bone architecture is adjusted to be functionally appropriate for load-bearing through processes in which the strains engendered by loading initiate cascades of responses in resident bone cells that in turn influence the activity of cells responsible for bone formation and resorption. The activity of these cells is also influenced by estrogens. Loss of estrogens following menopause is associated with the development of osteoporosis, a widespread condition of skeletal inadequacy that has been hypothesized to reflect a failure of the homeostatic mechanisms by which bone adapts to its functional load-bearing environment, commonly referred to as the mechanostat (1Lanyon L. Skerry T. Postmenopausal osteoporosis as a failure of bone's adaptation to functional loading: a hypothesis.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This implies that compounds that target the ERs should be able to enhance the sensitivity of the mechanostat and so provide effective, mechanically appropriate, treatment for osteoporosis. The action of the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen illustrates this; it reduces fracture risk in human patients (5Cooke A.L. Metge C. Lix L. Prior H.J. Leslie W.D.

Mechanical strain stimulates osteoblast proliferation through the estrogen receptor in males as well as females.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, cells overexpressing ERα are more proliferative in response to strain than cells only expressing endogenous ERα (25Zaman G. Cheng M.Z. Jessop H.L. White R.

The role of ERα in bones' local adaptive responses to loading has also been demonstrated in vivo in a number of studies, each of which show a diminished response to loading in female mice when ERα activity is reduced (2Saxon L.K.

Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of ERβ in regulating bones' adaptation to loading remains controversial. The first in vivo study of ER's involvement in loading-related adaptation in bone reported a lower osteogenic response to axial loading of the ulna in female ERβ−/− mice compared with WT littermates (32Lee K.C.

However, later studies using knock-outs regarded as being more “complete,” showed enhanced responses to axial loading (2Saxon L.K. Galea G. Meakin L. Price J. Lanyon L.E.

Metab. 2007; 293: E484-E491Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ERβ has been suggested to be the dominant regulator of estrogen receptor signaling, in part due to its ability to form heterodimers with ERα (34Pettersson K. Delaunay F. Gustafsson J.A. Estrogen receptor β acts as a dominant regulator of estrogen signaling.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the outcomes of ERβ signaling depend on the cellular context in which it operates; whereas ERβ largely inhibits transcriptomic changes caused by estrogen treatment when ERα is present, it promotes expression of a subset of genes when ERα is deleted (35Lindberg M.K. Movérare S. Skrtic S. Gao H. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.A. Ohlsson C. Estrogen receptor (ER) β reduces ERα-regulated gene transcription, supporting a “ying yang” relationship between ERα and ERβ in mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In osteoblastic cells, ERα activation increases ERβ expression (36Somjen D. Katzburg S. Sharon O. Knoll E. Hendel D. Stern N.

Gustafsson J.A. The Ah receptor inhibits estrogen-induced estrogen receptor β in breast cancer cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, ERβ can repress ERα expression (38Bartella V. Rizza P. Barone I. Zito D. Giordano F. Giordano C. Catalano S. Mauro L. Sisci D. Panno M.L. Fuqua S.A. Andò S. Estrogen receptor β binds Sp1 and recruits a corepressor complex to the estrogen receptor α gene promoter.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2012; 134: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and mice lacking ERβ have increased ERα in their bones (39Windahl S.H. Hollberg K. Vidal O. Gustafsson J.A. Ohlsson C. Andersson G. Female estrogen receptor β−/− mice are partially protected against age-related trabecular bone loss.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1388-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The outcomes of ERα and ERβ signaling are therefore closely linked in what has been described as a “ying yang” relationship determined by a subtle balance between them (35Lindberg M.K. Movérare S. Skrtic S. Gao H. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.A. Ohlsson C. Estrogen receptor (ER) β reduces ERα-regulated gene transcription, supporting a “ying yang” relationship between ERα and ERβ in mice.Mol.

Compensation for the absence of ERα activity by ERβ, and vice versa, is demonstrated by the mild effect of loss of either receptor alone compared with deletion of both ERs in bone and other tissues (41Sims N.A.

The adaptive response of bone to mechanical loading in female transgenic mice is deficient in the absence of oestrogen receptor-α and -β.J.

The studies reported here used subtype-selective receptor agonists and antagonists against the ERs to establish the contributions of ERα and ERβ to the regulation of Sost and proliferation by both estradiol and strain in osteoblasts. 17β-Estradiol (E2) was from Sigma and dissolved in molecular grade ethanol (EOH).

The recent discovery of a new enzyme, first identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae from a patient from New Delhi and denoted as NDM-1, represents an example of extreme promiscuity: It hydrolyzes and inactivates nearly all known β-lactam-based antibiotics with startling efficiency. NDM-1 can utilize different metal cofactors and seems to exploit an alternative mechanism based on the reaction conditions. Here we report the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study that examines the substrate, metal binding, and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. We utilize structures obtained through X-ray crystallography, biochemical assays, and numerical simulation to construct a model of the enzyme catalytic pathway. The NDM-1 enzyme interacts with the substrate solely through zinc, or other metals, bound in the active site, explaining the observed lack of specificity against a broad range of β-lactam antibiotic agents. The zinc ions also serve to activate a water molecule that hydrolyzes the β-lactam ring through a proton shuttle."

The number of reliably measured black-hole masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them is limited, holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. Directly measuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (in early-type galaxies), ionised-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-type galaxies) and in rare objects which have central maser emission. Here we report that by modelling the effect of a black-hole on the kinematics of molecular gas it is possible to fit interferometric observations of CO emission and thereby accurately estimate black hole masses. We study the dynamics of the gas in the early-type galaxy NGC4526, and obtain a best fit which requires the presence of a central dark-object of 4.5(+4.2-3.0)x10^8 Msun (3 sigma confidence limit). With next generation mm-interferometers (e.g. ALMA) these observations could be reproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less the 5 hours of observing time. The use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one to estimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local universe, many more than accessible with current techniques."

All strains of influenza virus are prone to developing drug resistance due to the high mutation rate in the viral genome. A therapeutic agent that targets a highly conserved region of the virus could bypass resistance and also be effective against multiple strains of influenza. Influenza uses many individually weak ligand binding interactions for a high avidity multivalent attachment to sialic acid-bearing cells. Polymerized sialic acid analogs can form multivalent interactions with influenza but are not ideal therapeutics due to solubility and toxicity issues. We used liposomes as a novel means for delivery of the glycan sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc). LSTc-bearing decoy liposomes form multivalent, polymer-like interactions with influenza virus. Decoy liposomes competitively bind influenza virus in hemagglutination inhibition assays and inhibit infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition is specific for influenza virus, as inhibition of Sendai virus and respiratory syncytial virus is not observed. In contrast, monovalent LSTc does not bind influenza virus or inhibit infectivity. LSTc decoy liposomes prevent the spread of influenza virus during multiple rounds of replication in vitro and extend survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of virus. LSTc decoy liposomes co-localize with fluorescently tagged influenza virus, whereas control liposomes do not. Considering the conservation of the hemagglutinin binding pocket and the ability of decoy liposomes to form high avidity interactions with influenza hemagglutinin, our decoy liposomes have potential as a new therapeutic agent against emerging influenza strains.

Health impact of influenza in the United States.Pharmacoeconomics. 1996; 9: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The current therapeutic options for influenza are limited, with vaccination being the most effective tool against the disease. Vaccines for influenza require a large lead time from production to delivery, and if the circulating strain drifts, the vaccine would offer little protection (2Potter C.W. A history of influenza.J. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 91: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in pandemic outbreaks, vaccines cannot be generated and delivered at the required speed or level (3Moscona A. Neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Treatments for influenza include small-molecule inhibitors such as amantadine, and neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir and zanamivir. Resistance against these inhibitors in the circulating influenza strains restricts their utility (2Potter C.W. A history of influenza.J. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 91: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the past decade, resistance to amantadine, which inhibits the viral M2 ion channel, emerged in clinical isolates of H1N1 influenza and quickly reached nearly 100% for circulating H3N2 influenza (4Hayden F.

These early experiments demonstrate the validity of using SA functionalized liposomes to inhibit influenza. The liposomal approach can further be improved upon by adding a net negative charge to decrease interactions with host cells (20Deol P. Khuller G.K. Lung specific stealth liposomes. Stability, biodistribution, and toxicity of liposomal antitubercular drugs in mice.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) while increasing the interaction with HA (21van Meer G. Davoust J. Simons K. Parameters affecting low pH-mediated fusion of liposomes with the plasma membrane of cells infected with influenza virus.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SA analog and its attachment chemistry incorporated into the liposomes can be optimized for stronger binding to HA. IAV HA interacts with the host-glycan motif beyond the terminal SA monosaccharide. Monosaccharides extending beyond the SA critically interact with HA and govern the HA-glycan interaction. A common feature of previous pandemic strains is their high affinity binding to α2–6-sialylated glycans that are tetrasaccharides or longer (22Chandrasekaran A. Srinivasan A. Raman R. Viswanathan K.

Here we describe a novel approach to constructing a SA receptor-based therapeutic agent capable of multivalent presentation of SA residues to influenza. Sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc) is a well studied sialooligosaccharide that is a high affinity binder to HA (24Eisen M.B. Sabesan S. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

Avian and human receptor binding by hemagglutinins of influenza A viruses.Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A liposome-based delivery platform allows spherical display and lateral diffusion of SA in the plane of the membrane. This display leads to a proper presentation of SA, as distribution and configuration affects the avidity of SA analogs for influenza (27Lees W.J. Spaltenstein A. Kingery-Wood J.E. Whitesides G.M. Polyacrylamides bearing pendant α-sialoside groups strongly inhibit agglutination of erythrocytes by influenza A virus. Multivalency and steric stabilization of particulate biological systems.J. Med.

We demonstrate that LSTc-sialoside-bearing liposomes can present SA in a multivalent fashion to enable high avidity binding to influenza HA. Our data show that decoy liposomes bind strongly to influenza viral particles and can inhibit IAV infectivity in vitro as well as extend survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of influenza A virus in vivo. LSTc was either obtained from a commercial source (Dextra, Reading, UK) or purified from milk. Frozen bovine milk was thawed and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper fatty layer was discarded, and the lower aqueous layer was mixed with 2 volumes of ethanol and kept at 4 °C overnight. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant, consisting primarily of oligosaccharides and lactose, was dried under nitrogen at room temperature and then reconstituted with 0.2 volumes of fresh 20% methanol and stored at −20 °C until use. To separate LSTc from other oligosaccharides, the reconstituted solution was subjected to dual stage purification using size exclusion as the first step to remove high molecular weight material and to exchange the sample into a suitable buffer. As the second step, weak anion exchange purification was performed using ammonium formate as the eluting agent. Fractions were monitored by mass spectrometry. LSTc fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Purity of sample was assessed using capillary electrophoresis. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and N-(FMoc-13-amino-4,7,10-trioxa-tridecyl)succinamic acid (FMOC) (Polypeptide Laboratories, San Diego, CA) were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was purchased from Sigma. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica-coated glass plates. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 Å. Mass spectrometry was performed using 4800 MALDI-MS and MALDI-TOF instruments (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Solvent evaporation was performed on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 30–35 °C. All other synthetic lipids were purchased as solutions in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) including: DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (sodium salt)), and DOPE-NBD (DOPE-N-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (ammonium salt)). Cholesterol (purity ≥99%, Mr 386.65) was purchased dry (Sigma) and dissolved in chloroform. Chloroform (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ) was >99.8% pure and stabilized with 200 proof ethanol (Goldshield Chemical Co., Hayward, CA), hydrochloric acid was certified ACS plus (Fisher), and all water used was ultra-purified (MilliQ A10, Millipore, Billerica, MA). LSTc incorporation into glycolipid was quantified by HPLC as described by Klein et al. (28Klein A. Diaz S. Ferreira I. Lamblin G. Roussel P. Manzi A.E.

Samples were treated with 30 μl of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene labeling mixture (1.6 mg of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride, 3.1 mg of sodium hydrosulfite, 58 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, 82 μl of glacial acetic acid per ml) at 50 °C for 2.5 h in the dark. Samples were diluted with 20 μl of double distilled H2O and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a TSKgel ODS-120T column (Tosoh Corp., South San Francisco, CA) running 7% methanol in water. Fluorescence of the 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene-SA complex is detected at excitation 373/emission 448. Gas-tight syringes (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) and 4 ml borosilicate glass vials with Teflon-lined caps (National Scientific, Rockwood, TN) were thoroughly cleaned before use. Syringes were rinsed 10× with 100% ethanol and then 10× with chloroform. Vials were soaked in 300 mm HCl for 1.5 h and then rinsed thoroughly with water, 3× with ethanol, and 3× with chloroform. Residual solvent was evaporated under a filtered stream of dry nitrogen gas. Lipids were mixed and deposited in clean vials using clean syringes. Solvent was evaporated under a filtered stream of dry nitrogen gas while manually rotating the vial until only a thin layer of lipid remained on the inner walls. Residual solvent was removed by placing uncapped vials in a desiccator (Dry Seal; Wheaton, Millville, NJ) followed by application of reduced pressure for 24 h using an oil-free diaphragm vacuum pump (Gast, Benton Harbor, MI). Aqueous lipid solutions were made by hydrating lipid films in 150 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl, 8.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and vortexing for 2 min in 30 s intervals. Lipid solutions were then subjected to 10 rapid cycles of freeze-thawing by submersion in liquid nitrogen and 70 °C water, respectively, to break apart multi-lamellar structures and then extruded through 200 nm pores. Extrusion consisted of either 10 passes through an aluminum oxide membrane using a Lipex Thermobarrel Extruder (Northern Lipids, Burnaby, BC, Canada) or 21 passes through a polycarbonate membrane using a LiposoFast-Basic Extruder (Avestin; Ottowa, ON, Canada). Extruders were thoroughly cleaned and primed with buffer before use. After the final pass, samples were collected in a clean vial, sealed with a Teflon-lined cap, and stored at 4 °C until use. Lipid concentration post-extrusion relative to pre-extrusion was determined by fluorimetry. Typical recoveries were ∼50% with the Lipex Thermobarrel Extruder and ∼80% with the LiposoFast-Basic Extruder. The concentration of lipid in a final solution made from a stock mixture of 3 mol% DOPE-NBD and 97 mol% DOPC was determined colorimetrically as described (29Weirich K.L. Israelachvili J.N. Fygenson D.K. Bilayer edges catalyze supported lipid bilayer formation.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 85-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and served as a reference for fluorimetric measurements on solutions made from the same lipid stock. Results were consistent with concentrations estimated based on mass lipid deposited and volume hydrated. Samples containing DOPE-NBD or DOPE-rhodamine were hydrated to an estimated concentration of 7.7 mm total lipid. Diameter and polydispersity of liposomes were determined by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano; Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) specifying a lipid refractive index of 1.480 and a dispersant (150 mm PBS) refractive index of 1.332. Measurements were taken using 40 μl of disposable cuvettes at room temperature (20 °C) and a backscattering angle of 173 degrees. Data are reported as the average of 5 measurements separated by 15 s. Decoy liposomes were stored at 4 °C for 12 months and were stable over this period, retaining their anti-influenza properties. Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR/8, H1N1) was generously provided by Susan Swain (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Influenza A/Philippines X-79 (H3N2) was provided by Richard Dutton (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Influenza A/Aichi/68 (X-31, H3N2) and Sendai virus (Cantell Strain) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (North Franklin, CT). Influenza A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) was purchased from Meridian Life Science (Saco, ME). Influenza viruses and Sendai virus were originally grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. Influenza viruses were stored at −80 °C before use and titered on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain A2 was grown in Vero cells in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and cell debris was frozen at −80 °C and subsequently titered on Vero cells. Recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 with AlexaFluor 647 covalently attached to the HA protein via sortase (WSN HA-647) was prepared as described (30Popp M.W. Karssemeijer R.A. Ploegh H.L. Chemoenzymatic site-specific labeling of influenza glycoproteins as a tool to observe virus budding in real time.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002604Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C before use. MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. A549 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin. Vero cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin. Female C57BL/6 wild-type mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were 8–10 weeks of age at the time of infection. IAV (1000 plaque forming units (PFU)) was combined with LSTc decoy liposomes (170 μm SA) or the equivalent amount of control liposomes in a final volume of 30 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were stored on ice until use. Mice were infected intratracheally with 30 μl of sample and monitored daily. Mice were scored as deceased when found dead or were clearly imminently moribund, in which case they were euthanized. The University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental protocols. Red blood cells (RBCs) were isolated from normal human peripheral blood, blood type O. Whole blood was washed in sterile PBS 3 times to remove serum. Packed RBCs were diluted 1:30 in sterile PBS and stored at 4 °C before use. All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. HA titers for each virus were determined on RBCs before inhibition studies per standard protocol (31Choi S.K. Mammen M. Whitesides G.M. Monomeric inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase enhance the hemagglutination inhibition activities of polyacrylamides presenting multiple C-sialoside groups.Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays, liposome samples were diluted 2-fold in PBS. Four HA units of virus in 25 μl of PBS were added to all dilutions. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 50 μl of diluted RBCs were added to the wells and incubated for an additional hour at room temperature to allow agglutination. The HAI titer is the reciprocal of the last dilution of liposomes that results in non-agglutinated RBCs. MDCK cells were seeded into 12-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to form monolayers. Liposome samples were diluted to the desired concentration in sterile PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in a final volume of 225 μl. IAV was diluted to 300 PFU/ml and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with liposome samples and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS, 1% BSA, and samples were added to wells in duplicate (200 μl per well). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h on MDCK cells. Cells were washed with PBS, 1% BSA and overlaid with freshly prepared 0.5% agar in DMEM-F-12 and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-hemagglutinin antibody MAB8261 (Millipore). Plaques were visualized with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BD Biosciences) and developed with peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Viral plaques in the MDCK monolayer were counted, and the PFU/ml was determined. For some experiments, RSV was used in a similar fashion, except as noted. Vero cells were grown to confluency in 24-well plates. Liposome samples were diluted to the desired concentration in serum-free DMEM in a final volume of 130 μl. RSV was diluted to 1000 PFU/ml and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with liposome samples and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Vero cells were prewashed in serum-free DMEM before the addition of 100 μl of sample in duplicate. After 1 h of infection, cells were washed with DMEM, 10% FBS and incubated in DMEM, 10% FBS and 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin for 3 days at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 80/20 (v/v) acetone/PBS and stained with anti-F and anti-G glycoprotein antibodies (MAB8599 and MAB858, respectively; 1:1000 dilution, Millipore). RSV plaques were visualized and quantified as for IAV. MDCK cells were seeded into 24-well plates and allowed to grow to confluency overnight at 37 °C. MDCK monolayers were washed with PBS, 1% BSA and treated with decoy liposomes ranging in concentration from 1 to 1000 nm LSTc or control liposomes at lipid concentrations equivalent to the 1000 nm LSTc decoy liposome treatment for 30 min at 37 °C. Treated MDCK cells were then infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 or 0.001 of PR/8 diluted in PBS, 1% BSA without removal of liposome solution. After an infection period of 1 h at 37 °C, the inocula were removed, and MDCK cells were washed with PBS, 1% BSA. Viral growth medium (0.5 ml) with identical liposome treatment as during th"

We demonstrate in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells that activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, by a cAMP analog Bt2cAMP, enhanced expression of HSL and its phosphorylation (P) at Ser-660 and Ser-563, but not at Ser-565, concomitant with increased HSL activity. Phosphorylation and activation of HSL coincided with increases in StAR, P-StAR (Ser-194), and progesterone levels. Inhibition of HSL activity by CAY10499 effectively suppressed Bt2cAMP-induced StAR expression and progesterone synthesis. Targeted silencing of endogenous HSL, with siRNAs, resulted in increased cholesteryl ester levels and decreased cholesterol content in MA-10 cells. Depletion of HSL affected lipoprotein-derived cellular cholesterol influx, diminished the supply of cholesterol to the mitochondria, and resulted in the repression of StAR and P-StAR levels. Cells overexpressing HSL increased the efficacy of liver X receptor (LXR) ligands on StAR expression and steroid synthesis, suggesting HSL-mediated steroidogenesis entails enhanced oxysterol production. Conversely, cells deficient in LXRs exhibited decreased HSL responsiveness. Furthermore, an increase in HSL was correlated with the LXR target genes, steroid receptor element-binding protein 1c and ATP binding cassette transporter A1, demonstrating HSL-dependent regulation of steroidogenesis predominantly involves LXR signaling. LXRs interact/cooperate with RXRs and result in the activation of StAR gene transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2016410233,"The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Although defects in SERCA activity are known to cause heart failure, the regulatory mechanisms imposed by PLN and SLN could have clinical implications for both heart and skeletal muscle diseases. PLN and SLN have significant sequence homology in their transmembrane regions, suggesting a similar mode of binding to SERCA. However, unlike PLN, SLN has a conserved C-terminal luminal tail composed of five amino acids ((27)RSYQY), which may contribute to a distinct SERCA regulatory mechanism. We have functionally characterized alanine mutants of the C-terminal tail of SLN using co-reconstituted proteoliposomes of SERCA and SLN. We found that Arg(27) and Tyr(31) are essential for SLN function. We also tested the effect of a truncated variant of SLN (Arg(27)stop) and extended chimeras of PLN with the five luminal residues of SLN added to its C terminus. The Arg(27)stop form of SLN resulted in loss of function, whereas the PLN chimeras resulted in superinhibition with characteristics of both PLN and SLN. Based on our results, we propose that the C-terminal tail of SLN is a distinct, essential domain in the regulation of SERCA and that the functional properties of the SLN tail can be transferred to PLN."
https://openalex.org/W2040289150,"In neurons, dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are thought to contribute to signal-regulated gene expression. Here we show that in mouse hippocampal neurons, synaptic activity-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is a common feature of all members of class IIa HDACs, which distinguishes them from other classes of HDACs. Nuclear calcium, a key regulator in neuronal gene expression, is required for the nuclear export of a subset of class IIa HDACs. We found that inhibition of nuclear calcium signaling using CaMBP4 or increasing the nuclear calcium buffering capacity by means of expression of a nuclear targeted version of parvalbumin (PV.NLS-mC) led to a build-up of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the cell nucleus, which in the case of PV.NLS-mC can be reversed by nuclear calcium transients triggered by bursts of action potential firing. A similar nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 was observed in vivo in the mouse hippocampus following stereotaxic delivery of recombinant adeno-associated viruses expressing either CaMBP4 or PV.NLS-mC. The modulation of HDAC4 activity either by RNA interference-mediated reduction of HDAC4 protein levels or by expression of a constitutively nuclear localized mutant of HDAC4 leads to changes in the mRNA levels of several nuclear calcium-regulated genes with known functions in acquired neuroprotection (atf3, serpinb2), memory consolidation (homer1, arc), and the development of chronic pain (ptgs2, c1qc). These results identify nuclear calcium as a regulator of nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5. The reduction of nuclear localized HDACs represents a novel transcription-promoting pathway stimulated by nuclear calcium."

Dyrk2 phosphorylates TERT protein, a catalytic subunit of telomerase. Phosphorylated TERT is then associated with the EDD-DDB1-VprBP E3 ligase complex for subsequent ubiquitin-mediated TERT protein degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2011076214,"Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the formation of two different types of plasma membrane structures: peripheral ruffles and dorsal ruffles. Although the formation of both ruffle types requires activation of the small GTPase Rac, the difference in kinetics suggests that a distinct regulatory mechanism operates for their ruffle formation. DOCK1 and DOCK5 are atypical Rac activators and are both expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We found that although PDGF-induced Rac activation and peripheral ruffle formation were coordinately regulated by DOCK1 and DOCK5 in MEFs, DOCK1 deficiency alone impaired dorsal ruffle formation in MEFs. Unlike DOCK5, DOCK1 bound to phosphatidic acid (PA) through the C-terminal polybasic amino acid cluster and was localized to dorsal ruffles. When this interaction was blocked, PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle formation was severely impaired. In addition, we show that phospholipase D, an enzyme that catalyzes PA synthesis, is required for PDGF-induced dorsal, but not peripheral, ruffle formation. These results indicate that the phospholipase D-PA axis selectively controls dorsal ruffle formation by regulating DOCK1 localization.

These results indicate that the phospholipase D-PA axis selectively controls dorsal ruffle formation by regulating DOCK1 localization.

Membrane ruffles are highly dynamic and F-actin-rich structures and are classified into two types: peripheral ruffles and dorsal ruffles, according to their morphology and localization (1Buccione R.

Peripheral ruffles are formed by the bending upward of the leading edge and are associated with cell motility (2Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Cell migration. Integrating signals from front to back.Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3813) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dorsal ruffles are the unique membrane structures characterized by a ring-shaped morphology and are thought to play important roles in macropinocytosis, internalization of cell surface receptors, and three-dimensional migration and invasion (3Swanson J.A.

Notably, the kinetics of these structures are not identical with peripheral ruffles being formed continuously upon stimulation with growth factors, whereas dorsal ruffles typically do not form until minutes after stimulation, and their formation is more transient (1Buccione R.

Therefore, the mechanism controlling activation and localization of Rac may be distinct between peripheral and dorsal ruffle formation. receptor tyrosine kinase DOCK homology region 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-clorohalopemide guanine nucleotide exchange factor mouse embryonic fibroblast phosphatidic acid phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine pleckstrin homology phosphatidylserine phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate phospholipase D. Like other small GTPases, Rac functions as a molecular switch by cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states, and stimulus-induced formation of the active Rac is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (10Schmidt A. Hall A. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases. Turning on the switch.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). There are two distinct families of Rac GEFs: Dbl homology domain-containing proteins and DOCK proteins (10Schmidt A. Hall A. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases. Turning on the switch.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 11Côté J.F. Vuori K.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that the DOCK proteins act as major Rac GEFs in varied biological settings. For example, DOCK2, which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, plays key roles in migration and activation of leukocytes (12Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H. Abe M.

Upon stimulation with growth factors, Rac is preferentially activated in peripheral and dorsal ruffles (2Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T.

The Rac GEFs contain a variety of localization motifs such as pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and DHR-1 domain, both of which bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (10Schmidt A.

PI3Ks have important roles in membrane ruffle formation probably by regulating local concentration of PIP3 (1Buccione R. Orth J.D. McNiven M.A. Foot and mouth. Podosomes, invadopodia and circular dorsal ruffles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A.

However, PIP3 production alone cannot explain the difference in kinetics of peripheral and dorsal ruffle formation. On the other hand, phosphatidic acid (PA) is a negatively charged phospholipid that can function as a lipid anchor by binding directly to positively charged sites on effector proteins (27Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Phosphatidic acid- and phosphatidylserine-binding proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In response to growth factors, PA is partly generated through hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (PLD) (28McDermott M. Wakelam M.J. Morris A.J. Phospholipase D.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29Jenkins G.M. Frohman M.A. Phospholipase D. A lipid centric review.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2305-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although the activity of PLD has been implicated in growth factor-induced macropinocytosis (30Haga Y. Miwa N. Jahangeer S. Okada T. Nakamura S. CtBP1/BARS is an activator of phospholipase D1 necessary for agonistinduced macropinocytosis.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. By analyzing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in DOCK1 and/or DOCK5, we found that these GEFs have different roles in PDGF-induced peripheral and dorsal ruffle formation. In this study, we provide evidence that the PLD-PA axis selectively controls dorsal ruffle formation by regulating DOCK1 localization. Mice selectively lacking DOCK1 SH3 domain (D1d/d) have been generated by crossing mice with a DOCK1 allele containing floxed exon 2 with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice, as previously reported (21Sanematsu F.

PIP3- or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2)-coated beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-GFP antibody, and Alexa Fluor 546- or 647-conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-GST (B-14), anti-DOCK1 (C-19), and anti-β-actin (I-19) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Rac antibody (23A8) was obtained from Millipore. PDGF-BB was obtained from Peprotech. Polyclonal anti-DOCK5 antibody was produced by immunization of rabbits with peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portion (residue 1853–1868) of mouse DOCK5. For expression of N-terminally tagged GFP fusion proteins and mCherry in mammalian cells, pCI-GFP and pCI-mCherry vectors were created by subcloning a cDNA encoding EGFP or mCherry (Clontech) into pCI (Promega), respectively. The cDNA encoding the WT or mutant DOCK1 or DOCK5 or the PH domain of SOS (residues 423–551) was subcloned into pCI-GFP. The pCI vector encoding DOCK1 with the HA tag at its C terminus has been created by PCR. The pcDNA vector encoding V5-tagged ELMO1 has been described previously (34Sanui T. Inayoshi A. Noda M. Iwata E. Stein J.V. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y. DOCK2 regulates Rac activation and cytoskeletal reorganization through interaction with ELMO1.Blood. 2003; 102: 2948-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The retroviral vector expressing Cre recombinase was created using pMxs-IRES-GFP (35Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. STAT5 as a molecular regulator of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in hematopoietic cells.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To expresses the DOCK1 chimera molecule encoding the C-terminal region of DOCK5 (designated D1/5C), the Dock1 gene corresponding to the C-terminal region (residues 1553–1865) was replaced with the Dock5 gene encoding amino acid residues 1578–1868 in pCI-GFP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of inverse PCR. To bacterially express recombinant proteins encoding GST at the N terminus, the cDNA encoding the C-terminal region of DOCK1 (residues 1610–1865), DOCK5 (residues 1634–1868), lactadherin-C2 (residues 277–463), or Akt-PH (residues 1–167) was subcloned into pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare). Recombinant proteins were expressed in ArcticExpress bacterial strain (Agilent) and then purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of MEFs, embryonic day 13.5 embryos were trypsinized and cultured in DMEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% FCS (complete DMEM). MEFs were transfected with WT or mutant DOCK1 or DOCK5 constructs by using Nucleofector kit V (Lonza), except for pCI-GFP vector encoding the C-terminal fragment of DOCK1 (residues 1612–1865). For transfection of this plasmid and pCI-GFP SOS PH into MEFs, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used. Recombinant retrovirus was prepared as previously described (17Gotoh K. Tanaka Y. Nishikimi A.

Twenty-four hours after the last infection, cells were washed with complete DMEM and cultured for 96 h for PDGF stimulation. Transient transfection into HEK293T cells was performed with polyethylenimine. For Rac activation assay, aliquots of the cell extracts were kept for total lysate controls, and the remaining extracts were incubated with GST fusion Rac-binding domain of PAK1 at 4 °C for 60 min. The bound proteins and the same amounts of total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with relevant antibodies. MEFs prepared from various knock-out mouse lines were seeded on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami Glass). After serum starvation overnight, the cells were stimulated with PDGF (30 ng/ml) for the specified times. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100-PBS for 5 min, blocked with 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h, and stained with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated phalloidin. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with FIPI (750 nm) (33Su W. Yeku O. Olepu S. Genna A. Park J.S. Ren H. Du G. Gelb M.H. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. 5-Fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI), a phospholipase D pharmacological inhibitor that alters cell spreading and inhibits chemotaxis.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 45 min before stimulation with PDGF (30 ng/ml). For ratiometric analyses, the GFP fusion WT or mutant DOCK1 or DOCK5 constructs (3 μg) were coexpressed with pCI-mCherry (1 μg) in MEFs, and the cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dish in the presence of sodium butyrate (1.5 mm) for 48 h. After stimulation with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 7 min, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-GFP antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin. The ratio images of GFP/mCherry were created with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) and were used to represent the efficiency of the ratio. For rescue experiments, the GFP fusion WT or mutant DOCK1 constructs (3 μg) were expressed in D1d/d MEFs before stimulation with PDGF (50 ng/ml). All of the samples were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 META; Zeiss). For preparation of liposomes, a mixture of PC, PE, and specified concentration of PA or PS was dissolved in chloroform and dried in SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments). The lipid powder was resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by vigorous vortexing for 10 min. Before use, liposomes were precipitated at 20,000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with TBS. The GST-tagged recombinant proteins were mixed with liposomes (400 μg) or lipid-coated beads in TBS supplemented with Nonidet P-40 (final 0.005% for liposomes and 0.25% for lipid-coated beads) to make 1 ml of solution. The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature and washed twice (for liposomes) or four times (for lipid-coated beads) with TBS containing 0.005% or 0.25% of Nonidet P-40 followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g (for liposomes) or 300 × g (for lipid-coated beads) at 4 °C. The binding proteins were immunoblotted using anti-GST antibody. To assay proteins expressed in HEK293T cells for lipid binding, cells transfected with the specified plasmid DNAs were suspended in 0.6 ml of TBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and subjected to a single freeze and thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted 40-fold with TBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm PMSF and then subjected to liposome binding assays at 4 °C as described above. MEFs from WT and PLD1/2 double deficient (PLD1/2−/−) mice were labeled with 32Pi and stimulated with PDGF (30 ng/ml). There was no difference in 32Pi incorporation into phospholipids between them (data not shown). Cellular PA levels at the specified times were measured by thin layer chromatography as previously described (36Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M.

We first examined the role of DOCK1 or DOCK5 in RTK-mediated Rac activation. In response to PDGF stimulation, Rac was activated in D1d/d and D5−/− MEFs, as well as in WT MEFs (Fig. 1B). In contrast, PDGF-induced Rac activation was severely impaired in MEFs lacking the expression of both DOCK1 and DOCK5 (D1d/dD5−/−; Fig. 1B). Consistent with this finding, PDGF-induced peripheral ruffle formation occurred normally in D1d/d MEFs and D5−/− MEFs but was almost completely lost in D1d/dD5−/− MEFs (Fig. 1, C, D, and F). These results indicate that in MEFs, DOCK1 and DOCK5 are major Rac GEFs acting downstream of PDGF RTK and regulate coordinately peripheral ruffle formation. Surprisingly, however, PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle formation was severely impaired in D1d/d MEFs at any concentrations tested (Fig. 1, C, E, and G), despite the normal expression of DOCK5 (Fig. 1A).

Ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of mutant AR protein is a critical characteristic of the pathogenesis of SBMA. SBMA has been modeled in AR-overexpressing animals, but precisely how the polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a new technology that can be used to model human diseases, study pathogenic mechanisms, and develop novel drugs. We established SBMA patient-derived iPSCs, investigated their cellular biochemical characteristics, and found that SBMA-iPSCs can differentiate into motor neurons. The CAG repeat numbers in the AR gene of SBMA-iPSCs and also in the atrophin-1 gene of iPSCs derived from another polyQ disease, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA), remain unchanged during reprogramming, long term passage, and differentiation, indicating that polyQ disease-associated CAG repeats are stable during maintenance of iPSCs. The level of AR expression is up-regulated by neuronal differentiation and treatment with the AR ligand dihydrotestosterone. Filter retardation assays indicated that aggregation of ARs following dihydrotestosterone treatment in neurons derived from SBMA-iPSCs increases significantly compared with neurological control iPSCs, easily recapitulating the pathological feature of mutant ARs in SBMA-iPSCs. This phenomenon was not observed in iPSCs and fibroblasts, thereby showing the neuron-dominant phenotype of this disease. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin sharply decreased the level of aggregated AR in neurons derived from SBMA-iPSCs, indicating a potential for discovery and validation of candidate drugs.

We show that hCOA3 physically interacts with both the mitochondrial translation machinery and COX structural subunits. We conclude that hCOA3 stabilizes COX1 co-translationally and promotes its assembly with COX partner subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2079749889,"Redundancies in both the ubiquitin and epithelial sodium transport pathways allude to their importance of proteolytic degradation and ion transport in maintaining normal cell function. The classical pathway implicated in ubiquitination of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) involves Nedd4-2 regulation of sodium channel subunit expression and has been studied extensively studied. However, less attention has been given to the role of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. Here we show that Nedd8 plays an important role in the ubiquitination of ENaC in alveolar epithelial cells. We report that the Nedd8 pathway is redox-sensitive and that under oxidizing conditions Nedd8 conjugation to Cullin-1 is attenuated, resulting in greater surface expression of α-ENaC. This observation was confirmed in our electrophysiology studies in which we inhibited Nedd8-activating enzyme using MLN4924 (a specific Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor) and observed a marked increase in ENaC activity (measured as the product of the number of channels (N) and the open probability (Po) of a channel). These results suggest that ubiquitination of lung ENaC is redox-sensitive and may have significant implications for our understanding of the role of ENaC in pulmonary conditions where oxidative stress occurs, such as pulmonary edema and acute lung injury."

The development of a proper dendritic branching pattern strongly relies on interactions between the extracellular environment and intracellular processes responsible for dendrite growth and stability. We previously showed that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is crucial for this process. In this work, we performed a screen for modifiers of dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons, the expression of which is potentially regulated by mTOR. As a result, we identified Cyr61, an angiogenic factor with unknown neuronal function, as a novel regulator of dendritic growth, which controls dendritic growth in a β1-integrin-dependent manner."

The phosphatase activity of PRL has been reported to be important for promoting metastasis, and it is inactivated by reversible oxidation of its catalytic cysteine. Here, we show that TRP32 specifically reduces PRL. Reduction of oxidized PRL in cells is inhibited by 2,4-dinitro-1-chlorobenzene, an inhibitor of TRX reductase. In vitro assays for the reduction of PRL show that only TRP32 can potently reduce oxidized PRL, whereas other TRX-related proteins linked to TRX reductase show little or no reducing activity. Indeed, TRP32 knockdown significantly prolongs the H2O2-induced oxidation of PRL. Binding analyses reveal that the unique C-terminal domain of TRP32 is required and sufficient for its direct interaction with PRL. These results suggest that TRP32 maintains the reduced state of PRL and thus regulates the biological function of PRL."

Accordingly, inhibition of sEH hydrolase activity has been shown to be beneficial in multiple models of cardiovascular diseases, thus identifying sEH as a valuable therapeutic target. Recently, a common human polymorphism (R287Q) was identified that reduces sEH hydrolase activity and is localized to the dimerization interface of the protein, suggesting a relationship between sEH dimerization and activity. To directly test the hypothesis that dimerization is essential for the proper function of sEH, we generated mutations within the sEH protein that would either disrupt or stabilize dimerization. We quantified the dimerization state of each mutant using a split firefly luciferase protein fragment-assisted complementation system. The hydrolase activity of each mutant was determined using a fluorescence-based substrate conversion assay. We found that mutations that disrupted dimerization also eliminated hydrolase enzymatic activity. In contrast, a mutation that stabilized dimerization restored hydrolase activity. Finally, we investigated the kinetics of sEH dimerization and found that the human R287Q polymorphism was metastable and capable of swapping dimer partners faster than the WT enzyme. These results indicate that dimerization is required for sEH hydrolase activity. Disrupting sEH dimerization may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing sEH hydrolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2159272367,"Of all our mechanosensitive tissues, skeletal muscle is the most developmentally responsive to physical activity. Conversely, restricted mobility due to injury or disease results in muscle atrophy. Gravitational force is another form of mechanical input with profound developmental consequences. The mechanical unloading resulting from the reduced gravitational force experienced during spaceflight results in oxidative muscle loss. We examined the early stages of myogenesis under conditions of simulated microgravity (SM). C2C12 mouse myoblasts in SM proliferated more slowly (2.23× less) as a result of their being retained longer within the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (2.10× more) relative to control myoblasts at terrestrial gravity. Blocking calcium entry via TRP channels with SKF-96365 (10–20 μM) accumulated myoblasts within the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and retarded their proliferation. On the genetic level, SM resulted in the reduced expression of TRPC1 and IGF-1 isoforms, transcriptional events regulated by calcium downstream of mechanical input. A decrease in TRPC1-mediated calcium entry thus appears to be a pivotal event in the muscle atrophy brought on by gravitational mechanical unloading. Hence, relieving the constant force of gravity on cells might prove one valid experimental approach to expose the underlying mechanisms modulating mechanically regulated developmental programs.—Benavides Damm, T., Richard, S., Tanner, S., Wyss, F., Egli, M., Franco-Obregón, A.

How SULTs select substrates from the scores of competing ligands present in a cytosolic milieu is an important issue in the field. Selectivity appears to be sterically controlled by a molecular pore that opens and closes in response to nucleotide binding. This point of view is fostered by structures showing nucleotide-dependent pore closure and the fact that nucleotide binding induces an isomerization that restricts access to the acceptor-binding pocket. Molecular dynamics models underscore the importance of pore isomerization in selectivity and predict that specific molecular linkages stabilize the closed pore in response to nucleotide binding. To test the pore model, these linkages were disrupted in SULT2A1 via mutagenesis, and the effects on selectivity were determined. The mutations uncoupled nucleotide binding from selectivity and produced enzymes that no longer discriminated between large and small substrates. The mutations did not affect the affinity or turnover of small substrates but resulted in a 183-fold gain in catalytic efficiently toward large substrates. Models predict that an 11-residue “flap” covering the acceptor-binding pocket can open and admit large substrates when nucleotide is bound; a mutant structure demonstrated that this is so.

It is increasingly recognized that TGFβ signaling is regulated by cross-talk with other signaling pathways. We previously reported that TGFβ activates protein kinase A (PKA) independent of cAMP through an interaction of an activated Smad3-Smad4 complex and the regulatory subunit of the PKA holoenzyme (PKA-R). Here we define the interaction domains of Smad4 and PKA-R and the functional consequences of this interaction. Using a series of Smad4 and PKA-R truncation mutants, we identified amino acids 290-300 of the Smad4 linker region as critical for the specific interaction of Smad4 and PKA-R. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that the B cAMP binding domain of PKA-R was sufficient for interaction with Smad4. Targeting of B domain regions conserved among all PKA-R isoforms and exposed on the molecular surface demonstrated that amino acids 281-285 and 320-329 were required for complex formation with Smad4. Interactions of these specific regions of Smad4 and PKA-R were necessary for TGFβ-mediated increases in PKA activity, CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) phosphorylation, induction of p21, and growth inhibition. Moreover, this Smad4-PKA interaction was required for TGFβ-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion of pancreatic tumor cells, and regulation of tumor growth in vivo."

These data suggested that the progranulin interaction with other proteins can affect its cleavage and bioactivity, which is relevant to understanding its function in the circulation. In the present study, we characterized the molecular properties of secreted progranulin. First, we provide biochemical evidence that recombinant progranulin exists as a homodimer in conditioned cell culture media and in mouse and human plasma. Second, we utilize a variety of assays, including ultracentrifugation, gel-filtration chromatography, and lipid binding assays, to provide evidence that progranulin is not a component of HDL.

Mouse blood was collected from non-fasted, anesthetized mice by heart puncture in EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt). Human venous blood was collected from non-fasted, healthy donors. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 900 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Samples (100 μl of plasma or 4 μg of purified protein) were separated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Eluate was collected as 90 500-μl fractions. The column was calibrated by using protein standards (Sigma). For some experiments (Fig. 3, B and D), the fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 0.5-ml columns (10-kDa cutoff). For lipoprotein analyses, the fractions corresponding to very low density lipoproteins, intermediate density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins (LDL), and HDL were identified by measuring the cholesterol content of fractions 13–48 using the Cholesterol E kit (Wako). For the experiments in Fig. 3, fresh plasma was delipidated as described (28Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. A solvent system for delipidation of plasma or serum without protein precipitation.J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, EDTA was added to plasma to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the sample was then mixed with two volumes of butanol/diisopropyl ether (40:60, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min, and the aqueous phase was collected with a syringe. Plasma lipoproteins were isolated from mouse and human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation in a TLA-100.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments) (29Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H.

Commercial preparations of HDL and LDL were obtained from Meridian Life Science and Fitzgerald Industries. The open reading frame of the human GRN gene was amplified using cDNA obtained from HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells and the Phusion DNA polymerase kit (New England Biolabs). The forward and reverse primers used in this reaction were CGTACGAATTCATGTGGACCCTGGTGAGCTGGGTGCTACGCGGCCGCCAGCAGCTGTCTCAAGGCTGG, respectively. The open reading frame of the human APOA1 gene was amplified using cDNA obtained from Huh7 human hepatocarcinoma cells. The forward and reverse primers used were CGTACGAATTCATGAAAGCTGCGGTGCTGACCT and GCTACGCGGCCGCCTGGGTGTTGAGCTTCTTAGTGTACTC, respectively. The PCR products were gel-purified, subjected to restriction digestion with EcoRI and NotI, and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3 upstream of three copies of the FLAG epitope tag. The resulting expression plasmids are denoted as pcDNA-human progranulin-3×FLAG and pcDNA-human apoA-I-3×FLAG. pcDNA-mouse progranulin-Myc/His encodes mouse progranulin with Myc and His epitope tags at the C terminus. The mouse progranulin cDNA was amplified from an IMAGE clone and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA4 upstream of the Myc and His epitope tags. Plasmids encoding deletion mutants of mouse progranulin were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Lightning kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA-mouse progranulin as the template. The forward and reverse primers used for these reactions were: GCTGGTAGCCGGAGATGGCTCCTGC and GCAGGAGCCATCTCCGGCTACCAGC for Δ31–70; ACGAGCCATCATCTAGTTTCACCCACGGGC and GCCCGTGGGTGAAACTAGATGATGGCTCGT for Δ71–190; TTCTGTCGTGTGCCCTGAAATGGGTATCCTCC and GGAGGATACCCATTTCAGGGCACACGACAGAA for Δ222–346; GAGTGATACACCTTGTGCTCGAGGTCACCC and GGGTGACCTCGAGCACAAGGTGTATCACTC for Δ377–602. The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Recombinant FLAG-tagged human progranulin was purified from conditioned media of transfected HEK293T cells by using anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-human progranulin-3×FLAG. After 3 days, conditioned medium was collected, cleared at 1500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, concentrated using Amicon Ultra columns (10-kDa cutoff size), and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotator for 4–6 h. The magnetic beads were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min. The bound material was eluted from the magnetic beads by competition with 500 ng/μl of FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluate was applied to an Amicon Ultra column (10-kDa cutoff) to remove the FLAG peptide (Sigma). The purity of the recombinant progranulin was >95%, as determined by Coomassie staining using the SimplyBlue kit (Invitrogen). Aliquots were stored at −20 °C. For Western blot analysis, 5× sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, 12.5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each sample. After boiling, equivalent volumes of samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For dot blot analysis, equivalent volumes of gel-filtration fractions were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a dot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) in a buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 1.3 mm SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000, Sigma), monoclonal anti-Myc (9B11 clone) (1:500, Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-mouse progranulin (1:500, R&D Systems), polyclonal anti-mouse apoA-I 2The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinDMPC1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine.

After incubations with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as indicated in the figure legends, bound antibodies were visualized with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) or SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) using a Li-Cor ODYSSEY imager or x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., X-Omat). apolipoprotein 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Polyclonal anti-human progranulin antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptides IVAGLEKMPARRGSLSHPR (amino acids 422–440, linker 4 region) and KEVVSAQPATFLARSPHVG (amino acids 497–515, linker 5 region) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The resulting sera were affinity-purified and referred to as anti-human progranulin linker 4 and anti-human progranulin linker 5, respectively. The conditioned medium of transfected HEK293T cells was collected and cleared at 1500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. After adding a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), the cleared conditioned medium was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The bound material was washed 3 times with cold PBS and then eluted in 2× sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min. Aliquots of the pellet or supernatant fractions of the immunoprecipitations were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described above. Cross-linking was carried out with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce), which was resuspended in DMSO at 100 mm. Disuccinimidyl suberate (or the DMSO control) was added to 2.5 μg of recombinant progranulin in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Aliquots of the reaction were subjected SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Interactions of purified proteins with DMPC was monitored as described with minor modifications (30Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Kinetics of lipid-protein interactions. Interaction of apolipoprotein A-I from human plasma high density lipoproteins with phosphatidylcholines.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Dry DMPC was dispersed in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% EDTA, 8.5% KBr, 0.01% NaN3) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and vortexed to form multilamellar liposomes. Purified proteins were added to the DMPC liposomes with a mass ratio of 1:5 (w/w) in triplicate 96-μl reactions in a 96-well plate. The samples were maintained at 24.5 °C in a spectrophotometer, and the absorbance at 325 nm was measured at 2–5-min intervals for 1 h. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. To determine the biochemical characteristics of secreted progranulin, we purified recombinant human progranulin, containing a 3×FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus from the culture supernatant of transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A). Coomassie staining showed that the recombinant protein was >95% pure and migrated at ∼90 kDa by SDS-PAGE. When subjected to gel-filtration by size-exclusion chromatography, recombinant progranulin eluted from the column in fractions 33 and 34, corresponding to ∼170–180 kDa (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that secreted human progranulin is a dimer. We next performed in vitro cross-linking studies using disuccinimidyl suberate, a cross-linker that reacts with primary amines. Cross-linking recombinant progranulin resulted in a portion of progranulin shifting in size, from ∼85 to ∼180 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C), also consistent with secreted recombinant progranulin existing as a homodimer. To further test this model, we carried out immunoprecipitation assays using the conditioned media of HEK293T cells co-transfected with human and murine progranulin, tagged at the C termini with FLAG and Myc epitopes, respectively (Fig. 1D). Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads pulled down nearly all of the progranulin-FLAG (pellets) and a large proportion of progranulin-Myc. Although this assay does not exclude the possibility of indirect interactions, this result demonstrates that progranulin interacts intermolecularly in the conditioned media of cultured cells. Taken together, the results of Fig. 1 indicate that recombinant progranulin exists as a homodimer. To identify the region(s) in progranulin that is required for dimerization, we generated a series of deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). We co-transfected FLAG-tagged full-length progranulin and Myc-tagged versions of these deletion mutants into HEK293T cells and performed immunoprecipitation assays. Immunoprecipitation of the full-length progranulin-FLAG pulled down full-length progranulin-Myc, Δ31–70 progranulin-Myc, Δ71–190 progranulin-Myc, Δ222–346 progranulin-Myc, or Δ377–602 progranulin-Myc (Fig. 2B). Thus, despite testing deletion mutants, which span ∼90% of the mature protein, we were unable to identify any regions required for the progranulin-progranulin interaction. Although it is possible that the region(s) required for dimerization was not covered by the deletion mutants tested, these results suggest multiple regions are sufficient for mediating the interaction. To determine whether progranulin exists as a dimer in vivo, we analyzed plasma from wild-type and progranulin-deficient (Grn−/−) mice by size-exclusion chromatography. As revealed in the dot blots of Fig. 3A, top panel, and the western blots of Fig. 3B, top panel, almost all of the progranulin immunoreactivity was found in fractions 32 and 33, which corresponds to ∼180–190 kDa and is consistent with the molecular mass of a dimer. Progranulin was not detected in plasma from Grn−/− mice. In human plasma, progranulin was similarly found in fractions 31–33 (Fig. 3A, top panel). We did not detect progranulin immunoreactivity in fractions 39–40, where progranulin monomers would be expected to elute. Progranulin was previously reported to be part of human HDL, as determined by Western blot analysis of HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation (17Okura H. Yamashita S. Ohama T. Saga A. Yamamoto-Kakuta A. Hamada Y. Sougawa N. Ohyama R. Sawa Y. Matsuyama A. HDL/apolipoprotein A-I binds to macrophage-derived progranulin and suppresses its conversion into proinflammatory granulins.J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2010; 17: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test this, we probed the dot blot and Western blot membranes with anti-apolipoprotein (apo) A-I antibodies, which detect the major HDL protein. The immunoblots in Fig. 3, A and B, revealed that the progranulin-containing fractions partially overlapped with the apoA-I-containing fractions of mouse and human plasma. We also measured the cholesterol content of the gel-filtration fractions to identify the lipoprotein-containing fractions. Indeed, progranulin partially co-eluted with both mouse HDL-cholesterol (fractions 28–33) (Fig. 3C) and human HDL-cholesterol (fractions 30–34) (data not shown). Of note, the plasma cholesterol profile of Grn−/− mice was not different than that of wild-type mice, indicating that progranulin deficiency does not appreciably affect plasma lipoprotein levels. Our results indicate that circulating progranulin elutes in the observed fractions because it exists as a dimer, but whether a portion of progranulin physically associates with HDL is unclear. Therefore, we performed experiments to determine whether circulating progranulin in the HDL-containing fractions is lipid-associated. We delipidated mouse and human plasma with a mixture of butanol and diisopropyl ether (28Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. A solvent system for delipidation of plasma or serum without protein precipitation.J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure removes lipids but does not denature proteins, and was previously used as one criterion to determine if candidate proteins are bona fide HDL proteins (31Gordon S.M. Deng J. Lu L.J. Davidson W.S. Proteomic characterization of human plasma high density lipoprotein fractionated by gel filtration chromatography.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 5239-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For lipid-free proteins, the gel-filtration elution profile is not affected by delipidation. On the other hand, the delipidation procedure causes a shift in the elution profiles of lipid-associated proteins. Delip"

In this study, we demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells such as C3H10T1/2 and human bone marrow cells can be committed to the osteogenic lineage by DPP. Treatment with DPP can stimulate the release of intracellular Ca(2+). This calcium flux triggered the activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Activated CaMKII induced the phosphorylation of Smad1 and promoted nuclear translocation of p-Smad1. Inhibition of store Ca(2+) depletion by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) or down-regulation of CaMKII by KN-62, a selective cell-permeable pharmacological inhibitor or a dominant negative plasmid of CaMKII, blocked DPP-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation. Activation of Smad1 resulted in the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2, Osterix, DMP1, Bone sialoprotein, Osteocalcin, NFATc1, and Schnurri-2, which have been implicated in osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that DPP is capable of triggering commitment of pluripotent stem cells to the osteogenic lineage."

NBCe1-A transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) is involved in forming part of the ion permeation pathway, and a missense mutation S427L in TM1 impairs ion transport, causing proximal renal tubular acidosis. In the present study, we examined the topology of NBCe1-A-TM1 in detail and its structural perturbation induced by S427L. We analyzed the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (Cys-389–Gln-424) of NBCe1-A-TM1 using the substituted cysteine scanning accessibility method combined with extensive chemical stripping, in situ chemical probing, and functional transport assays. NBCe1-A-TM1 was previously modeled on the anion exchanger 1 TM1 (AE1-TM1); however, our data demonstrated that the topology of AE1-TM1 differs significantly from NBCe1-A-TM1. Our findings revealed that NBCe1-A-TM1 is unusually long, consisting of 31 membrane-embedded amino acids (Phe-412 to Thr-442). The linker region (Arg-394–Pro-411) between the N terminus of TM1 and the cytoplasmic domain is minimally exposed to aqueous and is potentially folded in a helical structure that intimately interacts with the NBCe1-A cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, AE1-TM1 contains 25 amino acids connected to an aqueous-exposed cytoplasmic region. Based on our new NBCe1-A-TM1 model, Ser-427 resides in the middle of TM1. Leucine substitution at Ser-427 blocks the normal aqueous access to Thr-442, Ala-435, and Lys-404, implying a significant alteration of NBCe1-TM1 orientation.

https://openalex.org/W2021797537,"PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC), a growth-regulated member of the PGC-1 coactivator family, contributes to the expression of the mitochondrial respiratory apparatus. PRC also orchestrates a robust response to metabolic stress by promoting the expression of multiple genes specifying inflammation, proliferation, and metabolic reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that this PRC-dependent stress program is activated during apoptosis and senescence, two major protective mechanisms against cellular dysfunction. Both PRC and its targets (IL1α, SPRR2D, and SPRR2F) were rapidly induced by menadione, an agent that promotes apoptosis through the generation of intracellular oxidants. Menadione-induced apoptosis and the PRC stress program were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. The PRC stress response was also activated by the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), an inducer of premature senescence in tumor cells. Cells treated with SN-38 displayed morphological characteristics of senescence and express senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. In contrast to menadione, the SN-38 induction of the PRC program occurred over an extended time course and was antioxidant-insensitive. The potential adaptive function of the PRC stress response was investigated by treating cells with meclizine, a drug that promotes glycolytic energy metabolism and has been linked to cardio- and neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Meclizine increased lactate production and was a potent inducer of the PRC stress program, suggesting that PRC may contribute to the protective effects of meclizine. Finally, c-MYC and PRC were coordinately induced under all conditions tested, implicating c-MYC in the biological response to metabolic stress. The results suggest a general role for PRC in the adaptive response to cellular dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W1989554592,"NrdH-redoxins are small reductases with a high amino acid sequence similarity with glutaredoxins and mycoredoxins but with a thioredoxin-like activity. They function as the electron donor for class Ib ribonucleotide reductases, which convert ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides. We solved the x-ray structure of oxidized NrdH-redoxin from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cg) at 1.5 Å resolution. Based on this monomeric structure, we built a homology model of NrdH-redoxin from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt). Both NrdH-redoxins have a typical thioredoxin fold with the active site CXXC motif located at the N terminus of the first α-helix. With size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering, we show that Mt_NrdH-redoxin is a monomer in solution that has the tendency to form a non-swapped dimer at high protein concentration. Further, Cg_NrdH-redoxin and Mt_NrdH-redoxin catalytically reduce a disulfide with a specificity constant 1.9 × 10(6) and 5.6 × 10(6) M(-1) min(-1), respectively. They use a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism with an N-terminal cysteine pKa lower than 6.5 for nucleophilic attack, whereas the pKa of the C-terminal cysteine is ~10. They exclusively receive electrons from thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and not from mycothiol, the low molecular weight thiol of actinomycetes. This specificity is shown in the structural model of the complex between NrdH-redoxin and TrxR, where the two surface-exposed phenylalanines of TrxR perfectly fit into the conserved hydrophobic pocket of the NrdH-redoxin. Moreover, nrdh gene deletion and disruption experiments seem to indicate that NrdH-redoxin is essential in C. glutamicum."
https://openalex.org/W2007072161,"Previous studies have shown that the innate immune stimulant LPS augments mechanical ventilation-induced pulmonary coagulation and inflammation. Whether these effects are mediated by alveolar epithelial cells is unclear. The alveolar epithelium is a key regulator of the innate immune reaction to pathogens and can modulate both intra-alveolar inflammation and coagulation through up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and tissue factor (TF), the principal initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. We hypothesized that cyclic mechanical stretch (MS) potentiates LPS-mediated alveolar epithelial cell (MLE-12) expression of the chemokine keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) and TF. Contrary to our hypothesis, MS significantly decreased LPS-induced KC and TF mRNA and protein expression. Investigation into potential mechanisms showed that stretch significantly reduced LPS-induced surface expression of TLR4 that was not a result of increased degradation. Decreased cell surface TLR4 expression was concomitant with reduced LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. Immunofluorescence staining showed that cyclic MS markedly altered LPS-induced organization of actin filaments. In contrast to expression, MS significantly increased LPS-induced cell surface TF activity independent of calcium signaling. These findings suggest that cyclic MS of lung epithelial cells down-regulates LPS-mediated inflammatory and procoagulant expression by modulating actin organization and reducing cell surface TLR4 expression and signaling. However, because LPS-induced surface TF activity was enhanced by stretch, these data demonstrate differential pathways regulating TF expression and activity. Ultimately, loss of LPS responsiveness in the epithelium induced by MS could result in increased susceptibility of the lung to bacterial infections in the setting of mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2008000301,"Measles virus (MV), an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, enters the cell through membrane fusion mediated by two viral envelope proteins, an attachment protein hemagglutinin (H) and a fusion (F) protein. The crystal structure of the receptor-binding head domain of MV-H bound to its cellular receptor revealed that the MV-H head domain forms a tetrameric assembly (dimer of dimers), which occurs in two forms (forms I and II). In this study, we show that mutations in the putative dimer-dimer interface of the head domain in either form inhibit the ability of MV-H to support membrane fusion, without greatly affecting its cell surface expression, receptor binding, and interaction with the F protein. Notably, some anti-MV-H neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are directed to the region around the dimer-dimer interface in form I rather than receptor-binding sites. These observations suggest that the dimer-dimer interactions of the MV-H head domain, especially that in form I, contribute to triggering membrane fusion, and that conformational shift of head domain tetramers plays a role in the process. Furthermore, our results indicate that although the stalk and transmembrane regions may be mainly responsible for the tetramer formation of MV-H, the head domain alone can form tetramers, albeit at a low efficiency."
