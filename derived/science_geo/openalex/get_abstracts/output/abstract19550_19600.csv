https://openalex.org/W2163498423,"Specific side-by-side interactions between transmembrane alpha-helices may be important in the assembly and function of integral membrane proteins. We describe a system for the genetic and biophysical analysis of these interactions. The transmembrane alpha-helical domain of interest is fused to the C-terminus of staphylococcal nuclease. The resulting chimera can be expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and is readily purified. In our initial application we study the single transmembrane alpha-helix of human glycophorin A (GpA), thought to mediate the SDS-stable dimerization of this protein. The resulting chimera forms a dimer in SDS, which is disrupted upon addition of a peptide corresponding to the transmembrane domain of GpA. Deletion mutagenesis has been used to delineate the minimum transmembrane domain sufficient for this behavior. Site-specific mutagenesis shows that a methionine residue, previously implicated as a potential interfacial residue, can be replaced with other hydrophobic residues without disrupting dimerization. By contrast, rather conservative substitutions at a valine on a different face of the alpha-helix disrupt dimerization, suggesting a high degree of specificity in the helix-helix interactions. This approach allows the interface between interacting helices to be defined."

https://openalex.org/W1549352256,"The complete sequence of the gene encoding the major cysteine protease from Trypanosoma cruzi is reported. The amino acid sequence predicted from the gene sequence aligns well with members of the papain family of cysteine proteases, suggesting the name cruzain. The sequence is most closely related to the cysteine protease of Trypanosoma brucei (59.3%) and the murine cathepsin L (42.2%). At least six copies of the gene are present in the genome and are organized in a tandem array of copies which are identical in all restriction endonuclease sites tested. The gene appears to be expressed in all developmental stages of T. cruzi with mRNA levels approximately 2-fold higher in the intracellular amastigote form. A copy of the T. cruzi gene was expressed in bacteria as an inactive, insoluble fusion polypeptide to approximately 5% of the total cell protein. The fusion protein was readily purified, solubilized in urea, and successfully refolded to produce a polyprotein which processed autocatalytically to yield approximately 1 mg of active protease per 3 g of wet cell paste. The processed form of the recombinant protease has an NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of the mature form of the protease purified from T. cruzi (Murta, A. C. M., Persechini, P. M., Souto-Padron, T., de Souza, W., Guimaraes, J. A., and Scharfstein, J. (1990) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 43, 27-38; Cazzulo, J. J., Couso, R., Raimondi, A., Wernstedt, C., and Hellman, U. (1989) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 33, 33-42). This suggests that the recombinant protease possesses the requisite specificity and activity to correctly process the proform of the protease in vitro. Kinetic assays with peptide substrates demonstrate that the substrate specificity and kinetic parameters for the recombinant protease are consistent with those of the endogenous protease. The proteolytic activity of the recombinant protease is enhanced by dithiothreitol, inhibited by leupeptin, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) but is unaffected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. More specifically, the recombinant enzyme was inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-fluoromethyl ketone, which inhibits replication and differentiation of T. cruzi within mammalian cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1569291911,"The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLD) was investigated. In membranes from Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts that had been incubated with [14C]choline to label endogenous phosphatidylcholine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) failed to stimulate production of [14C]choline. However, stimulation was observed if fibroblast cytosolic fraction or PKC partially purified from this fraction was added. When incubated with membranes in the presence of PMA, pure PKC from rat brain stimulated [14C]choline production in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal 2-3-fold effect. PMA similarly stimulated [14C]phosphatidylpropanol formation from propanol using membranes from [14C]myristic acid-prelabeled cells, confirming the activation of PLD. None of the effects described required exogenous ATP. To probe the role of phosphorylation in the PKC effect, we included high concentrations of apyrase in the assay. This ATPase had no effect on the ability of PKC to activate PLD, but under exactly the same conditions, it eliminated autophosphorylation of PKC. The results provide conclusive evidence for the involvement of PKC in the activation of PLD and suggest that ATP-dependent phosphorylation is not required."

https://openalex.org/W1563588257,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide, being identical to the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, a cellular thyroid hormone binding protein and a component of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein complex, and highly similar to a polypeptide acting in vitro as a glycosylation site binding protein. It has two -Cys-Gly-His-Cys- sequences which, it has been proposed, act as catalytic sites for the isomerase activity, but few data have been available to indicate whether one or both of them do indeed act as catalytic sites and whether the two presumed catalytic sites act independently or cooperatively. We report here on the expression of human PDI in Escherichia coli with three different signal sequences. All three polypeptide variants were secreted into the periplasmic space as fully active enzymes. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to convert either one or both of the -Cys-Gly-His-Cys- sequences to -Ser-Gly-His-Cys-. The PDI activity of both polypeptides containing a single modified sequence was about 50% of that of the wild-type polypeptide, whereas the polypeptide with two modified sequences had no isomerase activity. It is thus concluded that both -Cys-Gly-His-Cys- sequences act as catalytic sites for the isomerase activity, and the two catalytic sites appear to operate independently of one another."
https://openalex.org/W1502844891,"Syndecan is an integral membrane proteoglycan that putatively binds extracellular matrix molecules and growth factors at the surfaces of several cell types. Syndecan is also transiently expressed in several condensing mesenchymes after epithelial induction. In order to understand the mechanism(s) that regulate(s) syndecan expression in early mesenchymal cells, we have studied the effects of growth factors on the expression of syndecan in 3T3 fibroblasts and compared these results to NMuMG epithelial cells. Our studies indicate that (i) two developmentally important growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), especially when administrated at the same time, increase syndecan expression in 3T3 cells both at the mRNA and protein level. (ii) Furthermore, the same growth factors also increase syndecan shedding into the culture medium of 3T3 cells. No such stimulation of syndecan synthesis or shedding was observed with NMuMG cells. (iii) Syndecan isolated from the cell surface of bFGF+TGF-beta-treated 3T3 cells binds bFGF. (iv) Induced expression of syndecan correlates with enhanced binding of bFGF to the cell surface of 3T3 cells, and (v) this interaction can be inhibited by exogenous ectodomain of syndecan. These results suggest a key role for growth factors in the regulation of syndecan expression during organogenesis and, moreover, an involvement of syndecan in the regulation of growth factor action."

https://openalex.org/W1513409211,"We have shown that the 32P-phosphorylation of the nuclear estrogen receptor from human MCF-7 cells or the calf uterus is estrogen-dependent. Within 2 min of estradiol treatment the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor from MCF-7 cells doubled, and increased 4-fold within 20-40 min of estradiol treatment. Progesterone was ineffective in stimulating the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the estrogen-stimulated phosphorylation of the human or calf estrogen receptor occurred only on serine residue(s). Phosphotryptic peptide analysis of the human estrogen receptor by two-dimensional peptide mapping or reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed that only a single tryptic peptide (site) was phosphorylated. Treatment of the estrogen receptor with potato acid phosphatase resulted in the dephosphorylation of the 32P-labeled estrogen receptor and a decrease of the receptor's affinity for specific DNA sequences. These data suggest that transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor involves an estrogen-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor resulting in its increased affinity for specific DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1537812986,"The p-menthane monoterpenes of the Mentha species are biosynthesized from geranyl pyrophosphate via the monocyclic olefin 4S-limonene. A monoterpene cyclase was isolated from both Mentha x piperita (peppermint) and Mentha spicata (spearmint) that catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to 4S-limonene. This enzyme, 4S-limonene synthase, was purified to apparent homogeneity by dye ligand, anion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Since the monoterpenes of Mentha are synthesized and secreted in modified epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, an extract of isolated glandular trichome cells was used as the source of this enzyme. A combination of gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that purified 4S-limonene synthase had a native molecular weight of 56,000 and was monomeric. The principal product of the enzyme was enantiomerically pure (-)-4S-limonene, and a catalytic constant of 0.3/s was determined. The basic properties of 4S-limonene synthase from both M. x piperita and M. spicata are identical and, in general, are similar to those of other monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene cyclases isolated from microorganisms and higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1581151107,"Abstract The single coding exons of the cloned genes encoding two human arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NAT1 and NAT2) were amplified by expression-cassette polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the tac promoter-based phagemid vector pKEN2 for production of the recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli strain XA90. Induction of cultures grown from selected bacterial transformants resulted in the production of substantial quantities of soluble recombinant human NAT1 and NAT2 with identical electrophoretic, immunologic and catalytic properties to those expressed in mammalian cell culture or in human liver. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of recombinant human NAT2 was then employed to determine the relative importance of 3 highly conserved cysteine residues in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism. Substitution of cysteine with glycine at position 68 of the 290 amino acid protein molecule (Cys68----Gly) resulted in the production of normal quantities of immunoreactive NAT2 which was completely devoid of enzyme activity, suggesting that the sulfhydryl group of Cys68 is directly involved in the transfer of acetate from the essential cofactor CoASAc to acceptor amine substrates. On the other hand, the mutations producing Cys44----Gly and Cys223----Gly led to the production of enzymatically active NAT2 proteins with markedly reduced in vitro stability, suggesting that substitution of either of these amino acids may cause alterations in the tertiary structure of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2157271860,"In delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, cytokine-mediated cell migration leads to localized accumulation of neutrophils and mononuclear cells over 4-48 h. In contrast to transient (2-6 h) responses elicited by other chemotactic factors, earlier studies indicated that a chemotactic activity previously described in our laboratory elicited skin test responses over 24 h, identical to those induced by injection of antigen into a sensitized test subject. We have isolated this factor, a 10.3-kDa chemotactic protein designated CP-10, from supernatants of activated murine spleen cells. Purification to homogeneity was achieved using affinity chromatography on iminodiacetic acid-immobilized copper and cation-exchange, mixed mode (cation exchange/metal affinity), reversed-phase, and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. CP-10 had maximal chemotactic activity for neutrophils at 10(-13) M. The 76-amino acid sequence, obtained by automated N-terminal microsequence analysis of native CP-10, and fragments derived from trypsin digestion and cyanogen bromide cleavage indicated no sequence identity with any known cytokine or chemotactic factor but revealed up to 55% sequence homology with S100, Ca2(+)-binding proteins. CP-10 appears to be the first protein of this family with a well defined function affecting cell migration, and its biological potency suggests an important role for this cytokine in cellular immune reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1535247289,"Human phagocyte cytochrome b is the terminal component of the microbicidal superoxide generating system. Although the primary structure of this protein has been determined, little is known about the placement of the heme prosthetic groups in this heterodimeric integral membrane protein. Analysis of the cytochrome using lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 0 degree C followed by tetramethylbenzidine heme staining demonstrated the presence of heme in both the 91- and 22-kDa subunits identified by Western blot analysis using peptide specific antisera. Exposure of cytochrome b (purified or in isolated neutrophil plasma membranes) to Staphylococcal protease V8 or trypsin did not affect absorbance spectra. However, such treatment resulted in degradation of both subunits to smaller fragments, including characteristic immunoreactive 20-kDa fragments of both the large and small subunits of the cytochrome that retained one or both of the hemes. The spectral stability to proteolysis and size of the proteolytic heme-containing fragments generated explains previous reports which suggested that the heme resided in the small subunit. Our current results indicate that human neutrophil cytochrome b is a bi-heme or possibly tri-heme molecule with at least one heme residing in the large subunit and one shared between both subunits and that the heme-containing regions of the cytochrome probably lie within the membrane lipid bilayer. Such a multi-heme structure would be consistent with an electron transfer function for this cytochrome by providing an efficient mechanism for transferring electrons across the plasma membrane to the extracellular surface where oxygen could be reduced to create superoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1584151070,"The complete open reading frame of subunit 2 of the NADH dehydrogenase in Oenothera mitochondria is split into five exons. The first two and the last three exons are encoded in distant genomic locations and are transcribed separately. Three tRNA genes coding for tRNA(Cys), tRNA(Asn), and tRNA(Tyr) are located upstream of the terminal three exons c, d, and e. The genomic distance, the interspersed tRNA genes, and the group II intron sequences flanking the two separated exons suggest trans-splicing to be required to connect exons b and c. Maturation of the mRNA includes RNA editing at 36 sites in the open reading frame. Three RNA editing events are observed in the split group II intron sequences. Two of these events allow after editing additional base pairings in the secondary structure, one in the stem of domain I, the other in the putative trans-pairing region of domain IV. These RNA editings may thus be involved in the trans-splicing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1515220193,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a specific inhibitor of the serine proteases tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). To systematically investigate the roles of the reactive center P1 and P1' residues in PAI-1 function, saturation mutagenesis was utilized to construct a library of PAI-1 variants. Examination of 177 unique recombinant proteins indicated that a basic residue was required at P1 for significant inhibitory activity toward uPA, whereas all substitutions except proline were tolerated at P1'. P1Lys variants exhibited lower inhibition rate constants and greater sensitivity to P1' substitutions than P1Arg variants. Alterations at either P1 or P1' generally had a larger effect on the inhibition of tPA. A number of variants that were relatively specific for either uPA or tPA were identified. P1Lys-P1'Ala reacted 40-fold more rapidly with uPA than tPA, whereas P1Lys-P1'Trp showed a 6.5-fold preference for tPA. P1-P1' variants containing additional mutations near the reactive center demonstrated only minor changes in activity, suggesting that specific amino acids in this region do not contribute significantly to PAI-1 function. These findings have important implications for the role of reactive center residues in determining serine protease inhibitor (serpin) function and target specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1576611598,"We have cloned and characterized 5'-flanking sequences of the DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) gene. DNA MeTase gene transcription is initiated at a few discrete sites: 343 and 90 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site as determined by RNase protection and primer extension assays. The promoter sequences that regulate expression of DNA MeTase, as defined by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, reside between position -171 and the transcription start site. The promoter of DNA MeTase does not contain TATAA or CAAT boxes and is unusual because it does not contain the CG-rich elements characteristic of TATAA-less housekeeping genes. The 5'-flanking region of DNA MeTase contains AP-1, AP-2 and glucocorticoid response elements, suggesting possible regulation by cellular signal transduction pathways. The base composition of the DNA MeTase promoter is markedly different from that of other housekeeping genes. Whereas most housekeeping genes are characterized by CG-rich areas in their 5'-flanking regions, the TG dinucleotide is over-represented in DNA MeTase 5'-flanking sequences, including a perfect tandem repeat of T/G between positions -685 and -650. DNA methylation patterns play an important role in the developmental regulation of gene expression in vertebrates. DNA MeTase activity is probably regulated to maintain this pattern of methylation. We suggest that the DNA MeTase promoter represents a new class of housekeeping gene promoters that was designed to ensure high fidelity regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1590958356,"We determined four nucleotide sequences of the hominoid immunoglobulin alpha (C alpha) genes (chimpanzee C alpha 2, gorilla C alpha 2, and gibbon C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 genes), which made possible the examination of gene conversions in all hominoid C alpha genes. The following three methods were used to detect gene conversions: 1) phenetic tree construction; 2) detection of a DNA segment with extremely low variability between duplicated C alpha genes; and 3) a site by site search of shared nucleotide changes between duplicated C alpha genes. Results obtained from method 1 indicated a concerted evolution of the duplicated C alpha genes in the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and gibbon lineages, while results obtained from method 2 suggested gene conversions in the human, gorilla, and gibbon C alpha genes. With method 3 we identified clusters of shared nucleotide changes between duplicated C alpha genes in human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and gibbon lineages, and in their hypothetical ancestors. In the present study converted regions were identified over the entire C alpha gene region excluding a few sites in the coding region which have escaped from gene conversion. This indicates that gene conversion is a general phenomenon in evolution, that can be clearly observed in non-functional regions."
https://openalex.org/W1569171381,"Abstract Little is known about the degradation of the most abundant protein in nature, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBP carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.39), probably reflecting the fact that no stress situation has been identified capable of causing extensive RuBP carboxylase degradation without causing the death of the plant. We have subjected plants of Lemna minor L. to a variety of stress situations, nutritive deficiencies in particular, and have found a single condition--sulfur starvation--that caused almost complete degradation of RuBP carboxylase without causing plant death. Moreover, the enzyme was preferentially degraded under these conditions. However, when the plants were deprived of calcium, no RuBP carboxylase degradation was observed. Instead, the enzyme was oxidized and polymerized into high molecular mass aggregates. On the other hand, RuBP carboxylase shows an extreme stability when Lemna is deprived of some macronutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium) probably reflecting that this plant had to evolve in a way to cope with frequent shortages of such elements. The implications of these data for the role of RuBP carboxylase as a leaf storage protein are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1570041773,"Covalent attachment of myristic acid (C14:0) to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a variety of eukaryotic cellular and viral proteins can have a profound influence on their biological properties. The enzyme that catalyzes this modification, myristoyl-CoA-protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), has been identified as a potential target for antiviral and antifungal therapy. Its reaction mechanism is ordered Bi Bi with myristoyl-CoA binding occurring before binding of peptide and CoA release preceding release of myristoylpeptide. Perturbations in the binding of its acyl-CoA substrate would therefore be expected to have an important influence on catalysis. We have synthesized 56 analogs of myristic acid (C14:0) to further characterize the acyl-CoA binding site of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMT. The activity of fatty acid analogs was assessed using a coupled in vitro assay system that employed the reportedly nonspecific Pseudomonas acyl-CoA synthetase, purified S. cerevisiae NMT, and octapeptide substrates derived from residues 2-9 of the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the Pr55gag polyprotein precursor of human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV-I). Analysis of ketocarbonyl-, ester-, and amide-containing myristic acid analogs (the latter in two isomeric arrangements, the acylamino acid (-CO-NH-) and the amide (-NH-CO)) indicated that the enzyme's binding site is able to accommodate a dipolar protrusion from C4 through C13. This includes the region of the acyl chain occurring near C5-C6 (numbered from carboxyl) that appears to be bound in a bent conformation of 140-150 degrees. The activities of NMT's acyl-CoA substrates decrease with increasing polarity. This relationship was particularly apparent from an analysis of a series of analogs in which the hydrocarbon chain was terminated by (i) an azido group or (ii) one of three nitrogen heterocycles (imidazole, triazole, and tetrazole) alkylated at either nitrogen or carbon. This inverse relationship between polarity and activity was confirmed after comparison of the activities of the closely related ester- or amide-containing tetradecanoyl-CoA derivatives. Members from all of the analog series were surveyed to determine whether they could inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV-I), a retrovirus that depends upon N-myristoylation of its Pr55gag for propagation. 12-Azidododecanoic acid was the most active analog tested, producing a 60-90% inhibition of viral production in both acutely and chronically infected T-lymphocyte cell lines at a concentration of 10-50 microM without associated cellular toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1575871478,"We report the molecular cloning of a fragment of human genomic DNA called S12, containing an open reading frame of 1170 nucleotides, which encodes a receptor for serotonin of 390 amino acids. The receptor function of the S12 protein was demonstrated by functional expression in mouse LS12 cells obtained by stable transfection of Ltk- cells, and LM5S12 cells, derived from LM5 cells (Ltk- cells previously transfected with the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor). Adenylyl cyclase studies showed that the S12 receptor is able to mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in response to serotonin in both types of cells. As studied in LM5S12 cells, the S12 receptor did not promote Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores, nor did it significantly modulate the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by stimulation of the phospholipase C stimulating M5 acetylcholine receptor. The pharmacologic profile of S12 as seen in adenylyl cyclase assays is as follows: (EC50 in nM): serotonin, full agonist (37 nM), 5-carboxamidotryptamine, full agonist (10 nM), sumatriptan, full agonist (50 nM), metergoline, partial agonist (10 nM), methysergide, partial agonist (40 nM), yohimbine, partial agonist (150 nM), metitepin, antagonist (KB = 0.7 to 1.2 nM). We propose that the human S12 serotonin receptor is a receptor of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1628449182,"Giardia lamblia is believed to be the earliest branching derivative from the eucaryotic lineage. Genomic and cDNA clones encoding the giardia NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase have been isolated and characterized. Southern hydridization using genomic DNA indicates that the gene encoding this activity is unique and single copy. Primer extension, S1 nuclease protection, and genomic and cDNA sequence analysis demonstrate that gene transcripts are initiated within a conserved AT-rich sequence element immediately preceding the ATG translation initiation codon and the short 5' untranslated region is not extended by transsplicing. The open reading frame is 1350 nucleotides in length and encodes a protein of 449 amino acids. The reading frame is not interrupted by introns and the primary transcript is probably not subjected to RNA editing. In the strictly anaerobic metabolism of giardia, NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase activity participates along with alanine aminotransferase, in the cyclic dissipation of reducing equivalents (NADPH) through the conversion of pyruvate to alanine. The deduced amino acid sequence of the giardia protein exhibits substantial homology to numerous fungal and eubacterial NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases. Comparisons of alignment gap positions and amino acid identities indicate that the giardia sequence is at least as similar or more similar to the eubacterial sequence than it is to the fungal sequence. This supports the hypothesis that giardia diverged very early from the eucaryotic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1548111272,"The prolactin (PRL) receptor, a lactogen- and primate somatogen-binding protein, is a member of an expanding superfamily (cytokine/growth hormone (GH)/PRL) of single membrane-spanning receptors. Two features commonly shared among this group of proteins are the presence of two pairs of cysteines, generally found in the N-terminal region of the extracellular domain, and a WSxWS (WS) motif, frequently located proximal to the transmembrane domain. We have recently shown the 4 cysteines to be critical to the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the PRL-receptor. In the present study, we prepared a set of eight chimeric rat PRL/human GH receptors and several alanine mutants, to assess the importance of the Cys-rich domain (residues 12-68) in confering specificity to PRL binding. The role of the WS motif in high affinity binding was also investigated. Binding of 125I-labeled ovine PRL or human GH to membrane preparations from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the mutant receptors have defined a region within the first disulfide loop (residues Arg13, Asp16, Glu18) and the set of lactogen-specific sequences between the two pairs of cysteines as key determinants of PRL-binding specificity, which converge to form a patch on a two-dimensional model of the PRL receptor. We also demonstrate that, although PRL- and GH-specific determinants overlap in certain areas, they are not identical. Finally, substitution of the WS motif with alanine residues precludes high affinity binding to ovine PRL and human GH and suggests that this structural element may provide a target site for the interaction of an accessory protein necessary for the formation of a high-affinity receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1554571764,"Two mechanisms of initiation of protein synthesis are known. The 5' cap-dependent model requires the activity of cap-binding eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF)1-4E and -4F, inducing unwinding of mRNA secondary structures. The internal initiation model is 5' cap-independent and requires a ribosomal entry site formed by higher order structures of the mRNA. It has been proposed that this mechanism does not need eIF-4E and eIF-4F. We prepared bicistronic transcripts on which both mechanisms of initiation occur, allowing the determination of the initiation factor dependence of these two mechanisms simultaneously. The unwinding factors eIF-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F were found to be necessary for 5' cap-dependent initiation as well as for internal initiation. Surprisingly, efficient translation of both cistrons on the bicistronic mRNA required eIF-4E. A model is presented in which assembly of eIF-4E into a functional eIF-4F complex is a prerequisite for both types of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1593547522,"Abstract The effects of fructose on the intracellular ionic changes evoked by anoxia were studied in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes maintained in agarose gel threads and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB). Cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) was measured with aequorin, intracellular sodium (Na+i) with sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, intracellular pH (pHi) with 2'-7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) by the increase in NADH absorbance during lactate oxidation to pyruvate, and viability by trypan blue exclusion. ATP, Pi, phosphomonoesters, and the cell phosphorylation potential assessed by the reciprocal of the Pi/ATP ratio were measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy in real time. Intracellular free Mg2+ (Mg2+i) was calculated from the chemical shift of beta-ATP relative to alpha-ATP in the NMR spectra. Anoxia was induced by perfusing the cells with KHB saturated with 95% N2, 5% CO2. When the perfusate contained 5 mM glucose as substrate, anoxia caused a fall in ATP, a rise in Pi, and in the Pi/ATP ratio, a biphasic increase in Ca2+i that reached 1.45 +/- 0.42 microM and a 6-fold increase in LDH. When 15 mM fructose was used as substrate during the anoxic period, intracellular ATP decreased much faster than with glucose, Pi did not increase, and the concentration of phosphomonoesters increased 2.5-fold. During the first hour of anoxia, the Pi/ATP ratio was higher in the fructose than in the glucose group indicating that the hepatocyte phosphorylation potential and ATP decreased faster and to lower levels with fructose than with glucose. On the other hand, ATP and the phosphorylation potential of the fructose group increased during the second hour of anoxia, in contrast to their continuous decline in the glucose group. The major surge in Ca2+i was depressed 52% when glucose was replaced by fructose: Ca2+i reached only 0.7 +/- 0.2 microM instead of 1.45 +/- 0.42 microM (p less than 0.01). Anoxia also caused an increase in Na+i and an intracellular acidosis. The rise in Na+i was significantly greater with fructose than with glucose. Na+i rose from a control value of 15.9 +/- 2.4 to 32.2 +/- 0.4 mM with glucose and to 48.7 +/- 0.7 mM with fructose (p less than 0.001). The decrease in pHi from a control value of 7.43 +/- 0.03 was consistently greater and faster with fructose than with glucose: 6.59 +/- 0.03 and 7.04 +/- 0.01, respectively. At the same time, fructose completely suppressed LDH release and reduced the loss of viability produced by anoxia from 27.7 +/- 2.9 to 14 +/- 3.1% (p less than 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W1529314598,"The hydrophobic, photoreactive probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) was used to characterize the effects of lipids and detergents on acetylcholine receptor (AChR) conformation. Affinity purified AChR reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA), and cholesterol showed the same pattern of [125I]TID-labeling and demonstrated the same reduction in labeling of all four subunits upon desensitization by the agonist carbamylcholine, as partially purified AChR in native lipids. On the basis of the patterns of [125I]TID incorporation, reconstitution into DOPC/DOPA also appeared to stabilize the resting (functional) conformation of the AChR, while reconstitution in DOPC/cholesterol or DOPC alone largely desensitized the AChR. The effects of lipids on the functional state of the AChR was determined independently by measuring the ability of AChR reconstituted into different lipid combinations to undergo the change in affinity for agonist diagnostic of desensitization. The dramatic reduction in the apparent levels of [125I]TID associated with the subunits of the AChR observed upon agonist-induced desensitization was shown not to be due to a change in affinity for tightly bound lipid. Solubilization of affinity purified AChR reconstituted into DOPC/DOPA/cholesterol by the non-ionic detergents octyl glucoside, Triton X-100, and Tween 20 (final detergent concentration = 1%) was shown to produce the same pattern of [125I]TID-labeling as desensitization by agonist, while solubilization in 1% sodium cholate appeared to stabilize a conformation of the AChR more similar to the resting state."

These biliproteins carry the following covalently attached bilins: Cr-PC 645 (alpha subunit) has one mesobiliverdin, (beta subunit), two phycocyanobilins and a doubly linked 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin; Cr-PC 566 (alpha), bilin 584, (beta), phycoerythrobilin and two bilin 584 chromophores (Wedemayer, G.J., Wemmer, D.E., and Glazer, A.N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4731-4741); Cr-PE 545 (alpha) has one 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin and (beta), only phycoerythrobilins. This is the first report of naturally occurring biliproteins carrying either 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin or mesobiliverdin chromophores. Native cryptomonad phycobiliproteins have been classified on the basis of the position of their long wavelength absorption maxima. However, comparison of the bilins of Cr-PE 566 from strain Bermani with those of Cr-PE 566 of strain CBD shows that the two proteins carry different bilins on the alpha subunit. Consequently, the identity of the bilin prosthetic groups on cryptophycean phycobiliproteins cannot be unambiguously inferred from simple inspection of the visible absorption spectra."
https://openalex.org/W1501663495,"Ribose 1-phosphate, phosphate, and acyclovir diphosphate quenched the fluorescence of purine nucleoside phosphorylase at pH 7.1 and 25 degrees C. The fluorescence of enzyme-bound guanine was similar to that of anionic guanine in ethanol. Guanine and ribose 1-phosphate bound to free enzyme, whereas inosine and guanosine were not bound to free enzyme in the absence of phosphate. Thus, synthesis proceeded by a random mechanism, and phosphorolysis proceeded by an ordered mechanism. Steady-state kinetic data for the phosphorolysis of 100 microM guanosine were fitted to a bifunctional kinetic model with catalytic rate constants of 22 and 1.3 s-1. The dissociation rate constants for guanine from the enzyme-guanine complex at high and low phosphate concentrations were similar to the catalytic rate constants. Fluorescence changes of the enzyme during phosphorolysis suggested that ribose 1-phosphate dissociated from the enzyme ribose 1-phosphate-guanine complex rapidly and that guanine dissociated from the enzyme-guanine complex slowly. The association and dissociation rate constants for acyclovir diphosphate, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme (Tuttle, J. V., and Krenitsky, T. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4065-4069), were also dependent on phosphate concentration. The effects of phosphate are discussed in terms of a dual functional binding site for phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1577729773,"Two tripeptide amides with stuctures similar to thyrotropin releasing hormone were isolated from human seminal fluid and their amino acid sequences determined. The peptides were purified by gel exclusion from Sephadex G50 and were detected by radioimmunoassay with thyrotropin releasing hormone antibody; in addition, N-terminally extended forms were demonstrated by radioimmunoassay after trypsin digestion. Further purification of the tripeptides was by chromatography on SP-Sephadex C25 and by high performance liquid chromatography on C18 Microbondapak using an HCl/acetonitrile gradient. After exclusion from mini-columns of SP-Sephadex C25 and DEAE-Sephadex A25, two neutral peptides were obtained in homogeneous form by high performance liquid chromatography with an HCl/methanol gradient. Amino acid analysis gave the following compositions: Glu, 0.74, Phe, 1.0, Pro, 1.0; and Glu, 1.72, Pro, 1.0. Both peptides possessed a blocked N terminus, but after opening the pyroglutamyl ring the sequences Glu-Phe-Pro and Glu-Glx-Pro were demonstrated. The chromatographic properties of the endogenous peptides were identical to the properties of the corresponding synthetic peptides. The structure of pGlu-Phe-Pro (where p-indicates pyro-) amide was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The presence in human semen of three structurally related peptides, pGlu-Phe-Pro amide, pGlu-Gln-Pro amide, and the previously reported pGlu-Glu-Pro amide (Cockle, S. M., Aitken, A., Beg, F., and Smyth, D. G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7788-7791), suggests that this series of peptides may have evolved to fulfil complementary biological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1565745864,"During a complete cell cycle of rat thymocytes stimulated by concanavalin A and interleukin 2, the activity and mRNA level of pyruvate kinase reached a maximum (8-12-fold increase) 48 h after stimulation coinciding with the S-phase of the cell cycle. Increases of cellular enzyme activity, pyruvate kinase protein, and mRNA levels are correlated up to 48 h of culture. Afterwards pyruvate kinase activity and mRNA levels decrease, whereas the pyruvate kinase protein continues to increase throughout mitosis. This change of specific pyruvate kinase activity points to a posttranslational modification of the enzyme besides its transcriptional regulation. The presence of the M2-type isozyme was determined by the following methods: (a) native cellulose acetate electrophoresis and activity staining, (b) Northern blot hybridization with M1- and M2-specific cDNA probes, and (c) determination of kinetic parameters. The isozyme pattern did not change during the cell cycle progression. The induction of pyruvate kinase is completely abolished by 2-difluoromethylornithine-mediated polyamine depletion. However, the proportion of hybridizable pyruvate kinase mRNA was not affected. These data suggest the requirement of polyamines for efficient translation rather than transcription during cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1593276557,"The role of pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive and -insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in the stimulation of Ca2+ mobilization by thrombin was investigated in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Characterization using immunoblotting with specific antisera indicated the presence in isolated membranes of the G alpha i2, G alpha i3, G alpha s, G beta 35, and G beta 36 protein subunits as well as a lower molecular weight species of unknown identity. To assess the importance of G proteins in the coupling of thrombin receptors to Ca2+ mobilization, we investigated the effect of PT on Ca2+ responses using fluorescence spectroscopy and the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2. Pretreatment of cells for 2 h with PT (1 microgram/ml), which produced 91.3% ADP-ribosylation of PT-sensitive G proteins, did not affect the magnitude of thrombin-induced release of Ca2+ from internal stores, suggesting that the residual 8.7% of PT-sensitive G proteins, or PT-insensitive mechanisms, was responsible for Ca2+ release. However, after an 18-h pretreatment with PT, which produced ADP-ribosylation of the total complement of PT-sensitive G proteins, the thrombin-induced peak Ca2+ response was inhibited by approximately 72%, suggesting that the major fraction of the Ca2+ response was mediated by a slowly ribosylating component. The delayed effect of the toxin was not caused by down-regulation of the beta-subunit of G proteins because quantitative immunoblots showed that levels of the beta-subunit remained constant throughout the period of PT pretreatment. It was also not caused by a reduction in the size of the thrombin-releasable Ca2+ pool because Ca2+ release induced by agents that release Ca2+ directly from internal stores, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone or thapsigargin, was not affected. In addition, the delayed effect of PT could not be explained in terms of differences in thrombin-induced [3H]inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation because the level of inhibition of IP3 formation after a 2-h PT treatment was similar to that present after an 18-h pretreatment. The results indicate that a slowly ribosylating PT-sensitive species is the major G protein pathway that couples thrombin-receptor activation to Ca2+ mobilization. This G protein appears to be involved not in the mechanisms that generate IP3 but rather possibly in coupling at the level of the intracellular Ca2+ store."
https://openalex.org/W1549953471,"Photoaffinity-labeled N-formyl chemotactic peptide receptors from human neutrophils solubilized in octyl glucoside exhibit two forms upon sucrose density gradient sedimentation, with apparent sedimentation coefficients of approximately 4 and 7 S. The 7 S form can be converted to the 4 S form by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with an EC50 of approximately 20 nM, suggesting that the 7 S form may represent a physical complex of the receptor with endogenous G protein (Jesaitis, A. J., Tolley, J. O., Bokoch, G. M., and Allen, R. A. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 2783-2790). To probe the nature of the 7 S form, we reconstituted the 7 S form from the 4 S form by adding purified G protein. The 4 S form, obtained by solubilizing GTP gamma S-treated neutrophil plasma membranes, was incubated with purified (greater than 95%) Gi protein from bovine brain (containing both Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 2) or with neutrophil G protein (Gn), and formation of the 7 S complex was analyzed on sucrose density gradients. The EC50 of 7 S complex formation induced by the two G proteins was 70 +/- 25 and 170 +/- 40 nM for Gn and Gi, respectively. No complexation was measurable when bovine transducin (Gt) was used up to 30 times the EC50 for Gn. The EC50 for Gi was the same for receptors, obtained from formyl peptide-stimulated or unstimulated cells. The addition of 10 microM GTP gamma S to the reconstituted 7 S complex caused a complete revision of the receptor to the 4 S form, and anti-Gi peptide antisera immunosedimented the 7 S form. ADP-ribosylation of Gi prevented formation of the 7 S form even at 20 times the concentration of unribosylated Gi normally used to attain 50% conversion to the 7 S form. These observations suggest that the 7 S species is a physical complex containing N-formyl chemotactic peptide receptor and G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1520287898,"The complete analysis of a cDNA clone encoding the mouse integrin beta 7 subunit that was isolated from a lambda gt10 cDNA library prepared from interleukin-4-activated mouse spleen B cells is reported. The 805-amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA revealed a signal peptide, a 704-amino acid extracellular domain with eight N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain, and a 61-amino acid intracellular domain. Several structural features were conserved with other integrin beta chains including the four cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like repeat sequences in the extracellular domain. Comparative analysis of the mouse and human beta 7 subunits revealed 87% sequence identity with conservation of three potential intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to two mRNA transcripts of 3 and 2 kilobases (kb) in size. The 3-kb transcript, which is considered the productive form, was found in T and B leukemic cell lines, a macrophage line, and a mastocytoma cell line. Suprisingly, the smaller 2-kb transcript, which seems unlikely to encode a complete beta 7 protein, was found expressed in epithelial cells cultured from mouse skin. The integrin beta 7 subunit displays sequence identity with the beta subunit of the M290 antigen found expressed almost exclusively on intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine suggesting that beta 7 may play an adhesive role in intraepithelial lymphocytes immunosurveillance of the gut mucosa. The cellular distribution of beta 7 transcripts is more extensive than the T-lineage-restricted distribution of the M290 antigen, indicating that beta 7 may be the common beta subunit for more than one receptor or that translation of beta 7 transcripts varies in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1540785416,"4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase is a key enzyme of the 4-aminobutyric acid shunt. It is responsible for the conversion of the neurotransmitter 4-aminobutyrate to succinic semialdehyde. By using oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequence data for the pig brain enzyme, several overlapping cDNA clones of 2.0-2.2 kilobases in length have been isolated. The largest cDNA clone was selected for sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence shows that the precursor of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase consists of the mature enzyme of 473 amino acid residues and an amino-terminal segment of 27 amino acids attributed to the signal peptide. The cofactor pyridoxal-5-P is bound to lysine residue 330 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1569652852,"This study investigates the catalytic and allosteric roles of a flexible loop in the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex. This loop connects helix 6 and strand 6 in the alpha subunit, an 8-fold alpha/beta barrel polypeptide. We have engineered three mutations in this disordered loop: a deletion of residues 185-187 and the replacement of threonine 183 by serine (T183S) or by alanine (T183A). Position 183 is a site of an inactivating mutation identified by Yanofsky's group (Yanofsky, C., Drapeau, G. R., Guest, J. R., and Carlton, B. C. (1967) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 57, 296-298). The three engineered alpha subunits form stable, stoichiometric alpha 2 beta 2 complexes with the beta subunit which bind alpha and beta subunit ligands. Although changing threonine 183 to serine has little effect on the enzymatic properties, changing threonine 183 to alanine or deleting residues 185-187 results in a 50-fold reduction in the intrinsic activity of the alpha subunit alone and in the alpha site activity of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. The latter two mutations profoundly alter the way in which the alpha subunit modulates the spectral properties and the activities of the wild-type beta subunit. These mutations also eliminate the effects of alpha subunit ligands on the beta subunit. Although the beta subunit ligand, L-serine, greatly stabilizes the wild-type alpha 2 beta 2 complex to dissociation and to proteolysis, L-serine stabilizes the T183A alpha 2 beta 2 complex weakly or not at all. Our findings suggest that the hydroxyl residue at position 183 and the adjacent residues in the alpha subunit loop play critical roles in the reciprocal communication between the alpha and beta subunits in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. The results also help to explain how the wild-type alpha subunit or ammonium ion modulates the activities of the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1562227270,"Expression of bioluminescence in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri is controlled by a unique cell density-dependent regulatory mechanism called auto-induction. The genes required for bioluminescence (the lux genes) are organized in two divergently transcribed operons (luxR-luxICDABEG). One operon (luxICDABEG) contains the genes required for light production (luxCDABE) and the synthesis of a diffusible signal molecule called autoinducer (luxI). The other operon contains the luxR gene which encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein that activates transcription of both lux operons in the presence of autoinducer. This bidirectional stimulatory mechanism leads to a positive feedback circuit that results in a rapid increase in light production at a particular culture cell density which is characteristic of autoinduction. Transcriptional positive feedback is apparently limited by a negative autoregulatory circuit through which LuxR acts to inhibit its own synthesis. Transcriptional negative autoregulation requires autoinducer, the lux operator located in the control region (which is the binding site for LuxR), and negative acting DNA sequences in the luxICDABEG operon. Deletion analysis of the luxICDABEG operon demonstrated that a negative acting element is located in the luxD gene at a position 2.0 kilobases from the lux operator. The nucleotide sequence of this luxD element is similar to the lux operator (11 of 20 base pairs identical) and can function as a LuxR-binding site when it replaces the lux operator in the control region. These results suggest that the luxD element functions as a low affinity binding site for LuxR and that occupancy of this site is required to achieve transcriptional negative autoregulation of luxR."
https://openalex.org/W1544652523,"The effects of the expression of the protein tyrosine kinase pp60v-src on endothelin- and thrombin-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) production and calcium responses were investigated in Rat-1 fibroblasts. The ability of endothelin-1 to induce the accumulation of these second messengers was dramatically amplified by v-src transformation, with 6- and 3-fold enhancements of the peak Ins(1,4,5)P3 and peak calcium responses, respectively. In contrast, thrombin-dependent responses were slightly reduced following v-src transformation, demonstrating that the augmentation of endothelin-stimulated signal transduction is a selective effect. The magnitude of the stimulated accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 presumably depends upon both the functional activation of phospholipase C to produce Ins(1,4,5)P3, and the activity of the enzymes that metabolize Ins(1,4,5)P3. Although the metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was strikingly altered by expression of pp60v-src, with a bias towards the production of higher inositol polyphosphates that is consistent with an activated Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, this change could not account for the marked increase in endothelin-stimulated signaling induced by v-src transformation. This suggests that an effect of pp60v-src is expressed at the level of the plasma membrane, through an interaction with one or more components in the receptor/guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)/phospholipase C system that transduces the endothelin signal into Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Preparation of membranes from normal and v-src-transformed cells showed that, while there was no change in the number of high-affinity endothelin binding sites, the release of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in response to guanine nucleotides and endothelin-1 was significantly increased following v-src transformation. In contrast, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 responses to thrombin and high Ca2+ concentrations were unaffected by transformation. Thus the selective interactions within the G protein system that couples the endothelin receptor to phospholipase C are potential sites at which the v-src transformation process may act to amplify endothelin-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 production."
https://openalex.org/W1522863749,"The electrochemical potential drives the translocation of the precursor form of outer membrane protein A (proOmpA) and other proteins across the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli. We have measured the electrical potential, delta psi, across inverted membrane vesicles during proOmpA translocation. delta psi, generated by the electron transport chain, is substantially dissipated by proOmpA translocation. delta psi dissipation requires SecA, ATP, and proOmpA. proOmpA which, due to the covalent addition of a folded protein to a cysteinyl side chain, is arrested during its translocation, can nevertheless cause the loss of delta psi. Thus the movement of charged amino acyl residues is not dissipating the potential. This translocation-specific reduction in delta psi is only seen in the presence of halide anions, although halide anions are not needed for proOmpA translocation per se. We therefore propose that translocation intermediates directly increase the membrane permeability to halide anions."
https://openalex.org/W1595817947,"1-O-Octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (octadecylacetyl-GP) and its deacetylation product were used as a model of phosphatidic acid and its lyso derivatives, respectively. The binding, transbilayer movement, and intermembranous transport, which should be related to its metabolism in guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, were studied. The albumin extraction procedure (Tokumura, A., Tsutsumi, T., Yoshida, J., and Tsukatani, H. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1044, 91-100) was used for studying the transbilayer movement of [3H]octadecylacetyl-GP. The binding, translocation, and metabolism of octadecylacetylglycerol, a dephosphorylated product of octadecylacetyl-GP, in polymorphonuclear leukocytes were also investigated for comparison. The translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP was dependent on temperature, but not on its concentration (in the range of 1-100 nM). The rate of translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP was much slower than that of octadecylacetylglycerol. Treatment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with N-ethylmaleimide did not affect the translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP. These results suggest that the transbilayer movement of octadecylacetyl-GP is driven by a diffusion process, not by a carrier protein. From these findings, the process of translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP is concluded to be a rate-limiting step in its metabolic conversion to triglyceride, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine."

The functional significance of this region is unclear. Previous results indicate that a radioiodinated tyrosinated synthetic peptide corresponding to A194-211 binds specifically, saturably, and with low affinity to a large population of sites on Balb/c 3T3 and several other cell lines (Khachigian, L. M., Owensby, D. A., and Chesterman, C. N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1660-1666). In this paper, we report that (Y)A194-211 and A194-211 can modulate the cellular proliferative response to normal human serum and several individual polypeptide growth factors as a consequence. When these peptides were coincubated separately with whole serum, PDGF, epidermal growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, DNA synthesis was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion and maximally by 200 microM peptide. In addition, both peptides could attenuate the stimulation of cell division by serum and PDGF. Peptides with similar charge or length failed to modify the level of proliferation. These observations were not due to cytotoxicity. Synthetic peptides such as (Y)A194-211 and A194-211 that influence cellular proliferation may be useful in modulating the cellular response to selected growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1522093734,"We have used DNA templates containing a vaccinia early promoter fused to G-less cassettes of varying length to study the formation of ternary transcription complexes by vaccinia virus RNA polymerase. Elongating polymerases were induced to pause at discrete sites on the DNA template by omission of GTP from transcription reactions. For most of the templates examined, the predominant sites of pausing were at or near the downstream border of the G-less transcription unit, as revealed by the size distribution of labeled RNAs synthesized in pulse-labeling reactions. Stability of ternary complexes containing nascent RNAs of any given length was assessed by the ability of these RNAs to be elongated upon provision of GTP. This criterion of stability could be met by complexes containing nascent RNAs as short as seven, eight, or nine nucleotides. In the presence of 3'-OMeGTP, nearly homogeneous populations of 3'-coterminal elongation complexes were positioned at the first G residue of the template. 3'-OMeG-arrested polymerases resumed elongation upon addition of GTP, apparently via sequential pyrophosphorolysis and nucleotide exchange at the site of elongation block. The ability to fix the 3' end facilitated analysis of initiation site choice based on the sizes of short nascent transcripts. Site choice was flexible and depended on the concentration of both the potential initiating NTP and the donor NTP participating in first phosphodiester bond formation. RNA polymerase could initiate at multiple positions within a nine-nucleotide region of the template. The rate of chain elongation by vaccinia polymerase during a single synchronous round of RNA synthesis was found to be 20-50 nucleotides per second."

To identify intermolecular associations among deoxyribonucleotide biosynthetic enzymes and to ask whether these enzymes are linked to replication proteins, we analyzed radiolabeled T4 bacteriophage proteins that bind specifically to a column of immobilized T4 deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase. More than a dozen T4 proteins and a few Escherichia coli proteins are adsorbed specifically by this column. Several of the T4 proteins were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and radioautography. These include five enzymes involved in DNA precursor biosynthesis, dCMP hydroxymethylase, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, dCTPase-dUTPase, and ribonucleotide reductase large and small subunits, plus several proteins of DNA metabolism and replication. Analysis of extracts of cells infected with phage amber mutants defective in specific proteins suggested a specific association involving thymidylate synthase and the gene 32 single-strand DNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510828048,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3)-induced differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells is accompanied by a number of cellular changes including regulation of oncogene expression and induction of terminal differentiation. We investigated the mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces these changes. We detected 10 nuclear phosphoproteins, designated p66, p45, p36, p33, p32, p27, p22, p19, p18 and p17, that show alterations in phosphorylation within 6-40 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. When phosphorylation reactions were performed with isolated nuclei (in vitro), three of these proteins were phosphorylated in a calcium and phospholipid dependent manner: p66, p36, and p19 P66 was phosphorylated in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and purified in a manner similar to that used for nuclear lamins. Western blot analysis of 2-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels confirmed its identity as lamin B. Phosphorylation of p17 and p18 decreased following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. We separated p17 and p18 by SDS-PAGE and obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence to identify these phosphorproteins as histones H2b and H3, respectively. P19 and p22 were both DNA-cellulose binding proteins whose phosphorylation was altered by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Increased phosphorylation of p27 was detected using 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of nuclear proteins in the intact cell (in vivo), revealed increases in p66, p45, p36, and p33 phosphorylation and a decrease in p17 phosphorylation following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. We detected an increase in phosphorylation of p32, which was extracted with salt from nuclei and migrated on SDS-PAGE similar to histone H1. Thus, we have identified 1,25-(OH)2D3-sensitive nuclear phosphoproteins, including lamin B and several histones. We have also detected and characterized several less abundant nuclear DNA binding phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation was affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3."
https://openalex.org/W1642645247,"Abstract The promoter of the major histocompatibility class II gene DRA contains an octamer element (ATTTGCAT) that is required for efficient DRA expression in B cells. Several DNA-binding proteins are known to bind this sequence. The best characterized are the B cell-specific OTF-2 and the ubiquitous OTF-1. This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but not OTF-1 regulates the DRA gene. In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 demonstrate a positive functional role for OTF-2 in DRA gene transcription. In contrast, OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene. Recombinant OTF-2 protein produced by in vitro transcription/translation could also enhance DRA gene transcription in vitro. In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF-2 expression vector resulted in similar findings: that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription, and that this effect requires an intact octamer element. Together these results constitute the first direct evidence of a positive role for the lymphoid-specific octamer-binding factor in DRA gene transcription."

Chem. 266, 20011-20017) we demonstrated the existence of a M(r) 66,000 microsomal iron protein (MIP) which stimulates NADPH oxidation by shunting electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reducase to its bound Fe(III). In the present study, purified MIP was depleted of iron and the apoMIP was examined for its ability to incorporate Fe(III) upon an incubation with Fe(II). It was found that apoMIP had an oxygen-dependent ferroxidase activity coupled with the incorporation of Fe(III). The reconstituted MIP exhibited a Fe(III) content and an NADPH oxidation activity similar to those of native MIP. However, the reconstitution of MIP from apoMIP and Fe(II) had to be performed in the presence of detergents to prevent the formation of protein aggregates and the oxidative incorporation of an iron which could not react with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. This redox inactive iron was probably bound nonspecifically to artifactual sites formed by the protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1600005578,"Newly synthesized 35S-labeled chondrocytic keratan sulfate chains were generated by chondrocytes of human chondrosarcoma cell line 105KC and were analyzed for heterogeneity of regional substitution, hydrodynamic size, and charge density. After isolation of the high density large chondrocytic proteoglycans and sequential digestions with chondroitinase ABC, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin, followed by Superose 6 chromatography, two populations of keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycan fragments were identified and pooled separately. Keratan sulfate chains from each of the regions were compared after release by Pronase digestion, and differences in substitution patterns were observed; keratan sulfate chains of greater polydispersity, as well as a population of larger hydrodynamic size, were present in only one of the two regions. Alkaline/borohydride treatment confirmed both the existence of a population of uniquely large keratan sulfate chains and its restriction to a single region of proteoglycan fragments. In addition to heterogeneity of hydrodynamic size, the keratan sulfate chains exhibited regional heterogeneity of charge density and hence, of sulfation patterns. Analysis by Mono Q chromatography identified distinct groups of keratan sulfate that segregated by charge density and whose proportionate composition differed between the proteoglycan regions. Furthermore, the most highly charged species were unique to a single region and encompassed the chains of larger hydrodynamic size. This suggests that there may be regional heterogeneity of keratan sulfate chains substituted along a single class of proteoglycans and identifies a novel population of large, highly sulfated chondrocytic keratan sulfate chains."
