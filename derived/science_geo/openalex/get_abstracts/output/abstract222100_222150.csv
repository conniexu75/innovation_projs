https://openalex.org/W2123409573,"The spontaneous assembly of phospholipids at planar interfaces between thermotropic liquid crystals and aqueous phases gives rise to patterned orientations of the liquid crystals that reflect the spatial and temporal organization of the phospholipids. Strong and weak specific-binding events involving proteins at these interfaces drive the reorganization of the phospholipids and trigger orientational transitions in the liquid crystals. Because these interfaces are fluid, processes involving the lateral organization of proteins (such as the formation of protein- and phospholipid-rich domains) are also readily imaged by the orientational response of the liquid crystal, as are stereospecific enzymatic events. These results provide principles for label-free monitoring of aqueous streams for molecular and biomolecular species without the need for complex instrumentation."
https://openalex.org/W2018392649,"We report the presence of two disconnected superconducting domes in the pressure-temperature phase diagram of partially germanium-substituted CeCu 2 Si 2 . The lower density superconducting dome lies on the threshold of antiferromagnetic order, indicating magnetically mediated pairing, whereas the higher density superconducting regime straddles a weakly first-order volume collapse, suggesting a pairing interaction based on spatially extended density fluctuations. Two distinct pairing mechanisms thus appear to operate in the single, wide, superconducting range of stoichiometric CeCu 2 Si 2 , both of which might apply more generally to other classes of correlated electron systems."

In the retinal pigmented epithelium, LRAT plays a key role in the retinoid cycle, a two-cell recycling system that replenishes the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments. We disrupted mouse Lrat gene expression by targeted recombination and generated a homozygous Lrat knock-out (Lrat-/-) mouse. Despite the expression of LRAT in multiple tissues, the Lrat-/- mouse develops normally. The histological analysis and electron microscopy of the retina for 6–8-week-old Lrat-/- mice revealed that the rod outer segments are ∼35% shorter than those of Lrat+/+ mice, whereas other neuronal layers appear normal. Lrat-/- mice have trace levels of all-trans-retinyl esters in the liver, lung, eye, and blood, whereas the circulating all-trans-retinol is reduced only slightly. Scotopic and photopic electroretinograms as well as pupillary constriction analyses revealed that rod and cone visual functions are severely attenuated at an early age. We conclude that Lrat-/- mice may serve as an animal model with early onset severe retinal dystrophy and severe retinyl ester deprivation.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12478-12482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRAT activity in the RPE has been studied for more than 60 years (6Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1936; 19: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but the enzyme was only recently identified on the molecular level as a 25-kDa integral membrane protein (7Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinyl esters are intermediate compounds in a metabolic pathway (“visual cycle” or “retinoid cycle”) that recycles 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments (for review, see Refs. 8McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Bok D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

In this cycle, all-trans-retinal dissociates from rhodopsin and cone pigments after photobleaching. In the photoreceptors, all-trans-retinal is reduced to all-trans-retinol and subsequently exported to the adjacent RPE. In the RPE, all-trans-retinol is esterified by LRAT and stored. All-trans-retinyl esters have been suggested to be the substrate for a putative isomerohydrolase in the RPE (11Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and for a retinyl ester hydrolase that produces all-trans-retinol, a substrate for the putative isomerase (for review, see Ref. 12McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ultimately, 11-cis-retinol is produced, oxidized to 11-cis-retinal, and exported to the photoreceptors. In the rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments, 11-cis-retinal recombines with opsins to form rhodopsin and cone pigments (for review, see Ref. 8McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Human LRAT cDNA was cloned from a retinal-RPE cDNA library (7Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and rodent Lrat cDNA from liver and other tissues (13Zolfaghari R. Wang Y. Chen Q. Sancher A. Ross A.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zolfaghari R. Ross A.C. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Zolfaghari R. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2024-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lrat mRNA was shown to be a 5.0-kb species expressed in the RPE, and the multiple transcripts based on differential polyadenylation were detected in several other tissues known for the highest LRAT activity (13Zolfaghari R. Wang Y. Chen Q. Sancher A. Ross A.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human LRAT polypeptide consisted of 230 amino acids and is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane domains. Based on the primary sequence, LRAT is a member of a large N1pC/P60 superfamily involved in murein degradation, amide hydrolysis, and acyl transfer (16Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2003; http://genomebiology.com/2003/2/3/reviews/0011Google Scholar). Eukaryotic members of this family include the class II tumor suppressor genes and the nematode developmental regulator Egl-26 (17Jahng W.J. Xue L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12805-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis of recombinant human LRAT revealed that of four Cys residues, Cys161 is a nucleophile creating a thioacylenzyme intermediate, which is then transferred to all-trans-retinol (18Mondal M.S. Ruiz A. Bok D. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5215-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Mondal M.S. Ruiz A. Hu J. Bok D. Rando R.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further mutagenesis experiments identified two His residues essential for LRAT catalytic activity (19Mondal M.S. Ruiz A. Hu J. Bok D. Rando R.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The human LRAT gene consists of three exons and is located as a single copy on chromosome 4q31.2 (20Ruiz A. Kuehn M.H. Andorf J.L. Stone E. Hageman G.S. Bok D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its key role in the retinoid cycle, defects in the LRAT gene are predicted to have severe consequences on vision and retinoid metabolism. Screening of 267 retinal dystrophy patients identified two disease-associated mutations inherited recessively (21Thompson D.A. Li Y. McHenry C.L. Carlson T.J. Ding X. Sieving P.A. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The missense mutation S175R and a frameshift mutation 396delAA inactivated LRAT. Patients carrying the S175R LRAT null gene developed normally, suggesting that the lack of LRAT in the liver and other tissues had no deleterious effects. However, their visual functions are severely attenuated, causing early onset severe retinal dystrophy. To characterize further the consequences of deleting the LRAT gene, we generated Lrat+/- and Lrat-/- mice by the standard gene replacement technique. The homozygous knock-out Lrat-/- animals exhibit slow degeneration of the retina. The RPE of Lrat-/- mice is devoid of all-trans-retinol or all-trans-retinyl esters, photoreceptors have no functional rhodopsin, and electroretinogram (ERG) responses are highly attenuated. Lrat-/- mice are an important experimental model for human retinal dystrophies and for vitamin A deprivation. Animals—All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the University of Washington, University of Utah, and Washington University Animal Care Committees and conformed to recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and recommendations of the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Animals were maintained in complete darkness, and all manipulations were done under dim red light employing a Kodak no. 1 safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). Rpe65-/- mice, obtained from Dr. M. Redmond (NEI, National Institutes of Health), were genotyped as described previously (22Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Typically, 6–12-week-old mice were used in all experiments. Construction of Targeting Vector and Generation of Lrat-/- Mice—A ∼14-kb genomic clone was isolated from a 129SvEvλ library. The probe used for screening was amplified with PCR primers LRAT2 (5′-GACGTGTTGGAGGTGTCACGGAC-3′) and LRAT4 (5′-CTTGTGTGTGCAGACCAAGATGAC-3′), fragment size 660 bp. The targeting vector was constructed by using a 1,350-bp DNA fragment as a short arm, which was PCR product amplified using the LRATSA1 and LRATSA2 primers. LRATSA1 is located 3.6 kb upstream of exon 1 (containing ATG), with the sequence 5′-GTACCCAGGAGTAGGACCAAC-3′. LRATSA2 is located 2.2 kb upstream of exon 1, with the sequence 5′-TGTGAGTGAGAGGCCACATCC-3′. The short arm was inserted into the 5′-end of the Neo gene cassette using an MluI site. The long arm was a 10-kb genomic fragment that starts from SmaI site (inside exon 1) to the end of the 14-kb λ clone. In this strategy, the part of the coding sequence of exon 1 (including ATG) and the 2.2-kb upstream sequence was replaced by a Neo gene cassette. 10 μg of the targeting vector was linearized by NotI and then transfected by electroporation of 129 SvEviTL1 embryonic stem cells. After selection in neomycin-containing medium G418, surviving colonies were expanded. PCR analysis was performed to identify clones that had undergone homologous recombination. PCR was done using primer pairs LRATSA6 and Neo1. Primer LRATSA6 is located outside of short arm, 80 bp upstream of LRATSA1, with the sequence 5′-AAAGAATCAATAGGACAAAGAACTGG-3′. Primer Neo1 is located in the 5′-promoter region of the Neo gene cassette and has the sequence 5′-TGCGAGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGC-3′. The positive clones were identified based on the 1.4-kb PCR fragment. The correctly targeted embryonic stem cell lines were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. The chimeric mice were generated, and they gave germ line transmission of the disrupted Lrat gene. Genotyping Lrat-/- and Lrat+/- Mice—To identify the wild-type allele, primer pairs LRATSA1/LRATWT1 (1.4-kb fragment) or LRAT1S/LRATWT1 (300-bp fragment) were used. LRATWT1 is located 44 bp downstream of LRATSA2, with the sequence 5′-AAGTGCTGGGCATGGTGACTTGTG-3′. The knock-out gene was identified with LRAT1S (5′-TCCAGTTCCAGACTCTTTCCACCCAC-3′) and Neo-1 (370-bp fragment). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 120 s; total of 30 cycles. The mice were outbred into the C57BL/6J strain. Mouse Anti-Lrat Monoclonal Antibody Production—We isolated mouse RPE RNA using the MicroAqueous RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). Lrat cDNA was amplified using Hotstart Turbo Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) using the primers 5′-GCTCACCTCGTACAGAACAGTTGC-3′ and 5′-ACATACACGTTGACCTGTGGACTG-3′. A fragment of Lrat corresponding to the residues Gln89–Glu179 in the polypeptide sequence of mouse Lrat was amplified using the primers 5′-CATATGCAGAAGGTGGTCTCCAACAAGCGT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCACTCAGCCTGTGGACTGATCCGAGA-3′ and cloned downstream of a His6 tag between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the inducible bacterial expression vector pET15b (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transformed into BL-21RP cells (Stratagene), and expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The His6-tagged fragment of the mouse Lrat protein (10 kDa) was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography using the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). The purified protein was examined by gel electrophoresis. After in-gel trypsin digestion, the eluted tryptic peptides were examined by microsequencing by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to verify the identity of the recombinant Lrat fragment. The purified protein was used to immunize mice as described before (23Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal antibody was produced by established methods (24Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Emerson S.S. Hargrave P.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The antibody was tested for its specificity by immunocytochemical testing of the Lrat+/+ and Lrat-/- mouse retinas. Rhodopsin Measurements—All procedures were performed under dim red light as described previously (25Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Jang G.F. Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Typically, two mouse eyes were used per rhodopsin measurement. Mouse eyes were enucleated and rinsed with double-stilled H2O. The lenses were removed, and the eyes were cut into three or four pieces and frozen immediately on a dry ice/EtOH bath. Rhodopsin was extracted with 0.9 ml of 20 mm BisTris propane, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dodecyl-β-maltoside and 5 mm freshly neutralized NH2OH·HCl. The sample was homogenized with a Dounce tissue homogenizer and shaken for 5 min at room temperature (Eppendorf mixer 5432). The sample was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415C). The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was extracted one more time. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge/TLA100.3 fixed angle rotor), and absorption spectra were recorded before and after a 12-min bleach (60-watt incandescent bulb). The concentration of rhodopsin was determined by the decrease in absorption at 500 nm using the molar extinction coefficient ∈ = 42,000 m-1 cm-1. Retinoids—All experimental procedures related to extraction, derivatization, and separation of retinoids from dissected mouse eyes were carried out as described previously (25Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48483-48493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light. Retinoids were separated by normal phase HPLC (Beckman, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate and 90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min with detection at 325 nm using an HP1100 HPLC with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.03.03 software. ERGs—Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection using 20 μl/g body weight of 6 mg/ml ketamine and 0.44 mg/ml xylazine diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl. The pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide. A contact lens electrode was placed on the eye, and ground electrodes were placed in the ear and tail. ERGs were recorded with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system UTAS E-3000 (LKC Technologies, Inc.). The light intensity was calibrated and computer-controlled. The mice were placed in a Ganzfeld chamber, and scotopic and photopic responses to flash stimuli were obtained from both eyes simultaneously. Flash stimuli had a range of intensities (-3.7–2.8 log cd·s·m-2), and white light flash duration was adjusted according to intensity (from 20 μs to 1 ms). Three to five recordings were made with >10-s intervals, and for higher intensity intervals, intervals were 10 min or as indicated. There were no significant differences between the first and fourth flashes. Light-adapted responses were examined after bleaching at 1.4 log cd·m-2 for 15 min. Typically, four to eight animals were used for recording of each point in all conditions. Leading edges of the ERG responses were fitted with a model of rod phototransduction activation as described previously (25Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The results were examined using the one-way ANOVA test. Pupillometry—Mice were dark-adapted for at least 1 h prior to recordings. Pupillary light responses were recorded under infrared conditions using a CCD video camera; data analysis was performed by video pupillometry. Light stimuli were provided by a halogen source. Wavelength and intensity were manipulated with neutral density and narrow bandwidth (10 nm) interference filters (Oriel). Irradiance measurements (watts/m2) were made using a calibrated radiometer (Advanced Photonics International). Light Microscopy—For light microscopy, eyecups were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde for 18 h, infiltrated with 20% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then embedded in 33% OCT compound (Miles) diluted with 20% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Thin sections were cut at 5 μm and subjected to light microscopy. Immunocytochemistry—All procedures have been described previously (23Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sections were analyzed under an episcopic fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Digital images were captured with a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments; Sterling Heights, MI). Transmission Electron Microscopy (EM)—For transmission EM, mouse eyecups were fixed primarily by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1.6% paraformaldehyde in 0.08 m PIPES, pH 7.4, containing 2% sucrose initially at room temperature for ∼1 h then at 4 °C for the remainder of 24 h. The eyecups were then washed with 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.35, and secondarily fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.35, for 1 h at room temperature. The eyecups were dehydrated through a methanol series and transitioned to the epoxy embedding medium with propylene oxide. The eyecups were embedded for sectioning in Eponate 812. Ultrathin sections (60–70 nm) were stained with aqueous saturated uranium acetate and Reynold’s formula lead citrate prior to survey and micrography with a Philips CM10 EM. Mouse Lrat Gene and Targeting Construct—The mouse Lrat gene appears to be present as a single copy in the mouse (and human) genomes. The entire mouse Lrat gene sequence can be found at the NCBI web site as a complement (18,757,074.18,766,035) at locus NT_039234 (containing 26,830,222 bp). The published mouse Lrat cDNA sequence (15Zolfaghari R. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2024-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an expressed sequence tag (accession BY705162) have a 250–267-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region that perfectly matches the upstream gene sequence. Thus, in contrast to human LRAT, the mouse Lrat gene most likely has no upstream untranslated exon and consists only of two coding exons. The intervening sequence in the mouse Lrat gene is ∼6,040 bp in length (human ∼4,080 bp). LRAT expressed sequence tags have been identified in multiple tissues, including the colon, testis, liver, spleen, and mammary gland (e.g. see www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?ORG=Mm&CID=33921). In the Lrat targeting vector, part of the coding sequence of exon 1 (including ATG) and a 2.2-kb upstream sequence was replaced by a Neo gene cassette, disabling translation of a functional product (Fig. 1A). To generate chimeric mice, correctly targeted embryonic stem cell lines were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Heterozygous knock-out mice with germ line transmission were generated by standard outbreeding procedures (Ingenious Targeting, Stony Brooks, NY). The wild-type allele was identified using the primer pair of LRAT1S and LRATWT1 (diagnostic fragment ∼300 bp) and the knockout gene using LRAT1S and Neo1 (370 bp) (Fig. 1B). The expression of Lrat is abolished in the eye of Lrat-/- mice as determined by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting revealed two major molecular forms of Lrat (28 kDa and 25 kDa) in the eye (Fig. 1D) or in the liver (data not shown) of Lrat+/+ mice which could arise by alternative splicing/posttranslational modifications. Both forms are absent in Lrat-/- mice. The reason for the difference between the forms was not investigated further. The Lrat-/- mice develop normally, have similar weight, females are fertile at a normal level, whereas males appear to be frequently infertile. This observation is consistent with the role of retinoids in the reproductive system of males, as observed employing vitamin A-deprived mice (32Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Histology and Ultrastructure of the Retina from Lrat+/- and Lrat-/- Mice—At 6–8 weeks of age, the only major change in histology of the retina observed at the light microscopy levels is an ∼35% reduction in the length of ROS in the retina when Lrat-/- mice are compared with Lrat+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A and B, n = 3). The outer nuclear layer and inner retina appeared to be comparable between these mice (Fig. 2C). Quantitative calculations of the thickness of different retinal layers showed no significant variation between these two genetic backgrounds within the experimental error (Fig. 2D). Retinas of Lrat+/- mice were indistinguishable from those of Lrat+/+ mice (data not shown). EM analysis of the retina and the RPE layer revealed no gross changes between Lrat-/- mice with the exception of shorter ROS as noted by light microscopy (Fig. 3). ROS are shorter and thinner, and they are less tightly packed. Higher resolution images of the RPE did not unveil any differences between Lrat-/- mice and WT mice (data not shown). Higher resolution at the synaptic terminal of the photoreceptors showed less developed synaptic ribbons (Fig. 3, C and D). In 4.5-month-old Lrat-/- mice, ROS are ∼one-half length compared with normal, and there is a minor reduction in the number of photoreceptor nuclei (<10%).Fig. 3Transmission EMs of the RPE and ROS.

All retinoids were identified by coelution with authentic retinoids and on-line UV spectroscopy. For Lrat+/+ mice and Lrat+/- mice, 535 ± 95 and 442.5 ± 50.9 pmol/eye of 11-cis-retinal were observed, respectively (Fig. 4). These amounts are comparable with mice of other genetic backgrounds used in our studies (33Maeda T. Van Hooser J.P. Driessen C.A. Filipek S. Janssen J.J. Palczewski K. J.

The rhodopsin levels in Lrat+/+ and Lrat+/- were comparable and similar to corresponding values of 11-cis-retinal as determined from the retinoid analyses (data not shown). Lrat+/+ and Lrat+/- mice differed in their level of all-trans-retinyl esters. Typically, the eyes from Lrat+/+ mice contained all-trans-retinyl esters (28.5 ± 13 pmol/eye). The eyes from Lrat+/- mice contained 15.2 ± 4 pmol/eye of all-trans-retinyl esters (Fig. 4). Retinoid analyses of 4–8-week-old Lrat-/- mice showed very low amounts of all-trans-retinol at ∼8.3 pmol/eye (Fig. 4), which most likely comes from the blood in the eye sample. All-trans-retinyl esters were present only in trace amounts, and no other retinoids were definitively identified. In all cases, the majority (>95%) of all-trans-retinyl esters were present in RPE (data not shown). Retinoid Analysis from Liver, Blood, and Lung of Lrat-/- Mice—The results of the analysis of retinoids from the liver and blood of Lrat-/- mice mirrored the lack of all-trans-retinyl esters in the RPE of Lrat-/- mice, whereas the all-trans-retinyl ester levels of Lrat+/- mice were comparable with those from Lrat+/+ mice (Fig. 5 and Table I). Similar amounts of all-trans-retinol in the blood were found in Lrat+/+ and Lrat+/- mice although slightly reduced in Lrat-/- mice (Table I). A similar dramatic decrease of all-trans-retinyl esters was observed in the lung of Lrat-/- mice (data not shown). This reduction in the ester content is consistent with the high activity of LRAT in the lung (14Zolfaghari R. Ross A.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2015680924,"The E2F1 transcription factor is a critical downstream target of the tumor suppressor pRB. The retinoblastoma (RB) pathway is often inactivated in human tumors, resulting in deregulated E2F activity that can induce both proliferation and apoptosis. Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins are pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family that trigger apoptosis in response to diverse stimuli. We show here that E2F1 up-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5 through a direct transcriptional mechanism. Expression of the E7 protein of HPV16, which disrupts RB/E2F complexes, also up-regulates the expression of these four BH3-only proteins, implicating endogenous E2F in this phenomenon. Indeed, endogenous E2F1 binds the promoters of these four genes. Furthermore, inhibition of E2F1-induced expression of either Noxa or PUMA results in a significant reduction in E2F1-induced apoptosis, indicating that increased Noxa and PUMA levels mediate this E2F1-induced apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of E2F activity abolishes DNA damage-induced elevation of PUMA levels, implicating E2F in the physiological regulation of PUMA expression. These data provide a novel direct link between E2F and the apoptotic machinery and may explain the increased sensitivity of cells with a defective RB/E2F pathway to chemotherapy.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 131-150PubMed Google Scholar). E2Fs are best known for their involvement in the timely activation of genes required for cell cycle progression (1DeGregori J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 131-150PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is currently clear that E2Fs have important roles in regulating both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Indeed, ectopic expression of E2F1 and, in some settings, E2F2 and E2F3 also, results in apoptosis (2Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H.

Moreover, loss of either E2F1 or E2F3 suppresses apoptosis in RB-deficient mice embryos (4Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol.

E2F-induced apoptosis occurs via both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, and it has been demonstrated that a number of E2F-regulated genes, including p14/p19ARF, p73, Apaf-1, and caspases, contribute to this E2F-induced apoptosis (6Bates S.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying E2F1-induced apoptosis are not fully understood. Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins are members of the Bcl-2 protein family that trigger apoptosis. They share with each other and with the rest of the Bcl-2 family only a nineamino acid BH3 domain. BH3-only proteins serve to integrate diverse apoptotic stimuli into a common cell death pathway governed by other multidomain Bcl-2 family members. Two such multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins, BAK and BAX, serve as essential effectors of cell death induced by BH3-only proteins (13Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). We now show that E2F1 regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5. Furthermore, increased Noxa and PUMA levels mediate E2F1-induced apoptosis.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 108 cells were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde directly to the growth medium (final concentration, 1%). Cross-linking was stopped after 10 min at room temperature by the addition of glycine (final concentration, 0.125 m). Cross-linked cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, scrapped, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in buffer I (10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100). Cells were pelleted by microcentrifugation and then resuspended in buffer II (10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 200 mm NaCl). After microcentrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). The resulting chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 1000 bp and then microcentrifuged. The supernatant was diluted 1:10 with dilution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100) and divided into aliquots. After preclearing with blocked protein A-Sepharose beads, 1 μg of antibody was added to each aliquot of chromatin and incubated on a rotating platform overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with blocked protein A-Sepharose beads. Following extensive washing, bound DNA fragments were eluted and analyzed by subsequent PCR. The antibody used is anti-E2F1 (sc-193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sequences of primers used for PCR are available upon request. FACS Analysis—Cells were trypsinized and fixed with 70% ethanol (4 °C overnight). After fixation, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS containing 5 mg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer.

Then cells were fixed using formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. To determine whether E2F regulates the expression of BH3-only proteins, we examined the effect of E2F1 on the expression of four members of the BH3-only family, namely PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5. Introduction of E2F1 into NIH3T3 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer resulted in a significant increase in the endogenous mRNA levels of all four BH3-only genes (Fig. 1A). Murine Bim has three isoforms, and all three are induced by E2F1 (Fig. 1A). To study the regulation of expression of BH3-only genes by endogenous E2F, we infected NIH3T3 cells with a retrovirus containing an inducible human papilloma virus HPV16 E7 (ER-E7) protein that disrupts RB/E2F complexes, thereby leading to the deregulation of E2F activity. Addition of the ligand OHT, which activates the ER-E7 fusion protein, led to a significant increase in endogenous mRNA levels of these four BH3-only genes (Fig. 1B). These data strongly suggest that deregulated endogenous E2F elevates the expression of endogenous PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5. The positive effect of E2F on the expression of representative BH3-only genes could also be confirmed at the level of the corresponding proteins (Fig. 1C). The fact that deregulation of endogenous E2F induces expression of PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5 (Fig. 1, B and C) suggests that these genes are physiological targets of E2F. In support of this notion, mRNA levels of all four genes increase as quiescent cells reenter S phase (Fig. 2). This growth-regulated expression of PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5 is similar to the previously demonstrated pattern of expression of many bona fide E2F target genes. To determine whether BH3-only proteins are direct targets of E2F, we infected NIH3T3 cells with a retrovirus expressing ER-E2F1 (21Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Induction of E2F1 by the addition of OHT to these cells led to an increase in mRNA levels of PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5 (Fig. 3). Importantly, the E2F1-induced increase in mRNA levels of these four BH3-only genes was detected also in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. These data indicate that de novo protein synthesis is not required for E2F1-induced up-regulation of these four genes, suggesting that they are direct targets of E2F. Interestingly, expression of these genes was induced with different kinetics; whereas the expression of PUMA and Bim was already maximal 4 h after the addition of OHT (Fig. 3A), the induction of Noxa and Hrk/DP5 was detectable only 8 h after induction (data not shown) and was maximal 16 h post induction (Fig. 3B). Sequence analysis of the promoters of the four BH3-only genes demonstrated that the murine Noxa, Bim, and PUMA promoters contain putative E2F binding sites at positions –109, –3, and –8, respectively (Fig. 5B, and data not shown). In some cases the promoters of these BH3-only genes have not been formally characterized, but the genomic sequences upstream to the transcription start sites of human Noxa and both human and murine Hrk/DP5 contain putative E2F binding sites. The human PUMA promoter does not contain any consensus E2F-binding sites; however, various promoters were shown to recruit E2F via a mechanism independent of the defined consensus site (22Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Responsiveness of the PUMA, Hrk/DP5, Noxa, and Bim promoters to E2F was studied using luciferase reporter plasmids that contain their promoters. The studied promoter fragments were the –428/+67 region of the human PUMA promoter (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol.

Co-transfection of either the PUMA-Luc reporter or the Hrk/DP5-Luc reporter together with an E2F1 expression vector into NIH3T3 cells resulted in E2F1-induced activation of 26- and 13.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The PUMA and Hrk/DP5 promoters were not activated by an E2F1 mutant, E2F1E132, which does not bind DNA, although E2F1E132 was expressed at levels similar to or higher than wild type E2F1 (Fig. 4, A and B). The Noxa and Bim promoters exhibited a qualitatively similar pattern of regulation; co-transfection of either the Noxa-Luc reporter or the Bim-Luc reporter together with an E2F1 expression vector into NIH3T3 cells resulted in a 4-fold E2F1-induced activation (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, the Noxa and the Bim promoters were not activated by E2F1E132 (Fig. 4, C and D). Expression of both PUMA and Noxa is regulated by p53 (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W.

E2F1 can up-regulate p53 levels and activity via direct activation of ARF transcription. NIH3T3 cells lack functional ARF (26Inoue K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); however, E2F1 may activate p53 via additional, ARF-independent mechanisms (14Berkovich E. Ginsberg D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of p53 in E2F1-induced up-regulation of PUMA and Noxa promoter activity was tested using mutant promoters lacking functional p53 binding sites. A truncated PUMA promoter lacking the p53-binding sites, which is not activated by p53 (Fig. 5A, and Ref. 16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), was activated by wild type E2F1 but not E2F1E132 (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a mutation in the p53-binding site, which abrogates activation by p53 (Fig. 5B and (17Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar)), did not inhibit activation of the Noxa promoter by wild type E2F1 (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that the activity of the promoters of both PUMA and Noxa can be up-regulated by E2F1 in a p53-independent manner. This also excludes indirect E2F-induced activation of PUMA and Noxa via the E2F-regulated p53 family member, p73, because regulation of PUMA and Noxa expression by p73 should most probably utilizes the same binding sites as p53. These data are in agreement with the demonstration that E2F1-induced up-regulation of PUMA and Noxa does not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 3). An involvement of p53 in the E2F1-induced increase of PUMA and Noxa was further excluded by the finding that ectopic expression of E2F1 in mouse primary fibroblasts derived from p53-null mice resulted in elevated levels of both PUMA and Noxa (Fig. 5E). Levels of Hrk/DP5 and Bim were also elevated by E2F1 in these cells (data not shown). In addition, activation of ER-E2F1 in the p53-deficient human SAOS-2 cells led to an increase in PUMA mRNA levels (Fig. 5F). Expression of Noxa could not be detected in these cells (data not shown). These data further indicate that regulation of PUMA and Noxa by E2F1 is p53-independent. To demonstrate the involvement of endogenous E2F1 in regulating the expression of these four BH3-only genes, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in growing NIH3T3 cells using an antibody directed against E2F1. The promoter fragments that were amplified are –250/+47 of PUMA, –311/–25 of Noxa, –219/+57 of Bim, and –356/+34 of Hrk/DP5. We observed a significant enrichment of all four promoters when using the anti-E2F1 antibody (Fig. 6). Such enrichment was not detected after amplification of an unrelated genomic DNA fragment (Fig. 6). These data demonstrate interaction of endogenous E2F1 with the promoters of these four BH3-only genes. Taken together with the ability of both ectopically expressed E2F1 and E7 to up-regulate these genes, these finding strongly suggest that endogenous E2F1 has a role in regulating the expression of PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5. To test whether induction of BH3-only proteins plays an important role in E2F1-induced apoptosis, we first studied the effect of reducing Noxa expression on E2F1-induced apoptosis. To that end, NIH3T3 cells expressing ER-E2F1 were infected with retroviruses expressing either Noxa-specific siRNA, irrelevant siRNA, or an empty retroviral vector. Expression of siRNA that inhibits Noxa expression, but not irrelevant siRNA, abolished E2F1-induced elevation of Noxa mRNA (Fig. 7A). Activation of E2F1 resulted in apoptotic cell death, as determined by the appearance of cells with Sub-G1 DNA content. Importantly, this E2F1-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by the Noxa-specific siRNA but not by irrelevant siRNA (Fig. 7, B and C). Next, we studied the effect of reducing PUMA expression on the survival and growth of cells overexpressing E2F1 by using a colony formation assay. To that end, SAOS2 cells expressing ER-E2F1 were infected with retroviruses expressing either PUMA-specific siRNA or irrelevant siRNA. Expression of siRNA that inhibits PUMA expression, but not irrelevant siRNA, abolished E2F1-induced elevation of PUMA mRNA (Fig. 8A). Activation of E2F1 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of colonies, most probably due to apoptosis. Inhibition of PUMA expression by the PUMA-specific siRNA led to a considerable increase in the number of colonies (Fig. 8B). These data indicate that E2F1-mediated up-regulation of Noxa and PUMA contribute to E2F1-induced apoptosis. Of note, SAOS2 cells, used for the PUMA siRNA experiments, do not contain a functional p53, and p53 levels were unaffected by the activation of E2F1 in the NIH3T3 cells used for the Noxa siRNA experiments (data not shown). To test whether E2F mediates the expression of any of the BH3-only genes in response to stimuli that ordinarily induce them, we analyzed the induction of PUMA after genotoxic stress. As can be seen in Fig. 9, levels of the PUMA protein are increased when mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from p53-deficient mice are treated with either cisplatin or doxorubicin. Importantly, infection of these p53–/– cells with a dominant negative mutant of the heterodimeric partner of E2F, DP1 (19Wu C.L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), inhibited this damage-induced elevation in the levels of PUMA (Fig. 9), implicating endogenous E2F in the regulation of PUMA expression in response to stress. Our data indicate that ectopic expression of E2F1 or deregulation of the RB/E2F pathway results in coordinated up-regulation of four members of the BH3-only family, namely PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5. Furthermore, we show that endogenous E2F1 binds to the promoters of these four BH3-only genes. Importantly, inhibition of expression of either Noxa or PUMA significantly diminished E2F1-induced apoptosis, supporting the conclusion that regulation of BH3-only protein expression by E2F1 contributes to its apoptotic function. We also show that in cells lacking E2F activity, because of the expression of a dominant negative mutant of DP1, the elevation of PUMA levels in response to DNA damage is abrogated, indicating that E2F mediates, at least in part, the regulation of PUMA expression in response to stress. Ectopic expression of each one of the four BH3-only genes studied here, PUMA, Noxa, Bim, and Hrk/DP5, can result in apoptosis (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol.

However, it is believed that the different proteins mediate death in response to distinct stimuli; levels of PUMA and Noxa increase in response to DNA damage, including that caused by γ-irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, and both genes are transcriptionally regulated by p53 (16Yu J.

Levels of Bim increase upon the withdrawal of cytokines or nerve growth factor in hematopoietic cells or neurons, respectively (28Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr.

In addition, Bim plays a role in apoptosis in response to Taxol or Ca2+ flux and is believed to be a critical physiological regulator of homeostasis in hematopoietic cells (30Bouillet P. Metcalf D.

Levels of Hrk/DP5 are high in embryonic neuronal tissues that undergo apoptosis (23Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, β-amyloid-induced apoptosis of cultured neurons was shown to be mediated by E2F1 (32Giovanni A. Keramaris E. Morris E.J. Hou S.T. O'Hare M. Dyson N. Robertson G.S. Slack R.S. Park D.S.

A recent screen using a DNA microarray demonstrates that ectopic expression of E2F1 elevates levels of Bad and Bid, two additional members of the BH3-only family that have not been shown previously to be transcriptionally regulated (33Stanelle J. Stiewe T. Theseling C.C. Peter M. Putzer B.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes is not the only effect of E2F on the Bcl-2 family, and it was shown to repress the expression of the anti-apoptotic member of the family, Mcl-1 (34Dong Y.B.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, E2F1 can also affect the expression of Bcl-2, but the exact nature of this effect is currently under debate and, although some studies indicate that E2F1 downregulates the expression of Bcl-2, others demonstrate that it up-regulates Bcl-2 levels (36Yang H.L.

Thus, the list of BH3-only genes that are regulated by E2F may still grow. Regardless of the final number of such genes, the coordinated E2F-induced elevation of several BH3-only proteins described here suggests a mechanism whereby increased E2F activity may sensitize cells to a variety of apoptosis-inducing stimuli. This could be one of the reasons for the increased sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Populations subjected to persistent levels of harvest lack juvenile trees less than 60 centimeters in diameter at breast height; only populations with a history of either light or recent exploitation contain large numbers of juvenile trees. A harvesting model confirms that intensive exploitation levels over the past century are such that juvenile recruitment is insufficient to maintain populations over the long term. Without management, intensively harvested populations will succumb to a process of senescence and demographic collapse, threatening this cornerstone of the Amazonian extractive economy."
https://openalex.org/W2014185712,"Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2, also known as CTGF) is a matricellular protein that appears to play an important role in hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-mediated fibrogenesis. After signal peptide cleavage, the full-length CCN2 molecule comprises four structural modules (CCN2<sub>1–4</sub>) and is susceptible to proteolysis by HSC yielding isoforms comprising essentially modules 3 and 4 (CCN2<sub>3–4</sub>) or module 4 alone (CCN2<sub>4</sub>). In this study we show that rat activated HSC are capable of adhesion to all three CCN2 isoforms via the binding of module 4 to integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, a process that is dependent on interactions between module 4 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). These findings are based on several lines of evidence. First, integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> was detected in HSC lysates by immunoprecipitation and Western blot, and CCN2<sub>4</sub>-mediated HSC adhesion was blocked by anti-integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> antibody. Second, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and solid phase binding assay, CCN2<sub>4</sub> bound directly to integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> in cell-free systems. Third, destruction or inhibition of synthesis of cell surface HSPGs with, respectively, heparinase or sodium chlorate abrogated HSC adhesion to CCN2<sub>4</sub>. Fourth, prior occupancy of heparin-binding sites on CCN2<sub>4</sub> with soluble heparin completely blocked HSC adhesion. These findings indicate that integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> functions as a co-receptor with HSPGs for CCN2<sub>4</sub>-mediated HSC adhesion. Furthermore, by peptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrated that the sequence IRTPKISKPIKFELSG within CCN2<sub>4</sub> is a unique binding domain for integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> that is sufficient to mediate integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>- and HSPG-dependent HSC adhesion. These findings offer the possibility of developing novel antifibrotic therapies that target the integrin-binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W2149307297,"Formation of nitric oxide-derived oxidants has been linked to development of atherosclerosis and associated thrombotic complications. Although systemic levels of protein nitrotyrosine predict risk for coronary artery disease, neither specific proteins targeted for modification nor functional consequences that might contribute to disease pathogenesis have been defined. Here we report a selective increase in circulating levels of nitrated fibrinogen in patients with coronary artery disease. Exposure of fibrinogen to nitrating oxidants, including those produced by the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-nitrite system, significantly accelerates clot formation and factor XIII cross-linking, whereas exposure of fibrinogen to non-nitrating oxidants decelerates clot formation. Clots formed with fibrinogen exposed to nitrating oxidants are composed of large bundles made from twisted thin fibrin fibers with increased permeation and a decrease in storage modulus G′ value, suggesting that these clots could be easily deformed by mechanical stresses. In contrast, clots formed with fibrinogen exposed to non-nitrating oxidants showed decreased permeation with normal architecture. Fibrinogen modified by exposure to physiologic nitration systems demonstrated no difference in the rate of plasmin-induced clot lysis, platelet aggregation, or binding. Thus, increased levels of fibrinogen nitration may lead to a pro-thrombotic state via acceleration in formation of fibrin clots.

Fibrinogen is a multifunctional protein essential for hemostasis. It is a 340-kDa glycoprotein, consisting of three non-identical peptide chains Aα, Bβ, and γ, which are linked together by 29 disulfide bonds (5Weisel J.W. Stauffacher C.V. Bullit E. Cohen C. Science. 1985; 230: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). During coagulation, the soluble fibrinogen is converted to insoluble fibrin polymers. The process is initiated by thrombin, a serine protease, which catalyzes the cleavage first of two fibrinopeptides from the amino termini of the Aα chains and then two fibrinopeptides from the amino termini Bβ chains. Upon release of the fibrinopeptides, the remaining fibrin monomers aggregate spontaneously to form ordered fibrin polymers (5Weisel J.W. Stauffacher C.V. Bullit E. Cohen C. Science. 1985; 230: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).

Ischiropoulos H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L961-L967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C while rotating. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose while rotating and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The beads were washed three times for 2 min each with freshly prepared lysis buffer containing the protease inhibitor mixture. The samples were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, and 30 μl of 2× sample buffer containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the pellet. The beads were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatant was then analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis. The proteins were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was blocked with dry milk solution and then incubated with rabbit anti-human fibrinogen-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). After antibody incubation, the blot was developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Purification of Fibrinogen from Human Subjects Plasma—An ImmunoPure Protein A IgG Orientation Kit (Pierce) was utilized to affinity-purify fibrinogen from coronary artery disease and age-matched control patient plasma. Briefly, rabbit anti-human fibrinogen antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) was bound to protein A and cross-linked with dimethylpimelimidate. For sample application, the patient plasma was diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and applied to the column. Unbound protein fractions were eluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Fractions of bound fibrinogen were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and collected in tubes containing 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All fractions were dried down to a small volume using a Savant Instrument SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant Instruments Inc., Holbrook, New York). Protein in the fractions was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. All fractions containing antigen or unbound protein were pooled together, respectively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Nitrotyrosine levels were determined by HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry using stable isotope dilution methodology and an ion trap mass spectrometer, as described previously (17Shishehbor M.H.

Nitration and Oxidation of Fibrinogen—Freeze-dried human fibrinogen (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT), which was free of plasminogen, factor XIII, and fibronectin, with coagulability greater than 95%, was solubilized in filtered de-ionized water. The fibrinogen solution was then eluted through a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Stock solutions of fibrinogen solutions were divided equally into two tubes, and an equal volume of buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.4) was added to each tube. Fibrinogen was exposed to 60 nm myeloperoxidase (MPO) plus 100 μm H2O2 in the absence or presence of 100 μm nitrite for 1 h. In the absence of nitrite and in physiological concentrations of chloride, MPO catalyzes the formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant and chlorinating agent. In the presence of nitrite in addition to HOCl, MPO also catalyzes the formation of nitrogen dioxide, an oxidant and nitrating agent (19Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C.

Fibrinogen was also exposed to 3-morpholinosydnonimine, HCl (SIN-1) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). SIN-1 is dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, and purged with nitrogen gas before and after each use. SIN-1 undergoes base hydrolysis to release nitric oxide and superoxide in solution (for 100 μm SIN-1 the rate is ∼1 μm per min), which they react with a rate constant of 1010m–1 s–1 to form peroxynitrite. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, which is approximately twice the half-life of SIN-1, and vortexed every 10 min to preserve the dissolved oxygen levels in the mixture. As a control, fibrinogen was exposed to SIN-1 in the presence of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) at 0.3 mg/ml to compete nitric oxide for superoxide. Under these conditions, fibrinogen is exposed to nitric oxide plus H2O2. After incubation with the different chemical systems, the samples were applied to a PD-10 desalting column and were eluted with TBS (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4). Following the different exposures, the nitration of fibrinogen was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies and by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry analysis (Table I), whereas oxidation was assessed by the formation of carbonyls (Table I) as described previously (22Shacter E. Williams J.A. Levine R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Western blotting confirmed that exposure to SIN-1 and MPO/H2O2/NO2- but not in the other controls results in nitration of tyrosine residue(s) in all three fibrinogen chains. The nitration of fibrinogen did not result in any significant change in fibrinogen structure as determined by the CD spectrum of the control and nitrated fibrinogen (data not shown). Under our experimental conditions, exposure of fibrinogen to either SIN-1 or MPO/H2O2/NO2- did not result in covalent protein cross-linking.Table IRate of clot formation of control fibrinogen and fibrinogens exposed to nitrating and oxidizing conditionsTreatment of fibrinogenV0 (s-1) × 10-4μmol nitrotyrosine/mol tyrosinemol of carbonyl/mol of fibrinogenMPO + H2O2/NO2-23.3 ± 1.9ap < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test.65 ± 80.71 ± 0.36ap < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test.MPO + H2O20.42 ± 0.10ap < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test.ND1.54 ± 0.45ap < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test.100 μm SIN-110.9 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test.46 ± 40.47 ± 0.07100 μm + SOD1.19 ± 0.59ND0.50 ± 0.1Control1.03 ± 0.42ND0.44 ± 0.08a p < 0.05 after ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc test. Open table in a new tab Thrombin-catalyzed Fibrin Clot Polymerization—Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 0.1 unit/ml of human thrombin (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) to fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) in TBS, pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm sodium chloride). Clot formation was monitored at 25 °C as the increase in absorbance at 350 nm over time using a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer. Clot formation in human plasma samples was initiated by simultaneous addition of CaCl2 (12 mm final concentration) and rabbit brain thromboplastin (Plastinex® from Bio/Data Co.). The concentration of thromboplastin in plasma was 1.4 mm relative to stock. Turbidity was measured in glass cells with a 1-mm optical path length. The formation of fibrinopeptides A and B after addition of thrombin was followed over time by HPLC separation and UV detection. factor XIII fibrinogen and fibrin cross-linking was performed as described previously (23Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Scanning Electron Microscopy—Fibrin clots made at room temperature using 0.1 unit/ml thrombin were processed for scanning electron microscopy as described previously (23Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All samples were prepared at least in duplicates, and for all clots at least three high resolution images from different regions were obtained. Permeation and Viscoelastic Measurements—The Darcy constant, which represents the surface of the gel allowing flow through a network, and thus provides information on the pore structure and fiber diameter, was calculated from the flow measurements, pressure, and geometric parameters of the clot as described in detail previously (24Ryan E.A. Mockros L.F. Weisel J.W. Lonard L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2813-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Viscoelastic measurements were performed in clots prepared between 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in a Plazek torsion pendulum described above for permeation studies (24Ryan E.A. Mockros L.F. Weisel J.W. Lonard L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2813-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Each clot was measured three times, and three clots were prepared for each sample on 2 different days. Lysis of Fibrin Clot—Clot lysis by 6 nm of recombinant tPA (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) was monitored as described (25Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The percent lysis was calculated after adjusting for value of the starting absorbance. The plasmin protection assay and the plasmin digestion of fibrin clots were performed as described previously (25Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 4721-4729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The previous published protocols for the preparation and lysis of 125I-fibrin microparticles was utilized as described in detail previously (27Murciano J.-C. Harshaw D. Neschis D.G. Koniaris L.

Platelet Aggregation and Adhesion—Aggregation of gel-filtered platelets was measured on a Dual Channel Aggregometer (Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA) in the presence of 150 μg/ml fibrinogen, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and different concentrations of ADP varying from 2 to 20 μm (34Belisario M.A. Di Domenico C. Pelagalli A. Della Morte R. Staiano N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For platelet adherence to control and nitrated fibrinogen Immulon 2HB microtiter plates were employed, and adherence was measured by the phosphatase assay (29Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) utilizing a universal microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Detection of Nitrated Fibrinogen in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease—Plasma of coronary artery disease patients was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. Probing the immunoprecipitated proteins with a polyclonal anti-fibrinogen antibody revealed that a fraction of fibrinogen was nitrated in coronary artery disease patient plasma (Fig. 1A). In order to confirm and quantify the presence of nitrated fibrinogen in coronary artery disease and age-matched control patient plasma, fibrinogen was purified using affinity chromatography in which the Fc portion of a polyclonal anti-fibrinogen antibody was coupled to protein A. The ability of the anti-fibrinogen column to capture nitrated fibrinogen was confirmed by using in vitro nitrated fibrinogen (not shown). The affinity column was efficient in capturing all the fibrinogen for the input plasma (Fig. 1A). The eluted fibrinogen was then hydrolyzed in order to quantify the protein 3-nitrotyrosine levels by HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry using stable isotope dilution methodology and an ion trap mass spectrometer (17Shishehbor M.H. Aviles R.J. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Goormastic M. Pearce P.L. Gokce N. Keaney J.F. Penn M.S. Sprecher D.L. Vita J. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med.

The values were normalized to the levels of tyrosine to avoid changes in fibrinogen levels among patients. A 30% increase (p < 0.001) in the levels of nitrated fibrinogen was found in coronary artery disease patients (n = 30) as compared with age-matched controls (n = 26) (Fig. 1C). Effect of Fibrinogen Nitration on Fibrin Clot Formation— The polymerization of fibrin catalyzed by thrombin monitored by changes in turbidity at 350 nm in human plasma after the addition of 12 mm calcium from coronary artery disease patients and controls is depicted in Fig. 2A. The thrombin-induced polymerization of fibrinogen recovered from patients with coronary artery disease showed a shorter lag phase, a rapid rise in the initial velocity, and increased final turbidity as compared with fibrinogen recovered from plasma of controls. The changes in fibrinogen polymerization were not due to fibrinogen concentration in plasma since the mole content of tyrosine in the purified fibrinogen for these samples was 33.6, 25.4, and 24.3 for the coronary disease patients samples (curves 1–3 in Fig. 2A) and 35.7 and 35.1 (curves 4 and 5, respectively) for the control plasma. However, the nitrotyrosine content in these samples (expressed as μmol of 3-nitrotyrosine/mol tyrosine) varied: 67, 38.4, and 52 for the coronary artery disease patients and 25.2 and 25.4, for the controls, respectively. To investigate the potential effect of fibrinogen nitration on turbidity changes and other properties of the protein, nitrated and oxidized fibrinogens were prepared by chemical treatments described in detail under “Materials and Methods.” The yield of nitration after exposure to either 60 nm MPO plus 100 μm H2O2 and 100 μm NO2- or 100 μm SIN-1, was 65 ± 8 and 46 ± 4 μmol 3-nitrotyrosine/mol tyrosine (n = 3–5), respectively, as assessed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry (17Shishehbor M.H. Aviles R.J. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Goormastic M. Pearce P.L. Gokce N. Keaney J.F. Penn M.S. Sprecher D.L. Vita J. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med.

These values were in close proximity to more than half of the coronary disease patient values that exceeded the mean value of 38 ± 14 μmol of 3-nitrotyrosine/mol tyrosine. Data in Fig. 2B reveal that the polymerization of fibrin catalyzed by thrombin monitored by changes in turbidity at 350 nm show a rapid rise in the sample of fibrinogen treated with MPO/H2O2/NO2- as compared with the protein oxidized by MPO and H2O2. The same increase in turbidity was also observed with fibrinogen exposed to nitration conditions using SIN-1 in the presence of CO2 as compared with control or fibrinogen exposed to SIN-1 in the presence of superoxide dismutase (Fig. 2C). In these experiments similar to the observations in coronary artery disease plasma, the lag phase in fibrin polymerization decreased, the maximum rate of turbidity for the first 500 s after the lag phase increased (Table I), and the final turbidity was greater than in the control curves, suggesting alterations of clot structure. Moreover, the maximum rate of turbidity for the first 500 s after the lag phase corrected for the final turbidity increased as a function of the magnitude of fibrinogen nitration (inset, Fig. 2B). The increase in the maximum rate of turbidity of fibrinogen exposed to nitration conditions was sustained even in the presence of oxidized fibrinogen. Fibrinogen that was exposed first to SIN-1 and further oxidized by addition of 100 μm HOCl or fibrinogen that was exposed first to 100 μm HOCl and then to SIN-1 showed the same increase in maximum rate of turbidity as fibrinogen exposed only to SIN-1 (Fig. 3D). In contrast fibrinogen exposed to either MPO plus H2O2 or nitric oxide plus H2O2 or reagent HOCl failed to show increases in the maximum rate of turbidity (Fig. 2). The significant increase in the maximum rate of turbidity was not due to acceleration in thrombin cleavage, since quantification of fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B released by thrombin proteolysis was the same between control and nitrated fibrinogen (Fig. 3). Factor XIII Cross-linking—Fibrinogen cross-linking factor XIII cross-links both fibrinogen and fibrin. Fibrinogen cross-linking by factor XIII is not different between control and nitrated fibrinogen (not shown). However, factor XIII cross-linking of fibrin was accelerated in the nitrated fibrinogen than in control as evident by the disappearance of the Aα and γ chains of fibrinogen (Fig. 4). Effect of Nitration on Fibrin Clot Architecture, Permeation, and Viscoelastic Properties—The architecture of the fibrin clots formed by control, nitrated, and oxidized fibrinogens was examined by scanning electron microscopy as described previously (23Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Fibrin clots formed by fibrinogens exposed to nitrating agents are strikingly different from control or oxidized fibrinogens under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 5). The clots made from fibrinogens exposed to either MPO/H2O2/NO2- or SIN-1 are made up of thinner fibers, even though the higher turbidity suggested that the fibers would be thicker. However, the fibrin clot made by nitrated fibrinogens is composed of large bundles of the thin fibrin fibers, which scatter light like thick fibers, accounting for the greater turbidity. Higher magnification images also reveal the existence of twisted fibers in nitrated fibrin. A number of large pores are evident in fibrin clots made of nitrated fibrinogens in contrast to the more dense and uniform fibrin network of the oxidized fibrinogen (Fig. 5). These changes in the architecture of the fibrin clots would be expected to have certain consequences on the physical properties of the clot. Therefore, quantitative changes in the permeation coefficient or Darcy constant were determined by flow measurements made under a constant pressure applied and accounting for geometric parameters of the clot (24Ryan E.A. Mockros L.F. Weisel J.W. Lonard L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2813-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The permeation coefficient of clots made from fibrinogens exposed to either MPO/H2O2/NO2- or SIN-1 was significantly higher than the control (Table II). This increase in permeation is accounted for by the presence of large pores, as seen by scanning electron microscopy. A dec"

In animal studies, we have reported that shock waves (SW) can promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through superoxide-mediated signal transduction (Wang, F. S., Wang, C.

Here, we found that SW elevation of VEGF-A expression in human osteoblasts to be mediated by Ras-induced superoxide and ERK-dependent HIF-1α activation. SW treatment (0.16 mJ/mm2, 1 Hz, 500 impulses) rapidly activated Ras protein (15 min) and Rac1 protein (30 min) and increased superoxide production in 30 min and VEGF mRNA expression in 6 h. Early scavenging of superoxide, but not nitric oxide, peroxide hydrogen, or prostaglandin E2, reduced SW-augmented VEGF-A levels. Inhibition of superoxide production by diphenyliodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, was found to suppress VEGF-A expression. Transfection of osteoblasts with a dominant negative (S17N) Ras mutant abrogated the SW enhancement of Rac1 activation, superoxide synthesis, and VEGF expression. Further studies demonstrated that SW significantly promoted ERK activation in 1 h and HIF-1α phosphorylation and HIF-1α binding to VEGF promoter in 3 h. In support of the observation that superoxide mediated the SW-induced ERK activation and HIF-1α transactivation, we further demonstrated that scavenging of superoxide by superoxide dismutase and inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 decreased HIF-1α activation and VEGF-A levels. Moreover, culture medium harvested from SW-treated osteoblasts increased vessel number of chick chorioallantoic membrane. Superoxide dismutase pretreatment and anti-VEGF-A antibody neutralization reduced the promoting effect of conditioned medium on angiogenesis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SW can stimulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoprogenitors, which has been associated with increases in osteogenic factor expression (15Rivilis I.

Moreover, several cell types have been reported to respond to mechanical stimulation by elevating VEGF mediation of angiogenic responses (15Rivilis I. Milkiewicz M. Boyd P. Goldstein J.

In animal studies, we have also demonstrated that SW treatment can induce neovascularization of tendon-bone junction and may be associated with increases in VEGF-A expression (17Wang C.J. Wang F.S. Yang K.D. Huang C.S. Hsu C.C. Yang L.C. J. Orthop. Res. 2003; 21: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which SW promotes angiogenesis has remained undetermined. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, acts as a critical regulator of VEGF expression. Active HIF-1 has been found to accumulate in the cell nucleus, bind to the target DNA sequence, and enhance hypoxia-inducible gene transcription (18Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Evidence has suggested that reactive oxygen radicals mediate hypoxia, arsenite, and vanadate activation of HIF-1-dependent VEGF expression (19Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M.

One of our recent studies has shown that superoxide mediated SW-promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteogenic lineage (21Wang F.S.

This finding implies that induction of reactive oxygen molecules by SW potentially may provoke intracellular signaling transduction, which in turn may activate angiogenic activity of bone cells. We hypothesize that SW induce the reactive oxygen radical as a mediator in the activation of intracellular signal transduction and angiogenic transcription. The purposes of this study were to examine the effect of SW on the angiogenic response of human osteoblasts and to investigate whether SW promotion of angiogenic activity can be linked to the induction of reactive oxygen radicals, the activation of HIF-1α, and the promotion of VEGF-A production. Cell Culture—Human fetal preosteoblastic cells (CRL-11372, American Type Culture Center, Manassas, VA) were maintained in a mixture of phenol red-free Ham’s F12 medium and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.5 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2, 34 °C incubator for 6 days. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in medium for further studies. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Shock Wave Treatment—Cells (1 × 106 cells/dish, 35-mm Petri dishes) were cultured for 48 h and subjected to SW treatment using OssaTron® SW equipment (HMT High Medical Technologies, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland) as described previously (14Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.C. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture dishes were floated in a thermostastically controlled water bath. A sterile SW probe was immersed vertically into each culture dish and placed to just touch the surface of the medium. The distance between the probe and the cells was ∼5–6 mm. Cells were exposed to a single SW treatment at 0.16 mJ/mm2 energy flux density, 1 Hz, 500 impulse. This SW energy enhances osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (14Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.C. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Control samples were prepared in the same manner except that they were not exposed to SW. Cells were harvested at 15 min, 30 min and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after SW treatment for RT-PCT and immunoblotting. To verify whether SW-augmented VEGF expression was regulated by osteogenic factors, SW-treated osteoblasts were co-cultured with or without 10 ng/ml monoclonal antibodies against BMP-2, TGF-β1, and IGF-I (R&D Systems) for 24 h, respectively. To investigate the role of bioactive radical in SW promotion of VEGF expression, subconfluent cell cultures were pretreated with or without 500 units/ml polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coupled bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and PEG-catalase (Sigma) to scavenge superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. To determine whether prostaglandin E2 was involved in the SW-enhanced VEGF expression, cells were pretreated with or without 10 μm indomethacin to suppress PGE2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 activity. To elucidate the role of nitric oxide in the SW-promoted VEGF expression, osteoblasts were pretreated with or without 100 μm N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, Sigma) to inhibit nitric oxide production. To differentiate which oxidase was responsible for SW-induced superoxide production, osteoblasts were pretreated with 30 μm DPI (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor), 50 μm allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or 50 μm rotenone (a mitochondrial oxidase inhibitor; Sigma). In some experiments, subconfluent cell cultures were pretreated with 20 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem) to inhibit ERK activity for 4 h before SW treatment. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted and purified from 106 cells with and without SW treatment using Tri-reagent (Sigma). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA followed by PCR amplification using human gene-specific primers: VEGF-A, forward, 5′-TTA TAC CGG GAT TTC TTG CG-3′), and reverse, 5′-CCC ACT GAG GAG TCC AAC AT-3′ (209 base pair expected); β-actin, forward, 5′-CGC CAA CCG CGA GAA GAT-3′, β-actin reverse, 5′-CGT CAC CGG AGT CCA TCA-3′) (168 base pair expected). The parameters for RT-PCR cycling were set as described previously (14Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.C. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All signals were quantified by scan densitometry, and the final value was obtained by calculating the VEGF-A/β-actin ration value. The -fold of promotion was calculated as the increase over the value of its corresponding control sample. Determination of Superoxide Production—Superoxide production by cell cultures with or without SW was determined using a horse heart cytochrome c reduction assay in the absence and presence of SOD and calculated from the molar extinction coefficient of 0.0282 μm–1 cm–1 as described previously (21Wang F.S.

Measurement of VEGF-A Production in the Culture Supernatants— The VEGF-A levels of culture supernatant were determined using ELISA kits (Quantikine®, R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Results were calculated using an interpolation determined from a standard curve made by a series of VEGF-A concentrations. Transient Transfection of a Dominant Negative Ras Plasmid— cDNAs encoding wild type and mutant (S17N) H-Ras proteins (DN-Ras) were ligated and cloned into pUSE vectors (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Stable transfection and selection were accomplished according to previously described methods (22Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoblasts (5 × 105 cells/well, 6-well plate) were plated to reach 60–80% confluence. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of wild type Ras and DN-Ras mutant cDNA plasmid (14Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.C. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells stably transfected with the plasmid were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts of cell cultures were prepared as described previously (21Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Sheen-Chen S.M. Kuo Y.R. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10931-10937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosolic extracts were harvested by lysing cells with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.7% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and then supernatants were harvested. Pellets were further lysed with buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 350 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were harvested after centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations in cytosolic and nuclear extracts were determined using a Bio-Rad assay kit. Measurement of Ras and Rac1 Activation by Raf-1 and PAK-1 Agarose Conjugate—Ras and Rac1 activation were determined using Ras and Rac1 activation assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, cell lysates were precleared with glutathione-agarose followed by incubation with specific Raf-1 Ras binding domain and PAK-1 p21 binding domain agarose conjugates, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were reacted with Laemmli buffer containing 200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue for 5 min at 95 °C. The mixtures were subject to Western blot assay. Activated Ras and Rac1 proteins on the blot were recognized by a mouse anti-Ras and anti-Rac1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as the second antibody. The activated Ras protein and Rac1 levels were visualized using chemiluminescence agents (SuperSignal®, Pierce) (14Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.C. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Determination of ERK, p38, and HIF-1α Phosphorylation—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts (500 μg) were reacted with anti-ERK, anti-p38 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), and HIF-1α antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were precipitated with protein A (Sigma), respectively. Immunoprecipitates (20 μg) were subjected to Western blot assay (21Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Sheen-Chen S.M. Kuo Y.R. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10931-10937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Total ERK, p38, and HIF-1α on the blots were recognized by anti-ERK, anti-p38, and HIF-1α antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as the second antibody and were visualized with chemiluminescence agents. The phosphorylated ERK, p38, and HIF-1α were recognized by stripping the membrane in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mm mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and then reprobed with mouse anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), respectively, using a similar procedure. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A HIF-1 consensus VEGF-A promoter (underlined) oligonucleotides probe (5′-CCA CAG CAT ACG TGG GCT CCA ACA-3′, 3′-GGT GTC GTA TGC ACC CGA GGT TGT-5′) was 5′ end-labeled with γ-32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with a binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 1.75 pmol of γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (30000–40000 cpm; 2 μl). To specify protein/DNA binding reactions, 1 μl of anti-HIF-1α antibodies was added to binding buffer, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and mixed with γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Samples were electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). The gel was dried and the radioactive band visualized using Kodak Bio-Max film with an intensifying screen at –70 °C. In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay—Concentrated culture supernatants were harvested by lyophilizing 1 ml of culture supernatants of osteoblasts with and without SW treatment in the presence or absence of 500 units/ml PEG-SOD and then resuspending them in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. VEGF-A concentrations in the mixtures were determined using a VEGF-A ELISA kit. To confirm whether VEGF-A was involved in angiogenesis, culture supernatants were neutralized with 50 ng/ml monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibodies (R&D Systems). Concentrated culture supernatants were subjected to assessment of angiogenesis using a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay as described previously (23Bellahcene A. Bonjean K. Fohr B. Fedarko N.S. Robey F.A. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, fertile White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 37 °C and 70% relative humidity. On the third day of incubation, the eggs were windowed by gentle sanding to expose an opening on the CAM. The openings were sealed with UV-sterilized adhesive tape, and the eggs were further incubated until day 5. On day 5, silastic rings were placed on the CAM surface. Concentrated culture supernatants were applied inside the rings. The eggs were resealed and incubated for 5 days. CAMs were examined and photographed with a Nikon color camera under microsurgery microscope. A vascular index was determined by counting all discernible vessels traveling the ring and was expressed as the relative increase of the number of vessels under different conditions in comparison with the control (23Bellahcene A. Bonjean K. Fohr B. Fedarko N.S. Robey F.A. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student’s paired t test was used to evaluate the difference between the sample of interest and its respective control. For analysis of the time course, a multiple range of analysis of variance was used. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. SW Treatment Raised VEGF-A Expression—We first determined whether SW augmented VEGF-A gene expression in osteoblasts. Cell cultures were treated with SW at 0.16 mJ/mm2 energy flux density, 1 Hz, 500 impulses. There was no significant difference in cell viability between SW and control groups (data not shown). RT-PCR results indicated that VEGF-A mRNA expression significantly increased in 6 h, peaking at 12 h (Fig. 1A). ELISA results also showed that osteoblasts subjected to SW treatment significantly increased VEGF-A production in 12 h (Fig. 1B). SW Promotion of VEGF-A Expression Mediated by Superoxide but Not by Osteogenic Factors or Nitric Oxide, Hydrogen Peroxide, or Prostaglandin E2—Previous studies have demonstrated that osteogenic factors can regulate VEGF expression of osteoblasts (24Goad D.L. Rubin J. Wang H. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Patterson C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Deckers M.M.L. van Bezooijen R.L. van der Horst G.

Acta. 2000; 1497: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) We sought to elucidate whether osteogenic factors were involved in SW-augmented VEGF expression, SW-treated osteoblasts were co-cultured with BMP-2, TGF-β1, and IGF-I monoclonal antibodies for 24 h, respectively. BMP-2, TGF-β1, IGF-I neutralization did not significantly alter SW-enhanced VEGF-A mRNA expression (Fig. 2A) or VEGF-A production (Fig. 2B). The accumulated evidence suggests that cells responded to SW by altering biological activities through influx of bioactive molecules such as oxygen radicals or PGE2 (21Wang F.S. Wang C.J.

Schmitz C. Clin. Orthop. 2003; 406: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We investigated which reactive radical might be responsible for mediating SW increase in VEGF-A expression. Scavenging of hydrogen peroxide by 500 units/ml PEG catalase did not influence SW-promoted VEGF-A expression. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity by 10 μm indomethacin and nitric oxide synthase activity by 100 μml-NAME did not affect SW-promoted VEGF-A mRNA expression (Fig. 2C) or VEGF-A production (Fig. 2D). Nevertheless, PEG-SOD pretreatment (500 units/ml) significantly reduced SW enhancement of VEGF-A expression (Fig. 2C) and VEGF production (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that superoxide, but not nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, or prostaglandin E2, was involved in the SW promotion of VEGF-A expression. DPI Pretreatment Reduced SW-induced Superoxide and VEGF-A Expression—Osteoblasts with SW treatment significantly increased superoxide production in 30 min. This higher production of superoxide persisted for 24 h (Fig. 3A). We determined whether SW promotion of superoxide production was linked to mitochondrial oxidase, xanthine oxidase, or NADPH oxidase. Pretreatment with DPI (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor), but not with other oxidase inhibitors, significantly reduced SW-promoted superoxide production (Fig. 3B), VEGF-A mRNA expression (Fig. 3C), and VEGF-A production (Fig 3D). This suggests that NADPH oxidase was responsible for SW-augmented superoxide production. Ras Regulated SW-promoted Rac1 Activation, Superoxide Production, and VEGF-A Expression—There has been some evidence that Ras and Rac1 proteins are involved in NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide synthesis (28Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 29Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L.

We sought to examine whether SW-induced superoxide production could be associated with Ras or Rac1 activation. SW rapidly activated Ras protein in 15 min and Rac1 protein in 30 min (Fig. 4A), respectively. To verify whether SW promotion of superoxide production and VEGF-A expression was regulated by Ras protein, we subjected wild type Ras- and dominant negative Ras-transfected osteoblasts to SW treatment. Transfection of the mutant-Ras completely reduced SW-induced Ras and Rac1 activation (Fig. 4B). Superoxide synthesis (Fig. 4C) and VEGF-A mRNA expression (Fig. 4D) were also significantly suppressed in the mutant Ras-transfected cells. SW promoted Phosphorylation of ERK and HIF-1α—Experiments were done to elucidate whether SW-increased VEGF-A expression was linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase and angiogenic transcription. Immunoblotting indicated that SW increased ERK activation in 1 h as demonstrated by phosphorylated ERK expression (Fig. 5A). SW did not affect p38 phosphorylation throughout the study period (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, SW increased nuclear HIF-1α phosphorylation, as demonstrated by phosphotyrosine expression of HIF-1α, in 3 h (Fig. 6A) and promoted HIF-1 binding to VEGF-A promoter, as determined by electrophoretic gel shift (Fig. 6B). We employed monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α to confirm the DNA-protein binding activity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay radiograph showed that nuclear extract harvested from SW-treated osteoblasts was indeed super-shifted by anti-HIF-1α antibodies (Fig. 6C). These findings indicate that SW activates HIF-1α binding to the VEGF promoter.Fig. 6SW-induced HIF-1α activation. A, SW activated nuclear HIF-1α phosphorylation in 3 h. Nuclear HIF-1α immunoprecipitates isolated from nuclear extracts of osteoblasts with and without SW treatment were subjected to immunoblotting. Phosphorylated HIF-1α was probed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. B, SW promoted binding activity of HIF-1α with VEGF-A promoter in 3 h as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Unfortunately, the implementation of random unitary operators on a quantum processor is exponentially hard. Here we introduce a method for generating pseudo-random unitary operators that can reproduce those statistical properties of random unitary operators most relevant to quantum information tasks. This method requires exponentially fewer resources, and hence enables the practical application of random unitary operators in quantum communication and information processing protocols. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor, we were able to realize pseudorandom unitary operators that reproduce the expected random distribution of matrix elements."
https://openalex.org/W2052390133,"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor for bile acids. Ligand activated-FXR regulates transcription of genes to allow feedback control of bile acid synthesis and secretion. There are five major bile acids in humans. We have previously demonstrated that lithocholate acts as an FXR antagonist, and here we show that the other four bile acids, chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), deoxycholate (DCA), cholate (CA), and ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), act as selective FXR agonists in a gene-specific fashion. In an in vitro coactivator association assay, CDCA fully activated FXR, whereas CA partially activated FXR and DCA and UDCA had negligible activities. Similar results were also obtained from a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay in which only CDCA and the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 significantly increased the interaction of SRC-1 with FXR. In FXR transactivation assays with a bile salt export pump (BSEP) promoter-driven luciferase construct, bile acids showed distinct abilities to activate the BSEP promoter: CDCA, DCA, CA, and UDCA increased luciferase activity by 25-, 20-, 18-, and 8-fold, respectively. Consistently, CDCA increased BSEP mRNA by 750-fold in HepG2 cells, whereas DCA, CA, and UDCA induced BSEP mRNA by 250-, 75-, and 15-fold, respectively. Despite the partial induction of BSEP mRNA, CA, DCA, and UDCA effectively repressed expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, another FXR target. We further showed that all four bile acids significantly increased FXR protein, suggesting the existence of an auto-regulatory loop in FXR signaling pathways. In conclusion, these results suggest that the binding of each bile acid results in a different FXR conformations, which in turn differentially regulates expression of individual FXR targets.

Bile acids such as CDCA, DCA, and CA have been previously shown to be FXR agonists that regulate expression of FXR targets (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V.

In this study, we systematically characterized the FXR agonist activities of these bile acids using a series of cell-free and cell-based assays including coactivator recruitment, GST pull-down assay, FXR transactivation, and quantitative real-time PCR for examining the expression of FXR targets. Our results indicate that CDCA is a full FXR agonist that effectively regulates expression of FXR targets, whereas DCA, CA, and UDCA are partial agonists in FXR transactivation assays and regulate expression of FXR targets in a gene-selective fashion. These three bile acids partially induced BSEP mRNA but effectively repressed Cyp7a and strongly increased FXR protein expression. This study shows for the first time that distinct bile acids have unique properties as FXR agonists and reveals an auto-regulatory loop in FXR signaling pathways. Reagents—The following reagents were obtained from Invitrogen: DMEM and Opti-MEM I; regular fetal bovine serum (FBS) and charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS); and TRIzol reagents. l-[35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences.

FXR Coactivator Association Assays—Human GST-FXR-ligand binding domain fusion protein was prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence based FXR and coactivator SRC-1 interaction assay was used to examine the interaction of FXR-ligand binding domain with various ligands according to those described previously for other nuclear receptors (21Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol.

Plates were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with shaking. Radioactivity was quantified in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. GST Pull-down Assay—The GST-SRC-1-(568–780) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described previously (21Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y.

Approximately, 2 μg of GST-SRC-1 protein on beads was incubated with 2 μl of 35S-labeled full-length human FXR (19Cui J. Huang L. Zhao A. Lew J.L. Yu J. Sahoo S. Meinke P.T. Royo I. Pelaez F.

The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation in a total volume of 116 μl(8mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.12 m KCl, 8% glycerol, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 4 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 2 mm DTT) prior to electrophoresis on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualization by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis for Expression of FXR Protein—Treatment of HepG2 cells with various FXR agonists and extraction of total nuclear proteins from treated cells were performed as described previously (19Cui J. Huang L. Zhao A. Lew J.L. Yu J. Sahoo S. Meinke P.T. Royo I. Pelaez F. Wright S.D. J. Biol.

Western blotting was carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences) using polyclonal rabbit anti-human FXR antibody (catalog number H-130, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescence kit used for detection were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. FXR Transactivation—HepG2 cells were transfected in 96-well plates using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described previously (22Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Li Y. Schaeffer J.M.

FXR transactivation assay using pGL3-enhancer-human BSEP-promoter-Luc construct was performed as described previously (19Cui J. Huang L. Zhao A. Lew J.L. Yu J. Sahoo S. Meinke P.T. Royo I. Pelaez F.

Treatment of transfected cells with various FXR ligands, assays for luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were also performed as described previously (22Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L.

This assay was carried out at Merck Sharp and Dohme de España in Spain. Treatment of HepG2 Cells for Gene Expression—HepG2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and 5 mm HEPES. 24 h after seeding, cells were treated with various concentrations of compounds for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and 5 mm HEPES. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription and TaqMan-PCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of carboxyfluorescein (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all of the samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S RNA. Levels of human BSEP and Cyp7a mRNA were expressed as fold difference of compound-treated cells against Me2SO-treated cells. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for human BSEP and Cyp7a were described previously (6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Bile Acids in FXR Coactivator Association Assays—An homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based FXR coactivator association assay was used to assess agonist/antagonist activities of bile acids on FXR in a cell-free system. This assay measures ligand-dependent association of FXR with the coactivator SRC-1. We have previously shown that CDCA is an FXR agonist, whereas LCA is an antagonist in this assay (6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we determined the activities of other bile acids including CA, DCA, and UDCA on FXR. Consistent with our previous results, CDCA robustly activated FXR with a half-maximal activation (EC50) at 2–5 μm. However, CA showed partial activation with a maximal stimulation that was 40% of that induced by CDCA, and DCA and UDCA were virtually inactive up to 200 μm in this assay (Fig. 1A). Tauro- or glyco-conjugated CDCA or CA was similar to their unconjugated homologues but with slightly higher EC50 values (Fig. 1B). Similar to the unconjugated molecule, tauro- or glyco-conjugated DCA or UDCA had no activity in these assays (data not shown). These results indicate that each bile acid results in a different maximal recruitment of SRC-1 by FXR. The binding affinity of the same panel of bile acids was determined by a FXR scintillation proximity binding assay. As shown in Table I, LCA had the highest binding affinity on FXR with an IC50 of 3 μm. CDCA bound to FXR with an IC50 of 17 μm, whereas DCA and UDCA had an IC50 of 131 and 185 μm, respectively. CA was the weakest binder among the five bile acids with an IC50 of 586 μm. The conjugated CA and CDCA had a similar IC50 to the cognate unconjugated bile acid. These data suggest that lack of the agonist activity for DCA and UDCA in the FXR coactivator association assay was not due to lack of the binding of FXR because CA, a much weaker binder, was able to activate FXR.Table IBinding affinity of bile acids on human FXRBile acidIC50μmCDCA17 ± 3DCA131 ± 8CA586 ± 64UDCA185 ± 26LCA3 ± 0.5Glyco CDCA32 ± 4Tauro CDCA19 ± 0Glyco CA800 ± 0Tauro CA733 ± 0 Open table in a new tab CDCA, but Not Other Bile Acids, Promotes the Interaction of FXR and SRC-1 in a GST Pull-down Assay—To confirm the results that unique bile acids can result in different levels of recruitment of SRC-1 by FXR, these bile acids were also evaluated in a GST pull-down assay. Similar to the FXR coactivator association assay, the GST pull-down assay measures interaction of SRC-1 with the ligand-bound FXR in a cell-free environment. Consistent with the results in FXR coactivator association assay, CDCA promoted the interaction of SRC-1 with FXR in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼1–2 μm and a saturation concentration between 8 and 16 μm determined by densitometry (Fig. 2A). However, DCA, CA, UDCA, or LCA at 32 μm were inactive in this assay (Fig. 2B). GW4064, a synthetic FXR agonist, also promoted the interaction of SRC-1 with FXR. At 50 nm, GW4064 showed a comparable level of activity with that of 32 μm CDCA (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate again that distinct FXR ligands can differentially promote FXR-coactivator interaction. Bile Acids in FXR Transactivation with the BSEP Promoter—BSEP, the major bile acid transporter in the liver, is transcriptionally activated by FXR through an FXR-responsive element in the BSEP promoter (5Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The activity of each bile acid was also compared in FXR transactivation assays using a BSEP promoter-driven luciferase construct. CDCA increased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum induction of 25–30-fold (Fig. 3A). In the same experiment, DCA, CA, and UDCA maximally increased luciferase activity by 20-, 15-, and 8-fold, respectively, ∼80, 60, and 30%, respectively, of the CDCA activity (Fig. 3, B–D). DCA, CA, and UDCA also had a higher EC50 than that of CDCA (Fig. 3, A–D). Thus, DCA, CA, and UDCA act as partial agonists of FXR when compared with CDCA. Bile Acids in Expression of Endogenous BSEP—It was previously reported that FXR agonists strongly induced BSEP expression in HepG2 cells (6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this study, these bile acids were also evaluated for their ability to regulate BSEP expression to quantify their agonist activities on FXR relative to CDCA, which we operationally define as a full agonist. HepG2 cells were treated with each of CDCA, CA, DCA, or UDCA, and BSEP mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR (TaqMan). Consistent with our previous report (6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), CDCA strongly induced BSEP expression up to 750-fold with an EC50 of 25–50 μm (Fig. 4A), whereas DCA showed a partial induction up to 250-fold with an EC50 of 50–75 μm (Fig. 4B). CA treatment resulted in a much lower induction up to 75-fold at 600 μm (Fig. 4C), and UDCA had the weakest induction of only 15-fold (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that various bile acids display different abilities in induction of BSEP expression. Bile Acids in Repression of Cyp7a Expression—It has been well established that FXR agonists repress Cyp7a mRNA. This repression is believed to be mediated primarily by the orphan nuclear receptors SHP and Cyp7a promoter binding factor (14Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 15Lu T.T.

Thus, we evaluated the same panel of bile acids for repression of Cyp7a mRNA to further assess relative activities on another FXR target. Consistent with the result in BSEP expression, again, CDCA was the most potent bile acid in decreasing Cyp7a expression with an EC50 of around 10 μm (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, DCA, CA, and UDCA also effectively repressed Cyp7a expression but with higher EC50 values (Fig. 5, B–D). In particular, UDCA, which was a very weak FXR agonist in other assays, decreased Cyp7a mRNA by 80% at 400 μm (Fig. 5D). Bile Acids Significantly Increase FXR Protein Expression— Bile acids increased FXR expression in rabbits (23Xu G. Pan L.X. Li H. Forman B.M. Erickson S.K. Shefer S. Bollineni J. Batta A.K. Christie J. Wang T.H. Michel J. Yang S. Tsai R. Lai L. Shimada K. Tint G.S. Salen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50491-50496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We investigated whether these bile acids and the FXR synthetic agonist GW4064 could increase FXR protein expression in HepG2 cells. Our results indicate that CDCA induced FXR protein expression in a time-dependent manner, and this induction reached maximum at 24 h (Fig. 6A). In addition to CDCA, the other three bile acids, DCA, CA, and UDCA, also significantly increased FXR protein levels (Fig. 6B). Again, CDCA was the most potent inducer of FXR protein expression (Fig. 6B). Similar to the results in down-regulation of Cyp7a mRNA, both DCA and UDCA showed a significant induction of FXR protein expression (Fig. 6B). The synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 also effectively increased FXR protein (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that both endogenous and synthetic FXR agonists can effectively increase FXR protein expression and that the extent of induction was similar for full, high partial, and low partial agonists of FXR. The efficient induction of FXR by various FXR agonists suggests that this auto-regulatory loop may play an important role in FXR-mediated gene regulation. We previously demonstrated that LCA was an FXR antagonist that decreased the FXR agonist-induced BSEP transcription (6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this study, we systematically characterized the other four bile acids in FXR function using a series of cell-free and cell-based assays. We showed here that CDCA was the most potent FXR agonist in cell-free assays and effectively regulated expression of BSEP and Cyp7a and also strongly increased FXR protein expression in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, we observed that DCA, CA, and UDCA were partial FXR agonists in FXR transactivation assays yet regulated FXR targets in a gene-selective fashion. The three bile acids partially increased BSEP expression but they repressed Cyp7a mRNA and increased FXR protein expression with nearly equal effects as CDCA. BSEP is a major hepatic bile acid transporter whose deficiency in humans results in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, a severe liver disease that impairs bile flow and causes irreversible liver damage (24Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisely A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M. Thompson R.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). BSEP is a direct FXR target, and FXR agonists strongly induce BSEP mRNA in both primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells (5Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 6Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J.

The efficacy and potency of bile acids in FXR transactivation assays correlate well with that in BSEP expression (Figs. 3 and 4). Cyp7a catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. It is well established that bile acid feedback inhibits Cyp7a production. Three pathways have been postulated to be responsible for this feedback repression. The first pathway, probably the predominant one, involves FXR up-regulation of SHP that in turn suppresses the activity of Cyp7a promoter binding factor, a critical positive regulator of Cyp7a (13Chiang J.Y.

Lee Y.K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev.

However, the bile acid-mediated Cyp7a repression was not completely abolished in SHP knock-out mice (27Wang L. Lee Y.K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A.

The other two most plausible pathways are 1) the xenobiotic receptor (pregnane X receptor) as the second bile acid receptor that can repress Cyp7a expression (29Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, although it is likely that the discordance between bile acid activities in FXR transactivation and in Cyp7a expression is the result of promoter selectivity by ligand-bound FXR, it is possible that the bile acid-mediated Cyp7a repression involves FXR-independent mechanisms. Auto-regulatory loops have been identified for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (31Camp H.S. Whitton A.L. Tafuri S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), retinoic acid receptor α and retinoic acid receptor γ (32Takeyama K. Kojima R. Ohashi R. Sato T. Mano H. Masushige S. Kato S.

In this study, we demonstrated that all of the bile acids tested as well as the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 strongly increased FXR protein, despite the fact that DCA, CA, and UDCA are partial agonists of FXR. Consistent with our observations here, Xu et al. (23Xu G. Pan L.X. Li H. Forman B.M. Erickson S.K. Shefer S. Bollineni J. Batta A.K. Christie J. Wang T.H. Michel J. Yang S. Tsai R. Lai L. Shimada K.

The existence of an FXR autoregulatory loop would lead to more efficient propagation of bile acid signals. In conclusion, we have shown that different bile acids have unique properties as FXR ligands, ranging from antagonist to partial agonist to full agonist. Our data here suggest that each of the endogenous bile acids interacts with FXR in a unique fashion that leads to a ligand and promoter selectivity for FXR-mediated gene transcription. These selective properties of bile acid activation of FXR may greatly facilitate FXR gene regulation in appropriate tissues and cell types. We thank Drs. Jilly Evans and Gerard M. Waters for critically reading the paper."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the process have been elusive. Here, we show that a neuronal homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT)-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (NEDL1) physically binds translocon-associated protein-δ and also binds and ubiquitinates mutant (but not wild-type) SOD1 proportionately to the disease severity caused by that particular mutant. Immunohistochemically, NEDL1 is present in the central region of the Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions in the spinal cord ventral horn motor neurons of both FALS patients and mutant <i>SOD1</i> transgenic mice. Two-hybrid screening for the physiological targets of NEDL1 has identified Dishevelled-1, one of the key transducers in the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutant SOD1 also interacted with Dishevelled-1 in the presence of NEDL1 and caused its dysfunction. Thus, our results suggest that an adverse interaction among misfolded SOD1, NEDL1, translocon-associated protein-δ, and Dishevelled-1 forms a ubiquitinated protein complex that is included in potentially cytotoxic protein aggregates and that mutually affects their functions, leading to motor neuron death in FALS."

The effectiveness of PDI as a catalyst of native disulfide bond formation in folding polypeptides depends on the ability to catalyze disulfide-dithiol exchange, to bind non-native proteins, and to trigger conformational changes in the bound substrate, allowing access to buried cysteine residues. It is known that the b′ domain of PDI provides the principal peptide binding site of PDI and that this domain is critical for catalysis of isomerization but not oxidation reactions in protein substrates. Here we use homology modeling to define more precisely the boundaries of the b′ domain and show the existence of an intradomain linker between the b′ and a′ domains. We have expressed the recombinant b′ domain thus defined; the stability and conformational properties of the recombinant product confirm the validity of the domain boundaries. We have modeled the tertiary structure of the b′ domain and identified the primary substrate binding site within it. Mutations within this site, expressed both in the isolated domain and in full-length PDI, greatly reduce the binding affinity for small peptide substrates, with the greatest effect being I272W, a mutation that appears to have no structural effect.

Native disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex process that is rate-limiting in the biogenesis of many outer membrane and secreted proteins. Native disulfide bond formation can occur via multiple parallel pathways, and there is evidence that a large number of different gene families and redox carriers may play a role in the supply of redox equivalents for protein disulfide bond formation. What is clear is that the rate-limiting step for native disulfide bond formation in proteins that contain multiple disulfides is late-stage isomerization reactions, where disulfide bond formation is linked to conformational changes in protein substrates with substantial regular secondary structure. These steps are thought to be catalyzed only by proteins belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. PDI 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; scRNase, scrambled RNase. was the first catalyst of protein folding identified over 40 years ago (1Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J.

In all eukaryotes, there exists a species-dependent PDI family of enzymes; for example, in humans (2Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W.

Functional characterization and differentiation between these family members is far from complete. PDI is a multifunctional, multidomain enzyme. The domain structure of PDI has been determined by theoretical (7Ferrari D.M. Söling H-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and experimental (8Kemmink J.

Salo K.E.H. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W Antiox. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and references therein), but not substantiated, that there is a short linker region between the b′ and a′ domains. In vitro studies indicate that PDI catalyzes all of the steps in native disulfide bond formation but that catalysis of disulfide bond isomerization is most significant over the non-catalyzed rate in a glutathione buffer that mimics the redox potential of the ER. The greatest enhancement of rate is for late-stage isomerizations, i.e. the rate-limiting steps for native disulfide bond formation. PDI is remarkable in that, to our knowledge, it appears to be able to catalyze all of the steps in native disulfide bond formation for all substrate proteins reported. It is still unclear how PDI recognizes all of these different folding states, from essentially unfolded through to substrates with quasinative conformations but lacking specific disulfide bonds, and yet does not appear to interact with correctly folded and disulfide-bonded substrate proteins. Some details have been elucidated of the roles of individual domains of PDI in the different aspects of the overall activity of PDI. It has been reported that oxidation reactions require only a single catalytic domain, simple isomerization reactions require a linear combination of a catalytic domain and the b′ domain, whereas all of PDI excluding the c region is required to catalyze isomerization reactions where disulfide bond formation is linked to conformational changes in protein substrates with substantial regular secondary structure (12Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The requirement for the non-catalytic b′ domain was subsequently shown to arise due to the fact that the b′ domain contains the principal peptide or non-native protein binding site (13Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For small peptide substrates, the b′ domain alone is sufficient for binding, whereas for larger protein substrates, the b′ domain is essential, but other domains contribute to substrate binding. No specificity has yet been reported for substrate binding by PDI, nor has the binding site been located within the b′ domain. However, for the homologue PDIp, the substrate specificity is now well defined (14Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a fact that will greatly assist in the localization and definition of the binding site of the PDI family. Here we confirm the existence of the putative linker region between the b′ and a′ domains and report the identification and characterization of the binding site within the b′ domain. Mutations within this site greatly reduce the binding affinity of PDI for small peptide substrates. Secondary Structure Prediction—The sequence of mature human PDI was submitted to the PredictProtein server (16Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PredictProtein uses the subprogram MaxHom (17Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) to perform a data base search for homologous sequences and to align those sequences into a multiple alignment file. The MaxHom-derived multiple alignment file contained 53 sequences, and this was used as an input to PredictProtein. The sequence data from the MaxHom-derived multiple alignment file was also used as an input for the secondary structure prediction program PREDATOR (18Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The secondary structure assignments for the b and b′ domains of human PDI were also predicted with PREDATOR using a different input file that was specially created using the sequences of just the b and b′ domains as input for the generation of a multiple alignment file, which contained 35 sequence fragments.

Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), of human thioredoxin and the a′ domain of PDI (9Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and of the a and a′ domains of PDI (19Gane P.G. A Sequence, Structure, and Electrostatic Analysis of the Disulfide Oxidoreductases. University of Kent, Canterbury, UK1996Google Scholar) were combined to produce a multiple sequence alignment of E. coli and human thioredoxin and the a, b, and a′ domains of human PDI. In cases of conflicting data from different alignments, priority was given to the alignments from Creighton and co-workers (8Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which are based on the structural data for PDI. The b′ domain of human PDI was added to this multiple sequence alignment after an initial alignment of the b and b′ domains using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, comparison table: BLOSUM62, gap opening penalty: 8, gap extension penalty: 1 (20Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4368) Google Scholar). The resulting multiple sequence alignment was further refined considering experimentally derived and predicted secondary structure assignments. Homology modeling of the b′ domain was performed using version 4 of the homology modeling program MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10690) Google Scholar). From 10 constructed models, the one with the lowest value of the objective function was selected as the representative model. Generation of Expression Vectors—A gene insert for an expression vector for the isolated b′ domain (Pro-218–Gly-332) of PDI was generated by PCR from an existing vector encoding PDI (11Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W Antiox. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using primers that included an in-frame NdeI site 5′ to the first codon of the gene and a BamHI site after a TAA stop codon at the 3′-end. The insert was cloned into pLWRP51, a modified version of pET23b (Novagen) that encodes for an N-terminal His tag in-frame with the cloned gene. The resulting gene products included the sequence MHHHHHHM-prior to the first amino acid of the domain sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as recommended by the manufacturer using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

The concentration of each protein was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated absorption coefficient, PDI b′ domain (2,840 m-1 cm-1; molecular weight 14,273), PDI b′x domain (8,440 m-1 cm-1; molecular weight 17,285), PDI (45,040 m-1 cm-1; molecular weight 56,386), and PDI I272W (50,640 m-1 cm-1; molecular weight 56,459) at 280 nm. Cross-linking—Cell extracts from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS were prepared by repeated freeze thawing. Bolton-Hunter 125I labeling of Δ-somatostatin (AGSKNFFWKTFSS) or Mastoparan (INLKALAALAKKIL) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking was performed using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (Sigma) as described (13Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Biophysical Analysis—Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrophotometer. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of eight scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, a scan speed of 20 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 1 s. The maximal high tension voltage was 750 V. All spectra were corrected for the blank spectra with no protein added. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 spectrophotometer using a 1-ml cuvette. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of four scans, with excitation at 280 nm, emission at 300–400 nm (or 300–350 for b′), slit widths of 5 nm, a scan speed of 200 nm/min. All spectra were corrected for the blank spectra with no protein added. For the tryptophan-containing constructs, the fluorescence parameter examined to look at the effects of guanidinium chloride on protein structure was the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity of 2 nm to either side of the λmax for native protein to the average fluorescence intensity over the range 320–400 nm. This parameter was chosen at it is independent of concentration and less dependent on the direct effects of guanidinium chloride on tryptophan fluorescence. Definition of the Boundaries of the b′ (Primary Substrate Binding) Domain of PDI—Previous theoretical (7Ferrari D.M. Söling H-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and experimental (for example, Ref. 11Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W Antiox. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) studies have defined the domain boundaries for the a, b, and a′ domains of the human PDIs. The domain boundaries of the b′ domain are less clear; constructs used in experimental work to date have defined the boundaries based on the end of the b domain and the beginning of a′. This produces a b′ domain that is significantly longer than the homologous b domain. Based in part on partial proteolysis of bovine PDI (10Freedman R.B. Gane P.J. Hawkins H.C. Hlodan R. McLaughlin S.H. Parry J.W. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), there has been a suggestion that a structured linker region exists between the b′ and a′ domains (2Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but there has been no reported experimental confirmation of this. To define the domain boundaries of the b′ domain of human PDI, a sequence alignment of the homologous b and b′ domains of human PDI was performed. This alignment was then refined using the results from secondary structure prediction using PredictProtein (16Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PREDATOR (18Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) to move gaps into loop regions and to align corresponding helix and strand regions without misaligning regions of good sequence similarity. The resulting alignment, together with observed and predicted secondary structure assignments, is shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from this alignment that the b′ domain defined previously (11Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W Antiox. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) includes 19 residues at the C terminus that form an unaligned extension of the aligned thioredoxin-like section. This apparent linker region between the b′ and a′ domains we designate as x. To confirm the proposed domain boundaries, a PDI b′ construct (residues Pro-218–Gly-332 of mature human PDI) was made. This construct and the original construct (residues Lys-213–Pro-351 of mature human PDI, now termed b′x), with an N-terminal hexa-His tag to aid purification, could be expressed solubly in the cytoplasm of E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of immobilized metal affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography (data not shown). The ability to generate significant amounts of soluble protein in E. coli from both of these domain constructs strongly indicates that both define compact stable structures; thus, the domain boundaries of b′ defined here are correct, and region x does not form part of this domain. Characterization of the b′ Domain of PDI—To confirm that the new b′ domain construct is structured and retains the biological activity associated with it in the full-length protein, a variety of biophysical analyses were undertaken. Previously, the b′ domain of PDI was reported to include the primary substrate binding site of PDI, binding to small peptides and being essential for the binding of larger substrates, e.g. non-native proteins (13Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Both the b′ and the b′x construct were tested for their ability to bind the 14-amino-acid test peptide Δ-somatostatin via the standard cross-linking assay using an E. coli lysate containing the recombinantly expressed constructs. Both the b′ and b′x constructs were able to bind Δ-somatostatin (Fig. 2A) and, as per full-length protein, this binding was reversible and dependent on hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2, B and C) The far UV CD spectra of both constructs showed that both b′ and b′x were well structured and contained a significant amount of α-helix and β-sheet. Since E. coli thioredoxin and the isolated b domain of PDI share the same α/β-thioredoxin-like fold, the CD spectra of these were compared with those of the b′ and b′x constructs and were found to contain similar features (Fig. 3A), suggesting that b′ also shares the thioredoxin-fold. The b′ construct under non-denaturing conditions showed a λmax of 304 nm, consistent with the fact that the protein contains 2 tyrosine residues and no tryptophans (Fig. 3B). Upon addition of 4 m guanidinium chloride, a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed with no shift in λmax. The b′x construct contains one tryptophan, and fluorescence spectra of b′x, under non-denaturing conditions, gave a λmax of 338 nm (Fig. 3C), indicative of a tryptophan residue being in a hydrophobic environment. Upon addition of 6 m guanidinium chloride, the fluorescence spectra of b′x had a λmax of 356 nm, indicative of a denatured protein. Fluorescence-based denaturation curves for b′ and b′x showed a single phase transition from the native to denatured state. From the data presented in Fig. 3D, the midpoints for denaturation were 1.65 and 2.32 m for b′ and b′x, respectively. The b′ domain of PDI contains two thiol residues (Cys-295 and Cys-326) that may be involved in modulating the binding affinity depending on redox potential (see Ref. 22Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rappaport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, but also see Ref. 23Lumb R.A. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6763-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An Ellmans assay on purified b′ and b′x under native and denaturing conditions indicated that both cysteines exist as free thiols and that both are relatively inaccessible to low molecular weight thiol-reactive reagents in the native state. This result was confirmed by examining the reaction of b′ with iodoacetate in the presence and absence of 4 m guanidinium chloride (data not shown). These data indicate that neither of the cysteine residues are likely to participate in substrate binding, nor are they likely to exchange between the dithiol and disulfide states upon the modulation of the redox potential. Identifying the Primary Substrate Binding Site within the b′ Domain of PDI—Previous data (13Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the b′ domain of PDI contains the primary substrate binding site of the enzyme, but there are no published data on the localization of the substrate binding site within this domain. Work in this area is hampered by the lack of a structure for any PDI or for any isolated PDI b′ domain. The structures of the a and b domains have been solved by NMR (8Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr.

NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and both show a thioredoxin fold. Since b′ is homologous to b, we sought to construct a model of b′ based on the known structure of b and to use this to identify the primary substrate binding site. Although the NMR structure of the b domain of human PDI has been determined (9Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), its coordinates had not been released at the time this modeling work was performed. Therefore, only the structures of E. coli thioredoxin (25Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), human thioredoxin (26Forman-Kay J.D. Clore G.M. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2685-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the a domain of human PDI (8Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) could be used as template structures for homology modeling. These structures, combined with the sequence alignments for the individual domains of PDI, were used to build a model of the b′ domain of PDI using the homology modeling program MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10690) Google Scholar). Only the thioredoxin-like section of the b′-(218–334) domain was homology-modeled. Unsurprisingly, the final modeled structure for the b′ domain was very similar to that of the b domain with an overall thioredoxin-like fold. The two cysteine residues that b′ contains are not surface-exposed in the model. The two sulfur atoms are 6.4 Å apart, and thus, they are unlikely to form a disulfide; this is consistent with the experimental data that showed a lack of reactivity of the cysteine residues to iodoacetamide in the native state. Although the substrate specificity of substrate binding by PDI is not known, there are strong indications (13Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that the recognition motifs are primarily hydrophobic in nature, and substrate binding can be inhibited by small molecular weight molecules such as 2-propylphenol. Furthermore, the binding specificity of the homologous protein PDIp has been reported (14Ruddock L.W. Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and since it binds single amino acid methyl esters of tyrosine and tryptophan, the substrate binding pocket must be relatively small. Examination of the model of the b′ domain of PDI revealed no large distinct hydrophobic pockets. However, a small hydrophobic pocket could be identified close to where the active site would be in the a domain (comprising primarily the side chains of Leu-242, Leu-244, Phe-258, and Ile-272). Furthermore, a larger, more distinct pocket could be identified at the same position in a model of the b′ domain of PDIp. 2M. Lobell, L. W. Ruddock, P. Klappa, and R. B. Freedman, manuscript in preparation. Since the non-catalytic domains are thought to have arisen by gene duplication of catalytic domains, it is probable that the primary substrate binding site in the b′ domain would have arisen from the catalytic site and thus would be located in the same part of the thioredoxin fold. These two independent strands of evidence suggest the localization of the binding site to the same region of the b′ domain of PDI. Defining the Primary Substrate Binding Site within the b′ Domain of PDI—To validate the localization of the binding site, a large number of mutations were made in the putative hydrophobic pocket and in spatially adjacent residues both in the isolated b′ domain and in full-length PDI. These mutants were expressed in E. coli. All but one of the mutants made in full-length PDI produced soluble proteins of the expected molecular size and equivalent yields. The exception was the P245A mutation, for which no expressed protein could be seen by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that this residue is structurally important. Even under optimal expression conditions"

PlGF exerts its biological activities through binding to VEGFR1, a receptor tyrosine kinase that consists of seven immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular portion. Here we report the crystal structure of PlGF bound to the second immunoglobulin-like domain of VEGFR1 at 2.5 Å resolution and compare the complex to the closely related structure of VEGF bound to the same receptor domain. The two growth factors, PlGF and VEGF, share a sequence identity of ∼50%. Despite this moderate sequence conservation, they bind to the same binding interface of VEGFR1 in a very similar fashion, suggesting that both growth factors could induce very similar if not identical signaling events.

Despite this moderate sequence conservation, they bind to the same binding interface of VEGFR1 in a very similar fashion, suggesting that both growth factors could induce very similar if not identical signaling events. Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is a complex process that involves a number of different growth factors. It is essential for a variety of physiologically important events such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and tissue repair but is also critical in a number of diseases such as tumor progression, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar, 2Ferrara N. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Consequently, the molecules that induce or mediate angiogenic events are potentially important targets for the treatment of these diseases. VEGF-A (or VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor; PlGF, placental growth factor; BTP, bis-Tris propane (1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane); r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor; PlGF, placental growth factor; BTP, bis-Tris propane (1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane); r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. the most important inducer of angiogenesis, is also the founding member of the family of vascular endothelial growth factors (3Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). This family of structurally and functionally related growth factors includes VEGF-A (VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E, and placental growth factor (PlGF). The members of the VEGF family are responsible for an array of angiogenic, vasculogenic, and lymphangiogenic processes and mediate their function mainly through differential binding to the three homologous receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 (also called flt-1), VEGFR2 (or KDR), and VEGFR3. These receptors are a subclass of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor family, but whereas the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptors have five Ig-like domains, the ectodomains of the VEGFRs contain a total of seven Ig-like domains. The extracellular portion of all receptor tyrosine kinases is connected to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain via a single transmembrane helix. VEGF, the most potent angiogenic factor of the VEGF family, signals through binding to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. A number of studies have identified VEGFR2 as the key signaling receptor mediating the proliferative effects of VEGF (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar, 3Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). The role of VEGFR1, the only tyrosine kinase receptor for PlGF, is still less well understood. Mice devoid of VEGFR1 develop endothelial cells but die because of severe disorganization of the vascular system (4Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice that express only a tyrosine kinase-deficient variant of the receptor are viable and do not display impaired embryogenesis (5Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). PlGF is specific for VEGFR1, and studies of PlGF isoforms showed that it has only limited mitogenic activity but that it augments and potentiates the activity of low concentrations of VEGF in vitro and in vivo (6Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it has been suggested that VEGFR1 act as a nonsignaling reservoir for VEGF during development or at least, under certain conditions, as a decoy receptor (7Ferrara N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1358-C1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that VEGFR1 is expressed not only on vascular endothelial cells but is also present on the surface of pluripotent stem cells. PlGF is specific for VEGFR1 and can reconstitute hematopoiesis by recruiting these stem cells from the bone marrow (8Hattori K. Heissig B. Wu Y. Dias S. Tejada R. Ferris B. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Bohlen P. Witte L. Hendrikx J. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Moore M.A. Werb Z. Lyden D. Rafii S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). It was further shown that selective activation of VEGFR1 induces proliferation of hepatocytes rather than endothelial cells (9LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2003; 299: 890-893Google Scholar). Interestingly, PlGF is not required for embryogenic angiogenesis, as mice that lack PlGF are healthy and unaffected by the mutation (10Carmeliet P. Moons L. Luttun A. Vincenti V. Compernolle V. De Mol M. Wu Y. Bono F. Devy L. Beck H. Scholz D. Acker T. DiPalma T. Dewerchin M. Noel A. Stalmans I. Barra A. Blacher S. Vandendriessche T. Ponten A. Eriksson U. Plate K.H. Foidart J.M. Schaper W.

However, PlGF-deficient mice display attenuated responses to VEGF in pathological angiogenesis (11Luttun A. Brusselmans K. Fukao H. Tjwa M. Ueshima S. Herbert J.M. Matsuo O. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Moons L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and PlGF is necessary for angiogenic events in adult tissues during ischemia, inflammation, wound healing, and cancer (10Carmeliet P. Moons L. Luttun A. Vincenti V. Compernolle V. De Mol M. Wu Y. Bono F. Devy L. Beck H. Scholz D. Acker T. DiPalma T. Dewerchin M. Noel A. Stalmans I. Barra A. Blacher S. Vandendriessche T. Ponten A.

Antibodies against VEGFR1 suppress neovascularization in tumors and ischemic retina, angiogenesis, and inflammatory joint destruction in autoimmune arthritis (12Luttun A. Tjwa M. Moons L. Wu Y.

Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). These findings make PlGF and its receptor, VEGFR1, potentially attractive targets for modulation of inflammation and angiogenesis. All members of the VEGF family are secreted dimeric glycoproteins. As a result of alternative splicing events, PlGF and VEGF appear in a number of isoforms. So far three isoforms of mature human PlGF have been reported (13Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G.

Commun. 1997; 235: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The shortest isoform of PlGF, PlGF-1, comprises 131 residues in its mature form and, like the corresponding isoform VEGF121 of VEGF, entails the receptor-binding domain. PlGF-2 has an insertion of 21 residues near its C terminus and like the longer VEGF-isoforms is able to bind heparin. PlGF-3 has an insertion of 72 amino acids near the C terminus of PlGF-1 but, unlike PlGF-2, does not bind to heparin (14Cao Y. Ji W.-R. Qi P. Rosin A. Cao Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the VEGF (15Muller Y.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. de Vos A.M.

Here we describe the crystal structure of the minimal ligand binding fragment of VEGFR1 in complex with the receptor-binding domain of PlGF and compare it with the complex between VEGFR1-d2 and VEGF. The structure and comparison of both complexes should shed light on the differences in the downstream effects of VEGFR1 activation via PlGF and VEGF (18Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A.

Expression, Refolding, and Purification—VEGFR constructs were expressed, purified, and tested for functional integrity as described (17Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C.

Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A construct comprising residues 19–116 of PlGF-2, corresponding to the receptor-binding domain, was expressed as insoluble protein in E. coli. Inclusion bodies were isolated by passing homogenized cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) through a French pressure cell and centrifuging the homogenate for 15 min at 4000 × g. The inclusion bodies were resuspended and the centrifugation repeated. The pellet, consisting primarily of PlGF, was dissolved in 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stirred for 1 h in 20 mm dithiothreitol. The protein solution was diluted to a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm cysteine at 4 °C for 24 h. Refolded PlGF was purified in consecutive chromatography steps using ion exchange (Q-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences), hydrophobic interaction (Phenyl Toyopearl, Tosohaas), and size exclusion (S-200, Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Purified PlGF was mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio with VEGFR1-d2. The resulting complex was purified using size exclusion chromatography (S-200, Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated to 6.5 mg/ml. The composition of the complex was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase HPLC (Vydac, 214 nm). Binding Assays—For BIAcore competition assays, VEGF8–109 was conjugated at a high density of 800–1000 response units (RU) to a B1 BIAcore chip using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). First, the concentrations of a VEGFR1 fragment that produced a signal on a VEGF-conjugated chip over a blank chip in the range of 30 to 70 response units in a 2-min injection at 30 μl/min were determined. Approximately 0.1–0.15 nm VEGFR1-d1–7 or -d23 and 2 nm VEGFR1-d2 were chosen for the binding experiments and incubated with increasing concentrations of PlGF and VEGF at 4 °C overnight. The mixtures were then injected onto the chip where unbound forms of the VEGFR1 fragment were captured on the VEGF-coated chip. The amount of captured RU was plotted against the concentrations of VEGF or PlGF in the initial incubation stage, and IC50 levels were determined. This assay was restricted by the lowest concentrations of VEGFR1 fragments sufficient to produce a reasonable signal. In these instances we report the affinity derived from other assays such as radioimmunoreceptor competition binding assays or biotinylated protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with a more sensitive readout as described previously (17Wiesmann C.

Crystallization—Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature using the hanging drop method. Crystallization buffer containing 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.02% NaN3 and 0.1 m bis-Tris propane (BTP), pH 6.5, was mixed with an equal volume of protein solution. The resulting crystals belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 54.25 Å, b = 71.97 Å, c = 115.34 Å and with 1 complex/asymmetric unit. Crystals were dipped into a drop containing reservoir plus 10% glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Processing, Phasing, and Refinement—Data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory to 2.45 Å resolution and processed using the HKL package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38246) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of VEGF in complex with VEGFR1-d2 (Protein Data Bank code 1FLT (17Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C.

Using data from 12 to 6 Å yielded a clear solution in the rotation and translation functions, and the best solution was subjected to rigid body refinement using the program X-PLOR (22Brünger A.T.

Affinity of the PlGF Binding Domain to VEGFR1—Based on sequence alignments and the crystal structure of VEGF in complex with VEGFR1-d2 (17Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C.

The resulting protein, PlGF19–116, consists of residues 19–116. VEGFR1 consists of seven immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular portion and binds to PlGF with sub-nanomolar affinity (6Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

To establish the minimal ligand binding domain toward PlGF, we tested three constructs of VEGFR1 entailing the entire ectodomain (VEGFR1-d1–7), domains 2 and 3 (VEGFR1-d2–3), and domain 2 only (VEGFR1-d2) in Biacore competition assays. In these assays, the longest construct, entailing the entire ectodomain of the receptor, binds PlGF19–116 with an IC50 of 0.5 nm. The affinity of PlGF19–116 toward the VEGFR1-d2-3 construct is only about 2-fold weaker, whereas VEGFR1-d2, the shortest construct tested, bound to the ligand with an IC50 of about 270 nm and therefore binds PlGF19–116 more than 500-fold weaker than the full-length receptor (Table I).Table IBinding affinitiesIC50aBinding affinities were measured as IC50 using a solution binding assay coupled with BIAcore competition capturing of unbound VEGFR1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding affinities of VEGFR1 fragments for VEGF-(8-109) were higher than PlGF and were measured with other assay formats because BIAcore assays were restricted by limited accuracy at that rangeVEGFR1-d2VEGFR1-d2-3VEGFR1-d1-7nMVEGF-(8-109)3.00.141.3bEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay competition assay using biotinylated VEGF (17)0.054cData were derived from a radioimmunoreceptor competition binding assay as described in Ref. 17, using iodinated VEGF as the tracer0.024cData were derived from a radioimmunoreceptor competition binding assay as described in Ref. 17, using iodinated VEGF as the tracerPlGF-(19-116)2751.10.435a Binding affinities were measured as IC50 using a solution binding assay coupled with BIAcore competition capturing of unbound VEGFR1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding affinities of VEGFR1 fragments for VEGF-(8-109) were higher than PlGF and were measured with other assay formats because BIAcore assays were restricted by limited accuracy at that rangeb Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay competition assay using biotinylated VEGF (17Wiesmann C.

The center of the complex is formed by the PlGF homodimer. Both receptor fragments are bound to the distant poles of this dimer giving the entire complex the dimensions 85 × 40 × 35 Å (Fig. 1). The overall structure of the receptor-binding fragment of PlGF in complex with VEGFR1-d2 is very similar to previously reported structures of PlGF or VEGF (15Muller Y.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. de Vos A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1325-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Iyer S. Demetres D. Leonidas G. Swaminathan J. Maglione D. Battisti M.

Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Like all members of the cystine knot family of growth factors, the PlGF monomer has an elongated shape with two pairs of twisted, antiparallel, two-stranded β-sheets in its central portion (strands A, B, C, and D) and the characteristic cystine knot motif, as well as the N and C termini on one end of the molecule (26Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cystine knot is formed by three disulfide bridges. In this motif, two disulfide bridges together with the protein backbone form a closed ring that is penetrated by the third disulfide bridge. Like the related VEGF, PlGF has an N-terminal helix (α1). The protein segment connecting strands A and B includes residues 43–58 and contains a single turn of α-helix (α2) as well as a short additional β-strand (A′) that forms hydrogen bonds with strand C. The hydrogen bonding pattern between strand C and D is interrupted so that strand D is broken into two shorter β-strands, named strands D and D′. The BC loop and the CD loops are both relatively short and span residues 65–74 and 91–97, respectively (Fig. 1). In the biologically active dimer, two PlGF monomers are assembled in an antiparallel manner and are covalently connected through the formation of two disulfide bonds between residues Cys59 and Cys68. This homodimer, which has a rather unusual shape, can be described as a curved sheet that is about 70 Å long and 35 Å wide but less than 15 Å thick in its central portion (Fig. 1). A total of 2700 Å2 is buried in the interface between the two PlGF monomers. A large portion of this interface is formed by the N-terminal helices of PlGF, which pack on top of the respective other dimer within the complex and thus stabilize the dimeric assembly. The overall architecture of the complex between ligand and receptor is dictated by the internal 2-fold symmetry of the PlGF dimer. The two receptor fragments of VEGFR1 bind on the opposing edges of the PlGF dimer with the closest distance between any two atoms between both receptor fragments of about 30 Å. VEGFR1-d2 is a member of the I-set of Ig-like domains (17Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Generally, Ig-like domains consist of about 100 residues, which form two β-sheets that fold against each other to form a β-sandwich. In VEGFR1-d2 one β-sheet is formed by strands A′,G,F,C,andC′ and the other contains strands B, E, and D. One disulfide bond forms part of the hydrophobic core and connects strands B and F, thus stabilizing the fold of the domain. The two halves of the complex are almost identical and superimposing the entire complex onto itself according to the internal 2-fold symmetry results in an r.m.s.d. of 0.75 Å for 372 Cα positions with the largest deviations occurring in regions that are also flexible in the unbound VEGFR1-d2 (27Starovasnik M.A. Christinger H.W. Wiesmann C. Champe M.A. de Vos A.M. Skelton N.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 293: 531-544Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interface—The total surface area buried in each of the interfaces between PlGF and VEGFR1-d2 amounts to ∼1650 Å2. Both PlGF monomers participate in the binding of each receptor with one monomer contributing about 70% and the other 30% of the buried surfaces. Each receptor molecule is in contact with five segments of the PlGF dimer. Three of these, including the N-terminal helix of PlGF (residues 24–33), the loop connecting strands B and C, and the C-terminal residues 110–114, stem from one PlGF monomer; the other two segments, including residues of the AB loop (residues 54–56) and the CD loop (residues 87–99), stem from the other PlGF monomer. On the VEGFR1-d2 side, residues from four distinct segments of amino acids form the interface. They include residues 140–147 from the N-terminal strand A′, residues 171–175 from strand C and the loop connecting to strand C′, residues 199–204 from strand F and the short helix following it, as well as residues 217–224 from strand G (Fig. 1). The C terminus of the last VEGFR1-d2 residue with defined electron density, Arg224, projects toward a groove formed by the AB loop of one PlGF monomer and the CD loop of the second monomer suggesting that the linker connecting VEGFR1-d2 to the third domain of the intact ectodomain might also contribute to the formation of the complex. The interface is largely of hydrophobic nature with no apparent “knob-into-hole” interactions. Hydrophobic residues constitute ∼50% of the interface, with nine leucine and isoleucine residues being responsible for almost one-third of the buried surface. There are only three direct polar interactions; one hydrogen bond is formed between the side chain of PlGF residue Gln26 and the main chain carbonyl of Glu141 of VEGFR1-d2, and two charged interactions occur between Asp71 of PlGF and Arg224 of VEGFR1-d2. In addition several hydrogen bonds are mediated by a bound BTP molecule and a number of water molecules. bis-Tris Propane Bound in the Interface—In addition to one full complex between PlGF and VEGFR1-d2, the asymmetric unit contains a single molecule of BTP. The buffer molecule is near the interface between PlGF and VEGFR1-d2 and located on a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis, with the NCS axis going through the central atom of the propane unit. Thus both of the tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino head groups form nearly identical interactions with the proteins. Each head group is involved in hydrogen bond formation to Glu141 of the receptor domain and to Gln87 and Glu101 of VEGF (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the BTP molecule is therefore in contact with both PlGF and both VEGFR1-d2 molecules of the asymmetric unit, thus presumably greatly stabilizing the packing arrangement in these crystals (Fig. 2). Structure of Bound Versus Unbound PlGF—Because of the dimeric nature of the PlGF complex, there are two ways to superimpose the PlGF dimer in its free form (Protein Data Bank code 1FZV) and the PlGF in complex with VEGFR1-d2 on top of each other. In either case, the molecules have an r.m.s.d. of ∼2.1 Å for a total of 188 Cα atoms (residues 22–115). Even the superposition of a single PlGF monomer in its unbound form onto a PlGF monomer in complex with VEGFR1-d2 results into a rather large r.m.s.d. of 1.6 Å for 94 atoms. This deviation is the result of a number of changes. First, the overall shape of the PlGF dimer is slightly altered when bound to the receptor (Fig. 3A). The CD loops form the far end of the sheet-like PlGF dime"

The membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs) comprise six members of plasma membrane-tethered MMPs, which include four type I transmembrane enzymes: MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMP, and two glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored enzymes: MT4- and MT6-MMP (4Massova I.

Although there is some tissue-specific expression of MT-MMPs, there is also significant overlap both in expression and in function raising the question of how cells command the repertoire of MT-MMPs at their disposition during proteolytic events. A major mechanism for controlling MT-MMP activity in the pericellular space is mediated by the action of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). However, as opposed to soluble MMPs, which are almost equally inhibited by all TIMPs (9Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 10Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the MT-MMPs are highly selective when it comes to TIMP interactions. For example, the type I transmembrane MT-MMPs are poorly inhibited by TIMP-1 but are relatively well inhibited by TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4. In contrast, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored MT-MMPs are inhibited by both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (11Seiki M. APMIS. 1999; 107: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The differential sensitivity to TIMP inhibition among members of the MT-MMP family may facilitate the control of MT-MMP activity in the pericellular space. In addition to being potent ECM-degrading enzymes, the type I transmembrane MT-MMPs can also initiate a cascade of zymogen activation on the cell surface. MT-MMPs activate the zymogenic form of MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2 or pro-gelatinase A) (6Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn can activate pro-MMP-9 (pro-gelatinase B) (12Toth M. Chvyrkova I. Bernardo M.M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP also promotes the activation of pro-collagenase 3 (MMP-13) (13Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B.

Because the gelatinases are efficient gelatinolytic enzymes, the MT-MMP/MMP-13/gelatinase axis represents a well adapted proteolytic system designed to promote coordinated and complete collagen degradation in the pericellular space. Although the type I transmembrane MT-MMPs have been shown to activate pro-MMP-2 (6Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the specific mechanism(s) by which each member of this subgroup accomplishes pro-MMP-2 activation and the accessory molecules involved in this process are not completely understood. In the case of MT1-MMP, pro-MMP-2 activation requires the participation of TIMP-2, which acts as a molecular link between an active MT1-MMP on the cell surface and pro-MMP-2 (14Strongin A.Y.

The N-terminal region of TIMP-2 binds to the active site of MT1-MMP, whereas the C-terminal region of the inhibitor binds to the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2 forming a so-called “ternary complex” (16Fernandez-Catalan C.

The propeptide of the bound pro-MMP-2 is then cleaved at the Asn37-Leu38 peptide bond by a neighboring TIMP-2-free active MT1-MMP molecule. This is followed by a second cleavage event in which the intermediate MMP-2 form is cleaved at the Asn80-Tyr81 peptide bond by a fully active MMP-2 in an autocatalytic intermolecular manner resulting in full activation (13Knauper V.

This permits availability of enough TIMP-2-free active MT1-MMP to hydrolyze the prodomain of pro-MMP-2 bound in the ternary complex. Thus, under limited conditions, TIMP-2 promotes zymogen activation, whereas high levels of TIMP-2 relative to MT1-MMP inhibit activation by blocking all free MT1-MMP molecules (14Strongin A.Y.

Generation of MT3-MMP Mutants—To generate a catalytically inactive MT3-MMP (E/A-MT3-MMP), Glu247 was substituted for Ala using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the wild-type MT3-MMP cDNA in pTF7EMCV-1 as a template. A cytosolic tail (CT) deletion mutant (ΔCT-MT3-MMP) was constructed by introducing a termination codon at Gln586. Likewise, a transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail deleted MT3-MMP (ΔTM/CT-MT3-MMP) was constructed by introducing a termination codon at Ala564. The fidelity of the inserts was verified by DNA sequencing in both directions. Recombinant viruses expressing these MT3-MMP mutants were generated by homologous recombination with wild-type vaccinia virus, as previously described (48Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M.

Expression of MT3-MMP and TIMP-2 by Co-infection—To express MT3-MMP, cells (various types) in six-well plates were co-infected with 10 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell each of vTF7-3 and vT7-MT3 viruses (encoding for either wild-type or mutant enzymes) for 45 min in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) at 37 °C. As a control, the cells were infected only with the vTF7-3 virus. To co-express MT3-MMP with TIMP-2, and to modulate the level of inhibitor expression, BS-C-1 cells were co-infected with 5 pfu/cell each of vTF7-3 and vT7-MT3 viruses and increasing amounts (0–20 pfu/cell) of the TIMP-2-expressing vaccinia virus vSC59-T2 as described (18Hernandez-Barrantes S.

Pro-MMP-2 Activation by Membrane-bound and Soluble MT3-MMP—Cells (various types) in six-well plates were co-infected to express MT3-MMP as described above. After these procedures, the media were aspirated and cells were rinsed once with serum-free DMEM, followed by a 4-h incubation with serum-free DMEM. The media were then aspirated and replaced with serum-free DMEM (1 ml/well) supplemented with pro-MMP-2 without or with various amounts of TIMP-2, N-TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4, or marimastat. At varying times, the media were collected for gelatin zymography and the cells were lysed on ice with cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% IGEPAL CA 630 (Sigma), also known as Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

We have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase itch/AIP4 as an endophilin A1-binding partner. Itch belongs to the Nedd4/Rsp5p family of proteins and contains an N-terminal C2 domain, four WW domains and a catalytic HECT domain. Unlike other Nedd4/Rsp5p family members, itch possesses a short proline-rich domain that mediates its binding to the SH3 domain of endophilin A1. Itch ubiquitinates endophilin A1 and the SH3/proline-rich domain interaction facilitates this activity. Interestingly, itch co-localizes with markers of the endosomal system in a C2 domain-dependent manner and upon EGF stimulation, endophilin A1 translocates to an EGF-positive endosomal compartment where it colocalizes with itch. Moreover, EGF treatment of cells stimulates endophilin A1 ubiquitination. We have thus identified endophilin A1 as a substrate for the endosome-localized ubiquitin ligase itch. This interaction may be involved in ubiquitin-mediated sorting mechanisms operating at the level of endosomes.

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that involves the transfer of ubiquitin, an evolutionarily conserved 76 amino acid protein, to substrate proteins. The major specificity determinants of the ubiquitination machinery are the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which belong to two major classes, one that carries a RING 1The abbreviations used are: RING, really interesting new gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH3, Src homology domain; HECT, homologous to E6-AP Cterminus. 1The abbreviations used are: RING, really interesting new gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH3, Src homology domain; HECT, homologous to E6-AP Cterminus. (really interesting new gene) finger domain and another that carries a HECT (homologous to E6-AP Cterminus) domain (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). RING finger E3s function as adaptor proteins, bringing the substrate to activated ubiquitin on E2-conjugating enzymes, whereas E3s of the HECT domain family bind to the activated ubiquitin and transfer it from the E2 to the substrate (2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar).The classical view of ubiquitination is that it targets proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitin is now also recognized as a signal that directs plasma membrane proteins for endocytosis and regulates trafficking decisions that target endocytosed proteins for destruction in the lysosome (3Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 4Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

For example, the RING domain ligase cbl is recruited to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor upon receptor activation by either EGF or transforming growth factor α (TGFα). Cbl mediates EGF receptor ubiquitination and endocytosis (6Lill N. Douillard P. Awwad R. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V. Band H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13940-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, whereas EGF remains bound to the receptor in the more acidic environment of the endosome, TGFα rapidly dissociates upon internalization, the kinase activity of the receptor is attenuated and ubiquitination is lost (8Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The ligand-free receptor is targeted to the recycling pathway at the level of the endosome and is returned to the cell surface. In contrast, EGF remains bound to the receptor, which secures the kinase activity, and maintains receptor ubiquitination. The ubiquitinated EGF receptor is sorted to a trafficking pathway that leads to the lysosome where both ligand and receptor are degraded (9Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which ubiquitination participates in endocytosis and trafficking decisions at the level of the endosome remain unclear. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that in addition to endocytic cargo, ubiquitination also regulates the protein machinery that controls cargo trafficking. For example, a functional ubiquitination machinery is required for down-regulation of the growth hormone receptor whereas ubiquitination of the receptor itself is dispensable (10Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, in yeast, the α-factor receptor Ste-2, when expressed as an ubiquitin fusion protein, undergoes internalization without the need for additional ubiquitination (11Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of the HECT domain ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p, internalization is impaired, suggesting that Rsp5p targets components of the trafficking machinery that regulate Ste-2 internalization (11Dunn R. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination thus has multiple roles in receptor down-regulation, acting both as a sorting signal on cargo and as a regulator of the trafficking machinery.Recently, multiple classes of ubiquitin binding domains have been described (reviewed in Ref. 12Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these domains are often found in components of the trafficking machinery in the endocytic pathway (13Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem.

In addition to known endophilin A1-binding partners, we identified the germinal center kinase-like kinase, suggesting a role for endophilin A1 in the Jun kinase (JNK) signaling pathway (29Ramjaun A.R.

Another protein identified in this screen was the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase itch/AIP4. Itch belongs to the Nedd4/Rsp5p family and was originally identified as a gene disrupted in the non-agouti-lethal 18H mice, which develop a spectrum of immunologic diseases including constant itching in the skin (30Perry W.L.

Here, we have characterized the interaction of itch with endophilin A1. Our results suggest that itch may participate in protein trafficking at endosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The I.M.A.G.E.

Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) encoding human itch was used as a template to generate various cDNA constructs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primers: full-length itch, forward, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCAATGGGTAGCCTCACCATG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTG-3′; itch ΔC2, amino acids 183–862, forward, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCTGAAGATGCAGGAGCTG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTG-3′; itch ΔC2/ΔPRD, amino acids 230–862, forward, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACTCAATGGTTCACCATCTGCC-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTG-3′; itch PRD, amino acids 183–235, forward, 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCTGAAGATGCAGGAGCTG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTAGGCAGATGGTGAACCATTG-3′. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma-Aldrich), pGE-X-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), or pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to add FLAG, GST, and GFP tags, respectively. Ligase inactive itch (itch-CA) was generated by substituting Cys830 with Ala using the megaprimer procedure (32Barik S. Methods in Molecular Biology.PCR Protocols, Current Methods and Applications. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 277-286Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, a forward primer encoding the mutation 5′-GAAGTCATACCGCTTTTAATCGCCTG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTG-3′ were used in a first amplification reaction. The resulting PCR fragment was used as a megaprimer with the forward primer 5′-GAGAATCGATAAGTCGACCAATGGGTAGCCTCACCATG-3′ to produce the full-length C830A mutant protein. GST-endophilin A1 constructs were described previously (27Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

All GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α and BL21 strains of Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG and Myc epitope tags were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against the γ-adaptin subunit of the AP-1 complex, the early endosomal antigen 1, and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and a monoclonal antibody against clathrin was produced from the hybridoma X22 (American Type Culture Collection). Anti-Golgi matrix protein of 130 kDa (GM130) and anti-itch monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibody against GFP was purchased from Molecular Probes. The anti-cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor polyclonal antibody used in Western blot experiments was a kind gift of Dr. Satoshi Waguri, Osaka University, Japan.

Approximately 15-h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 4 min, and processed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. For transferrin and EGF uptake assays, cells were serum-starved2hat37 °C and then incubated 1 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 μg/ml Cy3-transferrin (Jackson), 1 μg/ml Texas Red-EGF, or 1 μg/ml Alexa 647-EGF (Molecular Probes). Media was then replaced with 37 °C serum-free media, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were then rapidly acid washed, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence as required.Immunoprecipitation and Pull-down Assays—For cultured cells, 100-mm dishes of transfected HEK-293 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml/dish buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). The cells were sonicated and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Extracts were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. For brain extracts, adult rat brains were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1%, and the extract was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. For immunoprecipitation assays, extracts of transfected cells were precleared with either protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads. The precleared supernatants were then incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads for 4–16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with buffer A/1% Triton X-100 and prepared for Western blot analysis. For pull-down assays, extracts were incubated with 10 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein for 4–16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively in the same buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Recombinant ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and UbcH7 (E2) were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Endophilin A1, full-length itch, and itch CA proteins were produced as GST fusions and eluted from glutathione beads by thrombin cleavage. Ubiquitination reactions (25 μl) contained 10 μg of endophilin A1, ubiquitin (25 μm), ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (100 nm), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 E2 (0.5 μm), 1.75 μg of itch or itch CA, and ATP (4 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to Western blot.Endosome Purification—The preparation of early and late endosomal enriched fractions from cultured COS-7 cells was performed according to Gorvel et al. (35Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and then incubated on ice for 10 min in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.6 ml of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized at 4 °C by five passages through a 27.5 Gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected. The PNS was brought to 40.6% sucrose using a stock solution of 62% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA (final volume = 1 ml), loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and then sequentially overlaid with 1.3 ml of 35% sucrose in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA; 1 ml of 30% sucrose in the same buffer, and finally with homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 124,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Early and late endosomal fractions were collected at the 35%/30% sucrose interface and in the uppermost region of the 30% sucrose cushion, respectively.RESULTSThe Ubiquitin Ligase Itch Interacts with the SH3 Domain of Endophilin A1—The screening of a rat brain expression library with a GST fusion protein coupled to the SH3 domain of endophilin A1 yielded 18 clones encoding potential endophilin A1 binding partners (29Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.-K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Of these, two independent isolates encoded a rat homologue of the human E3 ubiquitin ligase itch/AIP4. To further validate the interaction, we co-transfected HEK-293 cells with a construct encoding full-length human itch with an N-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-itch) and an untagged endophilin A1 construct. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-itch with an anti-FLAG antibody led to co-immunoprecipitation of endophilin A1 (Fig. 1A). The FLAG antibody failed to immunoprecipitate endophilin A1 in protein extracts from cells transfected with endophilin A1 alone (Fig. 1A).We next sought to determine the regions of endophilin A1 and itch involved in the interaction. Full-length FLAG-itch expressed in HEK-293 cells specifically bound to GST fusion proteins of full-length endophilin A1 and the isolated SH3 domain but failed to bind to endophilin A1 lacking the SH3 domain (data not shown). These experiments confirmed that the SH3 domain of endophilin A1 mediates the interaction with itch. To determine the SH3 binding domain of itch, GST-itch fusion proteins were used in affinity selection assays from rat brain extracts. GST full-length itch bound to endophilin A1 with a near complete depletion of endophilin A1 from the extract (Fig. 1B, top panel). Deletion of the N-terminal C2 domain (itch ΔC2) did not affect the capacity of itch to bind endophilin A1, whereas further deletion of 44 amino acids containing the proline-rich domain (PRD) (itch ΔC2/ΔPRD) abolished the interaction (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Identical results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation analysis of FLAG-tagged itch deletions co-transfected with endophilin A1 (data not shown).To determine if the itch/endophilin A1 interaction is direct, we performed an overlay assay. Extracts from HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-Itch ΔC2, FLAG-Itch ΔC2/ΔPRD or mocktransfected cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with GST-endophilin A1 or GST alone. The GST proteins were subsequently detected with an anti-GST antibody. GST-endophilin A1 bound to FLAG-Itch ΔC2 but not to FLAG-Itch ΔC2/ΔPRD (Fig. 1C). No binding was detected in the mock-transfected lane or with GST alone (Fig. 1C).The 44 amino acids truncated in itch ΔC2/ΔPRD contain a short PRD, PSRPPRPSRPPPPTPRRP, which contains two sequences that resemble the consensus binding motif for the endophilin A1 SH3 domain (PXRPPXPR) (36Cestra G. Castagnoli L. Dente L. Minenkova O. Petrelli A. Migone N. Hoffmuller U. Schneider-Mergener J. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32001-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As detected by Coomassie Blue staining, endophilin A1 is the major protein affinity-selected from brain extracts by a GST-itch PRD fusion protein (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis confirmed the identity of the isolated band as endophilin A1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the itch PRD interacts preferentially with endophilin A1 versus other SH3 domain bearing proteins in brain. However, amphiphysin and intersectin, which contain one and five SH3 domains, respectively, were both detectable by Western blot as itch PRD binding partners (data not shown).Itch Ubiquitinates Endophilin A1—HECT domain ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family interact with their substrates through their WW domains, with recognition preferences for the motif PPX(Y/pY) (where pY = phosphorylated tyrosine) (37Otte L. Wiedemann U. Schlegel B. Pires J.R. Beyermann M. Schmieder P. Krause G. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Endophilin A1 does not contain such motifs but instead forms a stable complex with itch via its SH3 domain. Because of the unusual nature of this interaction for ubiquitin ligases, we sought to determine if endophilin A1 could serve as a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase activity of itch. We first utilized an in vitro ubiquitination assay with purified proteins. Recombinant endophilin A1 was incubated with purified mammalian ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), recombinant UbcH7 (E2), ubiquitin, and ATP. Wild-type (WT) full-length itch, from which the GST tag was removed with thrombin cleavage, and an itch mutant, in which the active site cysteine in the HECT domain was mutated to an alanine (CA) were added to the mixture. After incubation at room temperature, the reaction was resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody 1903 against endophilin A1. Ubiquitination of endophilin A1 in the presence of itch was detected by the presence of higher molecular weight bands, likely corresponding to the addition of one, two or three ubiquitin units (Fig. 2A). The ubiquitinated forms were detected at a level similar to the non-ubiquitinated protein suggesting a robust ubiquitination reaction (Fig. 2A). No ubiquitination of endophilin A1 was detected following incubation with itch CA (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Ubiquitination of endophilin A1 by itch. A, recombinant endophilin A1 was incubated with ubiquitin, E1, E2, and ATP in the presence of recombinant itch (WT) or an inactive mutant (CA) at 25 °C for 90 min. The reaction mixture was prepared for immunoblot (IB) with endophilin A1 antibody 1903. Ubiquitinated endophilin A1 (Ubn-Endo A1) is indicated. B, HEK-293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ubiquitin and GFP-endophilin A1, with (+) or without (-) plasmid encoding WT FLAG-itch (5 μg each). Cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody and immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-Myc (right panel). The same membrane was reprobed with anti-GFP (left panel). C, HEK-293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ubiquitin and GFP-endophilin A1 alone (-) or also with plasmids encoding WT Flag-itch, FLAG-itch CA (CA), FLAG-itch ΔC2, or FLAG-itch ΔC2/ΔPRD (5 μg each). Cell-lysates (sm) (upper panel) were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-FLAG or were processed for immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted (IB) with Myc antibody and the same membrane was reprobed with GFP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further explore itch-induced endophilin A1 ubiquitination, we used a cell-based approach (38Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.-Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged ubiquitin and GFP-endophilin A1, with or without FLAG-itch. Cells were left untreated for 48 h and GFP-endophilin A1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. GFP Western blots revealed equal levels of GFP-endophilin A1 in all immunoprecipitates. The immunoprecipitated proteins were blotted with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody to detect ubiquitination. Bands corresponding to mono- and poly-ubiquitinated GFP-endophilin A1 were detected only in cells ectopically expressing Flag-itch (Fig. 2B). Ubiquitinated forms of GFP-endophilin could also be detected in anti-GFP Western blots (Fig. 2B).To determine if ubiquitination of endophilin A1 by itch depends on the SH3/PRD interaction, we examined for the ability of different FLAG-tagged itch constructs to induce endophilin A1 ubiquitination. Co-transfection of wild-type (WT) itch with GFP-endophilin A1 led to ubiquitination of GFP-endophilin A1 as detected by anti-Myc Western blot (Fig. 2C). Ubiquitinated bands were also detected with antibody 1903 against endophilin A1 (data not shown). No ubiquitination was seen following co-transfection of the itch CA mutant (Fig. 2C). Truncation of the N-terminal C2 domain, which does not alter the interaction between itch and endophilin A1 (Fig. 1B), did not affect endophilin A1 ubiquitination when compared with wild-type protein (Fig. 2C). However, further truncation of the PRD domain, leaving the WWs and the HECT domain intact, reduced the ability of itch to induce endophilin A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2C). All of the FLAG-itch constructs were similarly expressed based on anti-FLAG Western blots and anti-GFP Western blots revealed similar levels of GFP-endophilin A1 in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C). Thus, the SH3/PRD interaction appears to facilitate the ability of itch to ubiquitinate endophilin A1.Itch Localizes to an Endosomal Compartment—The subcellular localization of itch has not been previously explored. We thus transfected COS-7 cells with GFP-tagged itch full-length constructs. At low and modera"
https://openalex.org/W2092323527,"Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcriptional activator that is essential for the coordinate transcriptional induction of various antioxidant drug-metabolizing enzymes. Numerous studies have firmly established Nrf2's importance in protection from oxidative stress and certain chemical insults. Given the protective function of Nrf2, surprisingly few studies have focused on the relationship between Nrf2 and apoptosis. Therefore, we analysed how Nrf2 influences Fas signaling using Nrf2-deficient T cells. At a concentration of 1 μg/ml, the anti-Fas antibody induced 60% of cell death in Nrf2-deficient cultured thymocytes while, using the same treatment, only 40% of Nrf2 wild-type thymocytes died (P<0.05). Nrf2 deficiency enhances the sensitivity of Fas-mediated apoptosis in T cells. Next we examined the effect of Nrf2 deficiency during hepatocellular apoptosis in vivo. In comparison to wild-type mice, Nrf2-deficient mice displayed more severe hepatitis after induction with the anti-Fas antibody or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The enhanced sensitivity to anti-Fas or TNF-α stimulation was restored by preadministration of glutathione ethyl monoester, a compound capable of passing the cell membrane and upregulating the intracellular levels of glutathione. The results indicated that Nrf2 activity regulates the sensitivity of death signals by means of intracellular glutathione levels."
https://openalex.org/W2133733198,"Adaptation to a specific niche theoretically constrains a population's ability to subsequently diversify into other niches. We tested this theory using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens , which diversifies into niche specialists when propagated in laboratory microcosms. Numerically dominant genotypes were allowed to diversify in isolation. As predicted, populations increased in fitness through time but showed a greatly decreased ability to diversify. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that niche generalists and reductions in intrinsic evolvability were not responsible for our data. These results show that niche specialization may come with a cost of reduced potential to diversify."
https://openalex.org/W2013883015,"Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is the prototype of a family of tumors (ESFT) of neuroectodermal origin formed by small, round cells with limited neural differentiation, which arise most frequently within bones in children or adolescents. The proliferation of ESFT cells is highly dependent on the establishment of, and signaling through several growth factor-mediated autocrine loops. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of translation and cell proliferation, involved in the cellular response to various nutritional, stress and mitogenic effectors. As mTOR has recently been associated with certain human cancers, we investigated the possibility that mTOR played a role in the regulation of ES cell proliferation. Results showed that ES cell lines carrying EWS/FLI-1 alleles of different types expressed different levels of total and phosphorylated mTOR protein. We demonstrate that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, efficiently blocked the proliferation of all cell lines by promoting cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. This was paralleled by the downregulation of the levels of the EWS/FLI-1 proteins, regardless of their fusion type, and the concomitant restoration of the expression of the TGF-beta type 2 receptor (TGFbeta RII), which is known to be repressed by several EWS-ETS fusion proteins. The expression of a rapamycin-resistant mTOR construct prevented both the proliferation blockade and the EWS/FLI-1 downregulation. These data demonstrate that mTOR signaling plays a central role in ES cell pathobiology and strongly suggest that the use of rapamycin as a cytostatic agent may be an efficient tool for the treatment of ES patients."
https://openalex.org/W2081187098,"The human HLA-B27 class I molecule exhibits a strong association with the inflammatory arthritic disorder ankylosing spondylitis and other related arthropathies. Major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains normally associate with β2-microglobulin and peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum before transit to the cell surface. However, an unusual characteristic of HLA-B27 is its ability to form heavy chain homodimers through an unpaired cysteine at position 67 in the peptide groove. Homodimers have previously been detected within the ER and at the cell surface, but their mechanism of formation and role in disease remain undefined. Here we demonstrate, in the rat C58 thymoma cell line and in human HeLa cells transfected with HLA-B27, that homodimer formation involves not only cysteine at position 67 but also the conserved structural cysteine at position 164. We also show that homodimer formation can be induced in the non-disease-associated HLA class I allele HLA-A2 by slowing its assembly rate by incubation of cells at 26 °C, suggesting that homodimer formation in the endoplasmic reticulum may occur as a result of the slower folding kinetics of HLA-B27. Finally, we report an association between unfolded HLA-B27 molecules and immunoglobulin-binding protein at the cell surface. The human HLA-B27 class I molecule exhibits a strong association with the inflammatory arthritic disorder ankylosing spondylitis and other related arthropathies. Major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains normally associate with β2-microglobulin and peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum before transit to the cell surface. However, an unusual characteristic of HLA-B27 is its ability to form heavy chain homodimers through an unpaired cysteine at position 67 in the peptide groove. Homodimers have previously been detected within the ER and at the cell surface, but their mechanism of formation and role in disease remain undefined. Here we demonstrate, in the rat C58 thymoma cell line and in human HeLa cells transfected with HLA-B27, that homodimer formation involves not only cysteine at position 67 but also the conserved structural cysteine at position 164.

Finally, we report an association between unfolded HLA-B27 molecules and immunoglobulin-binding protein at the cell surface. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; AS, ankylosing spondylitis; SpA, spondyloarthropathy; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HC-dimer, heavy chain homodimer; BiP, immunoglobulin-binding protein; NEM, N-methylmaleimide; IAA, iodoacetamide; endo H, endoglycosidase H; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing. class I molecule HLA-B27 is strongly associated with development of the inflammatory arthritic disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and other human spondyloarthropathies (SpAs) (1Brewerton D.A. Hart F.D. Nicholls A. Caffrey M. James D.C. Sturrock R.D. Lancet. 1973; 1: 904-907Abstract PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 2Schlosstein L. Terasaki P.I. Bluestone R. Pearson C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1973; 288: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Direct evidence supporting a role for HLA-B27 in the disease process has come from transgenic rats, which, under appropriate conditions, develop inflammatory arthritic disease with similar characteristics to human SpAs (3Hammer R.E. Maika S.D. Richardson J.A. Tang J.P. Taurog J.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 1099-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). HLA-B27 when expressed as a transgene in mice can also increase the incidence of a naturally occurring form of inflammatory arthritic disease, referred to as ankylosing enthesopathy (4Weinreich S. Eulderink F. Capkova J. Pla M. Gaede K. Heesemann J. van Alphen L. Zurcher C. Hoebe-Hewryk B. Kievits F. Ivanyi P. Hum. Immunol. 1995; 42: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The precise role that HLA-B27 plays in disease onset and progression remains undetermined. Several hypotheses have been formed to account for the strong association between HLA-B27 and SpAs (5Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 6de Castro J.A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Allen R.L.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The arthritogenic peptide hypothesis, for example, proposes that AS is a consequence of the antigen presentation function of HLA-B27. The presentation of pathogen-derived antigens that mimic self peptides presented by HLA-B27 would activate autoreactive T cells (6de Castro J.A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that SpAs may not be the result of antigen presentation by HLA-B27 but may arise because of aberrant folding of HLA-B27 molecules within the environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (9Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Support for the idea that HLA-B27 misfolding can contribute to inflammatory arthritis has come from transgenic mice expressing either HLA-B27 (10Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or endogenous MHC class I molecules that are unable to assemble for lack of β2-microglobulin (11Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Witte D.P. Taurog J.D. Roopenian D.C. Colbert R.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which develop a form of spontaneous inflammatory arthritis. In the transgenic rat model, disease occurs only in rats with a transgene copy number above a certain threshold (12Taurog J.D. Maika S.D. Simmons W.A. Breban M. Hammer R.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4168-4178PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that may potentially promote polypeptide misfolding. It is therefore possible that SpAs could be categorized alongside the increasing number of diseases now recognized to be caused by protein misfolding that have been referred to as ER storage or conformational diseases (13Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 836-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). SpAs could therefore be related to the intracellular assembly of HLA-B27, a process that normally involves a series of interactions with ER-resident chaperones that ensure appropriate folding (15Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Elliott T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains associate with calnexin, which, upon β2-microglobulin association, is displaced by calreticulin (16Zhang Q. Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3944-3948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Q. Salter R.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 831-837PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Both calnexin and calreticulin can recruit the oxidoreductase ERp57 into these early folding intermediates (19Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 20Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon calreticulin association, the partially folded MHC class I molecule associates with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) via the MHC class I-specific accessory molecule tapasin, thus forming the peptide loading complex (18Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). As part of the peptide loading complex, tapasin is disulfide-bonded to ERp57 (23Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and its function promotes the binding of optimal peptides by MHC class I molecules (25Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26Dick T.P. Cresswell P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) HLA-B27 exhibits several unusual characteristics. It displays a partially tapasin-independent route of peptide acquisition, which can lead to the binding and presentation of low affinity peptides and the formation of unstable cell surface molecules (27Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Within the ER, HLA-B27 exhibits an enhanced susceptibility to undergo ER-associated degradation (28Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar), a pathway utilized by misfolded MHC class I heavy chains (29Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Enhanced ER-associated degradation of HLA-B27 appears to be associated with slow folding kinetics, which is, at least in part, influenced by the composition of the B pocket of the peptide binding groove (28Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). A striking feature of HLA-B27 that has recently received much attention is its ability to form heavy chain homodimers (HC-dimers). In vitro folding studies revealed the capacity of HLA-B27 heavy chains to form HC-dimeric structures via a disulfide bridge at the relatively rare unpaired cysteine at position 67 (Cys67) in the α1 helical region of the peptide binding groove (30Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, two species of HC-dimers have been detected, one within the ER and another at the cell surface (31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These populations of HC-dimers appear to be distinct from each other, since cell surface HC-dimers arise from recycling of HLA-B27-β2-microglobulin complexes through an endocytic compartment (31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas ER-resident HC-dimers do not appear to transit the secretory pathway (32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Another evident feature of these studies was the detection of several HC-dimer structures by SDS-PAGE both in the presence (32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and absence of Cys67 (31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other HLA alleles that do not possess an unpaired Cys67 (e.g. HLA-B7) can form HC-dimers (32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Nößner E. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that cysteine residues other than Cys67 could be involved in HC-dimerization. HC-dimers therefore have two potential ways in which they may be involved in SpAs: mispresentation of peptides and subsequent immune recognition of the HC-dimer structures at the cell surface (34Boyle L.H. Goodall J.C. Opat S.S. Gaston J.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Allen R.L. Raine T. Haude A. Trowsdale J. Wilson M.J. J.

Bird L. Sun M.Y. Retiere C. Braud V.M. McMichael A. Bowness P. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), or, alternatively, HC-dimers within the ER may induce ER stress responses (9Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, it remains undetermined how the assembly characteristics of HLA-B27 are related to the formation of HC-dimers and whether these features play a direct role in SpA pathogenesis. The rat model for AS is the best characterized with respect to disease pathology (38Taurog J.D. Maika S.D. Satumtira N. Dorris M.L. McLean I.L. Yanagisawa H. Sayad A. Stagg A.J. Fox G.M. Le O'Brien A. Rehman M. Zhou M. Weiner A.L. Splawski J.B. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To complement studies of HLA-B27 in the transgenic rat model of AS, we have undertaken a study of the assembly of the disease associated HLA-B*2705 allele when expressed in the rat C58 thymoma cell line. By mutating the conserved structural cysteines of HLA-B27, we demonstrate that HC-dimer formation not only involves Cys67 but can also involve the structural cysteine at position 164 (Cys164). The formation of HC-dimers is not due simply to the presence of Cys67, since the introduction of Cys67 into the non-disease-associated HLA-A2 molecule did not lead to HC-dimer formation. However, HC-dimer formation appears to be related to the assembly rate of HLA-B27. Following incubation at 26 °C, HLA-A2 can adopt similar folding kinetics to HLA-B27 and can form HC-dimeric structures. In addition, we demonstrate that residues flanking position 67 can influence the rate of assembly and contribute to HC-dimer formation. Finally, we provide evidence that unfolded HLA-B27 associates with immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) at the cell surface. DNA and Cell Lines—The C58 thymoma cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. C58.B27, B27.C67S, B27.C101S, B27.C164S, B27.C259S, C58.A2, A2.V67C, A2.C101S, A2.C164S, A2.C203S, and A2.C259S cells were generated by electroporation of cDNA in vector pCR3 (Invitrogen) with selection in 1 mg/ml G418. B*2705 and A*2010 cDNAs were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange (Stratagene) methodology and sequenced to confirm mutagenesis. T2 and Daudi cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 5% fetal calf serum. Transfectant T2.B27 (expressing B*2705) was a gift from Louise Boyle and Hill Gaston (Cambridge, UK). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were transiently transfected using 4 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) per well of a 6-well plate, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies and antisera used were as follows: pK (anti-Sv5 tag), ME1 (recognizing folded HLA-B molecules (39Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)), BB7.2 (anti-HLA-A2 (40Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Hum. Immunol. 1981; 3: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar)), HC10 (recognizing unassembled HLA-B and -C (41Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar)), anti-ERp57 antiserum (courtesy of N. Bulleid, Manchester, UK), anti-calnexin antiserum (courtesy of D. Williams, Toronto, Canada), and SPA 826 anti-BiP antiserum (Stressgen). Immunoblotting of Cell Lysates—Cell lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmN-methylmaleimide (NEM) (Sigma)). Lysates were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (DuPont), blocked in 5% powdered milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween, and probed overnight with relevant antibodies. Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-κ light chain IgG (Caltag) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and visualized with Supersignal West Pico and Femto chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations—Pulse-chase, lysis, immunoprecipitations, and endoglycosidase H (endo H; Roche Applied Science) digestions were performed essentially as previously described (42Powis S.J. Deverson E.V. Coadwell W.J. Ciruela A. Huskisson N.S. Smith H. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1992; 357: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 43Powis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were cysteine/methionine-starved for 30 min, labeled with 3.7 MBq of Trans label (ICN) for 10 min, lysed, precleared, and immunoprecipitated for 1 h. Washed immune complexes were digested for 1 h with endo H and analyzed reduced on 8% SDS-PAGE. For chaperone studies, cells were pretreated with 20 mm NEM on ice for 15 min, lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and precleared as described followed by immunoprecipitation with pK anti-Sv5 antibody and analyzed nonreduced on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by immunoblotting. Cell Surface Biotinylation—1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl biotin (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer supplemented with 10 mm iodoacetamide (IAA) or NEM. Immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with Extravidin (Sigma), followed by development with chemiluminescent reagents as above. Cysteines 67 and 164 Influence Homodimer Formation—Previously, Cys67 has been implicated in HC-dimer formation in both in vitro folding experiments and during in vivo expression (30Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In vivo studies intriguingly detected several HC-dimer species (31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the conserved structural cysteine residues at positions 101, 164, 203, and 259, which form intrachain disulfides, could also influence HC-dimer formation. Each of these cysteine residues was mutated to serine in an HLA-B*2705 (B27) cDNA that was additionally C-terminally tagged with the Sv5 epitope and expressed in the rat C58 thymoma cell line. NEM-treated whole cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-Sv5 epitope tag antibody pK. HC-dimer structures were detected in wild type B27, C101S, and C259S cells (Fig. 1A, non-reduced panel). HC-dimers were essentially undetectable in C67S cells, although very long exposures revealed a faint band in this region (data not shown), which is in accordance with previous reports (31Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Dangoria N.S. DeLay M.L. Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Colbert R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23459-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). HC-dimers were also not strongly detected in C164S cells. This observation suggests that HC-dimer formation in the ER is not solely a Cys67-Cys67-mediated event but can involve Cys164. To further define the role of Cys67 in homodimer formation, we replaced the valine at position 67 (Val67) in HLA-A2 (an HLA allele that is not associated with human SpAs) with cysteine (A2.V67C). We also mutated the conserved cysteine residues in HLA-A2 (A2.C101S, A2.C164S, A2.C203S, and A2.C259S). Lysates were immunoblotted with pK antibody. The addition of a cysteine residue at position 67 in A2.V67C cells failed to induce obvious HC-dimeric structures (Fig. 1B, non-reduced panel). HC-dimers were also not detected in A2.C164S, A2.C203S, and A2.C259S cells. However, a faint HC-dimer structure was detected in the A2.C101S mutant, which may reflect some HC-dimer formation induced through the now unpaired Cys164 residue. These observations suggest that in non-Cys67-containing alleles, the introduction of Cys67 alone is not sufficient for HC-dimer formation and that other factors or residues may influence or be required in this process. To confirm that the core of our observations were not due to cross-species differences in the assembly of HLA alleles in rat cells, we transiently expressed cDNAs encoding B27 and mutants C67S and C164S in the human HeLa cell line. Immunoblotting cell lysates with HC10 revealed that C67S significantly reduced the number and complexity of HC-dimer formation (Fig. 1C), essentially leaving one band, which was similar to that seen in C58 cells upon long exposure (see above). Furthermore, expressing increasing amounts of mutant C164S failed to result in the appearance of significant HC-dimers as seen for wild type B27 (Fig. 1D). Cysteine at Position 67 Slows the Folding of MHC Class I Heavy Chains—The folding rate of HLA-B27 can be influenced by residues making up the B pocket, which include Cys67 (28Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined the impact of Cys67 on the folding of HLA class I heavy chains in C58 cells. C58.B27, B27.C67S, and C58.A2 cells were metabolically labeled, chased for 0, 1, and 2 h, and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with the conformation-sensitive antibodies ME1 or BB7.2. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were treated with endo H to assess exit from the ER. HLA-A2 molecules assemble and exit the ER at a faster rate than HLA-B27 molecules (Fig. 2A), replicating the slower folding kinetics seen for HLA-B27 in human cells. It was of interest that in B27.C67S cells a slightly faster rate of ER exit was observed in comparison with wild type B27, with essentially full endo H resistance being attained after 2 h of chase, indicating that Cys67 affects the assembly of HLA-B27. To further determine the impact of Cys67 on assembly kinetics, we performed similar experiments comparing B27, B27.C67S, A2, and A2.V67C cells using the conformation-independent pK antibody directed to the C-terminal epitope tag, thus allowing detection of the complete pool of class I molecules and removing any likely influence of the induced mutations upon antibody recognition (44el-Zaatari F.A. Sams K.C. Taurog J.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1512-1517PubMed Google Scholar). This approach revealed a large pool of ER-resident (endo H-sensitive) molecules in C58.B27 cells, even after 3 h of chase. By contrast, in B27.C67S cells, this ER-resident pool was not so prevalent. In C58.A2 cells isolation of the full pool of A2 also revealed the ER retention of a pool of A2 molecules, but far less than occurred with B27. Moreover, the introduction of Cys67 into A2 molecules resulted in a partial slowing of its exit from the ER (compare the amount of endo H resistant material at 1 h of chase). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of Cys67 significantly slows the assembly and/or exit of a class I molecules from the ER. Reduced Temperature Enhances and Induces Homodimer Formation in HLA-B27 and HLA-A2, Respectively—The introduction of cysteine at position 67 and the resulting small reduction in folding kinetics in HLA-A2 is not sufficient for HC-dimer formation (Figs. 1 and 2). The pulse-chase experiment in Fig. 2B suggests that A2.V67C can, moderately, fold more efficiently than wild type HLA-B27. We therefore attempted to further reduce the folding kinetics of A2 by incubating cells at 26 °C. Cells incubated overnight at 26 °C were metabolically labeled, chased, and immunoprecipitated with pK antibody. Under these conditions, the ER exit of A2 resembled closely that of wild type B27 (Fig. 2, compare B and C). We next determined the effect of 26 °C treatment on HC-dimer formation in B27, A2, and their respective mutants (Fig. 3). Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates revealed that 26 °C treatment enhances the presence of B27 HC-dimers in wild type and mutant B27 molecules (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, 26 °C treatment also induced C67S to form more obvious HC-dimer structures. Similar treatment of A2-expressing cells unexpectedly revealed the formation HC-dimer structures in varying amounts (Fig. 3B). Most notably, the presence of V67C now permitted enhanced formation of HC-dimers compared with wild type A2. In order to eliminate the possibility that the observed high molecular weight structures were not the result of enhanced interactions between ERp57 and class I (45Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-ERp57 antibodies. None of the bands observed in Fig. 3B could be ascribed to ERp57-class I complexes (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the folding efficiency of a class I molecule in the ER can influence its ability to form into HC-dimer structures. Thus, B27, due to its slower folding, may be predisposed to the formation of HC-dimers in the ER. We also characterized the rate of HLA-A2 HC-dimer formation at 26 °C. A2, A2.V67C, A2.C101S, A2.C164S, and A2.C203S cells were compared with B27. Following 26 °C incubation, B27 HC-dimer formation increased with time (Fig. 4, top left panel). Similarly, in A2 and its mutants, HC-dimers appeared with increasing time, but usually required overnight incubation to be present in sufficient amounts for detection by immunoblotting. We further asked whether treatment at reduced temperature could reveal HC-dimer formation in human cell lines. T2 (TAP-deficient), T2.B27, and Daudi (β2-microglobulin-deficient) cells were immunoblotted with HC10 after incubation at reduced temperature, revealing in each case the formation of HC-dimers (Fig. 4B). Thus, HC-dimer induction at reduced temperature is not restricted to cross-species expression of HLA in rat cells. Effect of Reduced Temperature and Cys67 upon Interactions with ER Chaperones—Whereas we failed to detect class I-ERp57 complexes in the immunoblotting of whole cell lysates shown in Fig. 3, we were interested to know whether 26 °C treatment could indeed enhance class I-ERp57 and other chaperone interactions. In previous work, we have only been able to detect such class I-ERp57 interactions in large scale immunoprecipitations of cell lines, most likely due to the very transient nature of oxidoreductase interactions with substrates in the ER (45Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Large scale pK immunoprecipitations of C58.B27, B27.C67S, A2, and A2.V67C were performed, and nonreduced samples were immunoblotted for ERp57, calnexin, BiP, and calreticulin (Fig. 5). Immunoblotting for ERp57 revealed the presence of class I-ERp57 complexes in both wild type and C67S versions of HLA-B27, which did not appreciably alter upon treatment at 26 °C. By contrast, ERp57-class I complexes involving HLA-A2 could only be detected in A2.V67C cells incubated at 26 °C. Calnexin was present in association with B27 and B27.C67S, again unaltered by temperature treatment. In contrast to the absence of ERp57, calnexin could be detected in association with wild type A2 and more strongly with mutant V67C. Interest"

We examined the effects of ovariectomy and estrogen supplement on the levels of synaptic zinc and zinc transporter protein Znt3 in the brain. Ovariectomy was performed on 5-month-old mice, and 2 weeks later, pellets containing vehicle, low (0.18 mg/pellet), or high dose (0.72 mg) 17β-estradiol were implanted. After 4 weeks, animals were decapitated, and blood and brain were collected for analysis. Blood analysis indicated that estrogen implants altered plasma estrogen levels in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of brain tissue showed that ovariectomy raised hippocampal synaptic vesicle zinc levels, whereas estrogen replacement lowered these zinc levels. Western blots revealed that Znt3 levels in the brain were modulated in parallel with synaptic zinc levels, whereas no change was detected in the levels of Znt3 mRNA, as determined by Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. However, mRNA levels of the δ subunit of adaptor protein complex (AP)-3, which modulates the level of Znt3 levels, were altered by estrogen depletion or replacement. These data demonstrate that estrogen alters the levels of Znt3 and synaptic vesicle zinc in female mice, probably through changing AP-3 δ expression. Since synaptic zinc may play a key role in neuronal death in acute brain injury as well as in plaque formation in Alzheimer’s disease, and since estrogen may be beneficial in both conditions, our results may provide new insights into the effects of estrogen on the brain.

Consistent with the idea that changes in sex hormone levels underlie this phenomenon, there are evidences that estrogen replacement therapy reduces the incidence and severity of AD in postmenopausal women (4Tang M.X.

Although the sex dependence of AD pathogenesis is intriguing, how it arises and how estrogen might protect against AD is poorly understood. Animal models such as the human Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic (Tg2576) mouse (7Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar) may be useful in investigations of AD gender difference since the plaque load in Tg2576 mice shows the same intersex disparity as in humans (8Callahan M.J.

These findings suggest that AD gender correlations may derive from differences in the rate of amyloid plaque formation. Consistent with these observations, it appears estrogen may affect various steps in β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, such as synthesis (10Xu H. Gouras G.K. Greenfield J.P. Vincent B. Naslund J.

Recent evidence indicates that endogenous metal ions such as zinc, copper, and iron contribute to Aβ aggregation and plaque accumulation. Zinc and copper were shown to induce rapid aggregation of synthetic Aβ in an aqueous environment (14Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K.

In addition, concentrations of transition metals including zinc and copper are elevated in brains of AD patients (17Deibel M.A. Ehmann W.D. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol.

Furthermore, treatment with metal chelators resulted in the dissolution of aggregated Aβ from AD brain extracts (22Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D.P. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Endogenous zinc in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles constitutes 10–30% of total brain zinc (24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This zinc appears to play a disproportionately large role in Aβ aggregation and plaque formation since removal of synaptic vesicle zinc by deleting the Znt3 gene (24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) resulted in a 70–80% decrease in the levels of insoluble Aβ and congophilic plaques in Tg2576 mice (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the level of synaptic zinc is greater in aged female than male Tg2576 mice (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Since the gender difference in plaque burden in Tg2576 mice disappeared when synaptic vesicle zinc was removed, it appears that different synaptic zinc levels may explain differences between plaque formation and AD occurrence in males and females (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether manipulation of estrogen levels by ovariectomy, or ovariectomy plus estrogen replacement, would alter synaptic zinc levels in the mouse brain. In addition, we examined whether changes in estrogen levels altered Znt3 expression since Znt3 is the protein solely responsible for zinc transport into synaptic vesicles. Animals—Production and genotyping of Znt3-null mice was performed as described previously (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wild-type (Znt3+/+) and nullmutant (Znt3–/–) mice were bred and maintained using a C57Bl6/129sv hybrid background in the Animal Facility of the University of Ulsan College of Medicine (Seoul, Korea). Mice were allowed free access to water and food in a 12-h light/dark cycle before and during experiments. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of Ulsan Guidelines for Laboratory Animal Care and Use. Each group of experimental animals consisted of 10 female mice. At the time of sacrifice, seven mice were used for metal and histological analysis, whereas three mice were used for protein and mRNA analysis. Ovariectomy and Estrogen Replacement—Both ovaries of female mice at 5 months of age were surgically removed under ketaminexylazine anesthesia. After 2 weeks, a pellet containing either 17β-estradiol (E2; 0.18 or 0.72 mg/pellet) or placebo vehicles was implanted subcutaneously at the scruff of the neck. The pellets were designed to release their contents continuously for 60 days (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL). The pellet-implanted animals were housed in a controlled animal facility for 4 weeks. Quantitative Determination of Plasma 17β-Estradiol—On the 29th day after pellet implantation, blood was withdrawn from the inferior vena cava into a heparinized syringe under anesthesia. Blood plasma was collected following centrifugation, and plasma 17β-estradiol concentrations were determined using an E2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BioSorce, Camarillo, CA). Tissue Preparation—Following blood collection, the brain was rapidly removed, dissected into two hemispheres, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After dissecting out the cerebellum, the left hemisphere of the cerebrum was weighed and stored at –80 °C for metal assay. For histological evaluation, coronal sections (12-μm thickness) of the right hemisphere were obtained using a cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Metal Analysis—The left hemisphere was lyophilized, digested in ultrapure nitric acid, and then dried by evaporation. The appropriate dilution of 1% HNO3 was added to brain samples prior to triplicated metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using an Ultramass 700 spectrophotometer (Varian, Victoria, Australia). Histofluorescent Zinc-specific Staining and Measurement of Vesicular Zinc—Unfixed brain sections were stained with a zinc-specific fluorescent dye, N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide (TSQ, 4.5 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 140 mm sodium barbital and 140 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 10.0) for 90 s (25Frederickson C.J. Kasarskis E.J. Ringo D. Frederickson R.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). After washing with saline, TSQ-stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (dichroic mirror, 400 nm; excitation filter, 330–385 nm; barrier filter, 420 nm) (BX60; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed with a digital camera (Camedia C2000-Z; Olympus). The quantification for vesicular zinc was conducted as described previously (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity in the mossy fiber region of the hippocampus, which was taken from bregma + 4.5 mm, was determined with a computer-assisted image analysis program (Image-Pro, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). After subtraction of background fluorescence (taken as fluorescence in the thalamus, which lacks vesicular zinc (24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar)), all values were normalized to the mean fluorescence in 6-month-old male mice, which was given a value of 100%. Znt3 Immunohistochemistry—To evaluate the impact of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement (E2 supplement) on Znt3 levels, we immunologically stained brain sections, as described previously (26Wenzel H.J. Cole T.B. Born D.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12676-12681Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated with an affinity-purified anti-Znt3 antibody, which was diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline (0.05 m Tris·HCl buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum, and 0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide, and then stained following the routine ABC staining method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The stain was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.003% H2O2, and sections were examined and photographed using a bright-field microscope (Olympus). Protein Analysis by Western Blots—The cerebellum was removed from the brain, and the cerebrum was dissected into two hemispheres. The right hemisphere was homogenized in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), centrifuged at 14,800 × g, and the supernatant protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins (120 μg) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.4) containing 20% methanol. The membrane was then blocked in 5% fat-free dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. After overnight incubation with antibodies specific for Znt3 (26Wenzel H.J. Cole T.B. Born D.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12676-12681Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), synaptophysin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000 dilution in 3% fat-free milk-phosphate-buffered saline solution), the blot was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Pierce) and the AutoChemi™ imaging system (UVP, Cambridge, UK). Analysis of Znt3 mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from the left hemisphere of the cerebrum using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a Superscript™ One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized as primers specific for mouse Znt3 (GenBank™ accession number NM-011773), β-actin (X03672), Ap1g (the gene for AP-1 γ subunit; BC054535), and Ap3d (for AP-3 δ; BC037477) or Ap3s (for AP-3 σ; AF084575) (Cosmo, Seoul, Korea): 5′-ATC CTC CTG TAC CTG GCC TT-3′ (Znt3 sense) and 5′-GAT GGA GAT CAT GGG TTG CT-3′ (Znt3 antisense); 5′-CGC ATC CTC TTC CTC CCT GGA-3′ (β-actin sense) and 5′-CCT AGA AGC ACT TGC GGT GCA-3′ (β-actin antisense); 5′-GGA GTG CCT CAA GCT AAT CG-3′ (Ap1g sense) and 5′-GTA CCT GCA AAA AGG GGT CA-3′ (Ap1g antisense); 5′-CCA ACG CAA TGG TAT CTG TG-3′ (Ap3d sense) and 5′-CCT TGG GTT TCT CAT CCT CA-3′ (Ap3d antisense); and 5′-ACG CAA CAG CAA ATC ATC AG-3′ (Ap3s sense) and 5′-TTA AAA GAG GGC AGG TTT GG-3′ (Ap3s antisense). After PCR amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis was used to identify Znt3 (493 bp), β-actin (440 bp), Ap1g (548 bp), Ap3d (509 bp), or Ap3s (500 bp) fragments. In addition, we evaluated mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA (10 μg) was resolved on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond™-N+; Amersham Biosciences). After immobilizing RNA by UV cross-linking, membranes were prehybridized in a hybridization solution (ExpressHyb; Clontech) and then hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for Znt3, β-actin, Ap1g, Ap3d, or Ap3s in the same solution. cDNA probes corresponding to the above RT-PCR products were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed at 65 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution and subjected to autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—All evaluations were performed in an evaluator-blinded manner. All values represent mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Ovaries of female Znt3+/+ mice were surgically removed at 5 months of age, and mice were then divided into three groups of 10. Two weeks after ovariectomy, mice were subcutaneously implanted with sustained release (60 day) pellets containing vehicle only or low dose 17β-estradiol (0.18 mg) or high dose 17β-estradiol (0.72 mg). Four weeks after pellet implantation, blood samples and brains were harvested for analysis. Plasma levels of 17β-estradiol were determined (Table I). In non-operated controls, the levels of 17β-estradiol were about 13–14 pg/ml in 6-month-old female mice and 10–11 pg/ml in 15-month-old female mice, indicating that estrogen levels decrease with aging (p < 0.05 by analysis of variance). When compared with non-operated controls, 6-month-old ovariectomized mice had substantially lower 17β-estradiol plasma levels. In contrast, 6-month-old ovariectomized mice that received low or high dose 17β-estradiol had dose-dependently higher 17β-estradiol plasma levels when compared with both control and ovariectomized mice.Table IPlasma levels of 17β -estradiol in female mice n = 10 each.Group17β-Estradiol, mean ± S.E.pg/mlControl (6 months)13.9 ± 0.5Control (15 months)10.9 ± 0.5OVXaOVX, ovariectomy. + placebo5.6 ± 0.2OVX + E2 (0.18 mg)127.4 ± 3.6OVX + E2 (0.72 mg)810.8 ± 18.6a OVX, ovariectomy. Open table in a new tab Mice brains were assayed for synaptic vesicle zinc levels. In non-operated mice, we found that 15-month-old female mice had slightly higher synaptic vesicle zinc levels when compared with 6-month-old female mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A), consistent with our previous data demonstrating an age-dependent increase in the levels of synaptic zinc in female mice (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although the levels of total brain zinc in ovariectomized mice were only about 10% higher than those in age-matched control females (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B), the levels of synaptic vesicle zinc were about 50% higher, as determined by TSQ fluorescence, an indicator of synaptic vesicle zinc (p < 0.05) (Figs. 1B and 2). Since synaptic vesicle zinc comprises 10–30% of total brain zinc (24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), most changes in total zinc could be attributed to the increase in synaptic vesicle zinc. In support of this concept, in Znt3–/– mice that completely lack synaptic vesicle zinc, neither ovariectomy nor estrogen replacement altered total zinc levels (Fig. 1C). In contrast, in ovariectomized Znt3+/+ mice, estrogen replacements substantially reduced the levels of total and synaptic zinc in an estrogen dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1B and 2). High dose estrogen treatment caused synaptic vesicle zinc levels to fall below those in control non-operated mice.Fig. 2Histofluorescent synaptic zinc in the hippocampus. Fluorescence photomicrographs of TSQ-stained hippocampi sections from Znt3–/– mice (A), or from non-operated/untreated (B), ovariectomized/placebo-treated (C), and ovariectomized/17β-estradiol (0.72 mg/pellet)-treated (D) Znt3+/+ mice are shown.

Western blots revealed that ovariectomy slightly increased the levels of Znt3 protein (Fig. 3). In contrast, Znt3 levels were markedly reduced by estrogen replacement in ovariectomized mice. Indeed, Znt3 levels in ovariectomy plus estrogen-supplemented mice were lower than those in control mice (Fig. 3), consistent with the higher levels of estrogen in 17β-estradiol-supplemented mice than in control mice (Table I). Similar changes in Znt3 expression were noted following immunohistochemical staining. Anti-Znt3 antibody immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, particularly in mossy fibers, was increased in ovariectomized mice. Estrogen replacements down-regulated Znt3 levels to below controls (Fig. 3). Other reports have shown that estrogen replacement affects synapse number (27Murphy D.D. Cole N.B. Segal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11412-11417Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 28Amateau S.K. McCarthy M.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may contribute to changes in overall Znt3 levels. Using Western blotting, we examined the level of synaptophysin, a synapse-specific protein. The level of synaptophysin in the brain was unaffected by ovariectomy or estrogen replacements (Fig. 3), indicating that changes in Znt3 levels following ovariectomy or estrogen supplement were not caused by changes in synapse numbers. To understand more about the changes in Znt3 protein levels, we examined Znt3 mRNA levels using both RT-PCR and Northern blot assays. We found that neither ovariectomy nor ovariectomy plus estrogen treatment altered the levels of Znt3 transcripts (Fig. 4). Brain tissues from Znt3–/– and Znt3+/– (heterozygotes) mice showed no and intermediate levels of Znt3 transcripts, respectively. These data suggest that estrogen affects Znt3 levels through post-transcriptional events. Previous studies (29Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D.

Genome. 2003; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that both Znt3 and synaptic vesicle zinc were remarkably reduced in the brain of mocha mice, in which the entire AP-3 complex was completely depleted by the genetic ablation of δ subunit. Thus, we examined whether estrogen depletion or replacement modulate expression of adaptor protein complexes in transcriptional level. Indeed, Ap3d transcript level in the brain of ovariectomized Znt3+/+ mice was higher than that in controls. Conversely, estrogen replacement lowered the level of Ap3d mRNA in ovariectomized rat brains (Fig. 5). On the other hand, transcript levels of the other AP subunits (Ap3s and Ap1g) were not altered by ovariectomy or estrogen replacement. Whether estrogen should be used for AD treatment appears unclear since some studies have concluded that estrogen replacement may reduce the incidence or severity of AD (4Tang M.X. Jacobs D. Stern Y.

Int. 2001; 39: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of the protein. The present results suggest an additional mechanism of action of estrogen. Our data indicate that estrogens may reduce the formation of mature plaques by down-regulating the levels of synaptic zinc, which contributes to the transformation of soluble Aβ into insoluble forms (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This effect appeared to be due to a reduction in the level of Znt3, the protein required for accumulation of synaptic vesicle zinc. Endogenous metals such as zinc and copper have been implicated as promoters of Aβ aggregation in AD (14Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K.

The levels of zinc and copper are higher in brains of AD patients (17Deibel M.A. Ehmann W.D. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Moreover, histochemical staining with zinc-specific fluorescent dyes revealed high levels of labile zinc in Aβ plaques of Tg2576 mice (20Lee J.Y. Mook-Jung I. Koh J.Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19 (1–5): RC10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AD patients (34Suh S.W. Jensen K.B. Jensen M.S. Silva D.S. Kesslak P.J. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Of various pools of brain zinc, synaptic vesicle zinc, which constitutes 10–30% of total brain zinc, may play a disproportionately critical role since removal of synaptic vesicle zinc results in a 70–80% reduction in amyloid plaques (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicle zinc is a special pool of zinc in the brain. It is localized mainly inside glutamatergic synaptic vesicles of the forebrain (35Martinez-Guijarro F.J. Soriano E. Del Rio J.A. Lopez-Garcia C. J. Neurocytol. 1991; 20: 834-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and probably because of its lability, can be identified using simple histochemical techniques such as Timm's staining or dye fluorescence (25Frederickson C.J. Kasarskis E.J. Ringo D. Frederickson R.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 36Perez-Clausell J. Danscher G. Brain Res. 1985; 337: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Like other neurotransmitters, zinc in synaptic vesicles is released with neuronal activity (37Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 38Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) and may play diverse physiological roles in synaptic transmission upon release (39Li Y. Hough C.J. Frederickson C.J. Sarvey J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8015-8025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ueno S. Tsukamoto M. Hirano T. Kikuchi K. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Nagano T. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, zinc may gain access into neuron cytoplasm and serves signaling functions (41Koh J.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 24: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicle zinc may also have pathological roles. In addition to the above-mentioned role in Aβ aggregation, excessive release of synaptic zinc may contribute to neuron death in various models of acute brain injury (42Frederickson C.J. Hernandez M.D. McGinty J.F. Brain Res. 1989; 480: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 43Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J. He Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W.

Brain Res. 2000; 852: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Hence, understanding the mechanisms regulating synaptic vesicle zinc levels appears important. Znt3 appears to be the membrane protein necessary for synaptic vesicle zinc transport since genetic deletion of Znt3 results in complete disappearance of synaptic vesicle zinc without altering the levels of the major protein-bound zinc pool (24Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the brain, expression of Znt3 is developmentally regulated (45Valente T. Auladell C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other than this developmental modulation in expression, little information is available as to the mechanisms regulating Znt3 levels in the brain. In a previous study, we noted increased synaptic vesicle zinc levels in female Tg2576 mice, which have higher plaque burdens than male mice (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Since the sex-dependent difference in plaque burden disappeared in Znt3-null mice, we hypothesized that sex-dependent factors such as estrogen may modulate the levels of synaptic vesicle zinc by regulating Znt3 expression. The present results indicate that brain levels of synaptic vesicle zinc are affected by changes in the level of estrogen. Whereas ovariectomy increased the levels of synaptic vesicle zinc in the brain, estrogen replacement reduced levels. Since total zinc levels in the brain did not alter greatly, estrogen may specifically modulate the levels of synaptic zinc. Our data indicate that the effect of estrogen on synaptic zinc levels was mediated by changes in Znt3 levels. Ovariectomy increased the levels of Znt3, whereas estrogen replacement reduced Znt3 levels, indicating that estrogen regulates Znt3 levels in the brain. Increases in synaptic vesicle zinc in 12-month-old female mice (9Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) might be the result of a rapid decline in estrogen levels and the consequent increase in Znt3 levels around that age. In the present study, estrogen regulation of Znt3 did not appear to be the result of changes in the synaptic integrity since synaptophysin levels in the cerebrum were not altered by ovariectomy or estrogen replacement. We did not detect any change in Znt3 mRNA levels by RT-PCR or Northern blot analysis, suggesting that modulation of Znt3 by estrogen occurs at the level of protein metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that the genetic ablation of the AP-3δ subunit in mocha mice caused the lack of Znt3 with less alteration of synaptic integrity in the brain (29Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

Genome. 2003; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the mocha mice, whereas the transcript level of another AP-3 subunit σ (Ap3s) (and presumably also the other subunits) was normal, the AP-3 subunit peptides (β, μ, and σ) disappeared, perhaps due to the instability (29Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

In our study, changes in the level of estrogen are inversely correlated with the levels of both Znt3 protein and Ap3d transcripts but not with those of Znt3 or Ap3s transcripts. These results suggest that estrogen modulates the levels of AP-3 complex in the brain via altering the expression of Ap3d transcripts, which in turn results in changes in the levels of Znt3 and synaptic vesicle zinc. It would be interesting to see whether other proteins that are under the control of the AP-3 complex (29Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D.

Despite increasing interest in the neurobiology of synaptic vesicle zinc (46Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 47Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), little information is available as to its regulation. The present results show for the first time that estrogen modulates Znt3 levels, the key protein for synaptic vesicle zinc transport. Since synaptic vesicle zinc contributes to neuron death in certain models of acute brain injury (46Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), the protective effects of estrogens in those models (48Yang S.H. Shi J. Day A.L. Simpkins J.W.

In addition, estrogen-dependent reduction of amyloid plaques in Tg2576 mice may also result partly from reduced levels of Znt3 and synaptic vesicle zinc. Further studies appear warranted to understand the mechanisms regulating Znt3 function and the pathophysiological significance of such regulation."

Male transgenic mice were subjected to BDL or sham surgery prior to sacrifice on days 3, 6, and 10, and others were injected with intraperitoneal lithocholic acid (LCA) or vehicle alone.

Individual bile acids were quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Serum 6β-hydroxylated bile acids were increased following BDL, confirming the physiological relevance of endogenous Cyp3a induction to bile acid detoxification. Although concentrations of conjugated primary bile acids increased after BDL, there was no increase in LCA, a putative PXR ligand, indicating that this cannot be the only endogenous bile acid mediating this protective response.

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate absorption, transport, and distribution of lipid-soluble fats and vitamins, and excretion of lipids and cholesterol. However, hydrophobic bile acids are inherently cytotoxic and their formation and elimination must be tightly regulated. This homeostasis is provided by two general pathways: (i) feed-forward regulation, where toxic bile acids trigger an adaptive protective response, which results in an increase in expression of a range of genes responsible for bile acid detoxification and/or excretion; and (ii) feedback regulation, where accumulating bile acids cause reduced transcription of genes such as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 1The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; α-HCA, α-hyocholic acid; β-MCA, β-muricholic acid; α-MCA, α-muricholic acid; 3-keto-LCA, 3-keto-lithocholic acid; ALT, alanine aminotransaminase; BDL, bile duct ligation; CA, cholic acid; CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CYP, cytochrome P450; CYP3A, cytochrome P450 3A; DCA, deoxycholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; GCA, glycocholic acid; GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GLCA, glycolithocholic acid; GUDCA, glycoursodeoxycholic acid; HDCA, hyodeoxycholic acid; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; LCA, lithocholic acid; MDCA, murideoxycholic acid; OH, hydroxylated; ONPG, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PXR, pregnane X receptor or steroid and xenobiotic receptor; Tβ-MCA, tauro-β-muricholic acid; TCA, taurocholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; TDCA, taurodeoxycholic acid; TLCA, taurolithocholic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic acid; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; VDR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D receptor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; α-HCA, α-hyocholic acid; β-MCA, β-muricholic acid; α-MCA, α-muricholic acid; 3-keto-LCA, 3-keto-lithocholic acid; ALT, alanine aminotransaminase; BDL, bile duct ligation; CA, cholic acid; CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CYP, cytochrome P450; CYP3A, cytochrome P450 3A; DCA, deoxycholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; GCA, glycocholic acid; GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GLCA, glycolithocholic acid; GUDCA, glycoursodeoxycholic acid; HDCA, hyodeoxycholic acid; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; LCA, lithocholic acid; MDCA, murideoxycholic acid; OH, hydroxylated; ONPG, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PXR, pregnane X receptor or steroid and xenobiotic receptor; Tβ-MCA, tauro-β-muricholic acid; TCA, taurocholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; TDCA, taurodeoxycholic acid; TLCA, taurolithocholic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic acid; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; VDR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D receptor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. the rate-limiting step in bile acid formation by the “classic” pathway of bile acid synthesis (1Russell D.W.

Whereas the mechanisms of feedback regulation are now relatively well understood, the processes involved in feed-forward regulation are less clear. CYP3A enzymes are predominantly expressed in the liver and small intestinal mucosa and catalyze the metabolic conversion of a wide diversity of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates to more polar derivatives. These enzymes exhibit adaptive transcriptional regulation in response to a range of xenobiotic inducing chemicals, which include some therapeutic drugs.

This is significant because the relative cytotoxicity of each bile acid is attributable to its hydrophobicity, and both ring hydroxylations and conjugation reduce hydrophobicity and effectively detoxify bile acids as well as rendering them accessible to excretory transporters (4Hofmann A.F. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 677-718Google Scholar). Bile acid-mediated induction of CYP3A enzymes therefore represents an important potential feed-forward mechanism for bile acid homeostasis. There is indirect evidence that CYP3A induction occurs in response to cholestasis. Increased excretion of the 6α-hydroxylated bile acids, α-hyocholic acid (α-HCA) and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), occurs in cholestatic patients and in women with cholestasis of pregnancy (5Bremmelgaard A.

In rats, concentrations of the 6β-hydroxylated bile acid, β-muricholic acid (β-MCA) increase after bile duct ligation (BDL) (8Kinugasa T. Uchida K. Kadowaki M. Takase H. Nomura Y. Saito Y. J.

Moreover, whereas hepatic CYP concentrations are generally decreased in human livers with biliary cirrhosis secondary to chronic cholestatic liver diseases, CYP3A4 expression is relatively preserved (10George J. Murray M. Byth K. Farrell G.C. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 120-128PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CYP3A induction occurs as a defensive response to bile acid accumulation, even in advanced disease. Adaptive regulation of CYP3A4 is now known to be mediated by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Specifically, the pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) (3Xie W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Waxman D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These receptors heterodimerize with the receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid-α (NR2B1) and recognize a range of small lipophilic molecules that includes endobiotic (endogenously synthesized) and xenobiotic compounds. Recently, PXR has been shown to be a low affinity receptor for lithocholic acid (LCA) and its metabolite, 3-keto-lithocholic acid (3-keto-LCA) (3Xie W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M.

In studies of knockout and transgenic animals, activation of PXR can both induce CYP3A enzymes and confer resistance to toxicity by LCA (3Xie W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C.

It has therefore been suggested that LCA represents the endogenous PXR ligand, and that PXR-mediated gene induction may be the predominant pathway of feed-forward regulation of bile acid detoxification and elimination (3Xie W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Waxman D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 11Staudinger J.L.

However, concentrations of LCA and other bile acids have not been measured in conjunction with an assessment of CYP3A induction in in vivo models of cholestasis. In the present study, we have utilized a recently described transgenic mouse model incorporating a regulatory human CYP3A4 transgene (19Robertson G.R. Field J. Goodwin B. Bierach S. Tran M. Lehnert A. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to explore the in vivo relationship between specific bile acids and physiological adaptive CYP3A gene regulation in acute cholestasis induced by surgical BDL. We provide evidence that adaptive up-regulation of both endogenous mouse and introduced human CYP3A genes does occur in response to bile acid accumulation, and that this response is not dependent on increases in circulating LCA. Chemicals and Reagents—Authentic bile acid standards were purchased from Sigma, except glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), murideoxycholic acid (MDCA), HDCA, α-HCA, β-MCA, α-MCA, and tauro-β-muricholic acid (Tβ-MCA) purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI), taurocholic acid (TCA) from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and the deuterated bile acid standards cholic-2,2,4,4-d4 acid, chenodeoxycholic-2,2,4,4-d4 acid, and lithocholic-2,2,4,4-d4 acid from C/D/N Isotopes (Quebec, Canada). High performance liquid chromatography grade methanol was purchased from APS Chemicals (Sydney, Australia). Animals and Operative Procedures—CYP3A4/lacZ transgenic mice carrying a construct comprising the upstream regulatory region of the human CYP3A4 gene, -13 kb to +53 bp relative to the transcription initiation site, linked to the lacZ reporter gene have been recently described in detail (19Robertson G.R. Field J. Goodwin B. Bierach S. Tran M. Lehnert A. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Eight to 10-week-old line 9/4 male mice hemizygous for a -13CYP3A4/lacZ transgene were used for all experiments. The animals were kept in individual cages, fed on a commercial pellet diet and allowed water ad libitium. All animal protocols and studies performed were approved by the Western Sydney Area Health Service Animal Ethics Committee. Bile Duct Ligation—Mice were anesthetized (ketamine 100 mg/kg, and xylazine 20 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally) and aseptically subjected to double ligation of the common bile duct below the bifurcation and single ligation above the pancreas with dissection between the distal and proximal ligatures. Sham operations were performed by gently touching the common bile duct with forceps, instead of ligation and subsequent dissection. Animals (n = 4–5 per group at each time point) were sacrificed by exsanguination under anesthesia 3, 6, and 10 days after BDL or sham operation. Mortality and the frequency of complications was less than 20%. At the time of sacrifice, blood samples were collected for determination of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin as a measure of liver injury, and cholestasis, respectively. Serum ALT and bilirubin were analyzed by the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, Western Sydney Area Health Service, using automated procedures. Serum and urine samples were also frozen at -70 °C for subsequent bile acid analysis. Liver and duodenal tissues were collected for staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and liver was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for quantitative β-galactosidase assessment, protein analysis, mRNA extraction, and bile acid analysis. Liver samples were also embedded in OCT compound for β-galactosidase staining of frozen sections. Bile Acid Administration—Mice were administered lithocholic acid, 0.125 mg/g body weight in 100 μl of corn oil or vehicle alone twice daily by intraperitoneal injection for 7 days. Mice were sacrificed by exsanguination 12 h after the last injection. Assessment of Liver Histology—Consecutive sections of liver (4 μm thick) from paraffin-embedded liver were cut for hematoxylin and eosin staining for evaluation of liver injury and necrosis. Analysis of CYP3A4 Transgene Expression—β-Galactosidase activity was visualized in slices and frozen sections of liver and other tissues following staining with X-gal. Tissues were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2: washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm MgCl2; and stained by incubation at 37 °C in wash solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide. Tissue slices were examined under a stereomicroscope (magnification, ×20) and tissue sections using a conventional microscope (magnification, ×100). The extent of β-galactosidase activity was quantitated in whole liver homogenates (100 mg of fresh tissue/ml of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) using the o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay as described previously (20Foster R. Jahroudi N. Varshney U. Gedamu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11528-11535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After appropriate dilution, the homogenate was incubated with β-galactosidase assay reagent (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.88 mg/ml ONPG) at 37 °C, quenched by the addition of 1 m Na2CO3, and the absorbance at 420 nm was determined. Protein concentration was quantified in the same whole liver homogenates using a commercially available kit (DC Protein Assay; Bio-Rad), and the units of β-galactosidase activity are given as A420/mg of protein/min. Endogenous Mouse Cyp3a11 Gene Expression—Endogenous mouse Cyp3a11 mRNA expression was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RNA was extracted from liver using a commercially available reagent (Trizol, Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized in duplicate from 5 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of each cDNA synthesis reaction (1 μl) was subjected to PCR amplification in duplicate using a PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Prism 7700 real-time PCR platform. Primers and TaqMan® probe were as follows: forward primer, bases 112–133: 5′-TGCTCCTAGCAATCAGCTTGG-3′; reverse primer, bases 220–199: 5′-GTGCCTAAAAATGGCAGAGGTT-3′; and probe, bases 137–171: 5′-FAM-CCTCTACCGATATGGGACTCGTAAACATGAACTT-TAMRA-3′. The probe was designed to cross an intron-exon junction to avoid interference from genomic DNA. Additionally, primer and probe sequences were chosen to avoid detection of other Cyp3a subfamily members. Results were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, determined using the following primers and TaqMan® probe: forward primer: 5′-GTCGTGGATCTGACGTGCC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-TGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT-3′; and probe: 5′-VIC-CCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATGATGACA-TAMRA-3′. Cycle parameters for all PCR were: 50 °C for 2 min then 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Quantitation of Bile Acids by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—Serum or urine (100 μl) were diluted with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline to which 41 ng of deuterated assay internal standard (cholic acid) was added. Solid phase extraction was carried out using Oasis HLB cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) as per the manufacturer's directions. Typical recoveries of extracted bile acids exceeded 85%. Mouse liver samples (50–100 mg) were homogenized with a Polytron (Kinematica CH6010, Kriens/Luzern, Switzerland) at 80% full speed for 10 s in a solution of Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Homogenates were brought to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. After the addition of the assay internal standard (cholic-2,2,4,4-d4 acid, 100 ng) the bile acids were extracted from the supernatant fraction (saturated with 0.75 g of ammonium sulfate) with dichloromethane-isopropyl alcohol (80:20; 2× 4 ml). Combined extracts were dried down with nitrogen and reconstituted in 150 μl of the chromatographic mobile phase. Extraction efficiency for this method was determined by spiking liver homogenates with deuterated bile acids covering a range of hydrophobicities, namely cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. Recovery for all three bile acids was in the range of 85–100%. Chromatographic separations were carried out with a Waters 2695 pump equipped with an autoinjector. The analytes were separated on a Waters X-Terra MS C18 column (3.5 micron, 2.1 × 150 mm). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (water), solvent B (methanol), and solvent C (100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5) delivered as a gradient: 0–15 min for solvent B, 67%; 15–25 min for solvent B, 67–85%; and 25–35 min for solvent B, 85–67%, with 10% solvent C at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The high performance liquid chromatography was coupled with a Waters ZQ quadruple mass detector via an electrospray ionization interface operating in the negative ion mode. Quantitative determination of bile acids was performed by time scheduled single ion recordings using [M - H]- ions. We determined that the following tune parameters are optimal for bile acid detection; capillary voltage 3 kV, cone voltage 40 V, extractor voltage 5 V, and RF lens 0.3 V. Source temperature was 100 °C and desolvation temperature was 300 °C. Desolvation gas flow was set at 350 liters/h and cone gas flow rate was 60 liter/h. The limit of quantitation was 40 nmol/liter for individual bile acids. Statistical Analysis—Treatment groups were compared using factorial analysis of variance, and post-hoc analysis was performed using the Bonferroni/Dunn test for parametric data. These results are presented as mean ± S.D. Data from bile acid analysis were non-parametric, and treatment groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test. These results are presented as median and interquartile range. All results are considered significant when p is less than 0.05. Liver Weight and Assessment of Liver Injury and Cholestasis after BDL—CYP3A4/lacZ transgenic male mice were subjected to BDL or sham operation, and sacrificed after 3, 6, and 10 days. Liver weight progressively increased after BDL, with a 2-fold increase in BDL animals compared with shams at day 10 (mean 2.5 ± 0.3 g versus 1.2 ± 0.01 g; p < 0.001). Serum bilirubin and ALT were abnormal in BDL animals at all time points, confirming both cholestasis and liver injury. There was a progressive increase in serum ALT to a mean of 1,607 ± 394 units/liters at 10 days after BDL (Fig. 1A), and serum bilirubin peaked 6 days after BDL with a mean of 137 ± 100 μmol/liter (Fig. 1B). At all time points, ALT and bilirubin were significantly greater in BDL animals compared with shams (p < 0.001). CYP3A4 Transgene Expression in Whole Liver and Duodenum after BDL—The response of the CYP3A4 regulatory transgene to acute cholestasis was assessed by visualizing β-galactosidase activity in slices and frozen sections of liver and duodenum by staining with X-gal (see “Experimental Procedures”). Significant hepatic induction of the CYP3A4/lacZ transgene was visualized by X-gal staining 6 and 10 days after BDL, compared with minimal constitutive expression in sham operated animals (Fig. 2A). Staining of frozen liver sections with X-gal demonstrated the distribution of transgene induction in pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes (Fig. 3). A quantitatively and qualitatively similar pattern of transgene induction has previously been observed when this line of transgenic mice were treated with the classical xenobiotic Cyp3a inducing agents dexamethasone, pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile, and phenobarbital (19Robertson G.R. Field J. Goodwin B. Bierach S. Tran M. Lehnert A. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When intestinal epithelium was examined, no significant difference in transgene expression was seen between BDL and sham animals, although the transgene was inducible in the gut following dexamethasone administration (not shown). This lack of intestinal transgene induction after BDL may be because of the effect of bile acid diversion from the gut.Fig. 3Hepatic expression of CYP3A4/lacZ transgene after BDL or LCA administration. Frozen liver sections were stained with a β-galactosidase stain and eosin counterstain. In control animals only a few hepatocytes contain transgene-derived β-galactosidase activity after X-gal staining (panel A). In contrast, the CYP3A4/lacZ transgene is significantly induced in pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes by days 6 (panel B) and 10 (panel C) after BDL, visualized as the blue-stained areas. LCA administration induces significant cavitation and necrosis in the liver parenchyma (panel D) as indicated by the arrow, but the transgene is induced only on the liver capsular surface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitative Expression of CYP3A4/lacZ Transgene and Endogenous Mouse Cyp3a11 after BDL—CYP3A4/lacZ transgene expression was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity in whole liver homogenates using the ONPG assay. Transgene expression increased significantly from day 6 in BDL animals compared with shams, to a mean 80-fold increase in induction on day 10 (Fig. 4A). On univariate analysis of variance, a statistically significant interaction was found between the effects of the procedure (BDL) and time. There was a linear increase in ONPG at a rate of 0.43/day (S.E. = 0.007, p < 0.001) in the BDL group. The sham group remained unchanged over time (slope = -0.002, S.E. = 0.008, p = 0.8). Cyp3a11 is an endogenous mouse Cyp3a gene and is the likely homologue of CYP3A4, and relative expression was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. A significant increase in Cyp3a11 expression was demonstrated both 6 (3.7-fold) and 10 days after BDL (Fig. 4B), in keeping with the physiological relevance of the CYP3A4/lacZ transgene induction. Changes to Serum Bile Acid Concentrations after BDL— Individual serum bile acid concentrations were determined in BDL and sham mice at different time points using LC/MS (Table I). Concentrations of β-MCA, a 6β-hydroxylated bile acid, and its tauro conjugate were massively elevated in BDL animals compared with sham animals at all three time points, and α-MCA was also elevated on day 3. Additionally, an ion consistent with taurine-conjugated unsaturated trihydroxybile acids (m/z 512), believed to correspond to tauro-Δ22-muricholate isomers (21Setchell K.D. Yamashita H. Rodrigues C.M. O'Connell N.C. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4169-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was also ∼40-fold greater than that of unconjugated β-MCA in BDL animals compared with shams (data not shown).Table ISerum bile acid concentrations in BDL and sham mice Mice were subjected to BDL or sham operation, and serum was collected after 3, 6, and 10 days for determination of bile acid concentrations by LC/MS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are shown as the median plus interquartile range from three to five mice per group, and expressed in nanomole liter. The following bile acids were below the limit of quantitation (40 nmol/liter) at all time points: CDCA, GCDCA, UDCA, GUDCA, MDCA, α-HCA, HDCA, LCA, GLCA, and TLCA.Bile acidDay 3 shamDay 3 BDLDay 6 shamDay 6 BDLDay 10 shamDay 10 BDLα-MCANDaND, not detected; concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (40 nmol/liter)3201 (1,020—3,686)bp < 0.05 for difference between BDL and sham at the given time point28 (16—138)183 (44—288)44 (40—162)NDβ-MCAND2740 (1,515—8,387)bp < 0.05 for difference between BDL and sham at the given time point34 (14—108)3,570 (2,496—8,975)cp < 0.01 for difference between BDL and sham at the given time point30 (12—265)2,525 (1,660—4,480)bp < 0.05 for difference betwe"

GSTπ overexpression has been observed in many tumors compared with the surrounding normal tissues and in various cancer cell lines resistant to anticancer agents (2Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role that this enzyme plays in resistance to anticancer drugs remains ill defined, particularly because GSTπ transfection does not always confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (3Gate L.

More recently, it has been shown that GSTπ acts as a regulator of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. GSTπ is an endogenous inhibitor of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), mediated by interactions with the NH2-terminal region of the kinase (4Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 5Wang T. Arifoglu P. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20999-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After oxidative stress, GSTπ oligomerizes and disassociates from JNK, which then becomes phosphorylated (4Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). GSTπ can also modulate the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). For example, in NIH 3T3 cells, the forced expression of GSTπ inhibits JNK activity and activates ERK and p38 kinase (6Yin Z. Ivanov V.N. Habelhah H. Tew K. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in GSTπ-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, the basal activities of JNK and ERK are higher than in their wild type counterparts (4Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 7Ruscoe J.E. Rosario L.A. Wang T. Gate L. Arifoglu P. Wolf C.R. Henderson C.J. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar). The principle that a therapeutic advantage might be gained by inhibiting GSTπ led to the design and synthesis of a peptidomimetic inhibitor γ-glutamyl-S-(benzyl)cysteinyl-R(-)-phenylglycine diethyl ester (TLK199) (8Kauvar L.M. Morgan A.S. Sanderson P.E. Henner W.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the drug was active in modulating resistance associated with GSTπ overexpression both in vitro and in vivo (9Morgan A.S. Ciaccio P.J. Tew K.D. Kauvar L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1996; 37: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a distinct pharmacological property emerged, namely, GSTπ-dependent regulation of myeloproliferation (7Ruscoe J.E. Rosario L.A. Wang T. Gate L. Arifoglu P. Wolf C.R. Henderson C.J. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar). The intraperitoneal injection of this drug increased the number of peripheral white blood cells in wild type mice but not in GSTπ-null animals. Furthermore, GSTπ-deficient mice presented a higher number of circulating leukocytes than wild type animals. The production of fully differentiated peripheral blood cells from pluripotent cells is tightly regulated by cytokines produced by the surrounding stroma and by the hematopoietic cells themselves (10Keller G. Lacaud G. Robertson S. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways mediated by cytokines have been studied extensively. Although each cytokine has its own mechanism of action, canonical pathways have been described (11Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The binding of a cytokine to its receptor leads to its dimerization and to the recruitment of Janus kinases (JAKs). These kinases phosphorylate each other and subsequently phosphorylate the receptor on tyrosine residues, allowing the binding of various proteins containing an SH2 domain. The binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules to the receptor induces their phosphorylation and leads to dimers that are translocated into the nucleus where they bind to their specific DNA binding site. Src protein family members also bind to the cytokine receptor, leading to their phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Ras, which then activates JNK, ERK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways. The activation of the JNK pathway by cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3; 12Foltz I.N. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has been described previously. However, the precise role(s) of these kinases in the proliferation of hematopoietic cells is still unclear. Because GSTπ is a natural inhibitor of JNK and a modulator of MAP kinase activities and the lack of GSTπ expression is associated with an increase in myeloproliferation, we set out to define a mechanistic link between myeloproliferation and GSTπ inhibition. Chemicals and Antibodies—MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, p38 inhibitor SB202190, and JNK inhibitor SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem. Each of them was used at a concentration of 10 μm. Orthovanadate was from Sigma. Mouse recombinant cytokines G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). GSTπ inhibitor TLK199 was provided by Telik, Inc. (San Francisco). Phospho-JAK2 antibody was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA), phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), phospho-STAT3 (Ser727), phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694), and phospho-AKT antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). AKT, JAK2, STAT5, ERK2, and phospho-ERK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-JNK1/2 and phospho-p38 were from Promega. STAT1, STAT3, GSTπ, and JNK1/2 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. SHP-1 and SHP-2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Lines—Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were obtained from the bone marrow of C57BL/6-129/Sv wild type and GSTπ–/– mice and grown in 50% WEHI-3 cell (ATCC) conditioned medium and 50% RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin. Cells in suspension were resuspended in fresh medium twice a week. After 4 weeks in culture, more than 95% of cells were BMMC. BMMC purity was determined by toluidine blue staining and was confirmed by flow cytometry by analyzing the expression of c-Kit (SCF-R) and IgE receptor. Hematology Studies—All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fox Chase Cancer Center. Wild type and GSTπ-deficient mice, kindly provided by Drs. C. J. Henderson and R. Wolf (Cancer Research UK, Molecular Pharmacology Unit, Dundee, UK), were housed in conventional conditions in the Fox Chase Cancer Center laboratory animal facility. 6–12-week-old wild type and GSTπ–/– male mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Blood was collected by intracardial puncture in heparin tubes. Platelets and red and white blood cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Leukocyte composition was determined by staining blood smears with a KWIK DIFF™ staining kit from Shandon (Pittsburgh, PA). Spleen and thymus were collected, and cells were extracted and labeled with specific antibodies against mouse surface markers B220, IgM, CD3∈, DX5, CD8, and CD4 (BD Biosciences). Bone marrow cells were flushed out of the femoral bone, and red blood cells were lysed with 0.8% ammonium chloride. Nucleated cells were counted with a hemocytometer and labeled with specific antibodies against mouse surface markers B220, CD43, CD11b (BD Biosciences), Ter119, and Gr1 (E-Bioscience). Surface marker expression was determined by flow cytometry using a FacsVantage or a Facscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed using FlowJo software. In Vitro Hematopoiesis Assay—Bone marrow cells were collected as described previously (7Ruscoe J.E. Rosario L.A. Wang T. Gate L. Arifoglu P. Wolf C.R. Henderson C.J. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly wild type and GSTπ–/– mice 6–12 weeks old were sacrificed with CO2, the pelt clipped, and hind limbs exposed. Both femurs and tibiae were removed and cells collected in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Red blood cells were lysed with 0.8% NH4 Cl. Cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were plated in Methocult™ medium containing 1% methylcellulose in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), 2 mm glutamine into 35-mm culture dishes, treated with cytokines (10 ng/ml G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-3) in combination with TLK199, MAP kinase inhibitors or vehicle, and incubated at 37 °Cin5%CO2. Colony-forming units were scored (colony >50 cells) 7 days after plating and expressed as a percentage of control. For colony composition and cell counts, cells were washed extensively with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove methyl cellulose, slides were prepared by cytospin, and cells were stained using a KWIK DIFF™ staining kit. Proliferation Assay—2 × 105 BMMC/ml were seeded in complete medium without IL-3 for 12 h. IL-3 was then added at various concentrations for 24 h. 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (ICN, Irvine, CA) was added to the cells for an additional 12 h. Cells were collected and washed three times with an ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid solution, and final pellets were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. Radiolabeled thymidine incorporation was quantified with a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500). Immunoblot—After treatments, cells were collected and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The final pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na2VO4) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated 3 × 10 s and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were considered whole cell extracts. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein expression was determined using specific primary and secondary antibodies. Briefly, after transfer, membranes were incubated in TBS-Tween containing 5% skimmed milk, washed with TBS-Tween, and incubated with primary antibody in TBS-Tween containing 5% skimmed milk for 1 h. Membranes were washed twice with TBS-Tween and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS-Tween containing 5% skimmed milk for 1 h and finally washed three times with TBS-Tween. When phospho-specific antibodies were used, 5% skimmed milk was replaced by 10% IgG-free bovine serum albumin (Jackson Immunoresearch). Specific proteins were revealed by chemiluminescence using ECL or ECL Plus Western blotting reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Reverse Transcription and Real Time Quantitative PCR—BMMC were incubated for 4 h in the absence of IL-3 and then exposed to this cytokine (100 ng/ml). At various time points, cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA extracted with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. RNA was reverse transcribed as follows. 1 μgofRNA was mixed with 1 μl of 0.5 μg/μl random hexamer and incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. The sample was mixed with 4 μl of first strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of dNTP mix, and 1 μl of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and incubated 1 h at 42 °C and 15 min at 70 °C. 50 ng of cDNA was used for PCR amplification, and gene expression was determined using a Cepheid Smartcycler and a Quantitect SYBR Green kit (Qiagen). Relative amounts of each gene were determined by the comparative CT method using the expression of each gene in the untreated wild type sample as the calibrator (15Su Y. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2180-2187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The quantification of expression for each sample was calculated from the threshold cycle (CT) value, which is the number of cycles for which an increase in PCR product is first detected at a statistically significant level. The relative expression value of each gene is obtained by evaluating the CT values for the unknown reaction using the equation 2ΔΔCT. The ΔCT values for the calibrator and samples in each gene expression assay were obtained by subtracting the CT value of the actin from the CT value for the gene. ΔΔCT was calculated by subtracting the average ΔCT (calibrator) values from the ΔCT (sample). The relative quantification was calculated by 2ΔΔCT. The mRNA quantity of the calibrator (untreated wild type) is expressed as 1, and all other quantities are expressed as a -fold difference relative to the calibrator. The primers used for this experiment were: 5′-GTCGCCAACGGAACTGCT-3′ and 5′-GGAAGGGGAAGGAACTCA-3′ for SOCS-1; 5′-GCTGGACCGACTAACCTG-3′ and 5′-CTACATCTTCACACCTTT-3′ for SOCS-2; 5′-TTTGCCACCCACGGAACC-3′ and 5′-CCCCCTCTGACCCTTTTG-3′ for SOCS-3; 5′-TCCAGGCAGAGAATGAAC-3′ and 5′-GATAGGCAGCACCGACTC-3′ for CIS-1; 5′-TAGAAGAATGCTCACAGA-3′ and 5′-GTTTAGATACAGGCTCAG-3′ for CD45; 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTTAGGCACC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGAT-3′ for actin. Increased Number of White Blood Cells in GSTπ–/–Mice— We observed that GSTπ–/– mice had about twice the number of circulating white blood cells compared with wild type animals (16.1 ± 2.0 versus 9.6 ± 1.3 × 106/ml, respectively) (Table I). The percentage of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in the peripheral blood of both mouse strains was similar. In contrast, the numbers of red blood cells and platelets were not increased significantly in GSTπ–/– mice. Spleens from GSTπ–/– mice also contained significantly more cells than wild type (74.7 ± 5.3 versus 46.1 ± 9.4 × 106 cells/spleen, respectively) (Table II). Both the number and percentage of splenic B lymphocytes (B220+/IgM+) were significantly higher in knockout animals compared with wild type. In contrast, the percentage of T lymphocytes (CD3∈+) was lower in GSTπ–/– mice, the cell counts were similar in both animals. In addition, there was no difference in number or proportion of splenic natural killer cells (DX5+). Analysis of thymus cells showed that cell counts and thymocyte subsets were similar in both wild type and GSTπ–/– mice (Table II), which is consistent with the lack of an impact on mature peripheral T cells. Therefore, our analysis indicates a selective expansion of B cells within the lymphocyte population in GSTπ–/– mice.Table IBlood analysis of wild type and GSTπ-/- animalsWild typeGSTπ-/-Erythrocytes (109/ml)5.7 ± 0.56.8 ± 0.2Platelets (107/ml)99.2 ± 8.6116.4 ± 9.7Leukocytes (106/ml)9.6 ± 1.316.1 ± 2.0*Lymphocytes (106/ml)5.8 ± 1.4 (66.6 ± 6.7%)13.3 ± 1.5* (74.9 ± 4.2%)Monocytes (106/ml)0.4 ± 0.2 (6.4 ± 2.4%)0.7 ± 0.3** (5.5 ± 1.9%)Granulocytes (106/ml)1.4 ± 0.2 (25.8 ± 7.2%)2.8 ± 0.4* (21.3 ± 4.7%) Open table in a new tab Table IILymphocyte populations in wild type and GSTπ-/- miceWild typeGSTπ-/-Cell no.

However, the percentages of granulocytic cells (CD11b+/Gr1hi) and monocytic cells (CD11b+/Gr1lo) were lower in the GSTπ-deficient animals than in the wild type. In contrast, the percentage of cells committed to the B lymphocyte lineage (B220+) was higher in the GSTπ–/– mice (Fig. 1). Modulation of Myeloproliferation by MAP Kinase Inhibitors—In vitro hematopoiesis experiments showed that all three cytokines tested (G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3) stimulated the formation of colony-forming units more effectively in GSTπ-deficient than in wild type animals. In addition, as reported previously (7Ruscoe J.E. Rosario L.A. Wang T. Gate L. Arifoglu P. Wolf C.R. Henderson C.J. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar), TLK199 stimulated cytokine-induced myeloproliferation in wild type mice but not in GSTπ–/– animals (Fig. 2). Therefore, myeloproliferative responses to cytokine stimulation are enhanced in the absence of GSTπ. Because GSTπ is known to be a regulator of MAP kinase pathways, we assessed the effect of MAP kinase inhibitors on the myelostimulant properties of TLK199. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 decreased myeloproliferation induced by cytokines but failed to inhibit the myelostimulant effect of TLK199 completely. These molecules decreased the number of colonies produced after exposure to cytokines by about 2–3-fold in both wild type and GSTπ-deficient mice. However, in combination with TLK199, a greater number of colonies were produced in wild type, but not in GSTπ-deficient animals. In addition, it appeared that U0126 was a more potent inhibitor of proliferation than PD98059. This could be explained in part by the more favorable inhibitory constant of U0126 toward MEK1/2 compared with PD98059. In contrast, the p38 inhibitor SB202190 significantly stimulated cytokine-induced myeloproliferation independent of GSTπ expression. TLK199 myelostimulant properties were not detected when used in combination with this p38 inhibitor. Similarly, differential myeloproliferation observed between wild type and GSTπ–/– cells was abrogated in the presence of SB202190. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 had a slight inhibitory effect on the number of colonies produced in wild type animals but significantly decreased their numbers in GSTπ–/– mice. In addition, SP600125 inhibited the myelostimulant effects of TLK199 in wild type mice. The cell composition and number of colonies were assessed in wild type and GSTπ-deficient mice. As expected, the number of cells/colony was higher in GSTπ-deficient samples than in wild type. However, the results presented in Table III show that there was no significant difference in the colony cell composition. Therefore, our data suggest that the JNK pathway could play an important role in the stimulation of myeloproliferation in GSTπ–/– cells or in wild type cells exposed to TLK199.Table IIICell composition and no. of cytokine-induced colonies from wild type and GSTπ-/- miceWild typeGSTπ-/-CompositionCell no.CompositionCell no.%%IL-3 (10 ng/ml)936 ± 1751390 ± 266Myeloblast26 ± 629 ± 4Myelocyte33 ± 133 ± 6Granulocyte30 ± 431 ± 5Monocyte12 ± 19 ± 1GM-CSF (10 ng/ml)1143 ± 1601309 ± 185Myeloblast29 ± 420 ± 1Myelocyte31 ± 632 ± 5Granulocyte36 ± 539 ± 3Monocyte12 ± 110 ± 4G-CSF (10 ng/ml)Myeloblast16 ± 3583 ± 5815 ± 3811 ± 98Myelocyte24 ± 123 ± 5Granulocyte55 ± 356 ± 6Monocyte5 ± 18 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Influence of GSTπ Expression on IL-3-mediated Signal Transduction in Bone Marrow Cells—Because of the increased myeloproliferation observed in GSTπ-deficient cells in response to cytokines, we assessed the influence of GSTπ expression on IL-3-mediated signal transduction in bone marrow cells collected from wild type and GSTπ–/– animals. Treatment of these cells with IL-3 induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of STAT5 (between 10 to 30 min) in wild type cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, in GSTπ-deficient cells, this cytokine induced a rapid but more sustained activation of STAT5 (up to 120 min). In addition, IL-3 induced a stronger activation of STAT3 without affecting the duration of stimulation and of JNK in GSTπ-deficient cells compared with wild type. The activation of the other proteins was similar in both mouse strains (Fig. 3). In addition, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was not detected in our model. Increased DNA Synthesis and Sustained STAT Activation in GSTπ–/–BMMC in Response to IL-3—Because the bone marrow is a heterogeneous cell system that does not allow accurate study of the effect of cytokines on signal transduction pathways, we decided to use homogeneous cell populations such as BMMC to define better the role of GSTπ in the cellular response to cytokines. GSTπ–/– BMMC had a higher DNA synthesis rate than wild type in response to IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 4). Stimulation of BMMC proliferation by IL-3 was also observed at a lower concentration of cytokine in GSTπ-deficient cells than in the wild type mast cells. Studies of cell signaling pathways involved in IL-3-mediated signal transduction showed that this cytokine induced a stronger and more sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr701), STAT3 (Tyr705 and Ser727), and STAT5 (Tyr694) in GSTπ-deficient cells than in wild type (Fig. 5A). Such an effect was also observed to a lesser degree with JAK2 phosphorylation. In contrast, levels of AKT phosphorylation were lower in knock-out than in wild type cells. Although levels of phosphorylated JNK were higher in wild type cells, the ratio of JNK phosphorylation to JNK total protein was higher in the BMMC from knock-out animals (Fig. 5B). Activation of p38 and ERK was similar in both cell types.Fig. 5A, effect of GSTπ expression on IL-3-mediated signal transduction pathways in BMMC. Wild type and GSTπ–/– were IL-3 starved for 4 h. 100 ng/ml IL-3 was then added, and cells were collected at various time points. Protein expression and phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoblot.

The basal mRNA levels for CIS-1, SOCS-1, SOCS-2 were similar, whereas that of SOCS-3 was 2-fold lower in GSTπ-deficient BMMC than wild type (Fig. 6A). IL-3 stimulated the expression of CIS-1, SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and to a lesser extent SOCS-2 in both cell types; however, this was more pronounced in GSTπ-deficient cells. Control expression of the regulatory phosphatase CD45 was similar in both cell lines, but its expression was repressed by IL-3 treatment. By immunoblot, we observed that the expression of the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 was also much lower in GSTπ–/– cells than in wild type but was not significantly affected by IL-3 exposure (Fig. 6B). Influence of Phosphatase Inhibitor Orthovanadate on IL-3-induced BMMC Proliferation and JAK-STAT Activation—Pretreatment of wild type and GSTπ-deficient mast cells for 4 h with 10 μm orthovanadate leads to a more sustained phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT-3, -5, ERK, and p38 proteins (up to 4 h) in response to IL-3 (Fig. 7B). In the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, the time course of activation of those proteins was similar in wild type and knock-out cells, whereas in the absence of orthovanadate the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway was more sustained in GSTπ–/– (Fig. 5A). In addition, pretreatment with orthovanadate increased wild type and GSTπ-deficient BMMC proliferation in response to IL-3 (Fig. 7A). When exposed to orthovanadate, the levels of thymidine incorporation in response to the cytokine were similar in both cell lines, whereas in the absence of this inhibitor, GSTπ–/– cells accumulated more thymidine than wild type.

The modulated expression of C/EBPβ has been suggested to be associated with toxic responses of TCDD such as wasting syndrome, diabetes, and inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. This study focused on the regulatory mechanism of TCDD-mediated transcriptional activation of C/EBPβ. Elevated C/EBPβ mRNA and protein levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (C3H10T½) and in mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) were correlated with increased binding affinity of the C/EBPβ protein. Transfection studies with different deletion constructs of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein promoter indicated that a small region located 60–120 bp upstream of the start site of transcription is required for activation of the C/EBPβ gene by TCDD in both cell lines tested. Further analysis using mutation constructs of the C/EBPβ promoter demonstrated that activation of the C/EBPβ promoter is mediated through incomplete cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) sites located close to the TATA box of the C/EBPβ gene. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 completely blocks the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ promoter activity, indicating that TCDD activates CREB binding via a cAMP/PKA pathway, which is supported by the increased cAMP level and PKA activity observed after TCDD treatment. Gel shift analyses demonstrated that CREB itself binds to the putative CREB motif that mediates the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ gene transcription. Cotransfection experiments with CREB and PKA expression plasmids further supported our conclusions that the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ transcription is mediated via PKA-dependent CREB activation.

Gel shift analyses demonstrated that CREB itself binds to the putative CREB motif that mediates the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ gene transcription. Cotransfection experiments with CREB and PKA expression plasmids further supported our conclusions that the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ transcription is mediated via PKA-dependent CREB activation.

Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). At least six members of the C/EBP family (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, C/EBPδ, C/EBP∈, and C/EBPζ) have been characterized (2Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides its importance in mediating inflammatory signals through the interleukin 6 pathway, C/EBPβ is known to play a crucial role in numerous cellular processes, such as liver growth and the differentiation of adipocyte and hematopoietic cells (3Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). These processes can be modulated by post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulation of the C/EBPβ gene during physiological and pathophysiological conditions through hormones, cytokines, nutrients, and toxic chemicals (4Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that C/EBPβ is responsible for mediating cellular responses induced by environmental stressors like ozone (5Jaspers I. Flescher E. Chen L.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L504-L511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hypoxia (6Yan S.F. Zou Y.S. Mendelsohn M. Gao Y. Naka Y. Du Yan S. Pinksy D. Stern D. J. Biol.

(9Liu P.C.C. Dunlap D.Y. Matsumura F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 23: 123-128Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which TCDD induces C/EBPβ expression remained unclear. In contrast, the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of genes for drug-metabolizing enzymes like those encoding CYP1A1, CYP1B1, glutathione S-transferase Ya, and NAD(P)H:menadione oxidoreductase by TCDD are well documented (10Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). TCDD-dependent activation of these genes involves binding of a heterodimer consisting of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein to xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) located in the 5′-flanking regions of the respective genes. In the absence of an activating ligand, the AhR resides in the cytosol as a complex with heat-shock protein 90. In addition to heat-shock protein 90, other proteins seem to be involved in the formation of cytosolic high affinity ligand-binding form(s) of the AhR (11LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K.

A complete XRE-binding sequence is located at position –68 to –64, but so far it is unclear whether recruitment of the AhR/Arnt dimer to the XRE-binding site located in the C/EBPβ promoter is necessary for transcriptional activation of C/EBPβ by TCDD. Two potential binding sites for CREB near the TATA box have been already identified as the important elements regulating the expression of C/EBPβ (19Niehof M. Streetz K. Rakemann T. Bischoff S.C. Manns M.P. Horn F. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9016-9027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The CREB-like sequences play a pivotal role for interleukin-6-mediated induction of C/EBPβ transcription during the acute phase response involving tethering of STAT3 to a DNA-bound complex (19Niehof M.

A sustained elevation of C/EBPβ level was also found in adipocytes after treatment with TCDD, which consequently leads to an inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation (21Liu P.C.C.

Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1231-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that TCDD-induced transcription of the cylcooxygenase-2 gene is mainly mediated through increased binding of C/EBPβ on the C/EBP-binding site of the cylcooxygenase-2 promoter (23Vogel C. Boerboom A.J. Baechle C. El-Bahay C. Kahl R. Degen G. Abel J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because C/EBPβ has been shown to play an important role in gene activation-mediated toxic responses caused by TCDD, the investigation on the molecular mechanism underlying the TCDD-mediating activation of C/EBPβ has been undertaken. By using deletion and mutation constructs of the C/EBPβ promoter, our present analysis revealed that TCDD induces C/EBPβ gene transcription via protein kinase A through a CREB motif located in its promoter in close proximity to the TATA box. Chemicals—TCDD (>99% purity) was originally obtained from Dow Chemicals Co. (Midland, MI). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was obtained from Aldrich. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Antibodies for C/EBP isoforms were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). N-{2-[(p-bromocinnamyl)amino]ethyl}-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide·2HCl (H89) was purchased from Calbiochem. Other molecular biological reagents were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and Roche Applied Science. Cell Culture, Transfection Experiments, and Luciferase Assays— C3H10T½ cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in basal modified Eagle’s medium. The mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1c1c7 was a gift from Dr. O. Hankinson (University of California, Los Angeles) and maintained in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen). Both cell culture media contained 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Woodland, CA) and 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfection experiments, C3H10T½ or Hepa1c1c7 cells were plated in 6-well culture plates (5 × 104/well). After 24 h cells were washed once with PBS, and 1.6 ml of fresh growth medium was added before transfection complexes were applied drop by drop to the cells. Cells were transiently transfected for 16 h by using 10 μl per well Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with 0.5 μg per well of respective luciferase reporter constructs of the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To control the transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with 0.1 μg per well β-galactosidase reporter construct. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 nm TCDD, 10 μm forskolin (FSK), or 0.1% Me2SO (control). Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 300 μl of passive lysis buffer. Luciferase activities were measured with the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, MI) using a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB 9501/16, Pittsburgh, PA). Relative light units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and to protein concentration, using Bradford dye assay (Bio-Rad). Experiments were repeated three times. Three wells of cells were analyzed per experiment. The LAP/C/EBP deletion and mutation luciferase reporter constructs containing the 5′-upstream regulatory sequence of the C/EBPβ promoter and the PKA(wt) and PKA(mut) expression vectors were used as described earlier (19Niehof M. Streetz K. Rakemann T. Bischoff S.C. Manns M.P. Horn F. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9016-9027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CREB expression plasmid and the dominant negative CREB-A vector were kindly provided by Dr. M. Montminy (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Dr. C. Vinson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from C3H10T½ and Hepa1c1c7 cells using a high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science), and cDNA synthesis was carried out as described previously (23Vogel C. Boerboom A.J. Baechle C. El-Bahay C. Kahl R. Degen G. Abel J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Quantitative detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and C/EBPβ was performed with a LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA-free total RNA (1.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 4 units of Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 1 μg of oligo(dT)15 in a final volume of 40 μl. The primers for each gene were designed on the basis of the respective cDNA or mRNA sequences of GAPDH (forward primer 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′) and C/EBPβ (forward primer 5′-GCGCGAGCGCAACAACATCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGCTTGAACAAGTTCCGCAG-3′). PCR amplification was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl, containing 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and 0.2 μm of each primer. The PCR cycling conditions were 95 °C for 15 min followed by 30–40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Detection of the fluorescent product was performed at the end of the 72 °C extension period. Negative controls were run concomitantly to confirm that the samples were not cross-contaminated. A sample with DNase- and RNase-free water instead of RNA was concomitantly examined for each of the reaction units described above. To confirm the amplification specificity, the PCR products were subjected to melting curve analysis. All PCR assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. The intra-assay variability was <7%. For quantification data were analyzed with the LightCycler analysis software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The variables were examined for one-sided Student’s t test. The results are given as the mean ± S.E. cAMP and Protein Kinase A Assays—cAMP was measured in C3H10T½ whole-cell extracts by using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier’s instructions. Calculation of cAMP concentrations (pmol/mg protein) is based on a standard curve for each experiment. PKA activity was determined in cell lysates using a PKA assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, C3H10T½ cells in 10-cm culture dishes were washed once with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were passed through a 21-gauge needle, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was assayed in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using synthetic Kemptide at 100 μm as substrate. Total PKA activity was measured by the addition of 2 μm cAMP; basal activity, a measure of active PKA at the time of harvest, was measured in the absence of exogenous cAMP. Unincorporated 32P was removed by spotting samples on phosphocellulose paper and washing three times with dilute H3PO4 (0.75%) and one acetone wash. The amount of 32P was quantified by scintillation counting. Nonspecific activity, determined in the presence of PKA inhibitor peptide, was subtracted. To determine whether effects on cAMP level and PKA activity are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX (Calbiochem) for 16 h. To examine AhR-dependent effects, cells were simultaneously treated with 10 μm 7-ketocholesterol (Sigma) and 10 nm TCDD. 7-Ketocholesterol has been identified as an endogenous modulator that inhibits transactivation by the AhR through competitive binding against xenobiotic ligands (25Savouret J.F. Antenos M. Quesne M. Xu J. Milgrom E. Casper R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3054-3059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Western Blotting—Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against C/EBPβ (C-19) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immunoblot, Bio-Rad). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the chemiluminescence substrate SuperSignal®, West Pico (Pierce), as recommended by the manufacturer. For quantitative analysis, respective bands were quantified using a ChemiImager™4400 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Gel Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were isolated from murine C3H10T½ and Hepa1c1c7 cells according to Dennler et al. (26Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD for 1–3 h and harvested in Dulbecco’s PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.05 μg/μl aprotinin. After centrifugation the cell pellets were gently resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.13 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min and then homogenized by 25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, nuclear pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer with 420 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol). The samples were passed through a 21-gauge needle and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear lysates were microcentrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford. For EMSA double-stranded oligonucleotides were used containing the consensus sequence (underlined) for the C/EBP (5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or the incomplete CREB (5′-GCGGCCGGGCAATGACGCGCACCGA-3′)-binding sites located between nucleotides –123 to –99 of the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter. DNA-protein-binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 15 μg of nuclear protein, 40,000 cpm of DNA oligonucleotide, 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Supershift analyses were performed by adding 2 μg of polyclonal C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, CREB1, c-Fos, and c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to the reaction mixtures. Competition experiments were performed in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragments. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure of the dehydrated gels to x-ray films. Induction of C/EBPβ by TCDD in C3H10T½ and Hepa1C1C7 Cells—Time response studies were conducted in C3H10T½ and Hepa1c1c7 cells. The earliest time point of a significant induction of C/EBPβ mRNA was observed after 1 h of treatment with 10 nm TCDD in C3H10T½ cells as shown by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (shown as squares in Fig. 1). In Hepa1c1c7 cells (circles in Fig. 1) TCDD caused a significant induction of C/EBPβ after 2 h. In both cell lines C/EBPβ mRNA was maximally (2.5–3.5-fold) induced after 6 h. The mRNA level of C/EBPβ was still elevated at 24 h (Fig. 1) in both cell lines tested. All values were compared with control cells that received 0.1% Me2SO. To verify the effect of Me2SO, we compared the vehicle controls with medium controls (untreated cells). No significant effect of 0.1% Me2SO was observed in Hepa1c1c7 or C3H10T½ cells on C/EBPβ mRNA expression at the time points tested (data not shown). TCDD Increases Protein Level and DNA Binding Activity of C/EBPβ—To test whether elevated mRNA levels correspond with an increased accumulation of the C/EBPβ protein in the nucleus, Western blot analyses were performed. In nuclear extracts of C3H10T½ cells, we detected strong staining of a 38-kDa band (Fig. 2, upper arrow), which is characteristic of the full-length isoform of C/EBPβ (27Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Hepa1c1c7 cells one additional band with a lower molecular weight (Fig. 2, lower arrow) was detected, which is probably related to the 35-kDa liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein (LAP) isoform of the C/EBPβ gene (27Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCDD treatment resulted in a 3-fold increase of the 38-kDa band at 6 h as well as 16 h in C3H10T½ cells. In Hepa1c1c7 cells band intensities for both C/EBPβ isoforms were 3-fold increased at 6 h and 2-fold increased at 16 h after TCDD treatment (Fig. 2). In order to determine whether the elevated protein level leads to an enhanced DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ, EMSAs were performed. We found an increased binding activity in nuclear extracts of C3H10T½ (Fig. 3) as well as Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig. 4) after TCDD exposure. After treatment for 6 and 16 h with 10 nm TCDD, the binding activity of C/EBP was 2.0-fold elevated in C3H10T½ (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). The supershift analyses using an anti-C/EBPβ antibody showed that binding activity of the C/EBPβ isoform is about 2.0-fold enhanced in C3H10T½ cells treated for 6 or 16 h (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 8). Similar results are obtained from EMSA with nuclear extracts from Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig. 4). C/EBPβ-specific complex formation in Hepa1c1c7 cells increased 2-fold in cells treated with 10 nm TCDD for 6 or 16 h (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). C/EBPβ-specific complex formation was confirmed by super-shift experiments using a C/EBPβ-specific antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–8).Fig. 4DNA binding of C/EBP complexes to a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing the C/EBP consensus binding site.A, Hepa1c1c7 cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD, and nuclear proteins were extracted at 6 (lanes 2 and 6) and 16 h (lanes 4 and 8). Control cells received 0.1% Me2SO (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). A 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled C/EBP was added in lane 9. Supershift analysis with a C/EBPβ-specific antibody (lanes 5–8) identified C/EBPβ as the major isoform of C/EBP binding complexes in Hepa1c1c7 cells. B, densitometric evaluation of band intensities of the total C/EBP binding complexes of control (lanes 1 and 3, open bars) or TCDD-treated cells (lanes 2 and 4, shaded bars) is presented. Band intensities of up-shifted C/EBPβ binding complexes of control (lanes 5 and 7) and TCDD-treated cells (lanes 6 and 8) are shown. Results of three separate experiments are shown as mean values ± S.D. *, significantly different from control cells (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of TCDD on C/EBPβ Promoter Deletion Constructs—To identify potential DNA motifs possibly responsible for TCDD-mediated C/EBPβ activation, transfection studies with different C/EBPβ promoter deletion constructs were performed in C3H10T½ and Hepa1c1c7 cells, respectively. The whole 5′-flanking region starting 16 bp downstream from the start site of transcription and compromising ∼1.4 kb was linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Increasing 5′-terminal deletions were introduced in this promoter fragment as depicted in Fig. 5A. The nomenclature of the deletion constructs (LAPPRO 1, LAPPRO 2, LAPPRO 7, LAPPRO 8, and LAPPRO 9) was adopted from previous studies (24Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of TCDD on the different deletion constructs was tested in transient transfection studies in C3H10T½ (Fig. 5B) and Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig. 5C). The luciferase activity of the corresponding constructs in vehicle-treated control cells were compared with the luciferase activity in TCDD treated cells (shaded bars). Treatment of C3H10T½ (Fig. 5B) or Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig. 5C) with 10 nm TCDD for 24 h led to a significant increase of 2–2.5-fold of the luciferase activity in the constructs LAPPRO 1 to LAPPRO 8. However, a dramatic decrease of both basal and TCDD-induced promoter activity was found in cells transfected with the short construct LAPPRO 9 (Fig. 5, B and C). This transfection experiment indicated that the binding elements located between nucleotides –121 and –71 in the C/EBPβ promoter mediate the TCDD-dependent effect on gene transcription. Additionally, our results suggest that the putative XRE-binding site located at nucleotide –68 to –64 of the 5′-upstream regulatory sequence (Fig. 6A, underlined) seems not to be involved in the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPβ gene transcription. TCDD Mediates C/EBPβ Activation via a CREB-binding Motif—Our previous study identified two CREB-binding sites essential for controlling the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ (24Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two CREB-binding sites are located at positions –111 to –107 (CREB1, Fig. 6B, boldface letters) and position –65 to –61 (CREB2, Fig. 6B, boldface letters) in the C/EBPβ promoter. Thus, these sequences of the promoter region were investigated by using two reporter constructs containing a mutation in the core sequence of the CREB1 or CREB2 site at position –109 to –107 (LAPPRO 8 M1) or position –65 to –61 (LAPPRO 8 M2) as illustrated in Fig. 6B. Transfection studies in C3H10T½ cells revealed that both mutations in the CREB1 or CREB2 site significantly abolished TCDD-dependent activation of the C/EBPβ promoter, suggesting an important role for both CREB sites in the TCDD-induced activation of C/EBPβ (Fig. 6C). Additionally, each mutation of the CREB1 or CREB2 site caused a significant reduction in basal promoter activity. Protein Kinase A Mediates the TCDD-dependent Increase in C/EBPβ Promoter Activity via CREB—To investigate the role of CREB in mediating TCDD-dependent C/EBPβ transcription, we performed cotransfection studies in C3H10T½ cells with increasing concentrations (100–400 ng/ml) of a CREB expression vector with the reporter construct LAPPRO 8. Cotransfection experiments with the CREB expression vector result in a dose-dependent increase (3–5-fold) of the TCDD-mediated promoter activity (Fig. 7). Transfection studies with a dominant negative CREB expression plasmid (A-CREB) that prevents DNA binding of wild-type CREB significantly blocked the TCDD- and FSK-mediated activation of LAPPRO 8 by more than 50% (Fig. 8), supporting the relevance of CREB in mediating the transcriptional activation of the"
https://openalex.org/W1963614332,"Caveolin is known to down-regulate both neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). In the present study, direct interactions of recombinant caveolin-1 with both the oxygenase and reductase domains of nNOS were demonstrated using <i>in vitro</i> binding assays. To elucidate the mechanism of nNOS regulation by caveolin, we examined the effects of a caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CaV1p1; residues (82–101)) on the catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant nNOSs. CaV1p1 inhibited NO formation activity and NADPH oxidation of wild-type nNOS in a dose-dependent manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.8 μm. Mutations of Phe<sup>584</sup> and Trp<sup>587</sup> within a caveolin binding consensus motif of the oxygenase domain did not result in the loss of CaV1p1 inhibition, indicating that an alternate region of nNOS mediates inhibition by caveolin. The addition of CaV1p1 also inhibited more than 90% of the cytochrome <i>c</i> reductase activity in the isolated reductase domain with or without the calmodulin (CaM) binding site, whereas CaV1p1 inhibited ferricyanide reductase activity by only 50%. These results suggest that there are significant differences in the mechanism of inhibition by caveolin for nNOS as compared with those previously reported for eNOS. Further analysis of the interaction through the use of several reductase domain deletion mutants revealed that the FMN domain was essential for successful interaction between caveolin-1 and nNOS reductase. We also examined the effects of CaV1p1 on an autoinhibitory domain deletion mutant (Δ40) and a C-terminal truncation mutant (ΔC33), both of which are able to form NO in the absence of CaM, unlike the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, CaV1p1 inhibited CaM-dependent, but not CaM-independent, NO formation activities of both Δ40 and ΔC33, suggesting that CaV1p1 inhibits interdomain electron transfer induced by CaM from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain."
https://openalex.org/W1972038003,"Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) serves nuclear transport of several proteins as a molecular chaperone. We have recently identified a novel variant of human Hsc70, heat shock cognate protein 54 (Hsc54), that lacks amino acid residues 464–616 in the protein binding and variable domains of Hsc70. In the present study, we examined nucleocytoplasmic localization of Hsc70 and Hsc54 by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions. GFP-Hsc70 is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus at 37 °C and accumulated into the nucleolus/nucleus after heat shock, whereas GFP-Hsc54 always remained exclusively in the cytoplasm under these conditions. Mutation studies indicated that 20 amino acid residues of nuclear localization-related signals, which are missing in Hsc54 but are retained in Hsc70, are required for proper nuclear localization of Hsc70. We further found that Hsc54 contains a functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES, <sup>394</sup>LDVTPLSL<sup>401</sup>) which is differently situated from the previously proposed NES in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Ssb1p. The cytoplasmic localization of Hsc54 was impaired by a mutation in NES as well as by a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, suggesting that Hsc54 is actively exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Hsc70 was not affected by the same mutation of NES or leptomycin B. These results suggest that the nuclear localization-related signal could functionally mask NES leading to prolonged retention of Hsc70 in the nucleus. An additional mechanism for unmasking the NES may regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of Hsc70."
https://openalex.org/W2089813112,"LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), a novel member of a subclass of the protein-serine/threonine kinases, is known to play a role in the development and maintenance of neuronal circuits that mediate cognitive function. Genetic studies have implicated a mutation of LIMK1 as a causative factor in the impairment of visuospatial cognition in a neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams syndrome. A transcriptional factor, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), is thought to be involved in the formation of many types of synaptic plasticity involving learning and memory. In the present study we show that the LIMK1 activity is markedly induced during the differentiation of immortalized hippocampal progenitor (H19-7) cells. We found that the addition of neurogenic growth factor to H19-7 cells induces specific binding between LIMK1 and active CREB, that LIMK1 directly phosphorylates CREB, and that this leads to the stimulation of subsequent cAMP-responsive element-mediated gene transcription during H19-7 cell neuronal differentiation. In addition, we also found that LIMK1 activation occurs through Rac/Cdc42- and p21-activated kinase-mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, when the plasmid encoding kinase-inactive LIMK1 was transfected to block the activation of endogenous LIMK1, the neuronal differentiation of H19-7 cells was significantly suppressed. These findings suggest that LIMK1 activation and subsequent CREB phosphorylation are important in the neuronal differentiation of central nervous system hippocampal progenitor cells.

These findings suggest that LIMK1 activation and subsequent CREB phosphorylation are important in the neuronal differentiation of central nervous system hippocampal progenitor cells. Trophic factors as well as growth factors, which both act by binding to cell surface receptors, are essential for the development of the vertebrate nervous system (1Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar, 2Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Trophic factors induce the phosphorylation of their receptor tyrosine kinases, which promote a variety of downstream intracellular signaling pathways and ultimately yield marked changes, and exert long lasting effects, such as those associated with promoting cell growth, survival or death, and proliferation or differentiation. The activation of cellular signaling cascades by growth factors involves the phosphorylation of transcription factors and leads to changes in the expressions of terminal differentiation genes in postmitotic neurons and results in alterations of the neuron mature phenotype. Therefore, transcription factors in neural progenitor cells are important in the establishment of neuronal cell identity.cAMP-responsive element (CRE) 1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; CNS, central nervous system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LIMK1, LIM kinase 1; PAK1, p21-activated kinase; PID, PAK1-inhibitory domain; TK, thymidine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Rho-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; CNS, central nervous system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LIMK1, LIM kinase 1; PAK1, p21-activated kinase; PID, PAK1-inhibitory domain; TK, thymidine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Rho-binding domain.-binding protein (CREB) is a central transcription factor that mediates cAMP-responsive genes by binding as a dimer to a conserved CRE motif (3Montminy M.R.

We found that active LIMK1 directly phosphorylates CREB and induces subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription during this neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells. Furthermore blockading LIMK1 activation significantly inhibited CREB phosphorylation and the neurite outgrowth induced by a neurogenic growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), in H19-7 cells. These findings suggest that active LIMK1 plays an important role during the neurogenic factor-induced neuronal differentiation of central nervous system (CNS) hippocampal progenitor cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Kim (Chungbuk National University, Chong-Ju, Korea).Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The bait vector for the yeast two-hybrid assay was constructed by subcloning the mutant CREB cDNA, in which RRPSY extending from amino acids 130–134 was replaced by RRSLY, into pHybTrp/Zeo. The human fetal cDNA library subcloned into prey vector (pACT2) was purchased from Clontech. All yeast two-hybrid screening protocols were performed as described previously (21Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and the Preparation of Cell Lysates—Immortalized hippocampal neuronal cells (H19-7) were grown and differentiated as described elsewhere (22Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To prepare cell lysates, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were removed by scraping, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C.DNA Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—H19-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm-diameter dishes. When the cell confluency was 70–90%, the cells were transfected with suitable plasmid constructs by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When luciferase reporter construct, pCRE-TK-Luc, was transiently co-transfected with the kinase-inactive mutant LIMK1-D460A, luciferase activity was determined by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer (EG & G Berthold). In every transfection experiment, CRE-lacking thymidine kinase (TK) promoter construct (pTK-Luc) was used as a negative control.Immunoprecipitation—One microgram of polyclonal anti-LIMK1 antibodies was incubated with 600 μg of cell extract prepared in lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. Twenty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were then pelleted and washed thoroughly with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and whole protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), which was then blocked in TBST buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 plus 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk containing antiphospho-CREB, anti-CREB, or anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Membrane was washed several times in TBST and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 60 min. The blot was then washed several times with TBST and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.Analysis of bFGF-induced Neuronal Differentiation in H19-7 Cells— H19-7 cells were grown on poly-l-lycine-coated 6-well dishes, and before reaching 70–90% confluency, the cells were switched to N2 medium and cultured at 39 °C for a further 2 days. Cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 48 h and analyzed for morphological changes. Differentiated cells were defined as those with a rounded and refractile cell body containing at least one neurite with a length greater than that of the cell body.In Vitro Kinase Assay—H19-7 cells grown in serum-free N2 medium for 2 days at 39 °C were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer, and lysate proteins (600 μg) were incubated with polyclonal anti-LIMK1 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Twenty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of Protein A-Sepharose were then added to the immunocomplexes, and after washing the samples with lysis buffer, kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min in a total volume of 20 μl, which contained kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg of acid-treated enolase), 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of GST-CREB or GST-CREB-S133A as a substrate. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.In-gel Kinase Assay—The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared containing 50 μg/ml GST-CREB or GST-CREB-S113A as an in-gel phosphorylation substrate. The total cell extracts were applied to the gel and resolved. All gel renaturation and phosphorylation protocols were performed as described previously (22Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Rac, Cdc42, and Rho Activation Assays—Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA activities were measured as described previously (23Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The amounts of the GTP-bound form of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho were assessed by using either GST fused to the PAK1-binding domain, for active Cdc42 and Rac, or GST protein fused with the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin, for active Rho, respectively. H19-7 cell lysates prepared with ice-cold cell lysis buffer were incubated with 30 μg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B bound either to Cdc42/Rac-binding domain of rat PAK1-binding domain or to RBD of rhotekin (GST-RBD) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the bound proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-mouse monoclonal Rac, Rho, or Cdc42 antibodies.RESULTSIdentification of Novel CREB Kinase(s) Activated during the Neuronal Differentiation of Immortalized Hippocampal Progenitor Cells—A conditionally immortalized hippocampal progenitor cell line (H19-7) was generated by transducing temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen into rat embryonic day 17 hippocampal cells (24Eves E.M.

These H19-7 cells had the ability to terminally differentiate into neuronal cells at a nonpermissive temperature (39 °C) in a defined medium when induced by several agents, which included bFGF (25Kuo W.L.

On differentiation H19-7 cells expressed several neuronal markers, including neurite outgrowth and neurofilament proteins (24Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc.

In earlier work we showed that CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription play important roles during bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells (27Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly the CREB phosphorylation was not mediated by any of the previously known signaling pathways, i.e. mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, p70S6K, or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. These findings suggest that the activation of a novel protein kinase signaling pathway is required for this bFGF responsiveness (27Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To identify upstream signal transduction pathways leading to CREB phosphorylation and to isolate the novel CREB kinase(s), a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using mutant CREB in which the critically regulatory Pro132-Ser133 residues of CREB were changed to Ser132-Leu133 as bait. The modification of either the catalytic or regulatory domains of transcription factors, including CREB, is frequently used to enhance the interaction and to stabilize the complex formation with its kinase in yeast two-hybrid assays (21Yang E.J.

By screening the human fetal brain cDNA library, we detected several known and several novel CREB-interacting proteins. These included Dyrk1A (21Yang E.J. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (60Yang E.J. Yoon J.H. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1827-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and LIMK1. As LIMK1 is known to play an integral role in the differentiation and signal transduction directed by nerve growth factor or epidermal growth factor in PC12 cells, we further examined its functional role during neuronal differentiation in CNS-derived hippocampal progenitor cells.Specific Binding between Active CREB and LIMK1 during the Neuronal Differentiation of H19-7 Cells—First, we examined whether LIMK1 is expressed in H19-7 cells or selectively induced under neuronal differentiation conditions. Cells were treated with bFGF for various times, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-LIMK1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, LIMK1 expression was not markedly changed by stimulating H19-7 cells with bFGF, although LIMK1 protein was expressed highly without stimulation (Fig. 1A). Second, to confirm a previous finding that bFGF stimulated the activation of CREB (27Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody specific for the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB. During the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF, the Ser133 residue in CREB protein was found to be significantly phosphorylated, whereas endogenous CREB levels were not markedly changed (Fig. 1B). Next we examined whether LIMK1 specifically binds to CREB in mammalian H19-7 cells. Cell extracts obtained after neurogenic bFGF stimulation were immunoprecipitated against either anti-LIMK1 or anti-CREB antibodies and then blotted with anti-LIMK1 antibodies. The addition of bFGF led to a marked increase in the specific binding between endogenous LIMK1 and CREB (Fig. 1C). When cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies and blotted with anti-LIMK antibodies, LIMK1 was found to selectively bind to active CREB within 30 min of bFGF stimulation (Fig. 1C). The transient overexpression of kinase-deficient LIMK1 mutants (LIMK1-D460A), in which the catalytic residue Asp460 had been replaced with Ala (31Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A.

Furthermore, when H19-7 cell lysates mock-transfected or transfected with plasmids encoding either HA-tagged wild type or dominant-negative LIMK1 mutant were immunoprecipitated by anti-active CREB antibodies and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA IgG, it was found that the addition of bFGF results in specific binding between HA-tagged LIMK1 and phospho-CREB but not between kinase-inactive LIMK1 and CREB (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that LIMK1 interacts with active CREB in a specific way during the bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of H19-7 cells.Active LIMK1 Directly Phosphorylates CREB in Response to Neurogenic bFGF in H19-7 Cells—As LIMK1 is activated via the phosphorylation of the Thr508 residue located in its kinase domain (32Edwards D.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we investigated whether LIMK1 is also activated by bFGF in H19-7 cells. After stimulating H19-7 cells with bFGF, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated against anti-LIMK1 antibodies, and the precipitated mixtures were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using anti-phospho-Tyr or anti-phospho-Ser/Thr antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of Ser/Thr-phosphorylated LIMK1 were markedly increased by bFGF stimulation in H19-7 cells, whereas no tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous LIMK1 was observed, suggesting that treating H19-7 cells with the neurogenic growth factor bFGF induces the LIMK1 activation.Fig. 2Activation of LIMK1 during bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells. H19-7 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF (FGF) for the indicated times under differentiating conditions. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 IgG, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected with either anti-phospho-Tyr (pTyr) or anti-phospho-Ser/Thr (pSer/Thr) antibodies as indicated. The quantity of immunoprecipitated LIMK1 was determined by blotting with anti-LIMK1 antibodies. The data shown are representative of three experiments.

The cell lysates obtained after bFGF treatment were immunoprecipitated using anti-LIMK1 antibodies. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using bacterial recombinant GST-CREB fusion proteins as a substrate, and phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3A, CREB phosphorylation was significantly induced by bFGF in a time-dependent manner and reached a maximum level at 30 min. When mutant GST-CREB-S133A, in which the Ser133 residue of CREB was replaced by alanine, was used as a substrate, no significant CREB phosphorylation was observed versus wild type CREB (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that LIMK1 directly phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB during the differentiation of H19-7 cells and that its effect specifically involves the Ser133 residue of CREB.Fig. 3LIMK1 directly phosphorylates CREB in response to bFGF in H19-7 cells.A, H19-7 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF (FGF) for the indicated times, and total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 antiserum. Where specified, an in vitro CREB kinase assay was performed using LIMK1-bound immunoprecipitates and bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing either wild type CREB (GST-CREB) or S133A CREB mutant (GST-mCREB) as an exogenous substrate. Kinase reaction products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated CREB levels were determined by autoradiography. B, H19-7 cells were either left untreated (Con) or treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF (FGF) for 30 min or the indicated times, and total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 IgG. The in-gel kinase renaturation assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 72-kDa CREB kinase activated by bFGF is indicated by an arrow (upper panel).

IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the possibility that, rather than LIMK1, other contaminated Ser/Thr kinase(s) in the LIMK1 immunocomplexes phosphorylate CREB at Ser133 in response to bFGF, we performed an in vitro in-gel kinase assay using a polyacrylamide gel prepared in the presence of bacterially recombinant GST fused with either wild type CREB or with CREB-S133A mutant protein. Equal amounts of protein-containing anti-LIMK1 IgG immunoprecipitates from H19-7 cells, which had been stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 30 min, were resolved by SDS-PAGE, renatured, and then assayed for CREB phosphorylation in the gel. The results obtained showed that a 72-kDa band, corresponding to LIMK1, markedly phosphorylated CREB in the gel (Fig. 4C). Moreover no significant kinase activity was detected when the mutant GST-CREB-S133A was used as a substrate (Fig. 4C). An analysis of the immunoprecipitated protein complexes prepared using anti-LIMK1 antibodies followed by Western blot analysis against anti-LIMK1 antibodies revealed that the 72-kDa CREB kinase band in the gel was identical to that expected for LIMK1. Overall these results show that active LIMK1 can specifically phosphorylate CREB at its Ser133 residue when H19-7 cells are stimulated with bFGF.Fig. 4Effect of LIMK1 activity on CRE-mediated gene transcription in H19-7 cells.A, where indicated, H19-7 cells were treated with vehicle (lanes 1 and 2) or transiently transfected with pCRE-TK-Luciferase (CRE-Luc) reporter plasmid (1 μg) alone (lane 4) or with a construct (1 μg) encoding kinase-inactive LIMK1-D460A (mLIMK1, lane 5). The cells were then either left untreated (Control) or stimulated with 10 ng/ml bFGF (FGF) for 4 h, and the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid was measured. In every transfection experiment, the CRE-lacking TK promoter construct, pTK-Luc (TK-Luc), was used as a negative control (lane 6).

Although the laminin α2 chain is expressed in the early stage of dental mesenchyme development and localized in the tooth germ basement membrane, its expression pattern in the late stage of tooth germ development and molecular roles are not clearly understood. We analyzed the role of laminin α2 in tooth development by using targeted mice with a disrupted lama2 gene. Laminin α2 is expressed in dental mesenchymal cells, especially in odontoblasts and during the maturation stage of ameloblasts, but not in the pre-secretory or secretory stages of ameloblasts. Lama2 mutant mice have thin dentin and a widely opened dentinal tube, as compared with wild-type and heterozygote mice, which is similar to the phenotype of dentinogenesis imperfecta. During dentin formation, the expression of dentin sialoprotein, a marker of odontoblast differentiation, was found to be decreased in odontoblasts from mutant mice. Furthermore, in primary cultures of dental mesenchymal cells, dentin matrix protein, and dentin sialophosphoprotein, mRNA expression was increased in laminin-2 coated dishes but not in those coated with other matrices, fibronectin, or type I collagen. Our results suggest that laminin α2 is essential for odontoblast differentiation and regulates the expression of dentin matrix proteins.

In addition, the extracellular matrix layer, whose main components are laminin, collagen IV, nidogen, and sulfated proteoglycan, and the BM layer are both considered to be involved with cell proliferation and differentiation (4Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 5Yurchenco P.D. O'Rear J.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The laminin family is composed of BM proteins that have been implicated in diverse functions of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Each member is a heterotrimer composed of α, β, and γ chains, and five α, three β, and three γ chains have been identified and are known to form at least 15 heterotrimer structures. Most laminin family members have been found to have combinations of β1γ1 or β2γ1 chains with one of the five α chains, although laminin-5 has a unique chain composition, α3β3γ2. Laminin-2 (with α2, β1, and γ1 chains), also known as merosin, is a major component of BM proteins in skeletal muscle and the peripheral nervous system (6Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and the absence of the laminin α2 chain causes merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MD-CMD) (7Tome F.M. Evangelista T. Leclerc A. Sunada Y. Manole E. Estournet B. Barois A. Campbell K.P. Fardeau M. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Sewry C. Dubowitz V. J. Child Neurol. 1995; 10: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MD-CMD causes degradation, regeneration, interstitial fibrosis, and adipose tissue infiltration in skeletal muscle. Dystrophic (dy/dy) mice also display a severe reduction in laminin α2 chain expression and are accepted as an animal model of MD-CMD (6Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J.

We generated a null mutant lacking the laminin α2 chain using a gene-targeting technique to examine the molecular pathophysiology of MD-CMD (12Miyagoe Y. Hanaoka K. Nonaka I. Hayasaka M. Nabeshima Y. Arahata K. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The mice showed symptoms similar to those seen in MD-CMD and a shorter life span than dy/dy mice (13Miyagoe-Suzuki Y. Nakagawa M. Takeda S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 48: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During tooth development, the mRNA of three laminin α chains, α1, α2, and α4, is expressed in tooth mesenchymal cells, whereas two other types, laminin α3 and α5 chain mRNA, are found in epithelial cells (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Salmivirta K. Ekblom P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, laminin α5 mRNA is widely expressed in tooth epithelium, with the corresponding protein distributed along the tooth basement membrane during the embryonic stage and diminished at the start of enamel matrix production (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Laminin α3 expression is slight in the embryonic stage and then dramatically increases during terminal differentiation of ameloblasts, following degradation of the tooth BM (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Ryan M.C. Lee K. Miyashita Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). On the other hand, laminin α2 mRNA is detected in mesenchymal cells in the tooth germ. In the earlier stages, mesenchymal expression is seen around the epithelial bud, while in later stages (E15–18) laminin α2 mRNA expression becomes stronger in dental sac cells than in dental papilla cells. By using immunohistostaining, laminin α2 can be detected in the tooth germ BM before E15, although later (E15–18) staining is lost from the dental BM, the area between the inner dental epithelium and dental papilla mesenchyme layers, whereas it remains strong in the BM area between the outer dental epithelium and dental sac mesenchyme (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the expression and molecular mechanisms of laminin α2 in postnatal tooth development have not been clearly shown. In the present study, we examined tooth formation and dentin sialoprotein (DSP) expression in laminin α2 knockout mice, a mutant strain with thin enamel and a widely opened dentinal tube, which are caused by a reduction of dentin formation and odontoblast differentiation. Laminin-2 enhances the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and dentin matrix protein (DMP) in primary cultured dental mesenchymal cells. Our present findings suggest that interactions between laminin α2 and odontoblasts regulate their differentiation and are important for dentinogenesis. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Analysis—Incisors were taken from wild-type and laminin α2 null mice and coated with gold and photographed using scanning electron microscopy at 20 kV (S-3500, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To observe the enamel crystals and dentinal tubes, the specimens were embedded in epoxy resin, cut with an ISOMET low speed saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL), and then treated with 40% phosphoric acid for 10 s and 10% sodium hypochlorite for 30 s, prior to coating with gold. Preparation of Tissue Sections—Laminin α2 null mice were generated by gene targeting and housed in a pathogen-free animal facility. Standard Nagasaki University guidelines were followed to monitor their health status as well as the housing and breeding practices. To prepare the heads of 3-week-old mice, each animal was anesthetized and then fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The maxilla was dissected out, post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and decalcified with 250 mm EDTA/PBS for 2 weeks, then dehydrated in xylene through a graded ethanol series, and embedded in paraplastic paraffin (Oxford Laboratories). Sections were cut at 10 μm on a microtome (RM2155, LEICA, Inc.). For detailed morphological analyses of molars and incisors, sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin Y (Sigma). For staining of cultured cells, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS for 5 min and then 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on the sections, which were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS as a blocking agent for 1 h prior to incubation with primary antibodies. We used antibodies directed against laminin α2 (4H8–2, Alexis) (12Miyagoe Y. Hanaoka K. Nonaka I. Hayasaka M. Nabeshima Y. Arahata K. Takeda S.

The primary antibodies were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy-3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Dental Epithelial and Mesenchymal Cell Cultures—For dental mesenchymal cell cultures, P3 mouse molars were dissected and treated with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min, after which the dental mesenchyme was separated from the dental epithelium. Separated dental mesenchyme samples were treated with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 15 min and then collected using a pipette and placed into the wells (21Fukumoto E. Sakai H. Fukumoto S. Yagi T. Takagi O. Kato Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Dental mesenchymal cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, whereas a dental epithelial cell line (HAT-7) was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum (22Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Developing molars were dissected from P3 mice, and RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 90 min using oligo(dT)14 primer. Real time PCR amplification was performed using primers for AMBN (5′-GCGTTTCCAAGAGCCCTGATAAC-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGCAGTGTCACATTTCCTGG-3′), AMEL (5′-ATTCCACCCCAGTCTCATCAG-3′ and 5′-CCACTTCGGTTCTCTCATTTTCTG-3′), enamelin (5′-GTGAGGAAAAATACTCCATATTCTGG-3′ and 5′-GTTGAAGCGATCCCTAAGCCTGAAGCAG-3′), enamelysin (MMP-20) (5′-AGATGGTGGCAAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-GAGATTCCGTATGTCAAAAT-3′), DSPP (5′-CTCAGAGAGAATCTGGGTGTACCACC-3′ and 5′-CACAGTGGTACATGGAGAGCTC-3′), DMP (5′-GCTTCAGGCTCAGTCTTGCT-3′ and 5′-TGTAACCCTCCAACTCCAGG-3′), osteonectin (5′-GTCTCACTGGCTGTGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGACTTGCCATGTGGGTTC-3′), osteopontin (5′-CGATGATGATGACGATGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGTCCTCATCTGTGGCAT-3′), osteocalcin (5′-CCTCTTGAAAGAGTGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGGAGACAAACAACAT-3′), and G3PDH (5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′), with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix by TaqMan 7700 Sequencer Detection (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed for 40 cycles, 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min as reported previously (21Fukumoto E. Sakai H. Fukumoto S. Yagi T. Takagi O. Kato Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation and Cell Binding—Dental epithelial cells (HAT-7) and dental mesenchymal cells at 1.0 × 105 were cultured in a 60-mm diameter dish coated with or without laminin-2 (merosin, Invitrogen), type I collagen (Cellmatrix, NITTA GERATIN, Japan), and fibronectin (human fibronectin, Invitrogen) for 5 days. At 1, 3, and 5 days after plating, cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and their numbers were counted under a microscope. For cell binding, dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells were detached with 0.05% EDTA, washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended to a concentration of 3.5 × 105/ml. Assays were performed in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates (Immulon-2HB, Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA). Wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with laminin 2, type I collagen, or fibronectin, then diluted with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were added to a plate and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Attached cells were stained for 10 min with 0.2% crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% methanol. After washing with H2O, the cells were dissolved in 10% SDS, and absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Laminin α2 Expression in Differentiated Odontoblasts and Maturation of Ameloblasts—Laminin α2 is known to be expressed in dental mesenchymal cells and localizes in the BM area between the dental epithelium and mesenchyme layers in the early stage of tooth germ development (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, its expression in later stages, especially in the postnatal period, has not been clearly identified. We performed immunostaining of incisor samples from 3-week-old mice to identify the localization of laminin α2, which was found expressed in the preameloblast and pre-odontoblast interfaces (Fig. 1A, a), as well as in odontoblasts, the outer side of the dental epithelium including the papillary cell layer, capillaries, and the muscle BM (Fig. 1A, a and b). However, laminin α2 expression was not observed in the cervical loop region or the secretory stage of ameloblasts (Fig. 1B, a). Later, in the early maturation (Fig. 1B, b) and late maturation (Fig. 1B, c) stages, laminin α2 appeared in the side of the enamel. On the other hand, laminin α2 expression was detected in odontoblasts at all stages (Fig. 1C). To confirm the expression in odontoblasts, immunostaining of primary cultured dental mesenchymal cells was performed, and laminin α2-positive cells were found expressed in DSP (Fig. 1D), which is a marker of odontoblasts, indicating that the odontoblasts produced laminin α2. Decreased Dentin Formation and Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Laminin α2 Null Mice—For the targeted disruption of LAMA2, a PGK-neo gene was inserted into the laminin α2 chain (12Miyagoe Y. Hanaoka K. Nonaka I. Hayasaka M. Nabeshima Y. Arahata K. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These mice had been back-crossed into the BALB/c strain at least 10 times, before the tooth phenotype was analyzed. To examine laminin α2 expression in the masseter muscle, we performed immunostaining of 3-week-old wild-type, heterozygous, and null mutant mice, using rat anti-laminin α2 chain monoclonal antibody 4H8–2, which recognizes the 300-kDa portion of the protein (23Schuler F. Sorokin L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results confirmed the absence of the laminin α2 chain in mutant strain muscles. Laminin α2-positive staining was observed in the muscle BM (Fig. 2A, a and b) in the wild-type and heterozygote mice but not in the mutants (Fig. 2A, c). In the same mice used to analyze laminin α2 expression in the masseter muscle, the color of the incisor surface in the mutants was found to be white when compared with the wild-type and heterozygote mice, indicating amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) (Fig. 2B). For detailed analyses of the incisor enamel and dentin, scanning microscopic examinations were performed. The overall tooth length and shape of the upper incisors were not different between the heterozygote and mutant mice (Fig. 2C); however, the cross-sectional surface of the incisor was decreased, as well as the enamel and dentin thickness by ∼13 and 25%, respectively, in the mutant specimens (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, the surface of the superficial enamel was rough as compared with that of the heterozygote incisors, resulting in the white color (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the size and structure of the enamel were not different between the two types of mice. On the other hand, the dentinal tubes were opened wide in the mutant mice following treatment with phosphoric acid and sodium hypochlorite, indicating immature dentin in the surrounding area (Fig. 3e). In the SEM analysis, enamel surface and dentin structures were not different between the wild-type and heterozygote mice (data not shown).Fig. 3Rough surface of superficial enamel and widely opened dentinal tubes in lama2–/– mice. SEM analysis of the incisor specimens from heterozygote (a, c, and d) and mutant (b, d, and e) mice was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Higher magnified images of superficial enamel (c and d) and dentinal tubes (d and e) in the boxed region of a and b are also shown. The superficial enamel of the mutant incisors was rough (d) as compared with that from the heterozygotes (c). The dentinal tubes were opened wide in the mutant specimens (e) following treatment with phosphoric acid and sodium hypochlorite.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Decreased Expression of DSP in Laminin α2 Null Mice—To analyze the differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts in mutant mice, we performed immunohistochemistry examinations using antibodies to AMEL, AMBN, and DSP. The AMEL and AMBN expression patterns during the secretory stage of ameloblasts were not altered in mutant incisors as compared with those from the wild-type and heterozygote mice (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, by using hematoxylin and eosin staining of dentin and odontoblasts, the width of the predentin and shape of odontoblasts in laminin α2 null mice were shown not to be different from those of the wild-type and heterozygote mice. However, DSP expression in odontoblasts was dramatically reduced in the mutant mice teeth (Fig. 4B). In addition, DMP, DSPP, and osteopontin mRNA expressions in dissected incisors were also decreased in two of the mutant mice (Fig. 5), whereas DMP, DSPP, and osteopontin mRNA were highly expressed in those from the wild type. DMP mRNA expression in two mutant strains was dramatically decreased by ∼60%, whereas DSP and osteopontin mRNA were decreased by ∼70% (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the differentiation of odontoblasts in the mutant mice was inhibited by the absence of the laminin α2 chain.Fig. 5Decreased expression of DMP, DSPP, and osteopontin mRNA in lama2–/– mice. Incisors were dissected from the maxillas of wild type (wt) and two mutant (K1 and K2) strains of 3-week-old mice, and then mRNA was isolated and amplified using quantitative RT-PCR, real time PCR, methods with specific primer sets as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expressions of DMP, DSPP, and osteopontin mRNA were decreased in both mutant strains. G3PDH mRNA was used as the control. G3PDH expression was not different between each sample (data not shown). mRNA expression in the mutant samples was compared with that in the wild type.

Biol. 1981; 81: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the present study, laminin α2 showed an expression pattern similar to other BM proteins (Fig. 1). To analyze the effect of laminin-2 on ameloblasts, a rat dental epithelial cell line (HAT-7) was cultured in several extracellular matrix-coated dishes for 3 days, after which marker gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. In HAT-7 cells, AMEL expression was inhibited by laminin 2, fibronectin, and type I collagen (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, enamelin and MMP-20 (enamelysin) expression was also decreased in those matrix cultures (Fig. 6A), whereas AMBN expression in HAT-7 was not detected under any of the tested conditions (data not shown). These results suggest that laminin-2 inhibits ameloblast differentiation in the secretory stage. Laminin α2 is known to be expressed in dental mesenchymal cells in the early stage and then transiently disappears in mesenchymal cells facing the inner dental epithelium. In the present study, this expression reappeared and continued during dentin formation. To identify the role of laminin α2 with odontoblast differentiation, dental mesenchymal cells from P3 molar tooth germ samples were cultured in laminin-2, fibronectin, and type I collagen-coated dishes, and ∼15% of the cells were found to be DSP-positive by immunostaining (data not shown). Furthermore, the expression of DSPP and DMP was increased 3–4-fold in the laminin-2-coated dish, whereas there were no changes in those coated with fibronectin or type I collagen (Fig. 6B). No Effect by Laminin-2 on Proliferation and Cell Binding of Dental Mesenchymal Cells—In general, the extracellular matrix is important for proliferation and differentiation of dental epithelium and mesenchymal cells. However, long term cultures of dental epithelial cells was shown to lead to an enhancement of cell proliferation and decrease of the enamel matrix protein amelogenin in collagen-coated dishes (26Kukita A. Harada H. Kukita T. Inai T. Matsuhashi S. Kurisu K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 51: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease of amelogenin and increase of DMP and DSPP mRNA in laminin-2-coated dishes was dependent on cell proliferation, we analyzed the effect of matrices on cell proliferation (Fig. 7). Cells were cultured with each matrix, and their numbers were counted after 5 days. HAT-7 proliferation in the type I collagen dish was increased (Fig. 7A), but not in the laminin-2 or fibronectin dishes, with similar results observed in the primary cultured dental mesenchymal cells (Fig. 7B). Type I collagen coating is known to have a greater effect on the expression of enamel matrix proteins than laminin-2 and fibronectin. Our results suggest that the decrease of enamel matrix expression in the type I collagen-coated dish may have been caused by an increase of cell proliferation. However, the decrease of amelogenin seen in dental epithelial cells and the increase of DMP and DSPP mRNA seen in dental mesenchymal cells cultured with laminin-2 may not have been dependent on cell proliferation. Laminin is associated with several extracellular matrix and cell receptors that are important for cell binding. We hypothesized that laminin-2 directly binds to dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells and regulates the gene expression of dentin and enamel matrices. To analyze the cell binding activity of laminin-2, cells were incubated in laminin-2-coated microtiter plates as described under the “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 8). We found that dental epithelial cell binding to laminin-2 was significantly weaker than that to fibronectin and type I collagen (Fig. 8A), whereas dental mesenchymal cells showed little or no binding to the laminin-2-coated plate (Fig. 8B). This is the first known analysis of laminin α2 expression in differentiated ameloblasts and odontoblasts during odontogenesis and tooth development in mutant mice. Laminin α2 chain mRNA and protein are expressed in several organs besides striated muscles, including the central nervous system (6Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), thyroid gland, thymus, kidney, testis, skin, and digestive tract. In addition, laminin α2 is also expressed in the tooth germ during amelogenesis and dentinogenesis in a stage-specific manner (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, laminin α2 chain mRNA was found intensely expressed in dental sac cells. Furthermore, results from immunostaining for laminin α2 expression were in conformity with the detected mRNA patterns, indicating a role for the laminin α2 chain in the production of BM proteins by dental mesenchymal cells. Salmivirta et al. (14Salmivirta K. Sorokin L.M. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that no laminin α chains (α1, α2, and α4) expressed by mesenchymal cells were found in secretory odontoblasts. However, they analyzed molars from embryonic stage and postnatal day 1 mice, during which odontoblasts are partially differentiated. For this reason, we used incisors from 3-week-old mice to investigate the expression of laminin α2 chain in fully differentiated ameloblasts and odontoblasts. The BM of the cervical loop in the incisor did not express the laminin α2 chain, indicating that there is no expression in inner dental epithelium or dental mesenchymal cells in molars. In contrast, expression was observed in the interface between pre-ameloblasts and odontoblasts, whereas laminin α2 transiently disappeared during odontoblast differentiation. Because dy3K/dy3K mice have no laminin α2 chain, they are excellently suited for analysis of the biological functions of the laminin α2 chain in various organs (12Miyagoe Y. Hanaoka K. Nonaka I. Hayasaka M. Nabeshima Y. Arahata K. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed laminin α2 null mutant mice in order to identify the role of laminin α2 in the tooth development. These mice showed irregular enamel surface structures"
https://openalex.org/W2089467829,"The antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 is now a recognized phototarget of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with the phthalocyanine Pc 4 and with other mitochondrion-targeting photosensitizers. Photodamage, observed on Western blots as the loss of the native 26-kDa Bcl-2 protein, is PDT dose dependent and occurs in multiple cell lines, in the cold, and immediately upon photoirradiation. In our initial study, no photochemical damage was observed to Bcl-xL, in spite of its similarity in size, sequence, location and function to Bcl-2. The original study used a commercial anti-Bcl-xS/L antibody. We have revisited this issue by examining Western blots developed using one of three epitope-specific anti-Bcl-xL antibodies from commercial sources, a polyclonal antibody generated to the entire protein, as well as the antibody used previously. All five Bcl-xL antibodies recognized bacterially expressed Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, whereas an anti-Bcl-2 antibody recognized Bcl-2 and not Bcl-xL. All five Bcl-xL antibodies recognized at least one protein migrating at approximately 30 kDa; two of the antibodies recognized an additional band, migrating at approximately 33 or approximately 24 kDa. We now observe Pc 4-PDT-induced photodamage to all Bcl-xL-related proteins, except the 33-kDa species, in several human cancer cell lines. The results indicate that, in addition to the expected quantitative differences that may reflect exposure of individual epitopes, the antibodies also detect proteins of different apparent molecular weights that may be distinct isoforms or post-translationally modified forms of Bcl-xL. No evidence for PDT-induced phosphorylation or degradation was observed. Bcl-xL localized to mitochondria was considerably more sensitive to photodamage than was Bcl-xL in the cytosol, indicating that as previously found for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL must be membrane localized to be photosensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2013954497,"Mice with a null mutation in the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, syndecan-1 (Sdc1), develop almost normally, but resist mammary tumor development in response to Wnt-1. Here, we test the hypothesis that Sdc1 promotes Wnt-1-induced tumor development by interacting with the Wnt cell surface signaling complex. Thus, the response of Sdc1−/− mammary epithelial cells (mecs) to the intracellular, activated Wnt signal transducer, ΔNβ-catenin, was assayed both in vitro and in vivo, to test whether β-catenin/TCF transactivation was Sdc1-independent. Surprisingly, we found that the expression of a canonical Wnt pathway reporter, TOP-FLASH, was reduced by 50% in both unstimulated Sdc1−/− mecs and in stimulated cells responding to Wnt1 or ΔNβ-catenin. Tumor development in response to ΔNβ-catenin was also significantly delayed on a Sdc1−/− background. Furthermore, the average β-catenin/TCF transactivation per cell was normal in Sdc1−/− mec cultures, but the number of responsive cells was reduced by 50%. Sdc1−/− mecs show compensatory changes that maintain the number of HS chains, hence these experiments cannot test the coreceptor activity of HS for Wnt signaling. We propose that TCF-dependent transactivational activity is suppressed in 50% of cells in Sdc1−/− glands, and conclude that the major effect of Sdc1 does not map to the activity of the Wnt signaling complex, but to another pathway to create or stabilize the β-catenin/TCF-responsive tumor precursor cells in mouse mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1965809040,"The Ink4b gene (Cdkn2b) encodes p15(Ink4b), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. It has been implicated in playing a role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in man, since it is hypermethylated with high frequency. We provide evidence that the gene is a tumor suppressor for myeloid leukemia in mice. The evidence is twofold: (1) retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemias of the myelomonocytic phenotype were found to have hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the Ink4b gene, and this could be correlated with reduced mRNA expression, as demonstrated by TaqMan real-time PCR. p15(Ink4b) mRNA expression in a leukemia cell line, with hypermethylation at the locus, was induced following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. (2) Targeted deletion of one allele in mice by removal of exon 2 increases their susceptibility to retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia. Mice deficient in both alleles were not more susceptible to myeloid disease than those deficient in one allele, raising the possibility that there are opposing forces related to the development of myeloid leukemia in Ink4b null mice."

E2F transcription factors are important downstream components of this pathway, which act by controlling the expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. To determine whether E2F2 deregulation promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated E2F2 transgenic mice, in which the Eμ and murine pim1 promoter (pp) direct high expression of E2F2 in thymic epithelial cells. Eμ-pp-E2F2 mice start to develop cytokeratin- and ER-TR4-positive cortical thymomas from the age of 20 weeks, and within 1 year, nearly all mice succumb to gross thymic epithelial tumors. General thymic morphology is largely maintained, but T cell development is perturbed in thymomas, with proportionately less CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes. In the first 3 months, E2F2 transgenic thymi exhibit only mild epithelial hyperplasia, and thereafter thymomas arise stochastically, probably following additional mutations.

Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G. Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and in hematopoietic progenitor cells E2F2 is required for efficient S phase progression (17Li F.X. Zhu J.W. Hogan C.J. DeGregori J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In postmitotic lens fibers overexpression of E2F2 induces cell cycle entry and subsequent apoptosis (35Chen Q. Hung F.C. Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4223-4231PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that E2F2 has a distinct function in promoting oncogenic transformation of nonlymphoid thymic epithelial cells (TECs). E2F2 Transgenic Mice—For the generation of Eμ-pp-E2F2 mice, a 1.3-kb HA-tagged human E2F2 cDNA was inserted into the SacI-KpnI site of pJ3Ω. The NotI-HpaI fragment containing HA-E2F2, followed by splice donor and acceptor elements derived from SV40 small t antigen intervening sequences present in pJ3Ω, was cloned in EagI-HpaI site of Eμ-pim1 promoter-Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR transgenic vector. The assembled transgene was liberated with HindIII from the vector backbone, microinjected into pronuclei of FVB zygotes, and transferred to (B6 × DBA)F1 foster mice. Eμ-pp-E2F founder mice and subsequent transgenic progeny were identified with PCR analysis on genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies with transgene specific primers TDK5′ 5′-CGGCCTTTGATGGCTTTG-3′ and EMU3′ 5′-AGGGTATGAGAGAGCCTC-3′. Northern and Southern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from frozen sections of normal and hyperplastic thymi or isolated TECs and thymocytes using TRIzol (Invitrogen). TECs were isolated as described previously (36Izon D.J. Nieland J.D. Godfrey D.I. Boyd R.L. Kruisbeek A.M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Samples of 20 μg of total RNA were separated on a 1% paraformaldehyde-containing agarose gel, transferred to Protran nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized to random priming labeled [α-32P]dATP U3LTR or 0.8-kb β-actin cDNA probes. Genomic DNA (15 μg), isolated from frozen tissue samples, was digested with PvuII, separated on 0.7% 1 × TAE-agarose gel, blotted on Protran nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized to probe J15, a 900-bp ClaI-EcoRI fragment of Jβ2 locus, to check for T cell receptor rearrangements. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell extracts were generated by lysis of frozen thymic tissues in ice-cold ELB buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, and 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Samples were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, lysates separated with SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Polyclonal antibodies against E2F2 (C20), cyclin A (C19), cyclin E (M20), and actin (C11) (Santa Cruz) were used for immunoblotting. Results were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—For histopathological examination, thymi were removed, fixed with 10% buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistology of frozen sections, tissues were immersed in optimal cutting temperature compound and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 5 μm frozen sections were acetone fixed and stained with mouse monoclonal pan-cytokeratin (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal E2F2 (Santa Cruz), or rat monoclonal (ER-TR4, ER-TR5, and ER-TR7) (37Van Vliet E. Melis M. Van Ewijk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1984; 14: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) antibodies. Primary antibodies were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. For paraffin-embedded sections tissues were processed using a standard protocol for DAB immunostaining, incorporating an antigen retrieval step, and using a 1:250 dilution of the mouse monoclonal HA.11 antibody (Covance). DAB-stained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions were freshly prepared from wild-type thymus or hyperplastic thymi, and 106 cells were resuspended in 2% fetal calf serum, 5 mm HEPES in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD4 (RM4-5) and phycoerythrin-conjugated CD8α (53-6.7) (BD Pharmingen), washed and analyzed on FACScan (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest software package. Generation of Eμ-pp-E2F Transgenic Mice—To compare their ability to promote cell proliferation and regulate apoptosis when overexpressed in vivo, E2F1 and E2F2 transgenic mice were generated. For this purpose, human E2F1 and E2F2 cDNAs were subcloned in a vector containing a duplicated version of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (μ) inserted into the murine pim1 promoter (pp) region, and the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR, which encodes a polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1A). The Eμ-pp transgenic promoter has been shown to direct ubiquitous expression during embryonic development (38Alkema M.J. van der Lugt N.M. Bobeldijk R.C. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1995; 374: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and confers high expression to different hematopoietic cell lineages in adult mice (39Alkema M.J. Jacobs H. van Lohuizen M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen J. van der Valk M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Four founders containing the Eμ-pp-E2F1 (TEF1-5, -21, -43, and -62) or Eμ-pp-E2F2 (TEF2-6, -33, -35, and -37) transgene were identified by PCR analysis on genomic DNA, and each of the founders was transmitted the E2F transgene to their progeny, except founder TEF2-6. To analyze expression of the different Eμ-pp-E2F transgenes in the thymus and compare transgene-driven E2F mRNA levels, Northern blot hybridization was performed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus U3LTR probe. Both Eμ-pp-E2F1 (TEF1-5) and Eμ-pp-E2F2 (TEF2-35 and TEF2-37) mice showed significant E2F1 and E2F2 transgenic mRNA levels in thymus (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting confirmed protein expression of transgene-derived HA-tagged E2F1 and E2F2 (data not shown). Western blotting for cyclin E and cyclin A protein levels on thymic cell extracts indicated that transgene-driven E2F2 expression, but not E2F1, resulted in enhanced levels of cyclin E (Fig. 1C). Both cyclin E1 (Ccn1) and cyclin E2 (Ccn2) gene transcriptions are controlled by the pRb/E2F pathway (3Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), suggesting that overexpression of E2F2 in murine thymus activates cyclin E expression. Eμ-pp-E2F1 and Eμ-pp-E2F2 founder lines were mated with FVB mice to generate larger cohorts of E2F transgenic mice. Interestingly, we observed a remarkable difference in phenotypes between E2F1 and E2F2 transgenic mice. Eμ-pp-E2F1 mice displayed a strong delay in endochondral ossification with concomitant dwarfism and a relatively high perinatal lethality among Eμ-pp-E2F animals (60% of transgenic offspring) (39Alkema M.J. Jacobs H. van Lohuizen M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus with great difficulty, only one Eμ-pp-E2F1 line (TEF1-5) could be maintained. In contrast, progeny of all three Eμ-pp-E2F2 founder lines (TEF2-33, -35, and -37) were born alive with normal Mendelian ratios and showed no evidence of skeletal abnormalities. Therefore, subsequent functional studies were largely restricted to E2F2 transgenic mice. Eμ-pp-E2F2 Transgene Is Highly Expressed in TECs—We decided to examine in more detail the expression pattern of the Eμ-pp-E2F2 transgene in the two major cell types present in thymus, thymocytes and TECs. Thymic epithelium forms a structurally and functionally important component of the thymus microenvironment and is required for selection of the appropriate T cell repertoire on the cell surface of thymocytes (40Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen J. van der Valk M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Boyd R.L. Tucek C.L. Godfrey D.I. Izon D.J. Wilson T.J. Davidson N.J. Bean A.G. Ladyman H.M. Ritter M.A. Hugo P. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 445-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Total mRNA was extracted from freshly isolated thymocytes or TECs that were cultured short term in vitro to obtain pure epithelial cells in sufficient quantity. Surprisingly, Northern blot analysis indicated that Eμ-pp-E2F2 was highly expressed in purified TECs and very low or nondetectable in primary thymocytes (Fig. 2A). Similarly, transgenic E2F2 expression was absent in mature peripheral T cells (data not shown). TECs isolated from Eμ-pp-E2F1 mice displayed reduced viability and were not able to grow in vitro, suggesting that E2F1 overexpression promotes apoptosis in these cells. Immunohistochemical analysis performed on thymic sections of Eμ-E2F2 mice confirmed HA-E2F2 nuclear staining in TECs from E2F2 transgenic thymi but not wild-type controls (Fig. 2, B and C), and high E2F2 protein levels coincided with the network of cytokeratin-positive TECs interspersed between islets of thymocytes (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, pim1 promoter in conjunction with Eμ sequences direct high transgene expression of E2F2 in TECs. High Incidence of Spontaneous Thymic Tumors in Eμ-pp-E2F2 Transgenic Mice—The predominant phenotype observed in aging Eμ-pp-E2F2 animals of each transgenic line, which became apparent between the age of 5 and 11 months, was respiratory distress and dyspnea. Shortly thereafter, these E2F2 transgenic mice became cachectic and had to be sacrificed (Fig. 3). At autopsy, diseased Eμ-pp-E2F2 animals displayed severe hyperplastic thymi, often occupying the entire thoracic cavity (Fig. 4A). There was no evidence of enlarged secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen and lymph nodes) or macroscopic invasion of other organs. In most cases, the normal thymic bilobar structure was preserved in the solid hyperplastic thymi.Fig. 4Characterization of thymomas in Eμ-pp-E2F2 transgenic animals.

Each genomic DNA sample is digested with PvuII, blotted, and hybridized with a T cell receptor β2 probe to detect T cell receptor rearrangements. The arrow indicates the position of the germ line band. The asterisk indicates the monoclonal rearranged T cell receptor β allele. E, flow cytometry was performed on a single cell suspension of thymocytes isolated from wild-type thymus and Eμ-pp-E2F2 thymoma of founder TEF2-6, stained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies. The percentage of cells in each quadrant is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections indicated that the functional organization of cortex and medulla was still present in all E2F2 thymic tumors examined, but darker stained lymphocyte-rich cortical areas were largely increased in size compared with their normal counterparts (Fig. 4, B and C). Pale stained medulla-like areas with Hassall corpuscle-like structures were present as isolated islets in enlarged thymi instead of one continuous area within a normal thymic lobe. These macroscopic and histological features recapitulated the characteristics of epithelial thymomas. A few Eμ-pp-E2F2 tumors showed small necrotic areas, but overall there was no evidence for high grade malignancy. None of the 18 Eμ-pp-E2F1 mice that survived into late adulthood developed thymomas or showed an enlarged thymus upon necroscopy. These findings indicate that the induction of thymomas in Eμ-pp-E2F transgenic animals results as a consequence of deregulated E2F2 expression, but not E2F1. This different ability to induce tumors in thymic epithelium may well be related to the differential ability of E2F1 and E2F2 to induce apoptosis. Phenotypic Analyses of Thymocytes in Eμ-pp-E2F2 Thymomas—To investigate whether thymocytes present in hyperplastic thymi of Eμ-pp-E2F2 transgenic mice showed evidence of transformation, T cell receptor rearrangements were assessed by Southern blotting. T cell lymphomas are normally mono- or oligoclonal in origin, which can be demonstrated by a specific and unique rearrangement pattern at the joining regions of the T cell receptor β locus (Fig. 4D, lane 2). However, Eμ-pp-E2F2 tumors contained either a regular germ line configuration, as seen in wild-type thymus (Fig. 4D, lanes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8), or polyclonal rearrangements (Fig. 4D, lanes 4 and 7), arguing against the presence of T lymphoid tumor cells. These findings were corroborated by flow cytometric analyses, which also showed no indications for clonal outgrowth of specific thymocyte subsets in Eμ-pp-E2F2 thymic tumors as defined by CD4 and CD8 coreceptor expression (Fig. 4E). Instead, we found altered ratios of thymocyte subsets in Eμ-pp-E2F2 thymomas, with relatively more immature CD4-CD8- double negative pre-T cells as well as a higher proportion of postselected CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive thymocytes (Fig. 4E and Table I). Young Eμ-pp-E2F2 mice without thymomas showed normal CD4/CD8 thymocyte distributions (data not shown). These analyses indicate that enforced expression of E2F2 in TECs results in cortical thymomas with concomitant perturbation of T cell development.Table ILatency and distribution thymocyte subsets of Eμ-pp-E2F2 thymomas The age at which moribund Eμ-pp-E2F2 animals were sacrificed is indicated together with individual mouse identification numbers and transgenic founder lines of origin. Fraction of CD4-CD8- double negative, CD4+CD8+ double positive, CD4+CD8- single positive, and CD4-CD8+ single positive thymocyte subsets are shown as determined by flow cytometric analysis on freshly isolated thymic tumor single cell suspensions.

Release of pre-existing E2Fs from inactive complexes of E2F and hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (RB) is the prevailing dogma for E2F transcriptional activation of target genes such as cyclin A. Here we explored the hypothesis that new synthesis of E2F-1 is required for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) to induce cyclin A accumulation and RB hyperphosphorylation, events that are targeted by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) to arrest cell cycle progression. We first established that IGF-I increases expression of cyclin A, causes hyperphosphorylation of RB, and augments the mass of E2F-1 in a time-dependent manner. As expected, E2F-1 small interfering RNA blocks the ability of IGF-I to increase synthesis of E2F-1. Most important, this E2F-1 small interfering RNA also blocks the ability of IGF-I to increase cyclin A accumulation and to hyperphosphorylate RB. We next established that TNFα dose-dependently inhibits IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of both RB and histone H1 by cyclin A-dependent cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) mediates this suppression because co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TNFα reduces the amount of IGF-I-induced cyclin A that binds Cdk2, leading to a reduction in Cdk2 enzymatic activity. TNFα antagonizes the ability of IGF-I to increase mass of both E2F-1 and cyclin A but not cyclin E or D1. The cytostatic property of TNFα is also shown by its ability to block IGF-I-stimulated luciferase activity of a cyclin A promoter reporter. Deletion of an E2F recognition site from this reporter eliminates the regulatory effects of both IGF-I and TNFα on cyclin A transcription, indicating the essential role of E2F-1 in mediating their cross-talk. Collectively, these results establish that TNFα targets IGF-I-induced E2F-1 synthesis, leading to inhibition of the subsequent accumulation in cyclin A, formation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes, hyperphosphorylation of RB, and cell cycle arrest.

Cell cycle aberrations occurring at the G1/S checkpoint often lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. G1 phase progression is stimulated by extracellular growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar), and this progression can be blocked by cytostatic cytokines (2Orlovsky K. Theodor L. Malovani H. Chowers Y. Nir U.

Although the mechanisms of TNFα cytotoxicity are relatively well established (reviewed in Ref. 5Beletsky I.P. Moshnikova A.B. Proussakova O.V. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2002; 67: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the cytostatic properties of TNFα that suppress cell cycle progression are largely unknown. We recently reported (6Shen W.H. Zhou J.H. Broussard S.R. Freund G.G. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4746-4756PubMed Google Scholar) that TNFα exerts its antiproliferative action on human breast cancer cells not by killing the cells but rather by preventing them from passing into S. Importantly, this cytostatic property of TNFα is manifested only when cells are released from a quiescent state into active cell cycle progression induced by the late G1 progression factor, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Acting as the functional mediator of growth hormone and as a potent growth factor, IGF-I plays a role in promoting cell proliferation (7Welniak L.A. Sun R. Murphy W.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar), survival (8Vincent A.M. Feldman E.L. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), malignant transformation (9Valentinis B. Baserga R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and tumor progression (10Yu H. Rohan T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1472-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). These biological actions of IGF-I are often related to cell cycle control through different signaling pathways (11Chang F. Lee J.T. Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. Shelton J.G. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2003; 17: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1/S checkpoint is driven by coordinated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which requires heterodimeric cyclin partners for enzymatic activity (12Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cyclin A-associated CDKs play a critical role in initiation of DNA replication and subsequent S phase entry by phosphorylating components of the DNA replication machinery (13Yam C.H. Fung T.K. Poon R.Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Activated CDKs can also hyperphosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein. It is believed that RB hyperphosphorylation causes release of E2F transcription factors from pre-existing RB-E2F complexes (14Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). These functional E2F transcription factors then bind to specific promoter regions to induce target genes whose products are necessary for S phase entry. Among the six members of the E2F family of transcription factors, E2F-1 possesses oncogenic properties both in vitro (15Johnson D.G. Cress W.D. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and in vivo (16Pierce A.M. Schneider-Broussard R. Gimenez-Conti I.B. Russell J.L. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E2F-1 is sufficient to induce quiescent cells to enter the S phase (17Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The pivotal role of E2F transcription factors in driving the G1-S transition is largely mediated by their target genes such as G1 cyclins (18Stevens C. La Thangue N.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that IGF-I acts on key molecular events at the G1/S checkpoint, leading to inactivation of RB and elevation of G1 cyclins such as cyclin D1 (19Hamelers I.H. van Schaik R.F. Sipkema J. Sussenbach J.S. Steenbergh P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47645-47652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), E (20Liu Q. VanHoy R.W. Zhou J.H. Dantzer R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35942-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that IGF-I augments G1 cyclin expression and RB hyperphosphorylation by up-regulating synthesis of E2F transcriptional factors. In mammalian cells, three sets of G1 cyclin-CDK complexes are sequentially assembled, thereby leading to the G1-S transition: D-type cyclins and Cdk4/6; cyclin E and Cdk2; and cyclin A and Cdk2 (12Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Among these G1 cyclin proteins, cyclin A is synthesized at the onset of S phase and plays a critical role in initiation of DNA replication. Overexpression of cyclin A in cells from breast cancer patients is positively related to both early cancer relapse and death (22Bukholm I.R. Bukholm G. Nesland J.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing cyclin A in the mammary glands exhibit significant preneoplastic changes, including nuclear abnormalities and hyperplasia (23Bortner D.M. Rosenberg M.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1579-1589PubMed Google Scholar). These effects can be mimicked in vitro by ectopic expression of cyclin A, which accelerates entry of G1 cells into the S phase (24Rosenberg A.R. Zindy F. Le Deist F. Mouly H. Metezeau P. Brechot C. Lamas E. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1501-1509PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, microinjection of antisense directed at cyclin A or anti-cyclin A antibodies blocks DNA synthesis (25Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). TNFα and IGF-I have been linked in our recent report (6Shen W.H. Zhou J.H. Broussard S.R. Freund G.G. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4746-4756PubMed Google Scholar) showing that TNFα blocks breast cancer cell growth by inhibiting IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the early adaptor docking protein, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Here we extend these early signaling events to the cell cycle machinery, focusing on an E2F-1 feed-forward loop acting at the G1/S checkpoint. We provide strong evidence that TNFα antagonizes IGF-I-induced molecular events during G1-S progression by reducing the expression of E2F-1, E2F-dependent cyclin A promoter activity, cyclin A expression, the activity of both cyclin A and Cdk2 in phosphorylating RB, and the formation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes. We establish that cyclin A expression and RB hyperphosphorylation directly result from IGF-I-induced synthesis of E2F-1, as shown by a failure of IGF-I to augment cyclin A expression and to hyperphosphorylate RB in cells containing E2F-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The requirement of E2F in mediating IGF-I induction of cyclin A expression is also demonstrated by IGF-I unresponsiveness in cells expressing a cyclin A promoter that lacks an E2F recognition site. These observations provide direct evidence for a new mechanism by which E2F-1 activates target genes by increasing its own synthesis in response to growth factors like IGF-I. Most important, these data establish that TNFα blocks cyclin A expression by inhibiting this E2F-1 feed-forward loop at the G1-S boundary. Cell Culture and Treatments—Human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in maintenance medium consisting of minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma). Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a volume of 2 ml of maintenance medium in 6-well Costar plates (Corning Glass). MCF-7 cells express estrogen receptors, and estrogen increases IGF-I-induced MCF-7 cell growth by enhancing IGF-I receptor signaling (26Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phenol red can bind to the estrogen receptor on MCF-7 cells and exhibit significant estrogenic activity (27Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). In order to avoid the influence of estrogen on cellular responses to IGF-I, all treatments were performed in phenol red-free medium. For each experiment, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a 24-h incubation in culture medium consisting of phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 5 μg/ml human transferrin and 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma). Human IGF-I (100 ng/ml) and varying concentrations of human TNFα (Intergen) were added to cells individually or in combination for 24 h prior to preparation of whole cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from 1 × 106 MCF-7 cells in whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, containing freshly added 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 48 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin, 40 nm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin; Sigma). Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the amount of protein in the supernatant was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting included rabbit anti-IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (06-248)), rabbit anti-cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H-432, sc-751)), rabbit anti-cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-19, sc-198)), rabbit anti-Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (M2, sc-163)), mouse anti-cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (BF683, sc-239)), mouse anti-Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (D-12, sc-6248)), mouse anti-E2F-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (KH95, sc-251)), goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (I-19, sc-1616)), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (Transduction Laboratories (P11120)), mouse anti-RB (Pharmingen (554136, clone G3–245)), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and HRP-linked donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of protein in whole cell lysates (∼200 μg) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were preincubated with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h before distribution into cell lysates. Immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were mixed with reducing sample buffer (0.92 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5% SDS, 4% glycerol, and 280 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and separated on SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred with a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer device to Immune-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin or 5% skim milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated in the same blocking buffer with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with an HRP-labeled species-matched secondary antibody for another 1 h, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reprobing was performed following incubation of membranes in heated (>55 °C) stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7) for 30 min. Intensity of protein bands on autoradiograms was quantified by scanning with an Agfa Duosacan T1200 scanner followed by analysis using GelExpert 3.5 software (NucleoTech). In Vitro Cyclin A-dependent CDK Kinase and Cdk2 Kinase Assays— Human MCF-7 cells were incubated with different doses of TNFα with or without IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for 24 h prior to lysis with ice-cold CDK lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm glycerophosphate, with freshly added 50 mm NaF and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 48 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin, 40 nm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). Cyclin A or Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of protein (∼200 μg) in whole cell lysates. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with CDK lysis buffer and twice with CDK kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Both a truncated RB protein (p56RB, amino acids 379–928; QED Biosciences Inc.) and histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) were used as CDK substrates. Kinase reactions were carried out by incubation of immune complexes in 50 μl of reaction buffer (20 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5–1 μg of CDK substrate) at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were subsequently subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Following fixation in 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min, gels were dried in a slab gel drier (SGD4050, Savant), and phosphorylation of RB protein or histone H1 was detected with either a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 8600, Amersham Biosciences) or with autoradiography using B-PLUS X-ray films (Central IL X-Ray). Measurement of In Vivo Association of Cyclin A with Cdk2—Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal Cdk2 antibody to measure in vitro Cdk2 activity, as described above. Equal proportions of these Cdk2 immunoprecipitates were used for measurement of in vivo association of cyclin A with Cdk2. Briefly, the Cdk2 immunoprecipitates were mixed with a non-reducing sample buffer (0.92 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5% SDS, 4% glycerol) and maintained at room temperature for 1 h before electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions was necessary to prevent reduced heavy and light chains of the immunoprecipitating antibody from masking appearance of cyclin A (∼50 kDa) and Cdk2 (∼30 kDa), respectively. Immunoblotting was carried out by using a monoclonal cyclin A antibody as described above. Equal amounts of Cdk2 in each immunoprecipitate sample were confirmed by reprobing the same membrane with a monoclonal Cdk2 antibody. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Luciferase reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Vicente Andrés (Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, Valencia, Spain). The CycA-79/+100 construct is driven by the minimal promoter fragment displaying transcriptional activity of the 7.5-kb full promoter region of human cyclin A gene (28Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), whereas the CycA-54/+100 construct contains a deletion in an E2F-1-binding site. For transfection, cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in a volume of 2 ml in 6-well Costar plates (Corning Glass) in maintenance medium. The following day, 60–80% confluent cells were transiently transfected in duplicate with 5 μg of the luciferase reporter constructs, CycA-79/+100, CycA-54/+100, or an empty pGL2 vector (Promega), using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection with a pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech) that permits high level expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Analysis of 10,000 cells in an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter) routinely showed that 30–40% of transfected MCF-7 cells were GFP-positive. Medium containing transfection mixture was removed 2 h after transfection. Cells were washed with PBS three times, followed by addition of TNFα (10 ng/ml) or IGF-I (100 ng/ml) alone or in combination in serum-free and phenol red-free MEM for 60 h. Luciferase activity was measured in 20 μl of cell lysates using a luciferase assay system (Promega) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) for 12 s. All results were normalized to standard protein concentrations. E2F-1siRNA—To create human E2F-1siRNA, two oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized based on the coding sequence of the human E2F-1 gene as follows: forward oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGCTTCCTGGAGCTGCTGTTCAAGAGACAGCAGCTCCAGGAAGCGCTTTTTT-3′; reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-AATTAAAAAAGCGCTTCCTGGAGCTGCTGTCTCTTGAACAGCAGCTCCAGGAAGCGCGGCC-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the pSilencer 1.0-U6 siRNA vector (Ambion), resulting in a siE2F-1 expression vector, U6/E2F1siRNA. To test whether E2F-1siRNA affects cyclin A expression and RB phosphorylation, U6/E2F-1siRNA was introduced into MCF-7 cells by transfection as described above, resulting in MCF-7/E2F-1siRNA cells. Control cells were simultaneously transfected with the pSilencer 1.0-U6 siRNA control vector. Experiments were conducted during a period of 4–12 days after transfection. In control cells, no obvious disparity was found in the extent of inhibition of basal or IGF-I-induced E2F-1 protein expression. Expression of both E2F-1 and cyclin A, as well as phosphorylation of RB, was detected by Western blotting in MCF-7/E2F-1siRNA cells as well as control cells treated with IGF-I for 24 h. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System for Windows (29Statistical Analysis System. 8.2 Ed. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC2001Google Scholar). All data, including standardized densitometric intensities from replicate autoradiograms, were analyzed as a completely randomized design using standard analysis of variance procedures. Treatment differences were assessed by Duncan's multiple range tests. All experiments were independently replicated at least three times, and data were summarized as means ± S.E. Two-sided p values of p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. TNFα Blocks IGF-I-stimulated Cyclin A-dependent CDK Enzymatic Activity—Extracellular growth factors stimulate G1 phase progression (reviewed in Ref. 1Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar), which is often blocked by cytostatic cytokines (2Orlovsky K. Theodor L. Malovani H. Chowers Y. Nir U. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4997-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Vivo C. Levy F. Pilatte Y. Fleury-Feith J. Chretien P. Monnet I. Kheuang L. Jaurand M.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently (6Shen W.H. Zhou J.H. Broussard S.R. Freund G.G. Dantzer R. Kelley K.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4746-4756PubMed Google Scholar) that IGF-I (100 ng/ml) increases the population of total cycling MCF-7 cells (S+G2/M) by 50%. Treatment with TNFα (5 ng/ml) prevents their entry into the S phase, leading to 90% inhibition of cells progressing through the G1 restriction point. Most important, TNFα does not inhibit G1 progression in the absence of IGF-I. A-type cyclin is synthesized at the onset of S phase and therefore plays a critical role in initiation of DNA replication (13Yam C.H. Fung T.K. Poon R.Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TNFα may act by impairing the ability of IGF-I to induce accumulation of cyclin A, which in turn reduces the enzymatic activity of cyclin A-associated CDK. To test this hypothesis, we used a cyclin A-specific antibody to precipitate its associated CDKs, and we measured the ability of these complexes to phosphorylate their substrates in vitro. Cyclin A-associated CDK activity, as assessed by phosphorylation of either truncated RB peptide or histone H1 substrates, was strongly induced by IGF-I (p < 0.01, Fig. 1). Simultaneous treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNFα dose-dependently impaired cyclin A-dependent CDK activity, as shown by elimination of IGF-I-promoted phosphorylation of both truncated RB and histone H1 (Fig. 1). TNFα, by itself, did not affect cyclin A-dependent CDK activity in the absence of IGF-I. These results show that TNFα blocks IGF-I-induced cyclin A-specific activity that leads to phosphorylation of RB. TNFα Suppresses IGF-I-Stimulated Cdk2 Activity and Formation of CyclinA-Cdk2 Complexes—Because Cdk2 is a critical CDK that drives the G1-S transition (30Buolamwini J.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), TNFα may specifically block the activity of Cdk2, which is the G1 CDK that associates with cyclin A. To test this possibility, Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with TNFα, IGF-I, or their combination. Cdk2-specific enzymatic activity was measured with an in vitro CDK kinase assay. Cdk2 activity was significantly activated by IGF-I (p < 0.01), as shown by its ability to phosphorylate both RB and histone H1 substrates (Fig. 2A). Most important, TNFα dose-dependently inhibited, and at 1 ng/ml completely blocked, Cdk2 activity stimulated by IGF-I (p < 0.01). It is important to note that the inhibition caused by TNFα was detected only in the presence of IGF-I. These results establish that TNFα inhibits Cdk2-mediated RB phosphorylation induced by IGF-I. IGF-I is a late G1 progression factor (31Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), so we focused on the G1-S transition where the association of Cdk2 with cyclin A is critical for S phase entry. In order to investigate the physical association between cyclin A and Cdk2, mass of cyclin A was measured in Cdk2 immunoprecipitates derived from cells treated with IGF-I and TNFα. These co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IGF-I caused an 18-fold increase in the amount of cyclin A that associates with Cdk2 (Fig. 2B). This induction was not due to an increase in Cdk2 protein, as shown by equal amounts of Cdk2 in each immunoprecipitate. Co-treatment with TNFα dose-dependently decreased the amount of IGF-I-induced cyclin A that associated with Cdk2 (Fig. 2B). TNFα alone did not alter the association of Cdk2 with cyclin A, consistent with the findings of TNFα alone on Cdk2 activity (Fig. 2A). These results establish that TNFα impairs the ability of IGF-I to induce the formation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes. IGF-I Up-regulates Cyclin A Expression, Accompanied by aProgressive Elevation of E2F-1 and Hyperphosphorylation of RB—Cyclin A is synthesized at the onset of S phase (13Yam C.H. Fung T.K. Poon R.Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and cyclin A induction is mediated by the E2F-1 transcription factor (32Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although IGF-I is known to promote cyclin A accumulation (33Varma H. Conrad S.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3985-3991PubMed Google Scholar), it is unknown whether IGF-I can increase synthesis of E2F-1. To test this possibility, cells were exposed to IGF-I for different times within a single population doubling time (∼24 h (34Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Taylor I.W. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3998-4006PubMed Google Scholar)) following a G1 arrest by serum deprivation (Fig. 3). As expected, IGF-I time-dependently increased cyclin A accumulation, with a significant rise occurring 6 h after the MCF-7 breast cancer cells were released from the G1 arrest by IGF-I. Activated cyclin A-CDK complexes phosphorylate RB and maintain it in an inactive state. In accord with these concepts, IGF-I increased the ratio of hyperphosphorylated versus hypophosphorylated RB, an effect that was most prominent at 24 h (Fig. 3). RB acts as a transcriptional repressor by sequestering E2F-1 that is needed to activate genes whose products are necessary for passage of cells through the G1/S checkpoint. Although E2F-1 activity is considered to be regulated mainly through its temporal association with pocket family proteins like RB (14Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), the data in Fig. 3 show a direct induction of E2F-1 expression by IGF-I. At the same time that cyclin A expression was increased (6 h), there was a significant and progressive increase in expression of E2F-1 and hyperphosphorylation of RB (Fig. 3). These results establish that E2F-1 steady-state protein expression is induced by IGF-I in a time-dependent fashion. TNFα Dose-dependently Inhibits IGF-I-stimulated Hyperphosphorylation of RB and Up-"
https://openalex.org/W1986762912,"Making decisions between self-renewal and differentiation is a central ability of stem cells. Elucidation of molecular networks governing this decision is therefore of prime importance. A model of choice to explore this question is represented by chicken erythroid progenitors, in which self-renewal versus differentiation as well as progenitor maturation are regulated by external factor combinations. We used this system to study whether similar or different signalling pathways were involved in the self-renewal of early, immature or more mature erythroid progenitors. We show that a transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha-activated Ras/MEK-1/ERK1/2 pathway is strictly required for immature self-renewing cells but becomes fully dispensable when those cells are induced to differentiate. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of this pathway led to spontaneous differentiation, only dependent on the presence of survival signals. Conversely, ectopic expression of a constitutive form of MEK-1 stimulates renewal and arrests differentiation process. Finally, we demonstrate that the ERK/MAPK signalling pathway is required in early but not in late primary erythroid progenitors, which can be turned into each other by different growth factor combinations specifically driving their renewal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a central role of ERK/MAPK signalling in regulating progenitor plasticity in the same cell type under different environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2006749342,"During early pregnancy, the steroid hormone progesterone induces differentiation of uterine stroma to decidual cells, which regulate embryo-uterine interactions. The progesterone-induced signaling molecules that participate in the formation and function of decidua remain poorly understood. We recently utilized high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to identify several genes whose expression is markedly altered in pregnant uterus in response to RU486, a well characterized antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR). Our study revealed that the gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2β (CTLA-2β), a cysteine protease inhibitor, is expressed during PR-induced decidualization. The spatio-temporal expression of CTLA-2β mRNA precisely overlapped with the decidual phase of pregnancy. Interestingly, administration of progesterone to estrogen-primed ovariectomized mice failed to induce CTLA-2β expression. A concomitant artificial decidual stimulation was necessary to trigger this expression. Uteri of PR knockout mice failed to express this mRNA, even after a combined administration of steroid hormones and artificial stimulation. The uterine expression of CTLA-2β was, therefore, dependent on PR as well as other unknown factor(s) associated with decidual response. To identify the molecular target(s) of CTLA-2β,we analyzed its interaction with proteins present in soluble extracts prepared from day 7 pregnant uteri containing implanted embryos. A protein affinity strategy employing recombinant CTLA-2β helped us to determine that cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, is one of its targets in the pregnant uterus. Consistent with this finding, expression of cathepsin L was detected in the giant trophoblast cells of the ectoplacental cone on day 7 of pregnancy. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that expression of CTLA-2β in the decidua may regulate implantation of the embryo by neutralizing the activities of one or more proteases generated by the proliferating trophoblast.

Progesterone plays a crucial role during early pregnancy by coordinating a complex series of interactions between the implanting blastocyst and the receptive uterus (1Psychoyos A. Greep R.O.

The hormonal regimen necessary to prepare a non-receptive uterus to receive embryo and permit implantation involves 48 h of progesterone treatment followed by a dose of estrogen (1Psychoyos A.

Whereas the combined action of estrogen and progesterone is essential for acquisition of uterine receptivity, progesterone is the critical hormone for decidualization (1Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C.1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 10Finn C.A. Wynn R.M. Biology of the Uterus. Plenum Press, New York1977: 246-308Google Scholar). Decidualization involves differentiation of the fibroblast cells of endometrial stroma into morphologically distinct cells, termed decidual cells, which show unique secretory and biosynthetic properties (10Finn C.A. Wynn R.M. Biology of the Uterus. Plenum Press, New York1977: 246-308Google Scholar, 11DeFeo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967: 191-290Google Scholar). This differentiation, induced by progesterone following a brief priming by estrogen, is a prerequisite for successful implantation. Decidua is a transient tissue, which first develops at the time of blastocyst attachment on day 4 of pregnancy. During the next 3 days, the decidual cells proliferate and differentiate extensively, and eventually they undergo apoptosis. By the end of the invasive period (day 10.5), the decidua is regressed. A variety of functions have been attributed to the decidua (12Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 13Irwin J.C. Giudice D.

It facilitates nutrient transfer to the embryo and secretes hormones, growth factors, and cytokines that are critical for embryonic growth and development. Additionally, the two most widely accepted roles of decidua are regulation of trophoblast invasion and immunomodulation of fetal allograft during pregnancy (12Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J.

The progesterone-regulated factors that play critical roles during decidualization, leading to successful implantation and establishment of pregnancy, however, remain largely unknown. To understand how progesterone regulates implantation, it is essential to identify a broader spectrum of genes that are regulated by PR 1The abbreviations used are: PR, progesterone receptor; CTLA-2β, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2β; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DIG, digoxygenin. during this process.

RU486 counteracts PR-dependent pathways by binding to the receptor and impairing its gene regulatory function (16Baulieu E.E. Science. 1989; 245: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 17Baulieu E.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify the genes whose uterine expression is markedly altered at the time of implantation by RU486-complexed PR (18Cheon Y.P. Li Q. DeMayo F.J. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2853-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2β (CTLA-2β) that is induced downstream of PR in the pregnant uterus. Denizot et al. (19Denizot F. Brunet J.-F. Roustan P. Harper K. Suzan M. Luciani F. Golstein P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) first cloned CTLA-2β from a T lymphocyte-derived cDNA library and found it to be highly homologous to the proregion of cysteine proteases. Previous studies indicated that the proregion, purified from a given protease, can inhibit the activity of that protease in vitro (20Delaria K. Fiorentino L. Wallace L. Tamburini P. Brownell E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this paradigm, studies have shown that CTLA-2β is a competitive inhibitor of certain cysteine proteases including cathepsin B and L (20Delaria K. Fiorentino L. Wallace L. Tamburini P. Brownell E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that CTLA-2β is induced in the steroid-primed uterus in response to a decidual signal. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that the expression of CTLA-2β in the pregnant uterus is localized in the uterine stroma near the vicinity of the embryo and overlapped with the decidual phase. Interestingly, our studies further revealed that cathepsin L, which is expressed in giant trophoblast cells, is one of the targets of CTLA-2β. Based on these studies, we postulate that expression of CTLA-2β in uterine stroma during PR-mediated decidualization plays a critical role in the regulation of embryo implantation. Reagents—Progesterone and 17β-estradiol were purchased from Sigma. RU 38486 (Mifepristone) was a gift of Population Council, New York, NY. Antibody against cathepsin L was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Animals and Tissue Collection—All experiments involving animals were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and the studies were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health standards for the use and care of animals. Female mice (CD-1 from Charles River, Wilmington, MA), in proestrus, were mated with adult males. The presence of a vaginal plug after mating was designated as day 1 of pregnancy. The animals were killed at various stages of gestation and the uteri were collected. The PRKO mice were bred and homozygotes were confirmed by genotyping as described previously (18Cheon Y.P. Li Q. DeMayo F.J. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2853-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Artificial Decidualization—Decidualization was induced artificially as described previously (21Lydon J.P. DeMayo F.J. Funk C.R. Mani S.K. Hughes A.R. Montgomery C.A. Shyamala G. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Mice were first ovariectomized. Two weeks following ovariectomy, animals were injected with 100 ng of estrogen in 0.1 ml of sesame oil for three consecutive days. This was followed by daily injections of 1 mg of progesterone for three consecutive days. Then one horn of the uterus was traumatically stimulated by insertion of a burred needle and longitudinal scratching of the entire length of the uterine horn. The other horn was left unstimulated. The animals were treated with progesterone for an additional 6 days post-stimulation and then sacrificed. The uteri were collected, the two horns were separated, and RNA was isolated from each horn. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern analysis, 20–30 μg of total RNA or 5 μg of poly(A)RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Duralon membrane (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 4 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml of a 32P-labeled CTLA-2β cDNA fragment. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then twice for 20 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and then exposed to x-ray films. The intensities of signals on the autoradiogram were estimated by densitometric scanning. To correct for RNA loading, the obtained signals were normalized with respect to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal in the same blot. For this the filters were stripped of the radioactive probe by washing for 10 min in 0.5% SDS at 95 °C. The blots were then re-probed with a 32P-labeled GAPDH probe as described above. In Situ Hybridization—Uterine tissues from pregnant animals were collected and frozen. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cryostat sections were cut at 8 μm and attached to 3-aminopropyltriethylsilane- (Sigma) coated slides. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes complimentary to CTLA-2β gene. DIG-labeled RNA probes were synthesized from CTLA-2β cDNA using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and DIG-labeled nucleotides according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization was carried out in a damp chamber at 37 °C for 60 min in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% N-laurylsar-cosine). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in a damp humidified chamber. To develop the substrate, sections were sequentially washed in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.1× SSC for 15 min in each buffer at 37 °C. Sections were then incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Excess antibody was washed away and the color substrate (nitro blue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate) was added. Slides were allowed to develop in the dark and the color was visualized under light microscopy until maximum levels of staining were achieved. The reaction was stopped and the slides were counterstained in Nuclear Fast Red for 5 min. The slides were washed in water, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Control incubations utilized a DIG-labeled RNA sense strand and were performed under identical conditions. Immunohistochemistry—Polyclonal antibody against cathepsin L (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was diluted 1:1000 for immunohistochemistry. Frozen uteri were sectioned at 7 μm, mounted on slides, and then fixed in 5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and then incubated in a blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum for 10 min before incubation in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunostaining was performed using a streptavidin-biotin kit for rabbit primary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Red deposits indicate the sites of immunostaining. Baculovirus Expression and Purification of CTLA-2β —To express recombinant CTLA-2β in baculovirus, the leader sequence was removed and the serine residue at position 31 was changed to methionine. A fragment of CTLA-2β with NcoI and BamHI sites was generated by PCR and ligated into the NcoI and BglII sites of a pAcSG2 vector (BD Pharmingen). At the N-terminal end of CTLA-2β, double stranded 3× FLAG oligo was inserted. The transfection of this vector into a baculovirus/insect cell system was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol (BaculoGold™ Transfection kit, BD Pharmingen). Sf9 insect cells were grown in Grace’s insect medium/TNM-FH (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). The N-terminal FLAG-tagged recombinant CTLA-2β was expressed in Sf9 cells. Cells were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 to 1 at 27 °C. Cells were harvested at 96 h post-infection. After harvesting, the baculovirus cell culture supernatant was supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (BD Pharmingen). The supernatant was then incubated with resin linked to a monoclonal antibody against FLAG (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The resin was washed three times with 20 bed volumes of TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The proteins bound to the resin were eluted at 4 °C with a buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS. After elution, specific protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting using a FLAG antibody. The analysis of purified CTLA-2β was performed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Antiprogestin RU486 Down-regulates CTLA-2β Expression in the Pregnant Uterus—The pivotal role of progesterone during early pregnancy is likely to be mediated by a network of PR-induced genes (22Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of pregnant rat or mouse during the pre-implantation phase with RU486, which impairs transcriptional function of PR, blocked implantation (23Philibert D. Moguilewsky M. Mary I. Lecaque D. Tournemine C. Secchi J. Deraedt R. Baulieu E.E. Segal S.J. The Antiprogestin Steroid RU486 and Human Fertility Control. Plenum Press, New York1985: 49-68Google Scholar). To identify the downstream targets of PR during pregnancy, we have recently examined the global changes in uterine mRNA expression profiles in response to RU486 (18Cheon Y.P. Li Q. DeMayo F.J. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2853-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice on day 3 of pregnancy were treated with either vehicle (sesame oil) or RU486 and uterine tissues were collected on day 4, the day of implantation. The uterine transcripts were then hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays (murine GeneChip Expression arrays, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing ∼12,000 gene probes. We applied a threshold of a 3-fold change in expression level between RU486-treated samples and untreated controls for identifying putative progesterone-regulated mRNAs. Applying this stringent cut off, we identified a total of 67 mRNAs whose expression was down-regulated in the uterus at the time of implantation in response to RU486 (18Cheon Y.P. Li Q. DeMayo F.J. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2853-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We identified one of these genes as that encoding CTLA-2β, a cysteine protease inhibitor. To verify the results of microarray analysis, we performed Northern blotting using total RNA obtained from uteri of day 4 pregnant mice treated with or without RU486 (Fig. 1). When the blot was probed with 32P-labeled CTLA-2β cDNA, a signal appeared in the RNA sample obtained from untreated mice on day 4 of pregnancy (lane 1). No mRNA signal was observed in the uterine sample obtained from RU486-treated mice (lane 2). Hybridization of the same blot with a control probe (GAPDH) indicated equal loading of mRNAs in these lanes. These results, therefore, confirmed the down-regulation of the level of CTLA-2β mRNA as predicted by the microarray analysis. Profile of CTLA-2β Expression in Uterus during Early Pregnancy—We next investigated the pattern of CTLA-2β gene expression in the mouse uterus at various stages of gestation. We performed Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from uteri of mice at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 of pregnancy (Fig. 2). Whole uteri devoid of embryos were used for this experiment. The uteri were freed of embryonic tissue either by repeated flushings (days 1–5) or by individually removing the embryos from the implantation sites (days 6–10). The blot was hybridized with a 32P-labeled CTLA-2β probe and also a control GAPDH probe. As depicted in Fig. 2A, no signal corresponding to CTLA-2β mRNA was observed in the pregnant animals on days 1–3 of gestation (lanes 1–3). A significant expression of this mRNA was detected on day 4 of pregnancy (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The level of CTLA-2β mRNAs increased further on days 5–8 and then declined abruptly to an undetectable level by day 10 of pregnancy (Fig. 2A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 10). The relative level of expression of CTLA-2β was estimated by densitometric scanning, followed by normalization with respect to the control GAPDH mRNA signal. The level of CTLA-2β mRNA on day 4 was about 15-fold higher than that on day 3 of gestation (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that CTLA-2β expression in the pregnant uterus is restricted between days 4 and 10 of gestation, an interval that precisely overlaps with the decidual phase. We then localized the expression of CTLA-2β by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). Consistent with the temporal expression pattern described above, the CTLA-2β mRNAs were undetectable between days 1 and 3 of pregnancy (panels A–C). The expression of CTLA-2β was observed on day 5 of pregnancy and this expression was localized exclusively in the stroma surrounding the implanted embryo (panel D). The level of this protease inhibitor in the stromal compartment increased further on days 6 (panel E)and8(panel F) and declined sharply on day 9 (panel G) with the cessation of the decidual phase of pregnancy. We also compared the expression of CTLA-2β in the uterine sections of day 5 pregnant animals at implantation and inter implantation sites. Whereas CTLA-2β-specific expression was observed in the uterine sections of day 5 pregnant animals at the implantation sites near the embryo, no CTLA-2β signal was detected at the inter implantation sites (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that CTLA-2β is induced in the stromal compartment exclusively at the sites of implantation. The secretion of CTLA-2β from the decidua in the immediate vicinity of the embryo raised the possibility that this factor regulates embryo-uterine interactions during early pregnancy. Regulation of CTLA-2β Expression: Role of PR-mediated Decidual Signal—The down-regulation of CTLA-2β expression in the pregnant uteri in response to RU486 (Fig. 1) indicated that progesterone acting through PR plays a role in this gene expression. Interestingly, we found that administration of progesterone alone to estrogen-primed ovariectomized mice failed to induce CTLA-2β mRNA in the uterus (data not shown). Since CTLA-2β was expressed in the decidua surrounding the embryo, we investigated whether a progesterone-mediated decidual stimulus is required for CTLA-2β expression. To induce decidualization, mice (n = 4) were ovariectomized. Two weeks following ovariectomy, mice were administered a hormonal regimen of estrogen and progesterone as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following hormone administration, decidualization was initiated in the right horn by scratching it with a needle while the left horn was undisturbed. As expected, the stimulated horn exhibited marked decidual response while the unstimulated horn was devoid of any decidual response. The uteri from animals (n = 2) were collected, stimulated or unstimulated horns were separated, and RNA was isolated from these horns for Northern blot analysis using CTLA-2β cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, no signal corresponding to CTLA-2β was observed in the RNA sample obtained from the unstimulated, nondecidualized uterine horn (lane 1). In contrast, a signal of marked intensity was detected in the horn that was decidualized in response to the artificial stimulation (lane 2). To further analyze the role of PR in CTLA-2β expression in the uterus, we monitored the expression of this gene in the uteri of PR null (n = 2) and wild-type mice (n = 2) of the same genetic background. As shown in Fig. 4, panel B, when these animals were subjected to decidualization using the procedure described above, we failed to observe any signal corresponding to CTLA-2β mRNA in the PR null mice (lane 2). The uterine RNA from wild-type mice, as expected, exhibited the CTLA-2β mRNA signal (Fig. 4, panel B, lane 1). Collectively, these results demonstrated that a PR-induced decidual signal is essential for expression of CTLA-2β in the uterus. Cathepsin L Is a Target of CTLA-2β in the Pregnant Uterus— Previous studies indicated that CTLA-2β is a cysteine protease inhibitor (19Denizot F. Brunet J.-F. Roustan P. Harper K. Suzan M. Luciani F. Golstein P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Delaria K. Fiorentino L. Wallace L. Tamburini P. Brownell E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A part of the CTLA-2β molecule is highly homologous to the proregions of cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B and L. Consistent with this observation, CTLA-2β binds and inhibits the activity of these proteases in vitro (20Delaria K. Fiorentino L. Wallace L. Tamburini P. Brownell E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, conceivable that this protease inhibitor might play a role in inhibiting the activity of one or more cysteine proteases secreted by the trophoblast in the decidual uterus. To determine whether CTLA-2β targets one or more cysteine in the pregnant uterus, we analyzed its interaction with proteins present in soluble extracts prepared from uteri obtained from mice at days 2 and 7 of pregnancy. The extracts prepared from day 2 pregnant uteri, which did not express CTLA-2β, were unlikely to contain target(s) of this protein and acted as negative control. In contrast, the extracts from day 7 pregnant uteri, which expressed abundant CTLA-2β mRNA, were likely to contain the target(s) of this protein. To determine whether the target of CTLA-2β in the decidual tissue is of embryonic or maternal origin, we prepared extracts from two kinds of day 7 pregnant uteri: one containing implanted embryos (D7+E) and the other devoid of them (D7-E). A protein affinity strategy employing a recombinant CTLA-2β was used to analyze these uterine extracts. For this purpose, we expressed and purified FLAG epitope-tagged CTLA-2β in baculovirus-infected insect cells (Fig. 5, panel A). The FLAG-CTLA-2β fusion protein was then used to pull down interacting proteins from the day 2 and 7 uterine extracts. The resulting CTLA-2β-associated proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and probed by immunoblotting using a panel of antibodies against known cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B, D, and L. We noted that CTLA-2β did not exhibit any interaction with cathepsin B or D in any of the uterine extracts tested (Fig. 5, panel B). We also failed to detect any interaction of this protease inhibitor with cathepsin L in the extracts of day 2 pregnant uteri or the day 7 pregnant uteri devoid of embryo (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). A cathepsin L-specific signal was, however, clearly visible in the proteins that associated with CTLA-2β in the day 7 uterine extracts containing the embryonic tissue (Fig. 5, panel B, lane 5). Our results, therefore, indicated that cathepsin L is indeed one of the targets of CTLA-2β in the pregnant uterus. Our results also indicated that embryo is the most likely source of cathepsin L. We also examined the localization of cathepsin L in day 7 pregnant uterus by immunohistochemistry. We observed that cathepsin L was expressed in the day 7 pregnant uteri and its expression was specifically localized to the invasive giant trophoblast cells of the ectoplacental cone (Fig. 5, panel C). Collectively, these results supported our hypothesis that decidual stage-specific expression of CTLA-2β in the pregnant uterus may serve to control embryo implantation by neutralizing the activities of cysteine proteases, such as, cathepsin L, generated by the proliferating trophoblast. In rodents, the progesterone-primed endometrial stroma undergoes extensive remodeling in response to blastocyst implantation, generating a tissue known as the decidua (11DeFeo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967: 191-290Google Scholar, 12Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 13Irwin J.C. Giudice D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Encyclopedia of Reproduction.

The decidua encapsulates the blastocyst and provides an environment within which the trophoblast cells invade, proliferate, and differentiate. The progressive interactions of these two tissues results in the establishment of a highly ordered structure that protects and supports the growth and development of the fetus (11DeFeo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967: 191-290Google Scholar, 12Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 13Irwin J.C. Giudice D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Encyclopedia of Reproduction.

The progesterone-induced signaling molecules that participate in the formation of the decidual tissue and promote its function remain poorly understood. We identified by DNA microarray analysis a cysteine protease inhibitor, CTLA-2β, which is induced in the uteri of pregnant mice precisely during the decidual phase. The CTLA-2β mRNAs were induced in the mouse endometrium on day 4.5 of pregnancy immediately following embryo attachment to the uterine epithelium, attained a peak during days 5–8, and then declined to undetectable levels after day 10 with the completion of the decidual phase. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that CTLA-2β mRNA expression occurred in an area immediately surrounding the embryo. It is known that with the onset of implantation, a variety of immune cells, including lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells, and macrophages, converge in the decidua near the implanted embryo (15Croy B.A. Chantakru S. Esadeg S. Ashkar A.A. Wei Q. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 57: 151-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At present, we cannot ascertain the nature of cells in the decidua that synthesize CTLA-2β. Nonetheless, the observation that CTLA-2β is secreted in the immediate vicinity of embryo is particularly interesting, and consistent with the proposed role of this factor in regulating embryo-uterine interactions during early pregnancy. Implantation of the embryo occurs in progressive phases. A role of protease inhibitors in regulating embryo-uterine interactions is consistent with the observation that the final stage of implantation involves invasion of the epithelium by the trophectoderm. Trophoblast invasion requires endometrial extracellular matrix proteolysis, as well as cellular migration through the maternal decidua. These processes are precisely regulated and require a balanced interplay between the factors that promote and restrain trophoblast invasion. Progesterone–regulated serine protease inhibitors, which are secreted by endometrial glands during pregnancy, have been known for years. Roberts and co-workers (24Mullins D.E. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 865-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Fazleabas A.T. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6886-6897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a 14-kDa uterine plasmin-trypsin inhibitor from uterine secretions of pigs during pregnancy (24Mullins D.E. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 865-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Fazleabas A.T. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6886-6897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression was strongly under the influence of progesterone, and restricted to surface and glandular epithelia. The inhibitor has a well defined Kunitz domain of 64 residues, which shares 67% sequence identity with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (26Stallings-Mann M.L. Burke M.G. Trout W.E. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24090-24094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports are consistent with the hypothesis that the progesterone-regulated protease inhibitors function by neutralizing the activities of one or more proteases generated by the proliferating trophoblast (27Roberts R.M. Mathialagan N. Duffy J.Y. Stallings-Mann M.L. Trout W.E. Dey S.K. Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Periimplantation Processes, Serono Symposia. Springer, U. S. A., New York1995: 253-267Google Scholar). In rodents, existing evidence also indicates that factors that promote invasion are primarily trophoblast-derived (28Bevilacqua E.M. Abrahamsohn P.A. Arch. Biol. Med. Exp. (Santiago). 1989; 22: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 29Strickland S. Richards W.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 355-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, mouse trophoblast has been shown to synthesize and secrete serine proteases (plasminogen activator), metalloproteases (gelatinase and stromelysin), and the cysteine proteases (cathepsin L) (30Teesalu T. Blasi F. Talarico D. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Zhang X. Shu M.A. Harvey M.B. Schultz G.A. Biol.

Development. 1996; 122: 1723-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decidual tissue is thought to participate in the control of invasion by secreting the inhibitors of these proteases. Our studies suggest that cathepsin L, secreted by the giant trophoblasts, is one of the targets of CTLA-2β in the pregnant uterus (Fig. 5). Based on these results, we propose that CTLA-2β secreted during the decidual phase regulates trophoblast invasion by neutralizing the activity of trophoblast-derived cathepsin L. An important role of cathepsin L during implantation is suggested by the studies of Babiarz and co-workers (35Afonso S. Romagnano L. Babiarz B. Development. 1997; 124: 3415-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They observed that injection of E-64, a synthetic inhibitor of cathepsin L, to pregnant mice affected implantation in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas treatment of mice with a high dose of E-64 resulted in a complete failure of implantation, administration of a low dose of this compound led to stunted embryos and a reduced decidual response. These studies support the view that an optimal action of cathepsin L within the decidua is critical for the decidualization and implantation processes. CTLA-2β was initially isolated in the process of identification of gene products important for the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (19Denizot F. Brunet J.-F. Roustan P. Harper K. Suzan M. Luciani F. Golstein P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Brunet J.F. Denizot F. Golstein P. Immunol. Rev. 1988; 103: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, conceivable that uterine CTLA-2β may also play a role in the regulation of T cell action during early pregnancy. At the time of embryo implantation, the maternal response to the invading semi-allograft embryo has the characteristics of an acute inflammation (37King-Moffett A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 38Thellin O. Heinen E. Toxicology. 2003; 185: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, once implanted, the embryo suppresses this response and prevents rejection. Simultaneously, the immune system of the mother prevents a graft versus host reaction that might derive from the fetal immune system (37King-Moffett A. Nat. Rev.

Consistent with this notion, recent studies have shown that agents, which facilitate killing of activated T cells, promote implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy (39Makrigiannakis A. Zoumakis E. Kalantaridou S. Coutifaris C. Margioris A.N. Coukos G. Rice K.C. Gravanis A. Chrousos G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 40Mellor A.L.

It is likely that maternal immune response to the invading embryo is kept in check via regulation of T cell repertoire. Interestingly, a number of recent studies indicated that cathepsin L plays an important role in T cell selection (41Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A.

Med. 2002; 195: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A critical step in major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted antigen presentation is degradation of the invariant chain (Ii). Cathepsin L was found to be necessary for Ii degradation, and consequently, cathepsin L null mice exhibited a reduced number of CD4+ T cells (∼60–80% reduction) in the thymus and periphery (41Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H. Peters C. Rudensky A.Y. Science. 1998; 280: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42Honey K. Nakagawa T. Peters C. Rudensky A.Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, a CD4+ T cell-deficient mouse was found to harbor a deletion mutation of the cathepsin L gene (43Benavides F. Venables A. Kug Poetschke H. Glasscock E. Rudensky A. Gomez M. Palenzuela Martin N. Guenet J.L. Richie E.R. Conti C.J. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our findings in this article raise the possibility that CTLA-2β synthesized in the decidua surrounding the implanting embryo may inhibit the activity of cathepsin L produced by the embryo, leading to deregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II processing. This in turn, may lead to a reduction in the number of certain subtypes of T cells, thus facilitating the modulation of maternal immune response to the invading embryo. Future studies will determine whether the principal function of CTLA-2β in the pregnant uterus is to interact with cathepsin L to control trophoblast invasion and/or modulate T cell function to control maternal immune response at the time of implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2048485421,"We have previously shown that the activity of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of NF-κB and cell survival ((2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28010–28018). Herein we demonstrate that NGF induces co-association of IRAK with atypical protein kinase C iota (PKC) and that the iota PKC·IRAK complex is recruited to the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Recruitment of IRAK to the receptor was dependent upon the activity of the iota PKC. Moreover, transfection of kinase-dead iota PKC blocked both NGF- and IL-1-induced IRAK activation and the activity of NF-κB. Hence, iota PKC lies upstream of IRAK in the κB pathway. Examining the primary structure of IRAK, we identified three putative PKC phosphorylation sites; iota PKC selectively phosphorylated peptide 1 (RTAS) within the death domain domain at Thr66, which is highly conserved among all IRAK family members. Mutation of Thr66 to Ala impaired the autokinase activity of IRAK and reduced its association with iota PKC but not TRAF6, resulting in impaired NGF- as well as IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanism whereby IRAK regulates the κB pathway and reveal that IRAK is a substrate of iota PKC. We have previously shown that the activity of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of NF-κB and cell survival ((2002) J.

Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In neurons, the functional outcome of this pathway is trans-activation of numerous genes that play a role in central nervous system survival. The molecular events at the p75 receptor complex leading to induction of NF-κB have been characterized recently. The adapter protein MyD88 recruits IRAK to the p75 receptor complex where IRAK subsequently interacts with TRAF6 and p62 scaffold, which bridges them to IKKβ (NF-κB kinase kinase). However, the mechanism whereby IRAK is activated in the κB pathway has not yet been fully elucidated. The identification of a kinase responsible for the signal-induced phosphorylation of IRAK has been the subject of intense study (2Martin M. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this regard, mutation of the its catalytic domain reveals that IRAK is still phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation (3Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that IRAK is likely to be the substrate of another kinase lying upstream proximal to the receptor. However, in the IL-1 pathway, the catalytic activity of IRAK is not required for mediating for activation of the κB pathway (4Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, in both the p75 NTR and TNF pathways, IRAK catalytic activity is required for mediation of the κB response (5Vig E. Green M. Liu Y. Donner D.B. Mukaida N. Goebel M. Harrington M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13077-13084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hence, in some systems, upstream phosphorylation by another kinase may regulate not only the catalytic activity of IRAK but also the enzyme's ability to interact with effectors of the κB pathway; thus phosphorylation of IRAK may serve as a bifurcation point in the κB pathway. interleukin 1 interleukin receptor-associated kinase atypical protein kinase C nerve growth factor tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor 6 myeloid differentiation factor 88 dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid relative light unit neurotrophin receptor myelin basic protein glutathione S-transferase death domain domain of unknown function C-terminal domains 1 and 2. NGF, IL-1, and TNF are potent activators of the atypical PKCs. Moreover, the highly homologous atypical PKC (aPKC) isoforms zeta and lambda/iota have been shown to play a critical role during κB activation (6Dominguez I. Sanz L. Seisdedos A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Virelizier J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Zhou G. Vandenplas M.L. Tan T.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NGF binding to the p75 NTR receptor results in production of second messenger metabolites such as ceramide (8Dobrowsky R.T. Werner W.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), which may lead to activation of iota aPKC (9Muller G. Ayoub M. Stroz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMJO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, the p75 NTR receptor employs p62, the atypical protein kinase C-interacting protein, as a selective scaffold for activation of NF-κB (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that iota PKC may be recruited into the p75 receptor complex to serve as an IRAK. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel pathway revealing that iota PKC phosphorylates IRAK within the death domain (DD) at the conserved residue Thr66. Mutation of this site impairs IRAK autophosphorylation, interaction with iota PKC, and NF-κB activation. Altogether these findings reveal that IRAK is a substrate of iota PKC and that the Thr66 phosphorylation site serves to enhance interaction between kinase and substrate. Cell Culture and Transfection—IRAK-deficient I1A cells were obtained as a gift from Dr. Xiaoxia Li, Lerner Research Institute (10Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent IRAK-deficient I1A cells were transfected with His/Myc mPLK/IRAK (gift of Dr. Maureen Harrington) and/or GST-aPKC active/inactive (gift of Dr. Jorge Moscat, Madrid, Spain) employing the Mammalian Cell Transfection Kit (Cell & Molecular Technologies, Inc.). All transfected cDNAs were normalized by using empty vector, pcDNA. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. They were transfected employing LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Purified IRAK enzyme was provided by Tularik, Inc., San Francisco. Polyclonal antibody to p75 NTR was a gift of Dr. Alonzo Ross (University of Massachusetts) or were purchased from Promega. Site Mutagenesis—The cDNA of His/Myc-mPLK/IRAK or His/Myc-cimPLK, a mutant of IRAK that has no autophosphorylation activity, was site-mutated Thr66 to Ala using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene by GeneMed Synthesis (San Francisco). Two complimentary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation and flanked by unmodified nucleotide sequences were synthesized (5′-CGCTCCGGGCAGCGCGCGGCCAGCGTC-3′ and 5′-GACGCTGGCCGCGCGCTGCCCGGAGCG-3′). Following transformation, individual colonies were screened for the β-galactosidase (β-gal+, blue), phenotype and the Thr66 to Ala mutation was verified by sequencing. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To immunoprecipitate p75 (Promega) or His/Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)-tagged IRAK, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with PD buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 μmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 300 μm NaOV3, 1 mm DTT, 2 μm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). 750 μg of cell extract was incubated for 3 h with either 3 μg of anti-p75 or anti-Myc antibody to capture the tagged IRAK construct followed by a 2-h incubation with 30 μl of anti-rabbit IgG agarose. The samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, Western blotted with antibody to iota PKC, IRAK, anti-GST, or anti-His followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed employing ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal antibody to IRAK was obtained from BD Biosciences. The immunogen for this antibody is the catalytic domain of IRAK. Peptide Kinase Assay—To examine phosphorylation of IRAK peptides (synthesized by the Macromolecular Structure Facility, University of Kentucky) by aPKC, an in vitro kinase assay was employed (11Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 1 μg of synthesized IRAK peptide control or mutant in 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 15 μl, 2.5 mm EGTA 17.5 μl, 100 mm MgCl2 10 μl, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine 2 μl, ± purified aPKC, 100 ng (Calbiochem), and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 280 mm H3PO4 and spotted onto P81 paper followed by washing in 75 mm H3PO4 three times. Radioactivity was counted using Cerenkov. Phosphorylation of IRAK Enzyme—Purified IRAK protein (50 ng) and purified iota PKC (Calbiochem) (0, 100, 200, 300 ng) were incubated in 20 ml of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 2 min followed by 10% SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. The program QuantiScan was used to scan the blots. Endogenous Kinase Assay—To examine IRAK autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation ability by coexpressed aPKC, an endogenous kinase assay was employed. Transfected HEK cells were lysed in PD buffer, and IRAK was captured by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates (750 μg) with Myc antibody. The beads were washed three times in PD buffer followed by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2,20 mm β–glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm NaOV3 and 0.4 mm PMSF) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. 20 μl of sample buffer was added to the samples to stop the reaction, and the reaction was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed to x-ray film. Aliquots of the whole cell lysates were blotted with anti-GST and anti-Myc to validate expression of iota PKC and IRAK. Monoclonal antibody to iota PKC or IRAK was obtained from BD Biosciences and polyclonal IRAK antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—To detect the activity of IRAK enzyme, anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (capturing expressed His/Myc-tagged IRAK) was incubated with 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2,20mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 20 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF) with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of MBP for 10 min at 37 °C (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Phosphorylated MBP was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Changes in IRAK activity were monitored as a function of the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate MBP as determined by phosphorimaging analysis. Measurement of NF-κB Activity—NF-κB activation was measured by reporter gene assay (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). IRAK– I1A HEK or PC12 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with the same amount of κB luciferase reporter gene plasmid, pGL-3, and Renilla luciferase (used as internal control for transfection efficiency). Individual constructs were transfected in duplicate, and each assay was measured in triplicate with the Promega dual luciferase assay. Values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of four individual experiments. NGF Induces Association of IRAK with Iota PKC in a p75 Receptor Complex—In previous experiments we observed that IRAK migrated as a doublet on Western blots coincident with its activation and increase in enzyme activity (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the IRAK antibody may detect the phosphorylated/activated form of the enzyme. To test this possibility, cell lysates were incubated with phosphatase 2A for various times followed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody to IRAK (Fig. 1A). Inclusion of phosphatase 2A abolished immunoreactivity to IRAK, thus revealing that this antibody detects the phosphorylated/activated form of the enzyme. Because we previously observed that IRAK interacts with iota PKC-interacting protein/p62 upon stimulation with NGF (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we next asked whether IRAK could also directly interact with iota PKC (Fig. 1B). Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF followed by immunoprecipitation of iota PKC confirmed that NGF stimulated a rapid but transient co-association of iota PKC with IRAK. Moreover, both IRAK and iota PKC were recruited to the p75 receptor in a coincident time frame (Fig. 1B). Likewise, IRAK immunoprecipitates contained both p75 and iota PKC. The interaction of both IRAK and iota PKC with p75 occurred prior to the interaction of iota PKC and IRAK, thus suggesting that the iota-IRAK interaction took place once recruited to the receptor. As control the lysates were blotted with each antibody and revealed equal amounts of protein (Fig. 1C). In addition, at a time when iota PKC was recruited to the p75 receptor (2 min), an immune complex kinase assay using hnRNPA1 as a defined iota PKC substrate revealed that the enzyme was active (data not shown). Recruitment of Phosphorylated IRAK to the p75 Receptor Requires Iota PKC Activity—Within minutes after PC12 cells are exposed to NGF, IRAK is recruited to the p75 receptor where it becomes highly phosphorylated and activated (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because our results reveal that iota PKC associates with IRAK, we analyzed whether the activity of iota PKC modulated recruitment of IRAK to the p75 receptor by transfecting a kinase-dead mutant of iota PKC followed by immunoprecipitation of p75 and Western blotting for IRAK (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, transfection of kinase-dead iota PKC diminished recruitment of IRAK to the p75 receptor complex and also blocked immunoreactivity of IRAK toward the monoclonal IRAK antibody, suggesting that the phosphorylation/activity of IRAK may be regulated by iota PKC. To examine this possibility, IRAK was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was measured in an immune complex kinase assay with MBP as substrate (Fig. 2B). Co-transfection of constitutively active iota PKC enhanced the basal as well as NGF-stimulated activity of IRAK. By comparison, the kinase-inactive form of iota PKC blocked NGF-stimulated activity of the enzyme along with diminished recruitment of IRAK to the p75 receptor complex. However, phosphorylation of MBP did not return to basal levels with transfection of inactive iota PKC. We believe that this effect is due to the co-association of kinases such as Src with iota PKC, which are also capable of phosphorylating MBP and thus contribute to the higher background. To test the effect of iota PKC on the ability of IRAK to activate the κB pathway, HEK293 cells were transfected with either catalytically active iota PKC or a kinase-dead iota PKC construct in the presence or absence of IRAK (Fig. 2C). Whereas overexpression of catalytically active iota PKC enhanced IRAK-induced κB, the kinase-dead form of iota PKC abrogated IRAK-induced NF-κB activation. We also tested the effects of iota PKC in two systems in which receptor interaction results in activation of NF-κB, e.g. NGF and IL-1 (Fig. 2D). In both systems, transfection of kinaseactive iota PKC enhanced NF-κB activity, whereas transfection of kinase inactive iota PKC abrogated ligand-induced NF-κB activation. Collectively they reveal that iota PKC lies upstream of IRAK in the κB signaling pathway, strongly suggesting that iota PKC may participate directly in the activation of IRAK. Threonine 66 in the IRAK Death Domain Is Phosphorylated by Iota PKC—IRAK is a multidomain protein (2Martin M. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal DD (residues 1–103) followed by a domain of unknown function (UD) (residues 104–198), a kinase domain (KD) (residues 199–522), and a two-part C-terminal domain, also of unknown function (residues 523–618 for C1 and residues 619–712 for C2) (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the IRAK sequence revealed the presence of three putative PKC phosphorylation sites (RxxG) in the DD, UD, and C1/C2 domains of IRAK. As a first step in determining whether iota PKC might phosphorylate IRAK, an in vitro kinase assay employing purified kinases was undertaken (Fig. 3B). Increasing concentration of aPKC directly stimulated the phosphorylation of IRAK. As a separate means to assess site-specific phosphorylation of IRAK by iota PKC, three peptides (RTAS, RPSS, RAHS) corresponding to the putative phosphorylation sites (RXXG) within IRAK were synthesized and employed in an in vitro kinase assay as substrate with purified iota PKC enzyme (Fig. 3C). Iota PKC preferentially phosphorylated peptide 1 from the DD (Fig. 3C), which possesses a unique threonine within the putative consensus phosphorylation site (RXXS). Because neither peptide 2 nor 3 was phosphorylated by iota PKC, we deduced that Thr66 within peptide 1 may be the amino acid targeted by iota PKC. To examine whether this was the case, a similar peptide was synthesized, except Thr66 was replaced by Ala, and the ability of iota PKC to phosphorylate the wild type and mutant peptide was assessed (Fig. 3D). Mutation of Thr66 to Ala abolished the iota PKC ability to phosphorylate the IRAK peptide, thus revealing that Thr66 serves as a phospho-acceptor site for iota PKC. As a separate means of confirming iota PKC phosphorylation of IRAK in vivo, we employed a catalytically inactive mutant of IRAK (cim PLK), where Thr66 was converted to Ala (Fig. 3E). If iota PKC were responsible for phosphorylation of IRAK at Thr66, we reasoned that we would be able to more clearly discriminate phosphorylation of IRAK over its autophosphorylation activity by employing the catalytically active mutant. Under these conditions, iota PKC was able to phosphorylate the kinase-dead mutant of IRAK, and mutation of Thr66 to Ala abolished iota PKC induced phosphorylation of IRAK (Fig. 3E). Threonine 66 Regulates IRAK Functional Properties and NF-κB Activation—Comparative sequence analysis of IRAK family members revealed that Thr66 is highly conserved among IRAK family members: IRAK, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and IRAK-4 (Fig. 4A). Site-directed mutagenesis of IRAK changing Thr66 to Ala was undertaken to assess the consequences of iota PKC on IRAK phosphorylation and ability to couple with downstream effectors (Fig. 4B). Transfection of IRAK– HEK cells with His/Myc-tagged IRAK or His/Myc-tagged mutant IRAK (Thr66 to Ala), along with iota PKC-active/inactive and/or TRAF6 was undertaken. The autokinase activity exhibited by wild type IRAK was completely abolished upon mutating Thr66 to Ala. The basal autokinase activity of wild type IRAK was significantly reduced upon inclusion of inactive iota PKC. Mutation of Thr66 not only blocked the auto-kinase activity of IRAK but also diminished its ability to associate with iota PKC without any effect on the interaction with TRAF6. Thus, Thr66 appears not only to serve as a phosphorylation site but also serves a novel role in anchoring enzyme and substrate (iota PKC-IRAK). In this regard, IRAK can be considered to belong to a family of proteins known as STICKs (substrates that interact with C-kinase) (13Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that PKC is able to interact with, phosphorylate, and modify the function of specific substrates; thus IRAK appears to be a novel STICK. The effects of the IRAK Thr66 mutation were also evaluated in a physiological setting. Because IRAK plays a critical role in p75 NTR activation of NF-κB, we next evaluated the effect that the Thr66 mutant had upon NGF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4C). PC12 cells were transfected with vector or mutant IRAK followed by treatment with NGF and the measurement of NF-κB employing dual luciferase reporter assay. We previously reported that constitutively active IRAK increases NGF-induced NF-κB and that the catalytic activity of IRAK is required for activation of this pathway (1Mamidipudi V. Li X. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28010-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfection of the mutant IRAK abrogated the ability of NGF to activate the-κB pathway (Fig. 4C) as well as IL-1-induced activation of the-κB pathway (Fig. 4D). Conclusions—Our findings reveal that iota PKC regulates the NF-κB pathway at the level of Thr66 within IRAK. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that zeta PKC, a closely related homolog of iota, phosphorylates p65 RelA and regulates its transactivation potential (14Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that regulation of the NF-κB pathway by the aPKCs takes place by two distinct mechanisms: 1) iota PKC regulation of IRAK at the membrane (herein) and 2) zeta PKC regulation of transcription within the nucleus (14Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In other systems removal of the KD of IRAK still produces an enzyme that is phosphorylated (3Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that another kinase phosphorylates the enzyme. Although IRAK4 has been identified as an IRAK (11Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), IRAK4 expression is restricted to liver and kidney, thus suggesting that other kinases also participate in the phosphorylation/regulation of IRAK in other tissues (12Hu J. Jacinto R. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3910-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Herein, we identify iota PKC as an IRAK kinase. In addition, deletion of the DD, which contains a Thr66 site, impairs IRAK autophosphorylation and the ability of IRAK to couple with downstream effectors, and it blocks IL-1- as well as c-Jun N-terminal kinase-induced NF-κB activation (3Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Qian Y. Commane M. Tsuji-Ninomiya J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with previous findings suggesting that the DD serves as a bifurcation hub for the NF-κB pathway, the identification of Thr66 as the site within the DD sheds light on the mechanism underlying this effect. Thus, considering the conserved nature of the Thr66 within IRAK family members, the regulation IRAK by iota PKC may be a common mechanism employed by diverse stimuli for regulation of IRAK function (12Hu J. Jacinto R. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3910-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Employing a totally different rationale and approach, it has been observed recently that Thr66 of IRAK plays a critical role in regulation of IL-1-induced NF-κB (16Ross K. Yang L. Dower S. Volpe F. Guesdon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37414-37421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), without considering the possibility that this is a site targeted for transphosphorylation by another kinase. The authors therein (16Ross K. Yang L. Dower S. Volpe F. Guesdon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37414-37421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) conducted modeling studies revealing that Thr66 may play a role in the stabilization of the fourth and first α-helices of IRAK; furthermore, their study suggested that Thr66 to Ala mutation may effect IRAK autophosphorylation, although without direct measure of phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that Thr66 to Ala mutation totally impairs the basal autokinase activity of IRAK and hence provides further insight into the mechanism whereby this site regulates enzyme activity. Altogether, these results reveal that Thr66 plays a conserved role in several signaling pathways to fine-tune the IRAK's function and signaling abilities and underscore the importance of iota PKC in the regulation of the κB pathway."

It involves an oxidation, enolization, intramolecular aldol cyclization, and reduction. Here we present the structure of MIP synthase in complex with NAD+ and a high-affinity inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate. This structure reveals interactions between the enzyme active site residues and the inhibitor that are significantly different from that proposed for 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate in the previously published structure of MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate. There are several other conformational changes in NAD+ and the enzyme active site as well.

Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Google Scholar) suggest that Valproate, a drug used in the treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, and seizure disorder, may act by inhibition of MIP synthase, thus lowering neuronal inositol pools similar to the action of lithium (14Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Google Scholar). Regulation of inositol biosynthesis itself may, therefore, play an important role in the regulation of second messenger signaling. MIP synthase is remarkably conserved in eukaryotes, with better than 45% identity from yeast to humans (3Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In all cases, the enzyme displays modest catalytic activity, with turnover numbers ranging from 3 to 13 μm/min/mg enzyme and with substrate Km values in the 100 μm to 1 mm range (3Majumder A.L.

The reaction path first proposed by Loewus et al. (shown in Fig. 1) remains the most likely (3Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 245-256Google Scholar, 26Loewus F.A. Kelly S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 204-208Google Scholar, 27Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5154-5155Google Scholar). A series of inhibitor studies indicates that the enzyme first binds the open acyclic tautomer of the substrate d-glucose 6-phosphate, followed by oxidation to the C5 keto intermediate (30Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Google Scholar). Frost and coworkers propose that enolization is promoted by proton extraction by means of the substrate phosphate, which is consistent with the phosphate binding in a transoid conformation (30Tian F. Migaud M.E. Frost J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5795-5796Google Scholar). They base this conclusion on the ability of 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate, a substrate mimic of the enzyme that fixes the phosphonate trans to C5, to strongly inhibit the enzyme, whereas the equivalent Z-mimic displays no affinity for the enzyme. 2-Deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate is, in fact, the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme known, having a Ki of 0.6 μm. Intramolecular aldol cyclization followed by reduction of the C5-ketone completes the formation of the product. None of the intermediates have been isolated or trapped, suggesting that all intermediates are tightly bound and not released until the final reduction to myo-inositol 1-phosphate (31Barnett J.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 125-129Google Scholar, 32Loewus M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7221-7223Google Scholar, 33Sherman W.R. Stewart M.A. Zinbo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5703-5708Google Scholar). Crystal structures of several MIP synthase enzymes have been determined, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae MIP synthase partially occupied with NAD+ and bound to fully occupied NAD+ and an inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar). The inhibitor seemed to be bound in a relatively extended conformation, which is inconsistent with intramolecular aldol cyclization. Based on this data, a conformation that would be consistent with the cyclization was modeled, and a mechanism for the transformation was proposed. In addition, a possible location for an ammonium ion was identified, and it was proposed that the ammonium ion performed a similar function to that of a divalent cation in type II aldolases, stabilizing the developing negative charge on the enolate oxygen atom. This supposition was based on data showing that ammonium ions significantly activate S. cerevisiae MIP synthase relative to other ions (17Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Google Scholar). The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MIP synthase bound to NAD+ has also recently been reported and a position for a Zn2+ proposed (35Norman R.A. McAlister M.S. Murray-Rust J. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 2002; 10: 393-402Google Scholar). However, the Zn2+ appears to be located between the amide of the nicotinamide and the nicotinamide phosphodiester on NAD+. Though apparently not in a position to be directly involved in catalysis, this Zn2+ bridges the NAD+ and may help to define the nicotinamide position in the active site. Recently, we have determined the structure of S. cerevisiae MIP synthase in the complete absence of NAD+ and in the presence of fully occupied NAD+ (36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar). We have also determined the structure of S. cerevisiae MIP synthase bound with NADH, phosphate, and glycerol (36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar). In both the apo and NAD+-bound structures, several active site residues were disordered. When the enzyme was bound with NADH, several dramatic conformational changes were observed. All active site residues became ordered in this structure, and the conformation of NADH changed significantly with its nicotinamide ring moving more than 1 Å away from its position in the NAD+-bound structure. A possible divalent cation was also observed in a position similar to that seen in the M. tuberculosis structure, between the nicotinamide phosphodiester and amide. Two small molecules were bound in the enzyme active site in this structure, and a phosphate and glycerol were modeled into these positions based on the shape and size of the electron density. However, the position of the phosphate was significantly different from that of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar), which is completely inconsistent with the position of the inhibitor in the active site and therefore calls into question the mechanism proposed based on the previous structure. Additionally, the putative ammonium ion proposed in this structure is one of the ligands for the putative metal ion, which is inconsistent with its identification as an ammonium ion. These structural results call into question virtually the entire mechanism proposed for S. cerevisiae MIP synthase based on the 2-deoxyglucitol-6-phosphate-bound structure. Major issues include the location of the substrate phosphate, and indeed the entire substrate molecule during active catalysis, and the role of ammonium for stabilization of the enolate. To better answer these and other questions regarding the mechanism of MIP synthase, we have determined the structure of S. cerevisiae MIP synthase in complex with NAD+ and a high affinity inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate (Ki = 0.67 × 10-6m) at pH 5.5, a pH at which the enzyme still displays significant catalytic activity. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—S. cerevisiae MIP synthase was purified as reported previously (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar, 37Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 348-350Google Scholar). Protein was treated with activated charcoal for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cofactors. Crystals of apo S. cerevisiae MIP synthase were then grown by using the same condition used to grow the crystals of S. cerevisiae MIP synthase with partially occupied NAD+ and the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex (37Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 348-350Google Scholar). Crystals of apo MIP synthase were then soaked in a stabilizer containing 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 5.5, 1 mm NAD+, 13.5 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate for 24 h. For data collection, a single crystal was transferred to the cryo-protectant stabilizing solution (5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 30% glycerol) and flash-frozen. Data were collected at the synchrotron radiation source at the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team ID-17, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data reduction and scaling were performed using HKL2000 (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The structure was solved by using the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure (36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar) as an initial phasing model. The electron density maps were traced by using TURBO-FRODO, and multiple rounds of refinement were conducted by using CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar).

The inhibitor was present and modeled into the active site of the A molecule. No electron density for the inhibitor was evident in molecule B, which is consistent with its less ordered active site. The final R factor and Rfree are 18.8 and 24.4%, respectively. Only 3 of 1041 residues are in the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plot (Asp-319 in molecule A, Asp-320 in molecules A and B) evaluated by PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Enzyme Kinetic Assay—S. cerevisiae MIP synthase single mutants K369A, K412A, and K489A were constructed by using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The primers used were: K369A, ATTTAGGTCTGCAGAGATTTCCAAA; K412A, GTCGGGGACTCAGCAGTGGCAATGGA; and K489A, AGTTACTGGTTAGCAGCTCCATTAA. Mutant enzymes were over-expressed and purified identically to that of wild-type enzyme. For the activity assay, the enzyme was incubated in the assay solution containing 50 mm Tris, 2 mm NH4Cl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.7, with 1.5 mm NAD+ and various concentrations of the substrate d-glucose 6-phosphate. Reactions were monitored over a time period of 20 min and stopped by adding a 20% trichloroacetic acid solution to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated with 0.2 m NaIO4 for one hour at 37 °C and quenched by the addition of 1.5 m Na2SO3. Released inorganic phosphate was determined by the colorimetric method of Ames (41Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—All energy minimization calculations were performed by using the Insight II version 2000 software package (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). X-ray coordinates of the MIP synthase and 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate were used to produce the starting coordinates of the substrate d-glucose 6-phosphate and the final reaction intermediate myo-2-inosose 1-phosphate. The structures were parameterized by using the Discover/Insight II Extensible Systematic Force Field (ESFF) and incorporating the partial charges calculated for both substrates and the reaction intermediate by an electrostatic fitting procedure. Explicit hydrogens were added, and the amino acid residues were protonated so as to be consistent with the experimental pH value. Energy minimization was performed until the atomic root-mean-square derivative reached its minimum. The Overall Structure of MIP Synthase—The overall structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex is similar to that of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex (Fig. 2A; Ref. 36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar). The root-mean-square deviation between the two structures was only 0.49 Å. All of the active site residues are ordered in both molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the side chains of the active site residues overlap with those of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure very well. Cys-436 is the only exception, because its Cα and side chain sulfur atoms moved 2.4 Å and 3.5 Å, respectively, away from their positions in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure. In fact, the position of Cys-436 is identical to that of the apo, NAD+-bound, and the 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate-bound structures (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar, 36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar). The Conformation of NAD+—The conformation of NAD+ is very similar to that of NADH in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure, differing significantly from that of the NAD+-bound and the NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate-bound structures. However, the distance between the amide and phosphodiester is a bit closer than that of the MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol structure (3.2 Å versus 3.8 Å) (Fig. 2B). The putative divalent cation is present in this structure as well, but the fourth ligand seen in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure (a water molecule) is not present. The fourth ligand is now Ser-439 O, identical to the coordination of the Zn2+ in the M. tuberculosis MIP synthase structure. Interatomic distances between the putative divalent cation and its four ligands are 2.26, 2.58, 2.52, and 2.83 Å, respectively; bond angles are 95.0, 104.7, 92.01, and 112.8°. The conclusion to be drawn from these observations is that divalent cation binding is variable in S. cerevisiae MIP synthase, at least at low cation concentration. It also correlates with a well folded active site, as metal binding is only seen in structures of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase when the active site is fully ordered. Therefore, this conformation of the cofactor probably represents the enzyme in its active state. Also, the conformational change of the cofactor is not solely due to the difference in the charge of the cofactor, as the present structure contains NAD+, whereas NADH is bound in the previous structure. The Structure of the Inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-Vinylhomophosphonate—The inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate is bound in the enzyme active site in an extended conformation, as shown in the 1.8 σ simulated annealing omit map shown in Fig. 3A. The phosphate group is in a transoid conformation relative to the inhibitor carbon backbone, fixed by the double bond between the phosphonate carbon and C6. The distance from the inhibitor C5 to nicotinamide C4 is 3.8 Å, a bit long for a direct hydride transfer. The inhibitor molecule is well nestled within the enzyme active site by hydrogen bond interactions with the active site residues (Fig. 3B). The phosphonate moiety is in an identical position to that of the phosphate in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure (Fig. 2B) but is different from the position of the phosphate moiety of the inhibitor in the previously published S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar). In fact, the entire inhibitor molecule is rotated end to end, with the phosphate on the opposite side of the active site relative to the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (Fig. 4A). The phosphate makes hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms of Ser-323, Gly-324, Gln-325, and Thr-326. This motif is conserved among eukaryotes, but not in prokaryotes (it is SQVGAT in M. tuberculosis and TGET in Archaeoglobus fulgidus). Conserved lysine residues Lys-412 and Lys-373 also make hydrogen bonds with the phosphonate oxygens. All of the hydroxyl groups of the inhibitor except O1 make hydrogen bonds with side chains of conserved active site residues. There are hydrogen bonds between O3 and both Asp-356 OD1 and Lys-369 NZ; O4 and Asp-438 OD2; O5 and both Lys-369 NZ and Lys-489 NZ; O1P and Ser-323 N, Gly-324 N and Gln-325 N; O2P and Gly-324 N, Gln-325N and Lys-412 NZ; O3P and Thr-326 N, Thr-326 OG1 and Lys-373 NZ. All of these residues are absolutely conserved among eukaryotes from yeast to human. Residues Asp-356, Lys-369, Lys-373, Lys-412, Asp-438, Lys-489 are also conserved among MIP synthases from A. fulgidus and M. tuberculosis. Fig. 3B depicts all of the interactions between the inhibitor molecule and the active site residues. It is important to note that the putative divalent cation chelates the water molecule as part of a hydrogen bond network that holds O3 and O4 of the inhibitor in their positions. However, the divalent cation position is quite far from O5, on the opposite side of the active site and seems not to be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, ruling out a type II, metal-mediated aldol cyclization mechanism. The water molecule that is chelated to this metal is also on the opposite side of the active site but plays an important role in stabilizing residues in the active site (Asp-356 and Asp-438), both of which make hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups of the inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Given the sequence similarity of the A. fulgidus MIP synthase to our S. cerevisiae MIP synthase enzyme, we conclude that this metal ion will likely be present in the A. fulgidus MIP synthase (17Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Google Scholar), though given the sensitivity of the Archaebacteria enzyme toward EDTA and metal ions, the possibility of a second metal ion in or near the active site cannot be ruled out. The surprising result is the apparent lack of a requirement for the divalent in S. cerevisiae MIP synthase, because our structures together indicate that the nicotinamide is improperly positioned for catalysis in the absence of the divalent cation, as shown in our structures of the NAD+-bound enzyme and the EDTA-treated NADH-bound enzymes (36Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Google Scholar). Clearly, more detailed analysis of the cationic requirements of S. cerevisiae MIP synthase is necessary to answer this question.Fig. 4A, overlay of the MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex structure (silver), and the MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (34Stein A.J.

Note: the substrate phosphate-binding surface is positively charged for encapsulation of the substrate phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The constellation of new data from the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+ complex, the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex, and the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex structures leads to the conclusion that the previous modeling of the inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate is not consistent with substrate binding at neutral pH and that the mechanism proposed must, therefore, also be revised (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar). (i) Asp-356 is in the same conformation in all of the above-mentioned structures, as well as M. tuberculosis MIP synthase and A. fulgidus MIP synthase, as opposed to the conformation in the previously reported S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (Fig. 4A; Ref. 34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar), where it is flipped out of the active site. (ii) The phosphate moiety of 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate is in an identical position to that of the phosphate in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure (Fig. 2B), which is quite different from that of the inhibitor from the previously published S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate structure (Fig. 4A; Ref. 34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar). (iii) As shown in Fig. 4B, an analysis of surface charge distribution of the substrate-binding site indicates that the phosphate-binding pocket is positively charged for encapsulation of the substrate. There must be strong polar interactions between the substrate and the substrate-binding site of MIP synthase at physiological pH. In both the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex structure and the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex structure, the phosphate moieties are located in this positively charged region. However, in the previously published structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex, the phosphate is located on the opposite side of the active site, where the surface is, in fact, negatively charged. (iv) The structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex was determined at pH 5.5, closer to the optimal pH (7.2–7.7) than pH 4.5, at which the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure was determined. MIP synthase activity assays at different pH indicate that, at pH 4.5, the enzyme has very low activity, but at pH 5.5, the enzyme recovers about 50% of its optimum activity (Fig. 5). Finally, in the structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex, the conformations of the substrate-interacting residues that are different from the previous S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar) agree well with that of the recently reported structure of M. tuberculosis MIP synthase (35Norman R.A. McAlister M.S. Murray-Rust J. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 2002; 10: 393-402Google Scholar), especially the region surrounding the phosphate-binding pocket. Specifically, Ser-323 is flipped into the active site in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex structure (Fig. 4A), effectively blocking phosphate binding, whereas it is flipped out in the M. tuberculosis MIP synthase, S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NADH-phosphate-glycerol complex, and S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex structures, allowing room for phosphate binding. This strongly indicates that Ser-323 belongs in the “flipped out” conformation when the enzyme is binding substrate, as we see in the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex structure. Modeling of the Substrate and Reaction Intermediates—As described above, the inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate is bound in the active site of the enzyme in an extended conformation and is incapable of cyclization (Fig. 3). When the substrate is modeled in the same conformation in the active site, a steric collision occurs between the 2-hydroxyl group and the residue Leu-360 in the active site (the distance from the 2-hydroxyl oxygen and Leu-360 carbon is 2 Å). This indicates that the substrate must bind differently in the active site than does the inhibitor in the vicinity of C1 and C2 (42Barnett J.E. Rasheed A. Corina D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 1267-1269Google Scholar). Based on the location and conformation of the inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate, the substrate d-glucose 6-phosphate was modeled in a conformation consistent with cyclization. The phosphate portion was overlaid onto that of the inhibitor molecule with O6 at the position of the inhibitor C7; C6, C5, and C4 were overlaid onto the inhibitor C6, C5, and C4, respectively. Energy minimization using the program Insight II was performed to model the rest of the substrate in a minimum energy conformation. The result of modeling was such that none of the backbone atoms and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms would collide with the side chains of active site residues (Fig. 6A). The result of this modeling provided abundant information regarding potential interactions between the substrate in its pseudocyclic conformation and the enzyme active site. All but O2 and O3 of the substrate hydroxyl groups make hydrogen bonds with active site residue side chains. Fig. 6B depicts most of the interactions seen. The final reaction intermediate, myo-2-inosose 1-phosphate, was also modeled, and its energy minimized in the active site (Fig. 6C). This cyclic intermediate makes an additional hydrogen bond between O3 and Asp-438, which contributes to the stabilization of the cyclic conformation. Proposed Mechanism of MIP Synthase—The structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate described above (34Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Google Scholar) is inconsistent with the mechanism proposed previously, which was based on the structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate complex. Based on the new structure of the S. cerevisiae MIP synthase-NAD+-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-(E)-vinylhomophosphonate complex and modeling of the substrate and reaction intermediates, a new mechanism can be proposed (Fig. 7). In the first step, the substrate is oxidized at C5 by NAD+. This involves direct hydride transfer from C5 of d-glucose 6-phosphate to C4 of the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+; this is consistent with the present crystal structure where the nicotinamide is located in a suitable orientation for hydride transfer to occur. In concert, a proton is lost from the C5 hydroxyl group of d-glucose 6-phosphate. This proton can be transferred to the Lys-369 terminal nitrogen atom, which is 2.8 Å away from the substrate O5. Asp-320, adjacent to Lys-369, could then accept this proton in a proton-shuffling system. The second step is the enolization. During the enolization, the pro-R hydrogen of C6 is eliminated (43Loewus M.W. Loewus F.A. Brillinger G.U. Otsuka H. Floss H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11710-11712Google Scholar). From the crystal structure, either the phosphate monoester or Lys-489 may act as the base at the enolization step. The distance between C6 and the phosphate oxygen is 3 Å, and between Lys-489 NZ and C6 is 3.4 Å. The phosphate monoester acting as the base at the enolization step has precedent in the dehydroquinate synthase mechanism (44Carpenter E.P. Hawkins A.R. Frost J.W. Brown K.A. Nature. 1998; 394: 299-302Google Scholar, 45Bender S.L. Widlanski T. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7560-7572Google Scholar). This hypothesis requires the phosphate to be in a transoid conformation relative to the carbon backbone of the substrate, which is consistent with the present structure (Fig. 3, A and B). From the modeling of the 5-keto-d-glucose 6-phosphate intermediate in the active site, Lys-489 is also in a suitable position to remove the pro-R hydrogen of C6. The developing negative charge on the enolate oxygen is stabilized by two lysines, Lys-369 and Lys-489. In the aldol condensation step, the phosphate could transfer the proton abstracted from C6 to O1. Lys-412 could also transfer a proton to O1 in the aldol cyclization step; the developing negative charge on O1 would then be stabilized by Lys-373. From the crystal structure and the substrate modeling, a type I aldolase mechanism where Lys-369 or Lys-489 could form a Schiff base with C5 of the substrate also can not be ruled out. However, Schiff base formation would require significant conformational changes of either the enzyme main chain or the substrate, because neither Lys-369 nor Lys-489 can reach C5 in its present position in our structure. The last step is the reduction by NADH. The hydride that was transferred in the first step to the nicotinamide C4 returns to the C5 of the intermediate myo-2-inosose 1-phosphate. Using the same proton-shuffling system, a proton could then be transferred to the C5 ketone oxygen from Asp-320, via Lys-369. It is important to realize that our mechanistic proposal is based largely on our inhibitor-bound structure and not our modeling, as the C5–O5 bond is already oriented properly for hydride transfer from NAD+. On the other hand, our hypotheses regarding activation of the O1 aldehyde by Lys-412 and Lys-373 are based on our modeling in the active site, though it is important to realize that both Lys-373 and Lys-412 are absolutely conserved in all MIP synthase sequences and that our mutagenesis results are consistent with this hypothesis in that the K412A mutation is completely inactive. Mutagenesis—To verify the importance of residues Lys-369, Lys-412, Lys-489 in the mechanism, we have mutated these three lysine residues to alanine and investigated the activity of these mutants. All three mutations have resulted in complete loss of activity, as none of these mutants was able to turn the substrate over detectably. This result strongly suggests that these lysine residues indeed play very important mechanistic roles. Though the mechanism described above is reasonable, it is by no means definitive. Verification of the mechanism proposed above requires further structural investigations of MIP synthase in complex with various structural analogues of reaction intermediates. At this point, there is still not enough data regarding whether the substrate binds in its cyclic form, followed by ring opening catalyzed by the enzyme, or binds in its acyclic form, which constitutes less than 0.4% of d-glucose 6-phosphate in solution. It is particularly important to produce a structure of a product-like inhibitor, which is already cyclized, to validate our modeling of the cyclic conformation in the active site. We thank F. Tian and J. W. Frost for providing the inhibitor molecule used in this study and B. Stec for helpful discussions and providing the coordinates of A. fulgidus MIP synthase before publication.

https://openalex.org/W2084344645,"Sml1 is a small protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which inhibits the activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). RNR catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo dNTP synthesis. Sml1 is a downstream effector of the Mec1/Rad53 cell cycle checkpoint pathway. The phosphorylation by Dun1 kinase during S phase or in response to DNA damage leads to diminished levels of Sml1. Removal of Sml1 increases the population of active RNR, which raises cellular dNTP levels. In this study using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified the region of Sml1 phosphorylation to be between residues 52 and 64 containing the sequence GSSASASASSLEM. This is the first identification of a phosphorylation sequence of a Dun1 biological substrate. This sequence is quite different from the consensus Dun1 phosphorylation sequence reported previously from peptide library studies. The specific phosphoserines were identified to be Ser56, Ser58, and Ser60 by chemical modification of these residues to S-ethylcysteines followed by collision activated dissociation. To investigate further Sml1 phosphorylation, we constructed the single mutants S56A, S58A, S60A, and the triple mutant S56A/S58A/S60A and compared their degrees of phosphorylation with that of wild type Sml1. We observed a 90% decrease in the relative phosphorylation of S60A compared with that of wild type, a 25% decrease in S58A, and little or no decrease in the S56A mutant. There was no observed phosphate incorporation in the triple mutant, suggesting that Ser56, Ser58, and Ser60 in Sml1 are the sites of phosphorylation. Further mutagenesis studies reveal that Dun1 kinase requires an acidic residue at the +3 position, and there is cooperativity between the phosphorylation sites.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mec1 and Rad53 kinases are transducers of all known cell cycle checkpoint pathways (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, cell cycle progression is arrested at certain phases known as checkpoints, and simultaneously cells increase their capacity to repair DNA damage. A downstream effector of the pathway modulated by Mec1 and Rad53 is ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; CAD, collision-activated dissociation; ESI, electrospray ionization; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; SORI, sustained off-resonance irradiation; cAPK, cylic AMP-dependent protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; CAD, collision-activated dissociation; ESI, electrospray ionization; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; SORI, sustained off-resonance irradiation; cAPK, cylic AMP-dependent protein kinase. RNR catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleoside diphosphates, which is the rate-limiting step for dNTP synthesis. Overexpression of RNR genes rescues lethality caused by deletion of MEC1 and RAD53 genes (2Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). During DNA damage and at S phase, levels of dNTP pools are increased to enhance the capacity of DNA repair (2Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This is achieved by transcriptional activation of RNR genes in a Mec1/Rad53-dependent manner (3Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The activity of RNR in yeast is also regulated by the small regulatory protein Sml1 (2Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Sml1 inhibits RNR activity through an interaction with the large subunit of the RNR complex, Rnr1 (2Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 5Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage or at S phase, the intracellular level of Sml1 is reduced significantly (6Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of RNR. Zhao and Rothstein (7Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the removal of Sml1 is triggered through its phosphorylation by Dun1 kinase. Evidence for this comes from the following observations: 1) deletion of the SML1 gene suppresses several phenotypes of the DUN1 null mutant, including its prolonged S phase; 2) in the null mutant of DUN1, both phosphorylation and degradation of Sml1 in response to DNA damage are diminished significantly; 3) Sml1 and Dun1 physically interact in vivo; and 4) Sml1 is phosphorylated by Dun1 in vitro. In S. cerevisiae, Dun1 is a particularly important serine/threonine kinase in that it acts upstream of multiple pathways such as transcriptional activation of genes required for DNA synthesis (3Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and the cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase (8Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.

In addition, more than 20 different proteins physically interact with Dun1, suggesting that Dun1 may be involved in multiple pathways (10Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I. Schandorff S. Shewnarane J. Vo M. Taggart J. Goudreault M. Muskat B. Alfarano C. Dewar D. Lin Z. Michalickova K.

Although the mechanism by which Dun1 transmits signals during cell cycle checkpoints to its downstream effectors is not well understood, its kinase activity is crucial for its biological function. For instance, the kinase-deficient mutants D328A and K229R, unlike wild type Dun1, cannot respond to DNA damage and do not induce the expression of the RNR3 gene (3Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins such as the Crt1 repressor (11Huang M. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and the DNA repair protein Rad55 (12Bashkirov V.I. Bashkirova E.V. Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4393-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) depends on Dun1, and the pathways in which these proteins are involved are independent of Sml1. Therefore, it is likely that there are other unidentified substrates of Dun1. So far, Sml1 is the only known natural substrate of Dun1 kinase. Prior to this study, the sites of Sml1 phosphorylated by Dun1 kinase had not been identified. By using an in vitro screen with a combinatorial library of 70 synthetic peptides that were known to be substrates of other serine/threonine kinases, Sanchez et al. (14Sanchez Y. Zhou Z. Huang M. Kemp B.E. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 398-410PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Dun1 phosphopeptides have a basic residue at the -3 position from the phospho-Ser/Thr site. Furthermore, they found that Dun1 phosphorylates the consensus cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) recognition sequence and that Dun1 and cAPK have similar substrate specificity. Nevertheless, to determine the Dun1 recognition sequence, it is necessary to identify phosphorylation sites in a natural substrate of Dun1. In this study, we identified the in vitro phosphorylation sites of Sml1 by Dun1 kinase using electrospray mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful technique for characterizing native and modified proteins. In particular, MS has been used extensively for phosphorylation mapping experiments by virtue of the capability of this technique to measure phosphorylated species at the molecular level (15Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Cleverley K.E. Betts J.C. Blackstock W.P. Gallo J.M. Anderton B.H.

The ability to conduct high resolution MS experiments on the phosphorylated version of Sml1 proved to be essential for unraveling the complex phosphorylation signature of this important protein. In our study, MS analysis combined with β-elimination of the Sml1 phosphopeptide greatly aided identification of the phosphorylation sites. Unlike the study with synthetic peptide libraries, the amino acid sequence spanning the phosphorylation sites of Sml1 did not show any similarity to the cAPK recognition sequence. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify unambiguously the Sml1 sites of phosphorylation and for the identification of crucial residues required for Dun1 recognition.

The procedure for constructing the C14S Sml1 mutant is described elsewhere. 2V. Gupta, C. Peterson, L. Dice-Turner, T. Uchiki, R. Hettich, J.-T. Guo, and X. Ying, X., submitted for publication. The wild type Sml1 expression plasmid was used as a template to create S56A, S58A, S60A, S61A, E63Q, and the S56A/S58A/S60A Sml1 mutants using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression and Purification of Bacterially Expressed Sml1—An overnight culture of BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed by Sml1 expression plasmid was grown in Terrific Broth medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 100-fold in fresh Terrific Broth medium and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm followed by a 3-h incubation in the shaker. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, containing 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) pH 7.4) and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The following procedures were all carried out at 4 °C. After thawing the frozen cell suspension, the lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The protein in the supernatant fraction was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 25% saturation. The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in buffer A before applying to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography column (26-mm inner diameter and 60-cm height; Amersham Biosciences), which was preequilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4). The eluted fractions containing Sml1 were identified by SDS-PAGE using a 15% acrylamide gel followed by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) MS as described below. These fractions were pooled and used for phosphorylation assays. The concentration of Sml1 was determined by a Coomassie Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. ADR1 G233 Peptide—The ADR1 G233 peptide (LKKLTRRASFSGQ) was custom synthesized at the Yale University W. M. Keck biotechnology resource center. This peptide was purified further by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and its purity was checked by ESI-FTICR-MS. The purified peptide was dissolved in water, and its concentration was determined by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (Pierce) using tryptophan dissolved in water as a standard. Expression of GST-Dun1 and Kinase Reaction—Expression of GST-Dun1 was carried out as described by Zhao and Rothstein (7Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast cells (U952-B) transformed by the GST-Dun1 expression plasmid (pWJ772-11) were grown in SC-URA raffinose, and the expression of Dun1 was induced at mid-log phase (5∼6 × 107 cells/ml) by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). After two doubling times, the cells were harvested, washed with water, and stored at -80 °C. The purification of GST-Dun1 was carried out as described by Zhao and Rothstein (7Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and Sanchez et al. (14Sanchez Y. Zhou Z. Huang M. Kemp B.E. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 398-410PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Igepal 630, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture, 2 μm pepstatin, pH 8.0) by glass bead disruption. The supernatant containing Dun1 was incubated with glutathione beads (glutathione-4-Sepharose Superflow: Amersham Biosciences) for 50 min and washed with buffer C. Examination of the glutathione beads by SDS-PAGE revealed pure GST-Dun1. The resin-bound GST-Dun1 was incubated with 2 bed volumes of buffer B containing 250 μm ATP, 8.3 μm Sml1 at 30 °C for 2 h. At the completion of the reaction, glutathione beads were harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected for MS analysis. For a quantitative kinase assay, 0.06 μCi/μl(1Ci = 37 GBq) [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 mCi/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was included in the buffer B. To compare the degree of phosphorylation in wild type Sml1 and ADR1 G233 peptide, the kinase assay was conducted with substrate concentrations of 8.3 μm and 67 μm for 30 min. Immediately after the reaction, 20 μl of supernatant was spotted on a 1-cm2 piece of phosphocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed in 10 mm phosphoric acid first and then with 95% (v/v) ethanol. The radioactivity on the membrane was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (LS3801; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). For autoradiography, 10 μl of the supernatant was mixed with SDS-gel loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% (v/v), 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.025 bromphenol blue) and was separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Cerenkov radiation on the gel was detected by an electric autoradiography imager (Instant Imager; A Packard Bioscience Company, Ontario, Canada). Enzymatic Digestion and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)—For tryptic digestion, a sample containing ∼10 μg (83 pmol) of Sml1 was incubated with 0.2 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 10 h. To quench the reaction, acetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). For cyanogen bromide (CNBr) digestion, a sample containing ∼10 μg of Sml1 was dried using a speed vacuum apparatus. 10 μl of 10 mg/ml CNBr (Sigma) in 70% (v/v) formic acid was added to the sample and incubated for 24 h. To quench the reaction, 50 μl of water was added, and the sample was dried using a speed vacuum apparatus. This step was repeated five times. A 20-μl bed volume of Ga(III) IMAC column with Poros MC resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) was prepared as described previously (22Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The CNBr-digested samples were dissolved in 10 μl of 10% (v/v) of acetic acid and manually loaded onto the column preequilibrated with 1% (v/v) acetic acid. The column was washed with 6 bed volumes of 1% (v/v) acetic acid, 6 bed volumes of a mixture consisting of water, acetonitrile, and acetic acid in a 70:30:1 respective ratio, followed by 6 bed volumes of 1% (v/v) acetic acid in water. The bound peptide was eluted with 3 bed volumes of 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.5. Derivatization of Phosphoserine—The phosphopeptides enriched by Ga(III) IMAC were desalted once with C18 reverse phase ZipTip columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the sample volume was reduced to less than 5 μl using a speed vacuum apparatus. The phosphoserine residues of the peptides were chemically modified to S-ethylcysteine by a β-elimination reaction in the presence of ethanethiol as described previously (23Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Oda Y. Nagasu T. Chait B.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of H2O, 4 m LiOH, acetonitrile, ethanol, ethanethiol mixed in a ratio of (5:14:5:5:2) was added to the sample and incubated in 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 μl of acetic acid. Because Sml1 contains only one cysteine residue (Cys14), we omitted the oxidation step, which is normally employed prior to the derivatization. ESI-FTICR-MS—All samples were desalted with C18 reverse phase ZipTips prior to MS analysis. For positive ion analysis, samples were prepared in a 50:50 mixture of water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid. For negative ion analysis samples were prepared in a 40:60 water:acetonitrile mixture containing 20 mm piperidine. All mass spectra were acquired with an IonSpec (Lake Forest, CA) 9.4-tesla HiRes ESI-FTICR-MS, as described previously for the Sml1-His tag species (25Uchiki T. Hettich R. Gupta V. Dealwis C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The MS experiment consisted of the four following steps: 1) ions were generated in the electrospray source; 2) the ions were accumulated in an external hexapole; 3) the ions were transferred into the high vacuum region with a quadrupole lens system; and 4) the ions were detected in the cylindrical analyzer cell of the mass spectrometer. To enhance ion trapping, nitrogen gas was pulsed into the mass analyzer to cool the ion packet prior to detection. Ions were measured under broadband conditions with resolutions ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 (full width at half-maximal height). External calibration was accomplished using the various charge states of bovine ubiquitin. The high resolution mass measurement enables isotopic resolution of multiply charged ions. Thus, the charge state of multiply charged ions can be determined solely by its isotopic spacing (26Horn D.M. Zubarev R.A. McLafferty F.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The deconvoluted molecular mass spectra were generated with the IonSpec software from the ESI-MS by multiplying the masses of the electrospray ions by their respective charge and then subtracting the masses of the protons added. This “unfolds” the multiply charged ion mass spectrum into a more easily interpreted molecular mass spectrum. Errors in the mass measurement for the multiply charged ions will be scaled proportional to the charge in the calculation of the molecular masses in the deconvoluted mass spectra. By calibrating on the calculated values of the most abundant isotopic peaks of six different charge states (7+ to 12+) of bovine ubiquitin, the deconvoluted molecular mass spectrum yielded a measured molecular mass for ubiquitin which was within 0.030 Da of the calculated value. Ion collision dissociation was conducted by isolating an ion of interest within the analyzer cell of the mass spectrometer and then accelerating the ion into nitrogen target gas under sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-activated dissociation, or SORI-CAD (27Gauthier J.W. Trauman T.R. Jacobson D.B. Anal. Chem. Acta. 1991; 246: 211-225Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar). For the SORI-CAD experiments, the ion excitation was accomplished with an RF pulse (∼1 KHz lower in frequency than the ion cyclotron frequency) applied for a 2-s duration and with an amplitude in the range of 1–4 volts (peak-to-peak). A pulsed valve was used to admit the nitrogen collision gas into the high vacuum region to a maximum pressure of about 5 × 10-6 torr during the ion excitation step. A base pressure of about 1 × 10-9 torr was reestablished prior to ion detection. Results from the in vitro phosphorylation of Sml1 by Dun1 where 32P is incorporated are shown in Fig. 1. Sml1 is specifically phosphorylated by Dun1 with 32P incorporation at 40–50 times greater than that of the negative control samples (Fig. 1). These results show that phosphorylation of Sml1 is solely the result of GST-Dun1 and that the kinase activity of GST-Dun1 is specific to Sml1. The number of phosphoryl groups attached to Sml1 was determined by a combination of MS and site-directed mutagenesis. To estimate the minimum number of phosphorylation sites, intact molecules of Sml1 were first analyzed by ESI-FTICR. The attachment of a phosphate to a hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, or tyrosine results in mass increases of the proteins or peptides by 79.966 Da in monoisotopic mass, and it was possible to estimate the number of phosphates on a protein by analyzing the mass shift. We observed monophosphorylated, diphosphorylated, triphosphorylated, and unphosphorylated Sml1. These observations indicated that at least three sites of Sml1 can be phosphorylated (Fig. 2). To find the region of Sml1 containing the phosphorylation sites, the protein was digested by trypsin or CNBr and then analyzed by ESI-FTICR. In the positive ion analysis of the tryptic digest, we detected peptides that covered 75% of the Sml1 sequence spanning residues 1–67 and 73–84. In the negative ion analysis, we detected peptides constituting 89% of the Sml1 sequence, which almost covered the entire Sml1 sequence with the exception of residues 16–26 (Fig. 3A). In both positive and negative ion analysis, the spectrum for the samples taken from the in vitro Dun1 phosphorylation assays showed that peptides spanning residues 33–67 (3,549.720 Da) and 34–67 (3,705.857 Da) are associated with their singly phosphorylated forms of 3,629.695 and 3,785.829 Da, respectively. In the positive ion analysis of CNBr digests, we detected four peptides that cover 34% of the Sml1 sequence spanning residues 29–39 and 81–104. However, none of these peptides was phosphorylated. In the negative ion analysis of CNBr digests, 7 or 8 peptides that cover 71% of Sml1 sequence (residues 31–106) were observed (Fig. 3B). These results showed that the peptide spanning residues 52–64 consisting of GSSASASASSLEM (1,153.539 Da) was associated with its singly phosphorylated form (Fig. 4, A and B). The phosphopeptides of Sml1 identified by both CNBr and tryptic digest are entirely consistent. The combined data generated from the CNBr and tryptic digest gave us 100% sequence coverage of Sml1.Fig. 4Negative ion analysis of Sml1 CNBr digest. A, the deconvoluted mass spectrum of the negative control of the kinase reaction subjected to CNBr digestion in which Sml1 was incubated in the presence of 250 μm ATP without GST-Dun1. As expected, no phosphorylated species were identified (see inset). In general, residues at the C terminus of peptides generated by CNBr digestion are homolactones, which can be further converted to homoserine by intramolecular hydrolysis. In this spectrum, residues at the C terminus of most of the peptides were homoserine. B, the deconvoluted mass spectrum of phosphorylated Sml1 subjected to CNBr digestion in which Sml1 was incubated with GST-Dun1 in the presence of 250 μm ATP. The peak (1,233.535) corresponds to a singly phosphorylated peptide consisting of residues 52–64 (see inset). Inthis spectrum, residues at the C terminus of the majority of the peptides were homoserine. C, phosphopeptides enriched by Ga(III) IMAC show singly, doubly, and triply phosphorylated species. In this spectrum, residues at the C terminus of these peptides were either homolactone or homoserine (denoted as C-homoserine).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To enrich phosphopeptides, CNBr digest samples were subjected to Ga(III) IMAC chromatography and analyzed in the negative ion mode. Singly, doubly, and triply phosphorylated forms of residues 52–64 were observed (Fig. 4C), which were absent in the negative control, which contained CNBr peptides generated from only unphosphorylated Sml1. In most of the samples, peak intensities of doubly or triply phosphorylated species were stronger than the singly phosphorylated species. Singly phosphorylated species could only be observed prior to IMAC chromatography. To confirm that the observed mass shift was the result of phosphorylation, an ion of the doubly phosphorylated species (M-H-1 = 1,294.452 Da) was subjected to CAD. In this experiment, the species of interest was isolated in the analyzer region of the mass spectrometer, accelerated with a RF voltage and bombarded into nitrogen gas. Depending on RF voltage used to accelerate the ion, we observed fragment ions of 1,196.489 and 1,098.466, which corresponded to the loss of one or two phosphoric acids (data not shown). We could not obtain a reasonable signal in the CAD experiment for singly and triply phosphorylated species, which was possibly because of the low abundance of the parent ions. To confirm our findings further, we repeated the same experiment with the C14S mutant form of Sml1 and its proteolytic fragment (29Uchiki T. Gupta V. Dealwis C. Hettich R.L. 50th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics. Orlando, FL2002Google Scholar). During purification of C14S Sml1 by gel filtration chromatography, the intact molecule was separated from a smaller degraded C14S Sml1 fragment corresponding to a mass of 8,147.073 Da. Mass spectrometric analysis of the latter revealed that the degraded peptide was an N-terminal fragment of C14S Sml1 consisting of residue 1–71 (29Uchiki T. Gupta V. Dealwis C.

https://openalex.org/W2044285636,"Protein phosphatases play an important role in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion processes. The type 1 phosphatase Glc7p and its regulatory subunit Reg1p were identified as required components in the glucose-induced targeting of the key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) to the vacuole for degradation. The interaction of Reg1p with Glc7p was important for the transport of FBPase from intermediate vacuole import and degradation (Vid) vesicles to vacuoles. The glc7-T152K mutant strain exhibited a reduced Reg1p binding along with defects in FBPase degradation and Vid vesicle trafficking to the vacuole. In this mutant, Vid vesicles were the most defective components, whereas the vacuole was also defective. Shp1p and Glc8p regulate Glc7p phosphatase activity and are required for FBPase degradation. In the Δshp1 and Δglc8 strains, Reg1p-Glc7p interaction was not affected, suggesting that phosphatase activity is also necessary for FBPase degradation. Similar to those seen in the glc7-T152K mutant, the Δshp1 and Δglc8 mutants exhibited severely defective Vid vesicles, but partially defective vacuoles. Taken together, our results suggest that Reg1p-Glc7p interaction and Glc7p phosphatase activity play a required role in the Vid vesicle to vacuole-trafficking step along the FBPase degradation pathway.

Regulation of the protein degradation process plays an essential role in cells. Although each cellular protein has its own intrinsic rate of turnover, this can be altered dramatically depending upon changes in the cellular environment. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins are targeted to the vacuole (the yeast homologue of the lysosome) following periods of nitrogen starvation by autophagy (1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev.

This process appears to be nonspecific, because cytosolic proteins are engulfed non-selectively in autophagosomes and delivered to the vacuole (2Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Cell. 2002; 3: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Serum starvation also enhances the rate of turnover of cellular proteins in mammalian cells, by targeting proteins for degradation in the lysosome (6Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 7Agarraberes F.A. Dice J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is a more selective process, in that proteins with a KFERQ motif are delivered to the vacuole in a molecular chaperone-mediated manner (8Chiang H.L. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6797-6805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The process of protein degradation also removes misfolded proteins, or proteins that are no longer required for a specific function. Along these lines, certain gluconeogenic enzymes are essential when yeast are grown in poor carbon sources, but they are rapidly inactivated when cells are replenished with fresh glucose (9Gancedo C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Holzer H. Revis. Biol. Celular. 1989; 21: 305-319PubMed Google Scholar). This process is critical for the cell, because it helps to prevent energy futile cycles. At present, the mechanisms of inactivation and degradation are not well established for most gluconeogenic enzymes. However, both vacuolar and proteasome-dependent degradation pathways have been described for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) 1The abbreviations used are: FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Vid, vacuole import and degradation; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; PP1, protein phosphatase type 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

For example, Glc7p is the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) and plays a critical role in several cellular trafficking events, including homotypic vacuole fusion, endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport and endocytic transport (22Peters C.

Specificity of Glc7p is dictated by regulatory subunits that target the catalytic subunit to various substrates for different functions under different growth conditions. As an example, Gac1p and Pig1p target Glc7p to glycogen accumulation (26Stuart J.S. Frederick D.L. Varner C.M. Tatchell K. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Nigavekar S.S. Tan Y.S. Cannon J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SHP1 (suppressor of high copy PP1) was identified as a mutation that suppresses the lethality caused by Glc7p overexpression (38Zhang S. Guha S. Volkertl F.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SHP1 gene lead to a marked reduction of the Glc7p-PP1 activity (38Zhang S. Guha S. Volkertl F.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Likewise, deletion of the GLC8 gene also significantly decreases Glc7p-PP1 activity (39Nigavekar S.S. Tan Y.S. Cannon J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, deletion of other regulatory subunits such as Reg1p, Reg2p, and Gac1p had minimal effects on Glc7p-PP1 activity (39Nigavekar S.S. Tan Y.S. Cannon J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At present, no role has been established for any phosphatase or phosphatase regulators in the trafficking of FBPase to the vacuole. However, Reg1p has been reported to play a role in the proteasome-dependent degradation of FBPase, presumably via its action as a signaling molecule (40Horak J. Regelmann J. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interaction of Glc7p with its regulatory subunits has been studied in detail. Analysis of the crystal structure revealed a hydrophobic grove on the surface of PP1c that is important for PP1c interaction with the PP1c-binding motif ((R/K)(V/I)XF) found in many targeting subunits of PP1c (41Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that this hydrophobic groove is indeed necessary for Glc7p binding to (R/K)(V/I)XF-containing regulatory subunits, including those in Reg1p and Gac1p. This hydrophobic groove is not only important for Glc7p binding to the motif, but it is also necessary for Glc7p biological activity and for its proper subcellular localization (42Wu X. Tatchell K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7410-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the hydrophobic groove, charged residues on the surface of Glc7p are important for its functions. For glucose derepression and cell cycle control, critical residues have been mapped to specific regions of the protein. For glycogen synthesis and sporulation, these charged residues are more widely distributed over the protein surface (43Baker S.H. Frederick D.L. Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 615-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a number of proteins that participate in the degradation of FBPase. These include the molecular chaperone Ssa2p (18Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the immunophilin cyclophilin A (19Brown C.R. Cui D. Hung G. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48017-48026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a plasma membrane protein Vid22p (20Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Hung G. Elco C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 655-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Vid24p (16Chiang M.C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and various members of the SNARE and homotypic fusion vacuole protein sorting families of proteins (21Brown C.R. Liu J. Hung G. Carter D. Cui D. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25688-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) play roles in this process. To identify additional proteins that are involved in the FBPase degradation pathway, we screened a yeast GST library in search of proteins that bind to FBPase. The phosphatase regulatory subunit Reg1p was identified as a putative FBPase-binding protein. FBPase degradation was defective in a Δreg1 strain, suggesting that Reg1p plays some role in the FBPase degradation. An interaction between Reg1p and Glc7p appears necessary for FBPase trafficking. A yeast strain harboring a mutant form of Glc7p that inhibits the Reg1p interaction was defective in both FBPase trafficking and degradation. The Δglc8 and Δshp1 strains that affect the catalytic activity of Glc7p also exhibited impaired degradation of FBPase. The functions of Vid vesicles and vacuoles were affected by mutations in the GLC7, SHP1, and GLC8 genes. Taken together, our results indicate that Reg1p-Glc7p plays an essential role in the trafficking of Vid vesicles to the vacuole.

Cells were lysed in GST binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature to solubilize membranes. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Supernatants were then incubated with pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min, and then washed five times with GST binding buffer. The washed beads were separated by SDS-PAGE. FBPase bound to GST fusion proteins were detected via Western blotting procedures using anti-FBPase antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells were grown in YPKG (10 ml) for 2 days and shifted to YPD for 30 min. Cells were harvested, resuspended in IP buffer (200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), followed by Triton X-100 (2%) solubilization for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was then incubated with anti-FBPase, anti-V5, or anti-myc antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein-antibody complex was precipitated using 100 μl of 50% slurry of protein A or protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were then washed three times with IP buffer, and proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins bound to the beads were detected by Western blotting. For Reg1p-V5-His6 pull down experiments, 10 ml of cultures was grown and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8. Lysates were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with 50-μl nickel beads. The bound material was washed three times in washing buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole, pH 8. Proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-Glc7p or anti-V5 antibodies. FBPase phosphorylation labeling experiments were performed as described by Jiang and Broach (45Jiang Y. Davis C. Broach J.R. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 6942-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 3% glycerol for 2 days, followed by a shift to low phosphate medium (0.2 mm potassium phosphate) containing 3% glycerol for 12 h. After incubation with 32PO4 (3 mCi, Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min, 2% glucose was added. Cells were removed at indicated times and fixed via the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Cells were washed and lysed, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and incorporated 32P was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To quantitate the overall levels of FBPase, 1 ml of cells was removed just prior to the addition of 32PO4 and examined by Western blot. Cells were lysed, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. FBPase was detected using anti-FBPase antibody. For FBPase pulse-chase experiments, we utilized a modification of the protocol described by Horak and Wolf (40Horak J. Regelmann J. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in SC media without l-methionine to A600 = 5. Cells then were washed twice with pulse-chase media (SC media without l-methionine, but containing 2% ethanol) and then incubated in the same media for 4–5 h. [35S]Met and [35S]Cys were added to the cells to the final concentration of 45 μCi/ml. After 5–6 h of labeling, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in SC media containing 10 mml-methionine, 10 mml-cysteine, and 2% glucose. At the indicated time points, 1-ml aliquots of cells were collected and fixed by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (5%). After washing the cells three times with cold water, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The 35S-labeled proteins were quantified with a PhosphorImager. Differential Centrifugation—Differential centrifugation experiments were performed as described (16Chiang M.C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In Vitro Vid Vesicle-Vacuole Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (21Brown C.R. Liu J. Hung G. Carter D. Cui D. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25688-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in YPKG media for 2 days at 30 °C and then shifted to glucose containing media for 30 min. Vid vesicles were isolated by differential centrifugation followed by a two-step 20 and 40% sucrose density gradients. Fractions containing fusion competent vesicles were collected from the interface and used in the in vitro assays. Vid vesicles were isolated either from wild type cells or the Δvam3 strain. Indistinguishable results were obtained with these vesicles (21Brown C.R. Liu J. Hung G. Carter D. Cui D. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25688-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Vacuoles and cytosol were isolated as described previously (21Brown C.R. Liu J. Hung G. Carter D. Cui D. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25688-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 20 μg of vesicle material, 20 μg of vacuolar material, 30 μg of cytosolic proteins, and an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 40 mm creatine phosphate). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and then terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C. The 13,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of alkaline phosphatase assay buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm ZnSO4) and examined for alkaline phosphatase activity using α-naphthyl phosphate as a substrate. REG1 Is Required for FBPase Degradation—We have established a model for the FBPase degradation pathway that consists of at least two steps. The first step involves the targeting of FBPase to Vid vesicles, whereas in the second step, Vid vesicles traffic to the vacuole for degradation (16Chiang M.C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have identified proteins that are required for each step in the pathway (18Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Brown C.R. Cui D. Hung G. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol.

To identify FBPase-interacting proteins that may play a role in the FBPase degradation pathway, we screened 64 pools of yeast strains in which each pool contained 96 cells expressing individual open reading frame fused with a GST tag. These cells were grown under glucose starvation conditions and then shifted to glucose containing media for 30 min. The GST fusion proteins were pulled down and examined for the presence of bound FBPase by Western blotting. The strongest positive pools were subjected to further analysis in which individual strains were cultured and processed as des"
https://openalex.org/W2143140848,"Our previous work indicated that instead of binding to B-Raf or C-Raf, trihydrophobin 1 (TH1) specifically binds to A-Raf kinase both in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we investigated its function further. Using confocal microscopy, we found that TH1 colocalizes with A-Raf, which confirms our former results. The region of TH1 responsible for the interaction with A-Raf is mapped to amino acids 1–372. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that TH1 is associated with A-Raf in both quiescent and serum-stimulated cells. Wild type A-Raf binds increasingly to TH1 when it is activated by serum and/or upstream oncogenic Ras/Src compared with that of “kinase-dead” A-Raf. The latter can still bind to TH1 under the same experimental condition. The binding pattern of A-Raf implies that this interaction is mediated in part by the A-Raf kinase activity. As indicated by Raf protein kinase assays, TH1 inhibits A-Raf kinase, whereas neither B-Raf nor C-Raf kinase activity is influenced. Furthermore, we observed that TH1 inhibited cell cycle progression in TH1 stably transfected 7721 cells compared with mock cells, and flow cell cytometry analysis suggested that the TH1 stably transfected 7721 cells were G0/G1 phase-arrested. Taken together, our data provide a clue to understanding the cellular function of TH1 on Raf isoform-specific regulation.

Bonthron group in 2000 (3Bonthron D.T. Hayward B.E. Moran V. Strain L. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). According to their studies, the TH1 gene was highly conserved from Drosophila to human by sequence comparison. The human TH1 gene was located in chromosome 20q13, which had a transcript product of 2.4 kb. Multiple tissues detected by Northern blots showed that TH1 was widely expressed. The human TH1 protein has been predicted having a molecular mass of 65.8 kDa and displays high levels of expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidney, adrenal, and thyroid. Although ubiquitously expressed, its function is not clear at present. From protein sequence data-base analysis, this protein does not seem to have a potential kinase domain. Our previous work has identified TH1 as a new interaction partner of A-Raf kinase, which belongs to a serine/threonine kinase family involved in MAPK signal transduction pathways (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 231: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mammalian MAPK signaling pathways have been found to play key roles in a wide range of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis corresponding to multiple extracellular stimuli (5Su B.

Among them, the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is so far the best described pathway, which is responsive to mitogenic and differential stimuli. It was depicted as a conserved three-kinase cascade pathway that consists of MKKKs, MKKs, and ERKs (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

As members of MKKKs, the serine/threonine Raf kinase family is poised in the core of the three-kinase module, which is important in relaying upstream signals to the nucleus (10Daum G.

In mammalian cells, the Raf kinase family is composed of three important isoforms: A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1Banga S.S. Yamamoto A.H. Mason J.M. Boyd J.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These Raf isoforms share high similarities in their sequence and structure as reported previously (11Yuryev A. Wennogle L.P. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Most studies have revealed that the Raf isoforms are under different regulation and have individual functions. In brief, as to their activation, although all three Raf isoforms interact with their upstream activator Ras and are activated by translocating to the membrane (14Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), studies in COS-7 cells showed that their activations were quite different. Unlike B-Raf, whose activation is sufficient by oncogenic Ras alone, A-Raf behaves like C-Raf, which needs synergism of oncogenic Ras and other tyrosine kinases such as Src to achieve full activation (16Marais R.

Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity, B-Raf kinase activity was proven to be determined by Ras and other members of the small G protein family such as Rap1 in PC12 cells (18Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) or TC21 in NIH3T3 cells (16Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J.

Moreover, Rap1 has been reported to inhibit C-Raf, whereas TC21 interacts with B-Raf and C-Raf but not A-Raf in these studies. Upon activation, the three Raf isoenzymes display differences in their catalytic activities. As measured by protein kinase assays, B-Raf has the highest activity to phosphorylate their common substrate, MEK1, whereas A-Raf has the lowest activity, and C-Raf catalytic activity is intermediate between them (21Pritchard C.A.

For instance, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A can activate Ras-related protein Rap1 (18Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

Besides, A-Raf is regulated distinctly from the other two Raf isoforms in the interleukin-3-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signal pathway (23Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although some common functions are found in the Raf family, their functions are noncompensable (13Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As reported, their distribution patterns are quite different. In contrast to C-Raf protein, which is ubiquitously expressed, the expression of A-Raf has a tissue-specific distribution and is expressed predominantly in urogenital tissues, whereas B-Raf is found mostly in brain tissues (37Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wadewitz A.G. Winer M.A. Wolgemuth D.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar). The restricted expression pattern may suggest that A-Raf has unique functions in such tissues. With gene knockout technology, mice deleted of different Raf genes show very different phenotypes (39Pritchard C.A. Bolin L. Slattery R. Murray R. McMahon M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 614-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech.

Dev. 1998; 76: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In previous studies, Sewing et al. (42Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) reported that high intensity of Raf activity caused cell cycle arrest mediated by p21Cip1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Recent studies in NIH3T3 murine fibroblast cells have shown that only moderate Raf activation such as A-Raf and C-Raf was necessary for G1 progression and cell proliferation, whereas the strongest activation of B-Raf led to apoptosis (43Chang F. McCubrey J.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, as a member of the Raf family, A-Raf may have its specific regulator and play a unique role in cells. In contrast to C-Raf and B-Raf, as increasingly demonstrated in recent studies, A-Raf has its unique interaction proteins. Besides binding to Ras (14Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Casein kinase 2β has been proven to be a specific activator of A-Raf which enhanced A-Raf kinase activity in Sf9 cells (36Hagemann C. Kalmes A. Wixler V. Wixler L. Schuster T. Rapp U.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase type M2 is a pyruvate kinase that correlates A-Raf with energy metabolism in tumorigenesis (13Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Yuryev et al. (58Yuryev A. Ono M. Goff S.A. Macaluso F. Wennogle L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4870-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) also discovered that two new proteins, hTOM and hTIM, which are involved in the mitochondrial transport system, interact with A-Raf, located exclusively in mitochondria (58Yuryev A. Ono M. Goff S.A. Macaluso F. Wennogle L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4870-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our recent study also reported that TH1 can interact directly with A-Raf, but how this interaction mediated A-Raf function has not been determined. Here, we observed by confocal microscopy that TH1 colocalizes with A-Raf in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells and COS-1 cells. By mapping the A-Raf binding region in TH1, the N-terminal 1–372 amino acids are found sufficient for binding with A-Raf. We also examined the association between TH1 and A-Raf in a different cellular context and found that the activation of A-Raf could enhance its association with TH1. In combination with the inhibitory effect of TH1 on A-Raf kinase tested by protein kinase assays, we demonstrated that TH1 is a new specific suppressor of A-Raf kinase in the MAPK/ERK cascade and the inhibition of cell cycle progression by TH1 may proceed through its interaction with A-Raf kinase. Cell Lines and Reagents—The human SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells (Institute of Cell Biology, Academic Sinica) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. The human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells kindly provided by the National Key Laboratory of Neurobiology of Fudan University and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells (Institute of Cell Biology, Academic Sinica) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. TH1 fragment F5 and the full-length TH1 stable transfectants derived from SMMC-7721 cells were established by selection in the culture medium with 4 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (>3,000 Ci/mm), [35S]methionine, Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protein G-agarose, glutathione-Sepharose beads, and mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal anti-A-Raf antibody, anti-C-Raf, anti-ERK1, anti-p-MEK1 (anti-phosphorylated Ser218/222), and mouse monoclonal anti-B-Raf antibody, anti-MEK1 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p-ERK1 (anti-phosphorylated Thr202/204) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Company. Anti-myc antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmid Construction—For binding assay in the yeast two-hybrid system, the full length of TH1 (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 231: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and deletion mutants was cloned in-frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA (Clontech). Plasmid pB42AD-A-Raf and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector pcDNA3-GST-TH1 and pcDNA3-A-Raf and the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1-myc-his-TH1 were obtained as described previously (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 231: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To generate the deletion mutants of TH1, we constructed by PCR with pLexA-TH1 as the template using the following primers: TH1 F1 (amino acids 1–452; sense, 5′-GTCGAATTCATGGACGAGGACTACTACG-3′ (the recognition site of EcoRI is underlined) and antisense, 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTTAGCAGGTGCTGATCTCAT-3′ (the recognition site of NotI is underlined)), TH1 F2 (amino acids 1–372; sense, 5′-TAAGGAATTCTCTGACGCAGGGTACCAGGGGGA-3′ (Eco-RI) and antisense, 5′-ATTGCGGCCGCTTAATCTTTATTGATGCTC-3′ (NotI)), TH1 F3 (amino acids 1–192; sense, 5′-GTCGAATTCATGGACGAGGACTACTACG-3′ (EcoRI) and antisense, 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTTAGAACACTTCTAGCTGCTG-3′ (NotI)), TH1 F4 (amino acids 1–170; sense, 5′-GTCGAATTCATGGACGAGGACTACTACG-3′ (EcoRI) and antisense, 5′-TGCCTCGAGAATAAGCCTAACGGTGAA-3′ (XhoI)), TH1 F5 (amino acids 64–452; sense, 5′-TGGAATTCATGTTCACCGTTATGCTTATTT-3′ (EcoRI) and antisense, 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTTAGCAGGTGCTGATCTCAT-3′ (NotI)), TH1 F6 (amino acids 171–582; sense, 5′-TAAGGAATTCTCTGACGCAGGGTACCAGGG-3′ (EcoRI) and antisense, 5′-GATGCGGCCGCTTAGTTCACCATGATG-3′ (NotI)), TH1 F7 (amino acids 452–582; sense, 5′-AGAGAATTCCACCAGCTCCTGCACC-3′ (EcoRI) and antisense, 5′-GATGCGGCCGCTTAGTTCACCATGATG-3′ (NotI)). The PCR products of each deletion were cut using the according enzymes and were cloned into plexA, pcDNA3 containing GST vectors, respectively. For fluorescence detection, plasmids pEGFP-N3 and pDsRed-C1 were purchased form Clontech Co. By PCR amplification, we cloned A-Raf in-frame into pDsRed-C1 at the site of XhoI/EcoRI using the primers A-Raf sense (5′-GCACTCGAGCTCATATGGAGCCACCACG-3′ (an XhoI site is underlined)) and antisense (5′-GTAGAATTCCTAAGGCACAAGGGGGGCTG-3′ (an EcoRI site is underlined)). Full-length B-Raf was generated by PCR with pLexA-B-Raf (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 231: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as the template using the primers B-Raf sense (5′-GCCCAAGCTTGTTATAAGATGGCGGCGCTGAGC-3′ (an HindIII site is underlined)) and antisense (5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGTGGACAGGAAACGCACC-3′ (an SalI site is underlined)). The PCR product was cut with HindIII/SalI restriction enzymes and cloned in-frame into pDsRed-C1. Full-length C-Raf was generated by PCR amplification using the primers C-Raf sense (5′-CATCTCGAGAGCACATACAGGGAGC-3′ (an XhoI site is underlined)) and antisense (5′-CAAGAATTCCTAGAAGACAGGCAG-3′ (an EcoRI site is underlined)). The full-length TH1 was cut with EcoRI/BamHI from pcDNA3.1-myc-TH1 and cloned in-frame into pEGFP-N3. The plasmids containing oncogenic Ras and Src were the generous gifts of Dr. Ji H. Zhao (Cornell University) and Dr. Jian G. Gu (Osaka University, Japan), respectively. The plasmids containing GST-MEK1, GST-MEK1 (K52), and GST-ERK1 for prokaryotic expression were kindly provided by Dr. Kun L. Guan (University of Michigan). Plasmid pBOS-A-Raf(KD)-(HA)2 was kindly provided by Dr. Sutor (Mayo Foundation). All generated sequences and plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Interaction Assays—For interaction in yeast, a series of TH1 deletion mutants constructed into plasmid pLexA were cotransformed with pB42AD-A-Raf and empty pB42AD plasmid to verify the specificity of the two-hybrid assay using EGY48 yeast strain (Matα trp1 ura3–52 leu2::pLeu2-lexAop6(ΔG-UAS leu2)). Yeast cotransformation was performed by the lithium acetate method provided by the manufacturer (Clontech). In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-TH1, its GST-fused deletion mutants, and A-Raf protein prepared as pcDNA3 constructs were used to generate [35S]methionine-labeled proteins individually with the TNT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A GST pull-down assay was performed as described previously (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 231: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 59Zhang S. Cai M. Zhang S. Xu S.

In brief, the labeled proteins were addressed immediately by constant mixing with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 3 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by autoradiography after they were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. In Vivo Binding Assay—The COS-1 and HEK293 cells in 60-mm dishes (Nunc) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3.1-myc-TH1 plasmid alone or with the combination of 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-Ras and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-Src. Total DNA was kept constant by pcDNA3.1-myc-his empty vector. 48 h after transfection, the cells were starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum medium for 18 h and then stimulated by the readdition of serum. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (4Yin X.L. Chen S. Gu J.X. Mol. Cell.

In brief, ∼500 μg of cell lysates was incubated with mouse normal IgG or 2 μg of anti-myc monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The preequilibrated protein G-agarose beads were then added. After 2 h of incubation, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed gently three times with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

https://openalex.org/W2051968643,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1/HIF-2) govern the expression of critical genes for cellular adaptation to low oxygen tensions. We have previously reported that the intracellular level of phosphatidic acid (PA) rises in response to hypoxia (1% O2). In this report, we have explored whether components of the canonical HIF/von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathway are involved in the induction of PA. We found that hypoxia induces PA in a cell line constitutively expressing a stable version of HIF-1α. PA induction was also found in HIF-1α- and 2α-negative CHO Ka13 cells, as well as in HIF-β-negative HepaC4 cells. These data indicate that HIF activity is neither sufficient nor necessary for oxygen-dependent PA accumulation. PA generation was also detected in cells deficient for the tumor suppressor VHL, indicating that the presence of VHL was not required for the induction of PA. Here we show that PA accumulation also occurs at moderate hypoxia (5% O2), although to a lesser extent to that seen at 1% O2, revealing that PA is induced at the same hypoxia range required to activate HIF-1. Prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) and asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH) belong to the iron (II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family and have been proposed as oxygen sensors involved in the regulation of HIFs. Chemical inhibition of these activities by treatment with iron chelators or 2-oxoglutarate analogs also results in a marked PA accumulation similar to that observed in hypoxia. Together these data show that PA accumulation in response to hypoxia is both HIF-1/2- and VHL-independent and indicate a role of iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases in the oxygen-sensing mechanisms involved in hypoxia-driven phospholipid regulation.

HIFs are heterodimers composed of α and β subunits, which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix PAS (Per, Arnt, Sim) family of transcription factors (8Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). The β subunit, also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, ARNT, is constitutively expressed, while the α subunit is tightly oxygen-regulated. There are three types of α subunits, HIF-1α, HIF-2α (endothelial PAS domain; EPAS), and HIF-3α (9Gu Y.Z. Moran S.M. Hogenesch J.B. Wartman L. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by different genes. In normoxia, the α subunits of HIF are very unstable proteins since they interact with the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) (10Kaelin W.G.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), which is a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (11Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J.

VHL recognizes HIF α subunits through two independent sites that contain the common motif LXXLAP present in both HIF-1α and HIF-2α (12Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated that hydroxylation of specific proline residues (underlined) into this conserved box is required for the interaction of VHL with HIFs (14Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 15Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I.

A novel family of mammalian proline hydroxylases: PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, which belong to the iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, have been involved in the hydroxylation of HIF proline residues (14Ivan M.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). In the absence of oxygen, these post-translational modifications do not occur; pVHL cannot recognize HIF α subunits and as a consequence, HIF is acutely induced. Thus, under hypoxia, HIFα proteins are accumulated, migrate to the nucleus, associate with β subunits, and lead to the subsequent formation of the HIF-1α/β and HIF-2 α/β heterodimers that bind to DNA at the specific HRE (hypoxia response elements) of different genes (18Wenger R.H. Faseb J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). More recently it has been reported that hypoxia-dependent transactivation activity of HIFs is controlled by hydroxylation of an asparaginyl residue in the C-terminal transactivation domain. FIH has been identified as the asparaginyl hydroxylase involved in this hydroxylation (19Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. White M.F. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 20Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Therefore PHDs and FIH have been named as HIF hydroxylases and have been proposed as the oxygen sensors that control HIF activity (21Safran M. Kaelin W.G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Masson N. Ratcliffe P.J. J.

Bell R.M. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid (PA) has been proposed as one of these intracellular second messengers (25Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R.

Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that hypoxia (1% O2) leads to an increase in the intracellular PA level, most probably through the action of a DGK activity (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S.

In this work we have characterized the oxygen-dependent mechanisms involved in the generation of PA induced after oxygen deprivation. Here we show that hypoxia-dependent PA accumulation does not require the activity of HIF-1 nor HIF-2 transcription factors or that of VHL. Moreover, we also provide evidence for the role of iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase in oxygen mechanisms involved in PA generation by low oxygen tension.

All the cells were cultured in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Labtech International Ltd., Woodside, UK). Cells were routinely cultured in 95% air, 5% CO2 (normoxic conditions) at 37 °C. To expose cells to hypoxia, they were placed into an airtight chamber with inflow and outflow valves that were infused with a mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 (S. E. Carburos Metalicos S. A., Madrid, Spain) or placed in an in vivo 400 hypoxia workstation (Ruskinn Technology, West Yorkshire, UK). In all experiments, cells were plated at 70-90% confluence, and when completely attached they were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia. In those experiments in which inhibitors were used, these compound were added 30 min before other treatments. Measurement of [32P] Phosphatidic Acid—Cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium supplemented or not with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (extensively dialyzed against 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) for 90 min before the addition of [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for an additional 90 min. Thereafter, the cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia. Phospholipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (39Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and analyzed as previously described (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S. San Juan M.A. Alfranca A. Vidal F. Vara A. Merida I.

Transfections were performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). 7-8 h after transfection cells were split into the appropriate number of wells (35-mm plates). After 12 h of expression, the cells were incubated under either normoxic or hypoxic 1% O2 conditions for 5-6 h. Finally, cells were harvested and Western blot assays as well as luciferase assays were performed in each case. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using a dual luciferase system (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was normalized based on the Renilla luciferase activity. Western Blotting—Proteins from total cell lysates were resolved using 8-10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with a digital luminescent image analyzer (FUJIFILM LAS-1000 CH). PA Generation Induced by Hypoxia Is HIF-1/2-independent—We have previously reported that hypoxia (1% O2) induces PA accumulation in different cell types (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S. San Juan M.A. Alfranca A. Vidal F. Vara A. Merida I. Landazuri M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10548-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that low oxygen tension induces both PA accumulation and HIF-1α protein stabilization raised the possibility that the intracellular PA increment depends on HIF activation after exposure to hypoxia. To assess this possibility, we used the 786-O-PP13 clone, which constitutively expresses HIF-1α protein. These cells derive from the wild-type 786-O, that express HIF-2 but not HIF-1α (Fig. 1, top panel), by stable transfection of a mutated version of HIF-1 at the 402 and 564 proline residues. This construct is constitutively stabilized, because it cannot be hydroxylated by HIF hydroxylases, and therefore VHL cannot recognize this protein. This clone expresses HIF-dependent genes despite the oxygen concentrations (40Del Peso L. Castellanos M.C. Temes E. MartínPuig S. Cuevas Y. Olmos G. Landazuri M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48690-48695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To rule out whether this cell line has constitutively elevated PA levels, we analyzed PA content in these cells. We found that 786-O as well as the mutated version 786-O-PP13 had similar PA basal levels (data not shown), and both were able to induce PA in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1, bottom panel). From these results we can conclude that HIF-1α stabilization per se is not sufficient to trigger PA accumulation. To further study whether PA induction depends on HIF activity, we decided to use the previously described CHO 4.5 cell line, that does not express HIF-2α and the CHO Ka13, obtained from CHO 4.5 by mutagenesis and which also lacks HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2B, top panel). Therefore CHO Ka13 cells do not exhibit inducible HRE-dependent transcriptional activity (38Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the oxygen mechanisms involved in the activation of HIF are functional in these cells, since an exogenously transfected HIF-1α subunit is regulated by hypoxia (Fig. 2A, top panel) and is able to drive the transcription of an HRE-linked reporter plasmid (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Importantly, we found that exposure of the Ka13, as well as the parental cell line 4.5, to hypoxia (1% O2) results in an increase in the level of PA (Fig. 2B) despite the lack of HIF-1/2. In addition, we also utilized the widely used HepaC4 cells, that do not express a functional HIFβ subunit, in contrast to the parental HepaC1 cells, and as a consequence, HIF proteins are not able to transactivate target genes (41Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42Maxwell P.H. Dachs G.U. Gleadle J.M.

Here we found that PA was also induced in response to hypoxia in both cell lines (Fig. 2C). Together all the data indicated that neither HIF-1 nor HIF-2 factors are necessary for PA accumulation by hypoxia. VHL Function Is Not Required for PA Induction in Response to Hypoxia—Since VHL plays a critical role in the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway, we investigated its role in hypoxia-mediated PA elevation. For this purpose, we used the previously described UMRC (36Ivanov S.V. Kuzmin I. Wey M.H. Pack S. Geil L. Johnson B.E. Stanbridge E.J. Lerman M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12596-12601Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and 786-O (37Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin W.G. Nat.

The major HIF isoform expressed by UMRC cells is 1α, whereas the 786-O cell line expresses mainly HIF-2α (data not shown). The absence of VHL results in a constitutive accumulation of HIF factors in normoxia (13Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R.

Interestingly, we found a significant intracellular PA induction by hypoxia in both cell lines regardless of the presence or absence of VHL (Fig. 3, B and D). These results indicate that the presence of VHL is not necessary for hypoxia-dependent PA accumulation. It is important to note that in the case of UMRC6 VHL (-) cells, which exhibit HIF-1α protein that is completely stabilized (Fig. 3C), the PA basal level was significantly lower than that in UMRC3.4 VHL (+) cells (Fig. 3D). These data support our observation above, suggesting that HIF activation is neither sufficient nor necessary for hypoxia-induced PA accumulation. Taken together the experiments described so far indicate that neither HIF-1/2 nor VHL are involved in the induction of PA triggered by hypoxia. PA Accumulation Is Induced by Moderate Hypoxia—Since we have observed PA accumulation at hypoxia (1% O2) and we and other investigators (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S. San Juan M.A. Alfranca A.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could observe HIF-1α stabilization at conditions ranging from 1 to 5% O2, (Fig. 4, top panels), we decided to analyze whether hypoxia-induced PA accumulation also occurred at this range of oxygen tension. For this purpose, we exposed [32P]orthophosphate metabolically labeled 293-T and HeLa cells to 1 and 5% oxygen concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4 (bottom panels), the accumulation of PA was detected under both hypoxic conditions in both cell lines. Importantly, we found that there was a good correlation between the levels of HIF and PA induced by different degrees of hypoxia, 1% O2 giving a greater accumulation of PA (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the oxygen-sensing mechanisms controlling HIF could be involved in hypoxia-induced PA generation. Inhibition of Iron (II)-2-Oxoglutarate-dependent Dioxygenases Induces PA Accumulation—HIF proline hydroxylases (PHDs) and HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH) are iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases previously proposed to act as oxygen sensors that directly govern HIF activity (14Ivan M.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). The similar oxygen dependence of PA induction and HIF-1α protein stabilization, led us to ask whether cellular iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity could function to regulate hypoxia-induced PA accumulation. First, we measured the intracellular PA level in the presence of the iron chelator agent deferoxamine (Df) and the transition metal cobalt chloride (CoCl2), which are widely used as HIF activators. Both compounds are potent inhibitors of PHD and FIH because of the iron requirement of these enzymatic activities (21Safran M. Kaelin W.G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Masson N. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As it is shown in Fig. 5, the treatment of 293-T cells with these agents, at the same concentration required to accumulate HIF-1α (top panel), was able to elevate the intracellular level of PA (bottom panel). These results indicate that these compounds mimic hypoxia not only by their positive effect upon HIF-1α expression, but also by increasing the level of intracellular PA. In addition to iron and oxygen, the above mentioned family of dioxygenases also requires 2-oxoglutarate to catalyze the hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, to further investigate the possible role of these enzymes in PA accumulation, we used a series of structurally distinct 2-oxoglutarate analogs previously described. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of 293-T cells with dimethyl oxalylglycine (DMOG) (16Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I.

Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), increased HIF-1α protein levels (top panel), and the same doses induced PA accumulation (bottom panel). To support these data we also used the known dioxygenases inhibitors L-mim (44McCaffrey T.A. Pomerantz K.B. Sanborn T.A. Spokojny A.M. Du B. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Lamberg A. Kivirikko K.I. Falcone D.J. Mehta S. Hanauske-Abel H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and 3,4-DHB (45Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7819-7823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been recently described that exposure of cells to these compounds induces HIF-1α protein since they are 2-oxoglutarate analogs (46Warnecke C. Griethe W. Weidemann A. Jurgensen J.S. Willam C. Bachmann S. Ivashchenko Y. Wagner I. Frei U. Wiesener M. Eckardt K.U. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 293-T cells treated with 3,4 DHB or L-mim stabilized the HIF-1α subunit in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and C, top panels). Importantly, a parallel increase in the PA level was also observed (Fig. 6, B and C, bottom panels). Therefore we conclude that chemical inhibition of iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity mimic hypoxia-driven PA generation. These findings and the fact that the generation of PA occurs at the same oxygen tensions that activate HIF-1 (see Fig. 4), led us to propose that HIF hydroxylases or other iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases with similar oxygen sensitivity are involved in PA accumulation after oxygen deprivation. We have previously reported that hypoxia-induced PA accumulation is involved in HIF-1 expression (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S. San Juan M.A. Alfranca A. Vidal F. Vara A. Merida I. Landazuri M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10548-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This fact led us to hypothesize that oxygen-sensing mechanisms involved in PA accumulation are upstream and independent of HIF-1 activation. Here we have probed our speculation using different approaches. First we found that the expression of a stably version of HIF-1α (786-O-PP13) did not trigger PA induction. Second, the PA increase occurred in the absence of HIF-1 and HIF-2 activity in Ka13 cells as well as in Hepa C4. Third, in VHL-negative cells, which have constitutive HIF activity, we did not observe a constitutively elevated PA level. Moreover, unlike HIF, PA was induced by hypoxia in VHL-deficient cells. These data reveal the existence of HIF-1/2- and VHL-independent mechanisms involved in PA generation upon cellular exposure to hypoxia. Our findings are in agreement with previous reports indicating the existence of several hypoxia-induced processes that are HIF-independent. Some of these events are the hypoxia-driven induction of heme oxygenase-1 expression (38Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol.

Eur J Biochem. 2003; 270: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because of the existence of these HIF-independent mechanisms in response to hypoxia and the role of PA as intracellular second messenger, our data raise the question of whether hypoxia-induced PA accumulation may have a role, not only on HIF-1α activation (35Aragones J. Jones D.R. Martin S. San Juan M.A. Alfranca A. Vidal F. Vara A. Merida I. Landazuri M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10548-10555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but also on other HIF-independent processes triggered by hypoxia. Particularly interesting cases are mTOR and Raf-1, previously identified as intracellular targets of PA. In this regard it has been reported that PA generation upon mitogen stimulation plays a role in the regulation of these two intracellular kinases (31Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh S. Moore S. Bell R.M. Dush M. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). There are several reports indicating the regulation of mTOR activity in response to hypoxia (50Arsham A.M. Howell J.J. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29655-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 54Humar R.K.F. Berns H. Resink T.J. Battegay E.J.

Cell. 2002; 22: 7004-7014Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The possibility that hypoxia-induced PA generation could be involved in the regulation of mTOR should be considered. Moreover Raf-1 has been described to be activated by hypoxia in endothelial cells (56Jung F. Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Reissner A. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility that PA could also be mediating this induction. Therefore future experiments will be designed to answer the question of whether PA generated in hypoxia constitutes a key intracellular regulator of certain hypoxia-induced processes. Because the most therapeutic approaches against pathological hypoxia are focused in HIF, the study and characterization of parallel and independent pathways will be of great interest. HIF hydroxylases (PHDs and FIH) have been proposed as oxygen sensors involved in the regulation of HIF transcription factors (21Safran M. Kaelin W.G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Masson N. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The use of previously recognized inhibitors of these dioxygenase activities result in a strong induction of HIFs (16Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J.

Wiesener M. Eckardt K.U. Faseb J. 2003; 17: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here we found that cellular exposure to variable doses of these inhibitors are able to induce HIFs and also resulted in marked PA generation. These data suggest that hypoxia and subsequent inhibition of hydroxylase activity could lead to PA accumulation. In addition, the fact that PA is tightly modulated by oxygen tension (see Fig. 4), suggests that one possible candidate to account for this PA accumulation could be HIF hydroxylases (PHD and/or FIH), since they are much more sensitive to small changes in O2 than other iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (57Hirsila M. Koivunen P. Gunzler V. Kivirikko K. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, our results do not exclude the possibility that other members of the iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases family, different from PHD or FIH, could be involved in PA induction by hypoxia. Further analysis is required to fully determine the involvement of these enzymatic activities on PA generation by hypoxia. Our data also suggest that the cellular mechanisms involved in hypoxia-induced PA generation are putative new targets for iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. We could therefore suggest that enzymatic activities involved in PA metabolism could be regulated by these novel post-translational modifications. This possibility could extend the range of effects mediated by iron (II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases after exposure to hypoxia in an HIF-independent manner. Our results indicate that cellular hypoxia is not totally orchestrated by HIF transcription factors and lead us to hypothesize, for the first time, the existence of new targets for this novel family of dioxygenases that control PA generation in response to low oxygen tension.

https://openalex.org/W2079965937,"Cyclosporin A (CSA) is an immunosuppressor used in organ transplantation. A recent proteomic analysis has revealed that activation of T cells in the presence of CSA induces the synthesis of hundreds of new proteins. Here we used representational difference analysis to characterize some of the corresponding induced genes. After cDNA bank screening we focused on one of these genes, which we named CSA-conditional, T cell activation-dependent (CSTAD) gene. This gene produces two mRNAs resulting from alternative splicing events. They encode two proteins of 104 and 141 amino acids, CSTADp-S and CSTADp-L, for the short and long forms, respectively. FK506 had the same effect as CSA, whereas rapamycin did not affect the level of CSTAD gene expression, demonstrating that inhibition of the calcineurin activation pathway is involved in CSTAD gene up-regulation. CSA also led to overexpression of CSTAD in mice immunized in the presence of CSA, confirming the in vitro analysis. Microscopic and cytofluorimetric analysis of cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged CSTADp-L and CSTADp-S showed that both proteins colocalize with mitochondrial markers and depolarize the mitochondrial transmembrane potential without causing release of cytochrome c, apoptosis, or necrosis. Both CSTADp isoforms are sensitive to proteinase K, implying that they are located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. These data reveal a new mechanism of action for CSA, which involves up-regulation of a gene whose products are sorted to mitochondria and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane.

These data reveal a new mechanism of action for CSA, which involves up-regulation of a gene whose products are sorted to mitochondria and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane. T cell activation and proliferation result in a large reshuffling of the gene transcription program; many genes become activated, whereas others are silenced (1Teague T.K. Hildeman D. Kedl R.M.

This process is highly coordinated to ensure the acquisition of optimal effector functions and cell survival (2Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Genes encoding different proto-oncogenes are induced immediately, whereas genes encoding cell growth and differentiation factors are induced later; finally, genes involved in cell division are transcribed at even later times. T cell proliferation can be prevented by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CSA), 1The abbreviations used are: CSA, cyclosporin A; CSTAD, CSA conditional, T cell activation-dependent gene; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; RDA, representational differences analysis; EDG-1, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ConA, concanavalin A; IL, interleukin; RT, reverse transcription; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel.1The abbreviations used are: CSA, cyclosporin A; CSTAD, CSA conditional, T cell activation-dependent gene; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; RDA, representational differences analysis; EDG-1, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ConA, concanavalin A; IL, interleukin; RT, reverse transcription; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel. a molecule successfully used in clinics to prevent graft rejection. CSA interferes with T cell proliferation by blocking the transcription of a set of genes encoding growth and differentiation factors (for review, see Refs. 2Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar and 3Rao A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transcription of these genes is regulated by a Ca2+-dependent pathway involving the activation of calcineurin. This serine phosphatase stimulates dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (4Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated NFAT migrates to the nucleus where in conjunction with AP-1 it activates IL-2 gene transcription (5Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). CSA binds to various members of the cyclophilin protein family and forms a complex with calcineurin, preventing its activation. Thus dephosphorylation of NFAT is prevented, IL-2 is not produced, and T cells do not proliferate (6Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 7Jain J.N. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). However, other biochemical pathways such as the Ras/Raf pathway responsible for AP-1 formation are not affected by CSA (8Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Finally, the stability of AP-1, a factor expressed transiently during activation, is increased in T cells activated in the presence of CSA (10Bemer V. Truffa-Bachi P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).CSA therapy does not induce tolerance toward graft antigens, and discontinuation of therapy is associated with graft loss due to rejection. Thus, patients need to be treated with the immunosuppressor during their entire life span. Deleterious effects such as nephrotoxicity, hypertension, symptomatic hyper uricemy, and hyperlipidemia are associated with this treatment. More damaging, CSA-treated patients display an increased incidence of lympho-proliferative disorders and skin cancers, a common and dreaded complication (11Thiel G. Bock A. Spondlin M. Brunner F.P. Mihatsch M. Rufli T. Landmann J. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 2493-2498PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stewart T. Tsai S.C. Grayson H. Henderson R. Opelz G. Lancet. 1995; 346: 796-798Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). Different reports suggest that therapy with immunosuppressors can specifically stimulate the transcription of genes that may contribute to the onset of complications arising from therapy. In particular, CSA increases transcription of the transforming growth factor β gene, suggesting that CSA may induce tumors in part due to overexpression of this immunosuppressive cytokine (13Hojo M. Morimoto T. Maluccio M. Asano T. Morimoto K. Lagman M. Shimbo T. Suthanthiran M. Nature. 1999; 397: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 14Khanna A.K. Cairns V.R. Becker C.G. Hosenpud J.D. Transplant. 1999; 67: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The finding that CSA up-regulates gene expression in cells from different tissues irrespective of their activation state suggests that calcineurin may be the ubiquitous target, which could then affect gene expression either negatively or positively.The effects of CSA on gene up-regulation were extended recently by a proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins in T cells activated in the absence or presence of CSA (15Mascarell L. Frey H. Michel F. Lefkovits I. Truffa-Bachi P. Transplant. 2000; 70: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Remarkably, more than 100 proteins that are not found in resting or activated T cells were induced when stimulation was carried out in the presence of CSA. To identify the corresponding genes, we have now performed representational difference analyses (RDA) under the same conditions. Among the up-regulated genes we have identified a gene that we have named CSTAD, for CSA-conditional, T cell activation-dependent gene. CSTAD encodes two proteins of 104 and 141 amino acids that are localized in mitochondria. Although overexpression of the short isoform perturbs mitochondrial morphology and depolarizes the inner mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c was not released, and cells did not undergo apoptosis nor necrosis. Finally, CSTAD up-regulation is also observed in mice immunized in the presence of CSA, suggesting that the phenomenon of CSA-induced gene up-regulation may be implicated in some of the deleterious effects of CSA treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice and Immunization—Five- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were obtained from IFFA-CREDO (L’Arbresle, France).

FK506 was a gift from Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. (Deerfield, IL). Rapamycin and DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2.)octane) were purchased from Sigma. For immunizations, CSA was mixed in olive oil (10 mg/ml) and kept at room temperature. CSA (2 mg) was administered intraperitoneally 1 day before and concomitantly with peptide injection (150 μg intravenously in the tail). A control group of mice received the peptide alone, and another group received olive oil alone.T Cell Activation—T cells were purified as previously described (10Bemer V. Truffa-Bachi P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, spleen cells (4 × 108/ml) were incubated with 75 μg of wheat germ agglutinin for 10 min and loaded on top of a tube containing 8 ml of balanced salt solution containing 50% fetal calf serum. Twenty minutes later non-agglutinated T cells were recovered from the top of the tube, centrifuged, and incubated with 0.2 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Sigma) for 5 min to remove excess WGA. After 2 washes, the purity of the T cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (90–95% of the recovered cells were CD3+). The T cell-enriched fraction responds to ConA-stimulation similarly to the unfractionated cells. Cells were cultured in 2 ml (2 × 106 cells/ml) in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640, Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 × 10-5 m 2-mercaptoethanol. Two μg/ml ConA (Sigma) were added at the beginning of the culture. CSA (1 μg/ml), FK506 (0.1 μg/ml), or rapamycin (0.1 μg/ml) were added to one group of cells. Non-activated cells and CSA-treated non-activated cells were cultured for comparison. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and recovered at different times.cDNA Synthesis and RDA—Cells were collected at 4 and 24 h Quick-Prep® micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was obtained with the Superscript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). Testers were prepared from 3 μg of mRNA of ConA-activated CSA-treated T cells obtained after 4- and 24-h cultures. The driver was prepared from 3 μg of mRNA of ConA-activated T cells (4 and 24 h) and non-activated spleen cells. RDA was performed as described previously (17Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 18Frazer J.K. Pascual V. Capra J.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 207: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After three cycles of subtraction and amplification, subtraction products were digested by DpnII and cloned into the BamHI site of pUC18 plasmid. The cloned cDNA fragments were sequenced with M13–20 primer using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then processed on a 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the BLASTN program and the NCBI GenBank™ data base.Analysis of the CSTAD Clone—The 5′ end of the CSTAD cDNA clone was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using total RNA of ConA-activated CSA-treated thymocytes. The PCR was performed with gene-specific primers in combination with the supplied GeneRacer 5′ primer. The rapid amplification of cDNA ends product was gel-purified, cloned with TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then sequenced. The 3′ end of the cDNA was determined by homology analysis using the GenBank™ data base. The complete sequence of the CSTAD clone was confirmed by sequencing the UUGC1M0246K22F genomic clone obtained from Dr. D. Dunn (University of Utah Genome Center, Salt Lake City, UT). Genomic organization was determined by analysis of nucleotide sequences in the mouse genome data base.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues, purified T cells were isolated by the acid guanidinium method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using random hexanucleotide primers. The PCR primers are: β-actin, 5′-CACGATTTCCCTCTCAGC and 5′-GCACCACACCTTCTACAA; IL-2, 5′-TGCTGACTCATCATCGA and 5′-AGGATGGAGAATTACAG; synaptotagmine-2-like, 5′-GGGTCATTTTAGCCAAAGC and 5′-CAAACAAAACCCAAACAAA; α-E-integrin, 5′-TGCAGTTCATGACCAGGACA and 5′-AGCTGACCACCAACATCTCCC; EDG-1, 5′-CTGCTGGGCCCCTCTCTTCA and 5′-CGGCGCATCTCCTTGTTGGT; CSTAD-L, 5′-ATGGGCACGCTTGTGTCA; CSTAD-C, 5′-TGAGCCAGGTCACCCAAGAGATG; CSTAD-S, 5′-GCCCGGAGAAACTGCTGAGAT.PCR was performed for 30–40 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s). After electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel the PCR products were visualized using a Vilber Lourmet transilluminator and the Biocapt program.Real-time PCR to Monitor Gene Expression—The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by real-time PCR using the above-mentioned primers. Total RNA was isolated, and cDNA was synthesized as described above. Real-time PCR was conducted with a SYBR green kit (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK) according to the manufacturer’s specifications using 3 mm MgCl2 and 50 pmol of primer per reaction. The amount of each gene was normalized to a housekeeping gene (β-actin).Plasmids, Transfections, and Fluorescence Microscopy—Plasmid constructs of full-length CSTAD-short and CSTAD-long fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA were generated by cloning PCR products of the CSTAD genes in-frame with GFP into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human fibrosarcoma 11.1 (U1A) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were plated at 5 × 104 on glass coverslips in 24-well plates 16 h before transient transfection. Transient transfections using 2 μg of plasmid per well were performed by calcium phosphate (125 mm). GFP fluorescence was monitored 24 h after transfection. Mitochondrial localization was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using MitoTracker or monoclonal antibodies against mouse cytochrome c or hsp-60. MitoTracker was added at 100 nm before cell fixation, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells that had not been treated with MitoTracker were incubated with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Hsp monoclonal antibodies and revealed with Texas Red-coupled anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies. For cytochrome c detection, permeabilization was carried out using 0.05% saponin as previously described (20Roumier A. Olivo-Marin J.C. Arpin M. Michel F. Martin M. Mangeat P. Acuto O. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 715-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For HSP-60 detection, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% SDS as described (20Roumier A. Olivo-Marin J.C. Arpin M. Michel F. Martin M. Mangeat P. Acuto O. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 715-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol mounting medium and 2.5% DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2.)octane). Confocal microscopy analysis was carried out using a Zeiss LSM-510 microscope and software. Z-series optical sections were performed at 0.5-μm increments. Green and red fluorescence emissions were collected separately to avoid fluorescence passage from one channel to the other.Cytofluorimetry Analysis of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential and Cytochrome c Release—To measure changes in transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), 11.1 (U1A) cells were first transfected with the C-terminal GFP constructs of CSTAD-S and CSTAD-L. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were loaded with 150 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 37 °C. After the loading period the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 15 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin at room temperature. The ΔΨ of cells was measured by cytofluorimetry (FL3), and GFP-positive cells were identified simultaneously on FL1. As a positive control for membrane depolarization, cells were incubated with 1 μm staurosporine overnight.Cytochrome c release was determined by cytofluorimetry using antibodies against cytochrome c, as previously described (21Bellosillo B. Villamor N. Lopez-Guillermo A. Marce S. Bosch F. Campo E. Montserrat E. Colomer D. Blood. 2002; 100: 1810-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell death was measured by cytofluorimetry after double-staining cells with propidium iodide and annexin V (22Perfettini J.L. Gissot M. Souque P. Ojcius D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); both adherent cells and cells in suspension were collected for analysis.Subcellular Fractionation—The cells used in these studies, 293 T cells, are derived from a human renal epithelial cell line that was transfected by an adenovirus E1A gene product. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish the day before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with 15 μg of plasmid per dish using calcium phosphate. Two days after transfection the cells were collected, resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (MB: 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), and lysed by 30–40 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was divided into nine aliquots and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain mitochondria-enriched pellets. The pellets were resuspended in MB supplemented with or without 1% Triton X-100 and treated with proteinase K (1–10 μg/ml) on ice for 30 min. After boiling for 10 min in the presence of SDS loading buffer, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Western Blot Analyses—The mitochondrial fractions were used for detection of VDAC, CSTAD-GFP fusion protein, and cytochrome c. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C. Blots were immunostained with rabbit anti-VDAC polyclonal antibodies (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) at a 1:2,000 dilution, rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Oncogene) at 1:2,000 dilution, and mouse anticytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) at 1:500 dilution at 4 °C overnight and probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Specific bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).RESULTSCSA Treatment Alters the Transcription of Genes in Activated T Cells—Two RDAs were performed on T cells activated for 4 and 24 h by ConA in the presence or absence of CSA, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fifty clones from each RDA were sequenced; readable nucleotide sequences were obtained for 30 and 23 clones for the 4-h and the 24-h incubations, respectively, and the sequences were analyzed using the BLASTN program and the GenBank™ data base. Primers specific for the clones obtained were designed using the Oligo® program (NBI). The effect of CSA on the level of expression of these genes was tested by RT-PCR on splenic T cells activated with ConA for 4 and 24 h in the presence or absence of CSA. Non-activated cells and cells cultured in the presence of CSA alone served as controls. Fig. 1 shows the level of mRNA accumulation for the four genes whose expression had been altered by the immunosuppressor, as detected by RDA. As expected, induction of the IL-2 gene was prevented by the immunosuppressor (10Bemer V. Truffa-Bachi P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), attesting to the effectiveness of the CSA treatment. Incubation of cells with CSA alone had no effect on IL-2 gene expression but strongly increased the accumulation of mRNA encoding EDG-1 and α-E-integrin (Fig. 1).Expression of the synaptotagmin-2-like gene was barely detected in resting T cells, and its level was barely modified by T cell activation. In contrast, gene expression was up-regulated when activation was carried out in the presence of CSA (Fig. 1). The mRNA encoding the gene that we have named CSA-conditional, T cell activation-dependent (CSTAD) was detected in non-activated T cells, but activation did not modify its amount. However, activation in the presence of CSA resulted in a large increase in the mRNA levels (Fig. 1). We, therefore, focused subsequently on the characterization of the products of this gene.Genomic Localization and Tissue Distribution of CSTAD— Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed to obtain the complete sequence of the CSTAD cDNA, revealing a sequence of 901 nucleotides. Alignment analyses with the GenBank™ data base showed that the CSTAD cDNA shares 785 nucleotides at the 3′ end with a Riken cDNA clone of 816 bases encoding a gene with unknown function located on mouse chromosome 2 (GenBank™ accession number AK020589; Gene ID, ENSMUSESTG00000040463). However, the two cDNAs differ in their 5′ end region by a stretch of 31 nucleotides, which are unique to the Riken clone, and by a sequence of 116 bases that are present exclusively in the CSTAD cDNA. The localization of the CSTAD cDNAs was determined from GenBank™ data base analysis (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Organization of the CSTAD gene. A, organization of the CSTAD gene as derived from the alignment of the sequences of the CSTAD and Riken (AK020589) clones with the mouse Gen-Bank™ data base. The position of the primers used for the amplification of the CSTAD-L and -S isoforms is indicated by the arrows. B, unique and shared nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the short and long isoforms. The specific primer sequences are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two exons had been defined in the Riken clone. The coding sequences and the translation products are represented in Fig. 2B. The Riken and CSTAD cDNAs, thus, represent two alternative splice variants of the CSTAD gene. We named them CSTAD-S (identified by Riken) for the short and CSTAD-L (identified by RDA) for the long isoform, respectively. These cDNA encode two proteins of 104 (CSTADp-S) and 141 amino acids (CSTADp-L).Up-regulation of the CSTAD gene could change the expression level of both the long and short CSTAD forms. This was assessed by PCR using the specific primers shown in Fig. 2A. Both CSTAD-L and CSTAD-S mRNAs increased in T cells activated for 4 and 24 h in the presence of CSA (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Estimation of CSTAD-L and CSTAD-S mRNA accumulation by real-time PCR. A, cells activated in the presence or absence of CSA, as described in the legend of Fig. 1, were collected at 4 and 24 h. After T cell purification RNA was prepared, and PCR was performed with primers specific for CSTAD-L and CSTAD-S cDNA, as described under “Material and Methods.” Gels and analyses were performed as indicated in the legend of Fig. 1. The data are representative of four independent experiments. B, real-time PCR using primers specific for each CSTAD isoform was performed as described under “Material and Methods” on the experimental groups described above. The results are expressed as fold increase of the CSTAD-L and -S isoforms in non-activated (NA) or activated T cells (ConA) or in T cells activated in the presence of CSA (ConA+CSA) or in T cells cultured in the presence of CSA (CSA). The data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Real-time PCR was used to quantify the amount of both mRNAs (Fig. 3B). The data are presented as the ratio of the amount of CSTAD-L and -S in T cells activated in the presence of CSA to the amount of mRNA for the other experimental groups. The ratio of CSTAD-L and -S in CSA-treated cells versus non-activated cells is also shown. Both the CSTAD-L and CSTAD-S isoforms increased by a factor of 4–5 at 4 h compared with T cells activated by ConA. Similar increases were found for the other conditions (Fig. 3). At 24 h CSTAD increased by a factor of 10–13 compared with ConA-activated T cells. However, the absolute amount of the CSTAD isoforms decreased at 24 h (Fig. 3, panel A).We next investigated the tissue distribution of the two alternative splice variants of CSTAD. All tissues tested positive for the two alternative splice variants, but the relative expression of the isoforms varied considerably. CSTAD-L is abundant in the intestines, thymus, and skin (Fig. 4), whereas CSTAD-S is highly represented in the skin but is less abundant in the thymus and is barely detectable in the intestines.Fig. 4Tissue distribution of the CSTAD-L and -S isoforms. RNA was prepared from different tissues as described under “Materials and Methods.” PCR was performed using primers specific for the long and short isoforms. The amplified material was resolved by gel electrophoresis, and the images were collected using a Vilber Lourmet transilluminator. The data are representative of three independent experiments. β-Actin served as an internal standard for the quality and quantity of the mRNA preparation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CSA Treatment during Immunization Increases the Expression of CSTAD in Mice—Because a polyclonal activator induced CSTAD overexpression in vitro, we next evaluated whether CSTAD expression may change during physiological conditions in vivo. For this purpose we used transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor specific for the pigeon cytochrom"
