https://openalex.org/W2113626726,"Numerous collecting expeditions of Theobroma cacao L. germplasm have been undertaken in Latin-America. However, most of this germplasm has not contributed to cacao improvement because its relationship to cultivated selections was poorly understood. Germplasm labeling errors have impeded breeding and confounded the interpretation of diversity analyses. To improve the understanding of the origin, classification, and population differentiation within the species, 1241 accessions covering a large geographic sampling were genotyped with 106 microsatellite markers. After discarding mislabeled samples, 10 genetic clusters, as opposed to the two genetic groups traditionally recognized within T. cacao, were found by applying Bayesian statistics. This leads us to propose a new classification of the cacao germplasm that will enhance its management. The results also provide new insights into the diversification of Amazon species in general, with the pattern of differentiation of the populations studied supporting the palaeoarches hypothesis of species diversification. The origin of the traditional cacao cultivars is also enlightened in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2007143913,"Nrf1 is a member of the vertebrate Cap'n'Collar (CNC) transcription factor family that commonly contains a unique basic-leucine zipper domain. Among CNC family members, Nrf2 is known to regulate a battery of antioxidant and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme genes through the antioxidant response element (ARE). Although Nrf1 has also been shown to bind the ARE, it is unclear whether it plays a distinct role from Nrf2 in regulating genes with this element. To address this issue <i>in vivo</i>, we generated mice bearing a hepatocyte-specific disruption of the <i>Nrf1</i> gene. Although<i>Nrf2</i> knock-out mice did not exhibit liver damage when they were maintained in an unstressed condition, hepatocyte-specific deletion of Nrf1 caused liver damage resembling the human disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Gene expression analysis revealed that the disruption of Nrf1 causes stress that activates a number of ARE-driven genes in an Nrf2-dependent manner, indicating that Nrf2 cannot compensate completely for loss of Nrf1 function in the liver. In contrast, expression of metallothionein-1 and -2 (<i>MT1</i> and <i>MT2</i>) genes, each of which harbors at least one ARE in its regulatory region, was decreased in the <i>Nrf1</i>-null mutant mice. Whereas Nrf1 and Nrf2 bound the <i>MT1</i> ARE with comparable affinity, Nrf1 preferentially activated the reporter gene expression through the <i>MT1</i> ARE. This study has, thus, identified the first ARE-dependent gene that relies exclusively on Nrf1, suggesting that it plays a distinct functional role in regulating ARE-driven genes."
https://openalex.org/W1966552488,"Maternal overweight and obesity in pregnancy often result in fetal overgrowth, which increases the risk for the baby to develop metabolic syndrome later in life. However, the mechanisms underlying fetal overgrowth are not established. We developed a mouse model and hypothesized that a maternal high-fat (HF) diet causes up-regulation of placental nutrient transport, resulting in fetal overgrowth. C57BL/6J female mice were fed a control (11% energy from fat) or HF (32% energy from fat) diet for 8 wk before mating and throughout gestation and were studied at embryonic day 18.5. The HF diet increased maternal adiposity, as assessed by fat pad weight, and circulating maternal leptin, decreased serum adiponectin concentrations, and caused a marked increase in fetal growth (+43%). The HF diet also increased transplacental transport of glucose (5-fold) and neutral amino acids (10-fold) in vivo. In microvillous plasma membranes (MVMs) isolated from placentas of HF-fed animals, protein expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was increased 5-fold, and protein expression of sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT) 2 was elevated 9-fold. In contrast, MVM protein expression of GLUT 3 or SNAT4 was unaltered. These data suggest that up-regulation of specific placental nutrient transporter isoforms constitute a mechanism linking maternal high-fat diet and obesity to fetal overgrowth."

In comparison with other gene expression steps where multiple small molecule effectors are available, very few compounds have been described that act as general inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing. Here we report construction and validation of a set of mammalian cell lines suitable for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing. Using these cell lines, we identified the natural product isoginkgetin as a general inhibitor of both the major and minor spliceosomes. Isoginkgetin inhibits splicing both in vivo and in vitro at similar micromolar concentrations. It appears to do so by preventing stable recruitment of the U4/U5/U6 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, resulting in accumulation of the prespliceosomal A complex. Like two other recently reported general pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors, isoginkgetin has been previously described as an anti-tumor agent. Our results suggest that splicing inhibition is the mechanistic basis of the anti-tumor activity of isoginkgetin.

Thus, pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors may represent a novel avenue for development of new anti-cancer agents. The removal of introns from nascent transcripts by the process of pre-mRNA (precursor to messenger RNA) splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, a highly dynamic, multimegadalton machine composed of five small stable nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; FRT, flp recombinase target; RT, reverse transcription; AdML, adenovirus major late; TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase. 2The abbreviations used are: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; FRT, flp recombinase target; RT, reverse transcription; AdML, adenovirus major late; TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase. and more than 100 polypeptides (reviewed in Ref. 1Matlin A.J. Moore M.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 623: 14-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Within the spliceosome, intron excision occurs in two chemical steps: 1) 5′ splice site cleavage accompanied by lariat formation at the branch point adenosine and 2) 3′ splice site cleavage accompanied by exon ligation. Both of these steps are readily observable in in vitro reactions containing crude nuclear extract and ATP as an energy source. In such reactions, spliceosome assembly occurs in a distinctly stepwise fashion. First, the pre-mRNA substrate is coated with a heterogeneous mixture of RNA-binding proteins (referred to as H complex). Interaction of U1 snRNP (U1 snRNA and its associated proteins) with the 5′ splice site and recognition of the branch point adenosine by U2 snRNP generates an early commitment complex (E or CC complex). A subsequent ATP-dependent step stabilizes the U2 snRNP-branch point interaction, resulting in formation of the prespliceosome (A complex). Entry of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP to form B complex is followed by multiple structural rearrangements, which produce the catalytically active C complex, wherein the two chemical steps of splicing occur. Finally, the ligated exon and lariat products are released, and the remaining spliceosome components are disassembled. In the more than two decades since its initial description (2Brody E. Abelson J. Science. 1985; 228: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Grabowski P.J. Seiler S.R. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 345-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a wealth of information has been gleaned regarding the parts list of the spliceosome, its gross assembly/disassembly pathway, certain key local structural interactions, and the activities of individual components. However, in comparison with other macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome and RNA polymerase II, our understanding of the spliceosome's inner workings and its detailed structure is still in its infancy. Mechanistic understanding of other macromolecular complexes has been greatly enhanced by the availability of multiple small molecule inhibitors impeding their functional cycles at different points (4Jurica M.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Steitz T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 9: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Such small molecules have been likened to wrenches that can be thrown into the works to freeze cellular machines in specific conformations, making them more amenable to biochemical and structural investigation (4Jurica M.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although a set of such wrenches that inhibit splicing in vitro or inhibit specific or alternative splicing events in vivo is being generated (4Jurica M.S. Nat. Chem.

Trans. 2008; 36: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), there is currently a paucity of small molecules that affect general pre-mRNA splicing in vivo. In this paper, we describe a cell-based assay to screen for general splicing inhibitors. This assay takes advantage of the observation that some amount of unspliced pre-mRNA can escape from the nucleus and become available for translation in the cytoplasm (11Legrain P. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 57: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12Nasim M.T. Chowdhury H.M. Eperon I.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By screening for an increase in reporter protein expression from a mammalian pre-mRNA designed such that only the unspliced version generates active protein, we were able to identify a compound that acts as a general inhibitor of splicing both in vivo and in vitro. This inhibitor is the naturally occurring biflavonoid isoginkgetin. In in vitro reactions, isoginkgetin causes accumulation of the prespliceosomal A complex. Like two other compounds recently described as in vivo splicing inhibitors (13Kaida D. Motoyoshi H. Tashiro E. Nojima T. Hagiwara M. Ishigami K. Watanabe H. Kitahara T. Yoshida T. Nakajima H. Tani T.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2666-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the mechanistic basis of the anti-tumor activity of isoginkgetin is its inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing. Plasmids—Reporter construct I was created by replacing the Renilla luciferase gene in plasmid triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI)/Renilla luciferase 5′ intron (pSHM06T) (16Nott A. Meislin S.H. Moore M.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) with the firefly luc2 gene from plasmid pGL4.10 (Promega). Construct II is identical to construct I except that site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove an in-frame stop codon in the intron and add a G at position 6 in TPI exon 7. Construct III was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of II to inactivate the 5′ splice site. Constructs I, II, and III were subcloned into vector pcDNA5/FRT for integration into the flp recombinase target (FRT) sequence in HEK293 cells (described below). Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen), as indicated below. Trypan blue (Invitrogen) and Alamar blue (BIOSOURCE) assays were done according to standard protocols. To generate a host cell line containing an integrated FRT site, HEK293 cells (ATCC) were transfected with ScaI-linearized pFRT/lacZeo (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as per the Flp-In™ system manual (Invitrogen). Stable integrants were selected with 100 μg/ml zeocin. Southern blotting and β-galactosidase assays identified cell clones with integrants expressing intermediate levels of the LacZ-Zeo fusion. Two such clones (293F1 and 293F2) were subsequently co-transfected with one of the three reporter plasmids and pOG44 (Invitrogen), which encodes Flp recombinase. Successful targeting of the reporter plasmid to the FRT site was selected by treatment with 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Luciferase Assays and RNA Isolation—Cells were grown in 24-well, 6-well, or 6-cm dishes and treated with DMSO or DMSO plus isoginkgetin, as indicated in the figure legends. Luciferase assays (luciferase assay system; Promega) were performed using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Systems). Protein concentrations were determined for lysates using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Corp.) and DNase-treated (Promega) according to the manufacturers' protocols. When a sample was to be used both for monitoring luciferase activity and for preparing RNA, cells were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline; 25% was diluted 2-fold with 2× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and used for luciferase assays, and the remainder was added to 5.5 volumes of TRI Reagent for RNA isolation. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was carried out using the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For qualitative experiments, 60 ng of DNase-treated total RNA was used per 25-μl reaction, run on 2% agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. For semiquantitative RT-PCR (using [α-32P]dATP), different amounts of DNase-treated total RNA (0.1–100 ng) were used, depending on the transcript being amplified. Reactions were performed with at least two concentrations of RNA to ensure that they were within the linear range. When the amplification product crossed an intron-exon boundary, primers amplifying U6 snRNA, an unspliced polymerase III transcript, were included as a control. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. High Throughput Screening—All high throughput screening was performed at the Broad Institute in association with the Chemical Biology Program. Cells were plated in 384-well plates at cell densities ranging from 1500 to 9000 cells/well. Plating ∼4000 cells/well gave the least variability in luciferase activity while maximizing the signal difference between cell lines II and III. Cells were plated in a 30-μl total volume using a Multidrop 384 or a Multidrop Micro (Thermo Scientific) liquid handler. To test sensitivity to DMSO (the carrier for the compound libraries), cell lines II and III were incubated overnight in growth media containing 0–1% DMSO. Concentrations up to 1% DMSO did not cause significant changes in signal intensity or reproducibility for any of the cell lines. For high throughput screening, cell lines II and III were plated on day 0 in growth medium in white, opaque bottom 384-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 3000–6000 cells/30 μl. On day 1, 100 nl of test compounds or DMSO was pin-transferred using a CyBio robot with a 384-well pin array to duplicate plates. On day 2, ∼24 h after the pin transfer, luciferase activities were read using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 30 μl of the combined cell lysis and assay reagent buffer were added directly to the well using a Matrix Wellmate (Thermo Scientific). After agitating plates for 10 min, luciferase readings were collected using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data analysis was performed as described (17Seiler K.P. George G.A. Happ M.P. Bodycombe N.E. Carrinski H.A. Norton S. Brudz S. Sullivan J.P. Muhlich J. Serrano M. Ferraiolo P. Tolliday N.J. Schreiber S.L. Clemons P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D351-D359Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to determine Z-scores and assess reproducibility of compound effects. For follow up experiments, cells were grown in 24-well, 6-well, or 6-cm dishes and treated with DMSO or DMSO plus isoginkgetin, as described above. Isoginkgetin—Screening and initial follow up experiments were carried out with isoginkgetin obtained from MicroSource. Isoginkgetin for subsequent experiments was purchased from Gaia Corp. To validate their identity and purity, all samples were subjected to C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. One sample from Gaia that exhibited no activity in cellular assays proved <50% pure, whereas a second sample that proved >99% pure by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry did exhibit the expected activity. In Vitro Splicing Reactions—Uniformly 32P-labeled adenovirus major late (AdML), TPI (exon 6-intron 6-exon 7), and β-globin (exon 1-intron 1-exon 2) pre-mRNA splicing substrates were generated by T7 run-off transcription of plasmids pHMS81, pMJM542, and pMJM540 and gel-purified as previously described (18Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared as previously described (19Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Splicing reactions containing ∼20 nm pre-mRNA, 30% nuclear extract, 20 mm additional potassium chloride, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 units/μl RNasin, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 mm ATP, and 1% (v/v) DMSO or isoginkgetin dissolved in DMSO were incubated for the indicated times (0–90 min) at 30° C. Native splicing complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing gels as described previously (21Reichert V. Moore M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Splicing efficiencies were assessed by separating purified RNAs on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. To estimate the IC50 of isoginkgetin, nonlinear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0a for Macintosh. Development of Cell Lines for in Vivo Screening—To generate constructs appropriate for in vivo screening, we created a splicing reporter consisting of the human TPI gene exon 6-intron 6-exon 7 cassette (16Nott A. Meislin S.H. Moore M.J. RNA. 2003; 9: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) upstream of the firefly luciferase open reading frame (Fig. 1A, positive control; construct I). In this construct, the start codon is in the first exon, and active luciferase is generated only from spliced mRNA. In order to generate the screening reporter (construct II), we removed all in frame stop codons from the intron and added one base at the beginning of the second exon, such that the luciferase open reading frame is out of frame with the start codon in the spliced mRNA but is in frame when the intron is retained. We also created a mutant reporter (construct III) identical to the screening reporter except for a 5′ splice site point mutation predicted to abolish splicing (U to A at position 2 in the intron). All three reporters were subcloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pcDNA5/FRT. This plasmid also contains an FRT site. Stable cell lines expressing each reporter were generated using the Flp/FRT recombinase system. To do so, we clonally selected HEK293 cell lines stably transfected with a plasmid containing a FRT site at a single position in a transcriptionally active portion of the genome, as confirmed by LacZ expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Independent co-transfection of two of these cell lines (293F1 and 293F2) with the reporter constructs and a plasmid encoding Flp recombinase generated the screening cell lines (293F1-I, -II, and -III and 293F2-I, -II, and -III). RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from each cell line confirmed that transcripts from constructs I and II were spliced, whereas those from construct III were not (see Fig. 1B for the 293F1-based lines; 293F2-based lines, data not shown). Consistent with this, luciferase activity levels were high in the positive control cells (I), low in the splicing reporter cells (II), and intermediate in the mutant reporter cells (III) (Fig. 1C). Since the three reporters behaved identically in both the 293F1 and 293F2 backgrounds, the two cell line sets were used interchangeably. High Throughput Screening of Compound Libraries—Paired cell lines containing either reporter II or III were used to screen for small molecules that specifically inhibited splicing. We expected that such inhibitors would increase the luciferase activity from reporter II but would have little or no effect on reporter III. Comparison of compound effects on reporters II and III allowed us to discriminate between effects on splicing and other potential means of increased protein expression (e.g. increased cell proliferation, transcription, translation, etc.). The 6-fold difference between the luciferase activities of reporters II and III under the screening conditions (0.3% DMSO) provided a sufficient window for compound identification. For high throughput screening, cells were grown in 384-well plates, exposed in duplicate to compounds dissolved in DMSO or an equivalent volume of DMSO alone for 24 h, after which luciferase activities were measured. Each luciferase value was expressed as the number of S.D. values from the mean (the Z-score) of control DMSO-treated cells (17Seiler K.P. George G.A. Happ M.P. Bodycombe N.E. Carrinski H.A. Norton S. Brudz S. Sullivan J.P. Muhlich J. Serrano M. Ferraiolo P. Tolliday N.J. Schreiber S.L. Clemons P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D351-D359Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A composite Z-score was derived by combining the vectors of each replicate's Z-score for every given compound/cell line pair. This score allows easy comparison of effects upon two separate biological systems that have differently distributed spreads of average values (in this case, the average luciferase activity of cells expressing construct II versus those expressing construct III) (17Seiler K.P. George G.A. Happ M.P. Bodycombe N.E. Carrinski H.A. Norton S. Brudz S. Sullivan J.P. Muhlich J. Serrano M. Ferraiolo P. Tolliday N.J. Schreiber S.L. Clemons P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D351-D359Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For each compound deemed to have a reproducible effect (i.e. its duplicates matched in direction and degree), the composite Z-score for reporter II was plotted against the composite Z-score for reporter III (Fig. 2). Approximately 8000 compounds were screened from natural product and synthetic libraries, some at multiple concentrations (15–100 μm). Of these, about half were known bioactives from commercially available NINDS, SpecPlus, and Biomol collections, and the remainder were the products of multiple diversity-oriented synthesis endeavors. A complete list of compounds screened and the scores each yielded in our assay can be found on the World Wide Web via ChemBank. The vast majority of compounds fell either within the noise range as defined by DMSO treatment (|composite Z-score| ≤ 2.5) or on the line defined by x = y (i.e. affecting reporters II and III similarly). As expected, compounds such as the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the translation inhibitor cycloheximide decreased luciferase activity of both reporters II and III, thus yielding negative composite Z-scores for both. A limited number of compounds yielded a positive composite Z-score ≥3 for one reporter while having a negligible effect on the other (Table 1). Among this set, one compound stood out strikingly as having a very large positive effect on luciferase activity in cells expressing construct II (composite Z-score = 27.9) but no significant effect in cells expressing construct III (composite Z-score = –2.5). This compound is the biflavonoid isoginkgetin, a natural product found in a variety of plant species, including Ginkgo biloba.TABLE 1Compounds with reproducible differential effects on reporters II and IIICompound nameChemBank IDaChemBank ID is the unique identifier for screening compounds within the ChemBank data base.Composite Z-scorebThe composite Z-score is a normalized value representing the number of S.D. values away from the empirically determined and mathematically defined mean of mock-treated cells.

Open table in a new tab Validation and Characterization of Isoginkgetin as an in Vivo Splicing Inhibitor—To confirm the isoginkgetin results from the screen, cells containing reporters I, II, and III as well as the parental cell line without a reporter were treated with 33 μm isoginkgetin (the screening concentration) dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO alone. Luciferase activity of reporter II increased significantly (∼4-fold) with isoginkgetin treatment, whereas that of reporter III increased only modestly (∼1.8-fold) (Fig. 3A). As observed in the screen, the effect on reporter III was not statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Consistent with an inhibition of splicing, a marked decrease (∼5-fold) in luciferase activity was observed upon isoginkgetin treatment of cells expressing reporter I. To verify that the observed changes in luciferase activity were due to inhibition of splicing, we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from isoginkgetin- and DMSO-treated cells. This analysis confirmed that overnight exposure to 33 μm isoginkgetin was sufficient to shift the predominant species generated from constructs I and II from spliced mRNA to unspliced pre-mRNA (Fig. 3B). Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that this shift toward accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA was detectable within 3 h of isoginkgetin addition (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, luciferase activity from reporter I began to decrease, and that from reporter II began to increase within a similar time frame (Fig. 3D). The effect of isoginkgetin treatment was also concentration-dependent, since treatment with 100 μm isoginkgetin led to a greater increase in pre-mRNA accumulation within 4 h than did treatment with either 10 or 33 μm isoginkgetin (Fig. 3E). To test whether the effect of isoginkgetin on splicing was specific to our reporter system or more general, we analyzed several endogenous transcripts, including those encoding β-tubulin, actin, DNAJB1, TPI, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and RIOK3. All of these transcripts exhibited pre-mRNA accumulation (2–20-fold) upon treatment with isoginkgetin (Fig. 4, A and B, and data not shown). We also monitored NOL1 intron 7, a known substrate for the minor spliceosome (23Tarn W.-Y. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As observed for other endogenous transcripts, isoginkgetin treatment led to an increase in the amount of unspliced NOL1 intron 7 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that isoginkgetin is a general inhibitor of splicing that targets both the major and minor spliceosomes. As expected for a general inhibitor of an essential step in gene expression, treatment of cells with isoginkgetin at concentrations inhibitory for splicing resulted in growth arrest (Fig. 5A). Trypan blue and Alamar blue analyses suggested that this growth arrest was not accompanied by a loss of cell viability (data not shown). Consistent with this, removal of isoginkgetin after 24 h restored both expression of luciferase from reporter I and cellular proliferation (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, isoginkgetin appears to be a reversible inhibitor of pre-mRNA splicing. Isoginkgetin Inhibits Splicing in Vitro—To determine whether isoginkgetin could inhibit splicing in vitro, we performed splicing assays in HeLa cell nuclear extract using multiple RNA substrates. For these assays, isoginkgetin was diluted in DMSO, which itself did not affect splicing efficiency at concentrations of ≤2% (data not shown). Radiolabeled pre-mRNAs were spliced for 60 min in standard reactions supplemented with 0–100 μm isoginkgetin (≤1% v/v). Splicing of AdML, β-globin, and TPI (exon 6-intron 6-exon 7, equivalent to the in vivo splicing reporter) transcripts was inhibited by isoginkgetin in a dose-dependent manner. For all three constructs, splicing was completely inhibited by 50 μm isoginkgetin, with an IC50 of ∼30 μm (Fig. 6A). This in vitro splicing inhibition was reproducible with several different HeLa nuclear extract preparations, and preincubation of the extracts with the compound was not required for inhibition (data not shown). Thus, as observed in vivo, isoginkgetin is a general inhibitor of splicing in vitro. Isoginkgetin Arrests Spliceosome Assembly and Sequesters Pre-mRNA in Complex A—To ascertain the stage at which splicing is inhibited, splicing reactions containing AdML pre-mRNA ±70 μm isoginkgetin were subjected to native gel electrophoresis. In the absence of isoginkgetin, progression through H/E, A, B, and C complexes was readily detectable over a 60-min time course (Fig. 6B, lanes 6–11). Reactions lacking ATP instead accumulated a complex, probably E, having a slightly lower mobility than A complex (Fig. 6B, lane 3, ATP– complex) (22Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Das R. Reed R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This same complex was observable in reactions containing isoginkgetin but lacking ATP (Fig. 6C). In reactions containing both isoginkgetin and ATP, little or no complex comigrating with B or C could be observed. Rather, these reactions accumulated a little or no complex with mobility identical to that of A complex (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 5) (data not shown). Thus, it appears that isoginkgetin blocks the A to B transition, resulting in sequestration of the pre-mRNA in a prespliceosome. In comparison with other steps in gene expression, there is currently a paucity of small molecule modulators of pre-mRNA processing. Such modulators, particularly if their action is reversible, can be incredibly useful tools for both cell biological and biochemical analyses. Here we describe the development of a set of stable mammalian cell lines that we successfully employed in a high throughput screen to identify a new general inhibitor of pre-mRNA splic"

Recent studies indicate that the catalytic subunits of SET1 family members are regulated by interaction with a conserved core group of proteins that include the WD repeat protein-5 (WDR5), retinoblastoma-binding protein-5 (RbBP5), and the absent small homeotic-2-like protein (Ash2L). It has been suggested that WDR5 functions to bridge the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory subunits of SET1 family complexes. However, the molecular details of these interactions are unknown. To gain insight into the interactions among these proteins, we have determined the biophysical basis for the interaction between the human WDR5 and MLL1. Our studies reveal that WDR5 preferentially recognizes a previously unidentified and conserved arginine-containing motif, called the “Win” or WDR5 interaction motif, which is located in the N-SET region of MLL1 and other SET1 family members. Surprisingly, our structural and functional studies show that WDR5 recognizes arginine 3765 of the MLL1 Win motif using the same arginine binding pocket on WDR5 that was previously shown to bind histone H3. We demonstrate that WDR5's recognition of arginine 3765 of MLL1 is essential for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro.

Eukaryotes have evolved a complex system to regulate access to genomic information by packaging DNA into chromatin. Chromatin can adopt various levels of organization that regulate essential cellular activities such as transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and repair (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, in which 147 base pairs of genomic DNA is wrapped around a disc-shaped octamer of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (2Luger K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Nucleosome positioning on DNA is fundamentally involved in controlling gene access and is regulated in part by a diverse array of enzymes that introduce covalent post-translational modifications on histone proteins (4Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 5Cosgrove M.S. Wolberger C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). An extensive array of histone modifications have been characterized, including lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitylation (6Cosgrove M.S. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2007; 4: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Peterson C.L. Laniel M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The large number of potential histone modification patterns provides cells with an enormous combinatorial potential for the precise regulation of gene function. This potential is summarized by the histone code hypothesis (8Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 9Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), which predicts that patterns of histone modifications are recognized by specialized “effector” domains found in numerous chromatin regulators. It is thought that effector domains help recruit the activities of proteins that either stabilize or remodel specific chromatin states (5Cosgrove M.S. Wolberger C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar).The combinatorial complexity of histone modifications is further increased by histone lysine residues that can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, which are correlated with distinct functional outcomes. For example, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that nucleosomes occupying the 5′ ends of active genes are trimethylated at H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), whereas the body of active genes tend to possess nucleosomes dimethylated at H3K4 (13Santos-Rosa H.

Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Several enzymes that regulate H3K4 methylation have been identified, all possessing the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which is required for lysine methylation (20Rea S. Eisenhaber F.

For example, it was recently shown that the minimal complex required for di- and trimethylation of H3K4 includes MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L, which together form the MLL1 core complex (39Dou Y.

In addition, we demonstrate that the Win motif is critical for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—A human spleen c-DNA library was used to amplify an MLL1 C-terminal fragment encoding residues 3592–3969. PCR subcloning was used to amplify MLL1 SET domain constructs consisting of residues 3745–3969 (MLL3745) and residues 3811–3969 (MLL3811). MLL3745 and MLL3811 were ligated into the pGST and pMBP parallel vectors, respectively (42Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). pMCGS7 plasmids encoding full-length WDR5 as N-terminal His6 fusions were obtained as generous gifts from Alexander Ruthenburg and David Allis. A plasmid containing the RbBP5 clone was obtained as a generous gift from Yali Dou and was subcloned into the pET3a vector without affinity tags. The ash2L gene (Clone ID 3921999) was purchased from Open Biosystems and subcloned into the pHis Parallel vector, which encodes tobacco etch virus (TEV) 3The abbreviations used are: TEV, tobacco etch virus; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. cleavable N-terminal His6 fusion.All recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli (Rosetta II, Novagen) by growing cells containing the plasmids at 37 °C in Terrific Broth medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin to an A600 of 1.0. The temperature was then lowered to 16 °C, and cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1–1 mm) for 16–18 h. RBBP5 and Ash2L were induced with 0.1 mm and 0.25 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, respectively. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), lysed with a microfluidizer cell disrupter, and clarified by centrifugation. Cells containing the RbBP5 plasmid were lysed instead using the same lysis buffer containing 1× BugBuster® (Novagen), which minimized RbBP5 degradation upon cell lysis. Clarified supernatants containing the GST-MLL3745 protein were passed over a glutathione-Sepharose column (GSTrap™ FF column, GE-Healthcare), and GST-MLL3745 was eluted with a gradient of reduced glutathione. Fractions containing GST-MLL3745 were combined, treated with TEV protease, and dialyzed with three changes against lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors). MLL3745 was further purified over a glutathione-Sepharose column followed by gel filtration chromatography. MBP-MLL3811 fusion protein was purified by amylose affinity chromatography followed by TEV protease treatment and two rounds of gel filtration chromatography. Full-length WDR5 protein was expressed and purified as described previously (43Couture, J., Collazo, E., and Trievel, R. C. (2006) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.Google Scholar). RbBP5 protein was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Ash2L was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (HisTrap column, GE Healthcare), dialysis and TEV cleavage to remove imidazole and the His6 tag, and repurification over a His-trap column. As a final step of purification and for buffer exchange, all proteins were passed through a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 μm ZnCl2.Mutagenesis and Peptides—Point mutations were introduced into MLL1 and WDR5 constructs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of the intended mutations and the absence of additional mutations. Peptides were synthesized by Global Peptide and Genscript.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out using a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab™ XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an eight-hole An-50 Ti analytical rotor. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 10 °C and 50,000 rpm (200,000 × g) using 3-mm two-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with quartz windows. Each sample was scanned at 0-min time intervals for 300 scans. Protein samples in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 μm ZnCl2 were run at various concentrations, and molar ratios were as described under “Results.” Sedimentation boundaries were analyzed by the continuous distribution (c(s)) method using the program SEDFIT (44Schuck P.

Equilibrium dissociation constants for WDR5-MLL1 complexes were obtained by global fitting sedimentation velocity data acquired at several different protein concentrations using the single-site hetero-association model (A + B ↔ AB) of SEDPHAT (45Schuck P.

The reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 2 h, stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer to 1×, and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen). The gel then was soaked in an autoradiography enhancer solution (Enlightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to film at −80 °C for 24 h.Mass spectrometry assays were conducted by adapting that previously reported for Dim5 and SET7/9 histone methyltransferases (48Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Six micrograms of MLL3745 or MLL1 core complex was incubated with 250 μm s-adenosyl-methionine and 10 μm histone H3 peptide (amino acid residues 1–20) at 15 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were quenched at various time points by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.5%. The quenched samples were diluted 1:4 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker AutoFlex mass spectrometer (State University of New York (SUNY), Oswego, NY) operated in reflectron mode. Final spectra were averaged from 100 shots/position at 10 different positions.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected on an AVIV 62A DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab CFT-33 refrigerated circulator at 10 °C using a 0.1-mm path length cell. Spectra for each protein at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml were collected in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 μm ZnCl2. The background contribution of the buffer alone was subtracted from each protein spectrum.RESULTSWDR5 Forms a Stable Complex with the N-SET Region of MLL1—MLL1 is a large protein of 3,969 residues containing several conserved domains with functions implicated in transcriptional regulation (49Rasio D. Schichman S.A. Negrini M. Canaani E. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1766-1769PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Previous efforts to map the interaction region between MLL1 and WDR5 led to the identification of three distinct WDR5 interaction regions in MLL1 (38Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The most C-terminal MLL1 fragment that interacts with WDR5 includes residues 3301–3969, which includes the N-SET region and the evolutionarily conserved ∼130-amino-acid SET domain at the extreme C terminus. The location of the WDR5 binding site within this region is unknown. Previous immunoprecipitation experiments showed that deletion of the last 149 amino acid residues spanning the MLL1 SET domain prevents co-immunoprecipitation of WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L with MLL1 (28Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M. Aufiero D.J. Kitabayashi I. Herr W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conserved SET domain of MLL1 is important for the interaction with the subcomplex. In contrast, domain-mapping experiments with the human SET1a protein suggest that ∼120 amino acid residues in the N-SET region are required for co-immunoprecipitation of WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L (33Lee J.H. Tate C.M. You J.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13419-13428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A similar region of the MLL3 protein was shown to interact with WDR5 in GST pulldown experiments (50Cho Y.W. Hong T. Hong S. Guo H. Yu H. Kim D. Guszczynski T. Dressler G.R. Copeland T.D. Kalkum M. Ge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20395-20406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N-SET region of MLL1 may be recognized by the WDR5 component of the MLL1 core complex. To test this hypothesis, we performed sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments to compare the hydrodynamic properties of two highly pure MLL1 SET domain constructs in the presence and absence of WDR5.The first MLL1 SET domain construct consisted of residues 3745–3969 of human MLL1 (hereafter referred to as MLL3745), which was shown in previous studies to be the minimal domain required for interaction with the Ini1 tumor suppressor (51Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Rozovskaia T. Burakov D. Sedkov Y. Tillib S. Blechman J. Nakamura T. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4152-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and for MLL1 SET domain self-association (52Rozovskaia T. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Sedkov Y. Burakov D. Yano T. Nakamura T. Petruck S. Ben-Simchon L. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This construct contains 66 amino acid residues of the N-SET region followed by the conserved SET and post-SET domains (Fig. 1a). We show in a separate investigation that MLL3745 is the minimal MLL SET domain construct required for the assembly of the full MLL1 core complex in vitro. 4A. Patel, V. E. Vought, V. Dharmarajan, and M. S. Cosgrove, manuscript in preparation. In the second MLL1 SET domain construct, the N-terminal residues encompassing the N-SET region were deleted. This construct consists of residues 3811–3969 (MLL3811) and encompasses only the conserved SET and post-SET domains (Fig. 1a). Both constructs are catalytically active in methyltransferase assays with histone H3 peptides encompassing residues 1–20 (Fig. 1b).Sedimentation velocity analyses were first performed with each of the proteins individually and were fitted to a distribution of Lamm equation solutions to determine the diffusion-free sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)) (44Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, a–c, shows that MLL3745, MLL3811, and WDR5 are monodisperse in solution with experimental s* values independent of protein concentration (not shown), suggesting that each is predominantly monomeric over the concentration range used. 5It was previously shown by yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments that MLL3745 self-associates (52Rozovskaia T. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Sedkov Y. Burakov D. Yano T. Nakamura T. Petruck S. Ben-Simchon L. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect self-association MLL3745 in this investigation by sedimentation velocity analysis. This is probably because the limited solubility of MLL3745 in the absence of interacting proteins prevents performing sedimentation velocity experiments at a high enough concentration to observe significant self-association. In support of this, control sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that MLL3745 weakly self-associates with a Kd of 12.7 μm (A. Patel and M. S. Cosgrove, unpublished data). When run individually, MLL3745, MLL3811, and WDR5 sediment with s* values of 1.68 ± 0.03 (1.76 s20,w), 1.31 ± 0.02 (1.38 s20,w), and 2.28 ± 0.05 (2.41 s20,w), respectively. The molecular masses calculated from these s20,w values are within error (<3%), similar to that of the expected masses for each protein (Table 1).FIGURE 2Sedimentation velocity analyses of WDR5 and recombinant MLL1 constructs. a–c, diffusion-free sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) derived from sedimentation velocity data of MLL3745 (a), MLL3811 (b), and WDR5 (c).

Despite extensive studies, many questions remain about the way respiratory sulfate reduction is associated with energy conservation. A crucial enzyme in this process is the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dSiR), which contains a unique siroheme-[4Fe4S] coupled cofactor. Here, we report the structure of desulfoviridin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, in which the dSiR DsrAB (sulfite reductase) subunits are bound to the DsrC protein. The ;2;2;2 assembly contains two siroheme-[4Fe4S] cofactors bound by DsrB, two sirohydrochlorins and two [4Fe4S] centers bound by DsrA, and another four [4Fe4S] centers in the ferredoxin domains. A sulfite molecule, coordinating the siroheme, is found at the active site. The DsrC protein is bound in a cleft between DsrA and DsrB with its conserved C-terminal cysteine reaching the distal side of the siroheme. We propose a novel mechanism for the process of sulfite reduction involving DsrAB, DsrC, and the DsrMKJOP membrane complex (a membrane complex with putative disulfide/thiol reductase activity), in which two of the six electrons for reduction of sulfite derive from the membrane quinone pool. These results show that DsrC is involved in sulfite reduction, which changes the mechanism of sulfate respiration. This has important implications for models used to date ancient sulfur metabolism based on sulfur isotope fractionations.

These results show that DsrC is involved in sulfite reduction, which changes the mechanism of sulfate respiration. This has important implications for models used to date ancient sulfur metabolism based on sulfur isotope fractionations. The dissimilatory reduction of sulfur compounds is one of the earliest energy metabolisms detected on earth, at ∼3.5 billion years ago (1Shen Y. Buick R. Canfield D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 2Philippot P. Van Zuilen M. Lepot K. Thomazo C. Farquhar J. Van Kranendonk M.J. Science. 2007; 317: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). At the end of the Archean (∼2.7 billion years ago), the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis led to a gradual increase in the levels of atmospheric oxygen, which in turn caused an increasing flux of sulfate to the oceans from weathering of sulfide minerals on land (3Canfield D.E. Habicht K.S. Thamdrup B. Science. 2000; 288: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this process, reduction of sulfate became a dominant biological process in the oceans, resulting in sulfidic anoxic conditions from about 2.5 to 0.6 billion years ago (3Canfield D.E. Habicht K.S. Thamdrup B. Science. 2000; 288: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 4Anbar A.D. Knoll A.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). During this extended period, sulfate-reducing prokaryotes were main players in marine habitats where most evolutionary processes were taking place. Today, these organisms are still major contributors to the biological carbon and sulfur cycles, and their activities have important environmental and economic consequences.A key enzyme in sulfur-based energy metabolism is the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dSiR), 3The abbreviations used are: dSiR, dissimilatory sulfite reductase; rSiR, reverse sulfite reductase; aSiR, assimilatory sulfite reductase; aNiR, assimilatory nitrite reductase; Dvir, desulfoviridin; r.m.s., root mean square. 3The abbreviations used are: dSiR, dissimilatory sulfite reductase; rSiR, reverse sulfite reductase; aSiR, assimilatory sulfite reductase; aNiR, assimilatory nitrite reductase; Dvir, desulfoviridin; r.m.s., root mean square. which is present in organisms that reduce sulfate, sulfite, and other sulfur compounds. This enzyme is also found in some phototrophic and chemotrophic sulfur oxidizers, where it is proposed to operate in the reverse direction (reverse sulfite reductase, rSiR). The dSiR is minimally composed of two subunits, DsrA and DsrB, in an ∼200-kDa ;2;2 arrangement. The dsrA and dsrB genes are paralogous and most likely arose from a very early gene duplication event that preceded the separation of the archaea and bacteria domains (5Dahl C. Kredich N.M. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Hipp W.M. Pott A.S. Thum-Schmitz N. Faath I. Dahl C. Truper H.G.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2975-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with a very early onset of biological sulfite reduction. The dSiR belongs to a family of proteins that also include the assimilatory sulfite (aSiR) and nitrite (aNiR) reductases, the monomeric low molecular mass aSiRs, and other dSiRs like asrC and Fsr (9Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Dhillon A. Goswami S. Riley M. Teske A. Sogin M.

This family has in common a characteristic cofactor assembly that includes an iron tetrahydroporphyrin of the isobacteriochlorin class, termed siroheme (see supplemental Fig. S1), that is coupled through its cysteine axial ligand to a [4Fe4S] iron-sulfur cluster (12Janick P.A. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3538-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Moura I. Legall J. Lino A.R. Peck H.D. Fauque G. Xavier A.V. Dervartanian D.V. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J.

The aSiR and aNiR, found in plants, fungi, and bacteria, are monomeric enzymes that display an internal two-fold symmetry of a module that is related to DsrA/DsrB, suggesting that these assimilatory proteins also resulted from a gene duplication event (9Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Dhillon A. Goswami S. Riley M. Teske A. Sogin M.

Phylogenetic sequence analysis indicates that both dSiRs and aSiRs diverged from a common ancestral gene that was present in one of the earliest life forms on earth (7Molitor M. Dahl C. Molitor I. Schafer U. Speich N. Huber R. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. Microbiology (Read.). 1998; 144: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Dhillon A. Goswami S. Riley M. Teske A. Sogin M.

Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Despite its central role in anaerobic metabolism, many aspects of dSiRs remain poorly understood. One of these is the nature of their physiological product because in vitro, they reduce sulfite to a mixture of trithionate, thiosulfate, and sulfide in proportions that depend on the reaction conditions (15Peck H.D. Legall J. Vanbeeumen J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 298: 443-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in contrast to aSiRs, which reduce sulfite directly to sulfide. This has led to some controversy, still unresolved, over whether the biological mechanism of dissimilatory sulfite reduction involves the formation of thiosulfate and trithionate as necessary intermediates (15Peck H.D. Legall J. Vanbeeumen J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 298: 443-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Akagi J.M. Barton L.L. Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1995: 89-112Crossref Google Scholar). Another open question regarding dSiRs is the content and the actual nature of the cofactors present. It is not clear whether both DsrA and DsrB subunits contain the coupled siroheme-[4Fe4S] cofactor because its characteristic binding site in DsrB is missing the first cysteine (5Dahl C. Kredich N.M. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both DsrA and DsrB contain a ferredoxin-like domain, not present in aSiRs, which should bind an extra [4Fe4S] cluster. Cofactor quantification of dSiRs is quite disparate, with studies reporting from 2 to 4 sirohemes and from 10 to 32 non-heme irons per ;2;2 module (13Moura I. Legall J. Lino A.R. Peck H.D. Fauque G.

Hagen W.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The nature of the catalytic cofactor has also been disputed, with some studies proposing a cubanesiroheme arrangement similar to that found in aSiRs (13Moura I. Legall J. Lino A.R. Peck H.D.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other studies proposing the presence of higher nuclearity high spin iron-sulfur clusters (18Pierik A.J. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Marritt S.J. Hagen W.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Arendsen A.F.

Finally, a most important and unresolved question is the nature of the physiological electron donor to dSiR.Most studies of dSiRs have focused on desulfoviridin (Dvir), the dSiR of Desulfovibrio spp. This enzyme has a characteristic and redox-insensitive band at ∼628 nm due to the presence of sirohydrochlorin, the iron-free form of siroheme (supplemental Fig. S1). It is reported that up to 80% of its siroheme lacks iron and is in the form of sirohydrochlorin (13Moura I. Legall J. Lino A.R. Peck H.D. Fauque G. Xavier A.V. Dervartanian D.V. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1075-1082Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Pierik A.J. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Murphy M.J. Siegel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6911-6919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this has been disputed (19Wolfe B.M. Lui S.M. Cowan J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another particular feature of Dvir is that it forms a stable complex with DsrC, a small protein of 11 kDa. Initial reports described DsrC as a ; subunit of dSiRs present in a stoichiometry of ;2;2;2 (23Pierik A.J. Duyvis M.G. van Helvoort J.M. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the dsrC gene is located separately from dsrAB in several sulfate-reducing organisms, like Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, where its expression is not coordinately regulated (24Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Bruschi M. Voordouw G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There are also several dSiRs that do not include DsrC (5Dahl C. Kredich N.M. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Molitor M. Dahl C. Molitor I. Schafer U. Speich N. Huber R. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. Microbiology (Read.). 1998; 144: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but all organisms that contain the dsrAB genes include also dsrC. These points indicate that DsrC is not a subunit of dSiR, but rather, a protein with which it interacts. In several sulfur-oxidizing and sulfite-reducing bacteria, dsrC is located in the same operon as dsrAB (25Dahl C. Engels S. Pott-Sperling A.S. Schulte A. Sander J. Lubbe Y. Deuster O. Brune D.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1392-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Pires R.H. Venceslau S.S. Morais F. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Pereira I.A.C.

It is actually one of the few proteins, apart from DsrAB (sulfite reductase) and the DsrMKJOP membrane complex (a membrane complex with putative disulfide/thiol reductase activity), to be conserved in both sulfur oxidizers and sulfate/sulfite reducers (26Pires R.H. Venceslau S.S. Morais F. Teixeira M. Xavier A.V. Pereira I.A.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Sander J. Engels-Schwarzlose S. Dahl C. Arch. Microbiol. 2006; 186: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, D. vulgaris dsrC is one of the most highly expressed genes in the cell with twice the expression level of dsrAB (28Haveman S.A. Brunelle V. Voordouw J.K. Voordouw G. Heidelberg J.F. Rabus R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4345-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), pointing to an important role in cellular metabolism. Interestingly, homologues of DsrC, like YccK, are also present in organisms that do not contain dSiRs such as Escherichia coli and Hemophillus influenzae. YccK (renamed as TusE) was recently shown to be involved in sulfur-transfer reactions as part of the biosynthesis of thio-modifications of bacterial tRNA wobble positions (29Ikeuchi Y. Shigi N. Kato J. Nishimura A. Suzuki T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This work provided the first functional assignment of a DsrC-like protein in sulfur metabolism, with important implications to the dissimilatory processes where the function of DsrC has not yet been elucidated. The functional part of DsrC seems to be a C-terminal flexible arm, which displays several strictly conserved residues including a cysteine that is the penultimate one (30Cort J.R. Mariappan S.V.S.

This structure resolves several long standing questions about dSiRs and suggests a function for DsrC that has important implications regarding the mechanism of sulfate reduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Crystallization and X-ray Data—Dvir from D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DSM 644) was purified as described previously (32Oliveira T.F. Clemens Vonrhein Matias P. Venceslau S.S. Pereira I.A.C. Archer M. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 164: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A detailed description of the crystallization and structure solution of Dvir by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion based on the iron is presented in Ref. 32Oliveira T.F.

In summary, small dark green crystals were obtained in 12.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m MgCl2 and were cryoprotected with the crystallization solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. Crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21 (a = 122.7, b = 119.4, and c = 146.68 Á, ; = 110.0°) with two ;2;2;2 units per asymmetric unit corresponding to a solvent content of ∼51%. A three-wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data collection to 2.9 Á was carried out on the tunable beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France.Further efforts were undertaken to improve crystal x-ray diffraction, which included many crystallization set-ups with the same or similar experimental conditions to overcome low crystallization reproducibility and very poor crystal quality (low resolution, multiple and anisotropic diffraction patterns). Additional x-ray data were later measured at the ESRF ID23-2 beamline using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. A data set with 300 images was collected at 0.933 Á, with an oscillation angle of 0.5° and an exposure time of 9 s/image. The x-ray data were integrated using the XDS program (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Data merging and conversion to structure factor amplitudes were carried out respectively with SCALA (34Evans P.R. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 33. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1997: 22-24Google Scholar) and TRUNCATE (35French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (888) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (36Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Crystals diffract to 2.1 Á and belong to the same space group (P21) as the 2.9 Á data set, but with different cell parameters: a = 65.41, b = 118.91, and c = 132.25 Á, ; = 104.1° with one ;2;2;2 assembly in the asymmetric unit and solvent content of ∼50%.Structure Determination and Refinement—Because the two measured crystals are not isomorphous, the 2.1 Á data set structure was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (37Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) using the 2.9 Á model as a template (two ;;; units were found). Further refinement (using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints) was carried out with BUSTER (38Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and model building using Coot (39Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). 5% of reflections were randomly excluded from the refinement for cross-validation (Rfree calculation). The electron density maps are generally well defined (better for chains ABC than DEF, as reflected by the higher average isotropic thermal motion parameters), except for some surface loops. The two ;;; units are very similar (r.m.s. deviation of 0.2 Á for 919 aligned residues), so chains A, B, and C will be used to describe the Dvir structure. The final model comprises 1818 amino acid residues, 2 sirohemes, 2 sirohydrochlorins, 8 [4Fe4S] clusters, 2 sulfite ions, and 1016 water molecules. The Ramachandran plot shows that 87.4% of the residues lie in most favored regions and only 0.4% fall in disallowed regions. Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 were generated using PyMOL (40Delano W.L.

Statistics of data processing and refinement are listed in Table 1. This model contains two ;;; units (;: residues 2–437 of DsrA, chains A and D; ;: residues 2–381 of DsrB, chains B and E; and ;: residues 3–105 of DsrC, chains C and F) (Fig. 1A). The ;2;2;2 assembly has overall dimensions of ∼125 × 100 × 60 Á and a total surface area of about 55,720 Á2. The interface area between the two ;; units is 6,100 Á2, which represents ∼11% of the total dimer surface area. This interface is mainly hydrophilic with an important contribution from the DsrA C-terminal tail that embraces DsrB from the other ;; unit, and to a lesser extent, the C terminus of DsrB (Fig. 1B). This demonstrates a strong interaction between the two ;; units that corroborates the ;2;2 minimal composition proposed for all dSiRs.TABLE 1Crystallographic data processing and refinement statistics Values in parentheses show the statistics of the highest resolution shell (2.21–2.10 Á).Data collection Wavelength (Á)0.933 Space groupP21 Unit cell parameters (Á, °)a = 65.41, b = 118.90, c = 132.45, ; = 104.1 Resolution range (Á)40.29–2.10 (2.21–2.10) Unique reflections112244 (14772) I/< (I)13.2 (2.0) Rmerge (%)aRmerge = :h :i |Ii(h) – 〈I(h)〉|/:h :i Ii (h), where I is the observed intensity, 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations from symmetry-related reflections, and N is redundancy4.7 (44.9) Rpim (%)bRpim = :h [1/(N-1)]1/2 :i |Ii(h) – 〈I(h) 〉|/:h :i Ii (h), where I is the observed intensity, 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations from symmetry-related reflections, and N is redundancy3.8 (38.1) Completeness (%)98.1 (88.7) Multiplicity3.1 (2.4) Wilson B (Á2)36.8Refinement No. amino acid residues in asymmetric unit1818Other moieties Siroheme (SRM)2 (with iron) + 2 (iron-free) Fe4S4 clusters8 SO32−2 Water1016 R/R-free (%)19.0/21.9 Average B-factor (main-chain) (Á2) Chains A and B/C31.9/42.9 Chains D and E/F47.2/56.1 Solvent molecules43.7 r.m.s. bond length deviation from ideal values (Á)0.005 r.m.s. bond angle deviation from ideal values (°)0.944a Rmerge = :h :i |Ii(h) – 〈I(h)〉|/:h :i Ii (h), where I is the observed intensity, 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations from symmetry-related reflections, and N is redundancyb Rpim = :h [1/(N-1)]1/2 :i |Ii(h) – 〈I(h) 〉|/:h :i Ii (h), where I is the observed intensity, 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations from symmetry-related reflections, and N is redundancy Open table in a new tab DsrAB Structure and Cofactor Binding—The ;-, ;-, and ;-proteins correspond respectively to DsrA, DsrB, and DsrC. The structures of the DsrA and DsrB subunits are very similar. Both proteins can be divided into three main domains (A1/B1, A2/B2, A3/B3), which can be superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.96 Á for 321 equivalent C; atoms, despite sharing only 20% sequence identity (Fig. 1C). Apart from the three similar domains, the structures of DsrA and DsrB include N- and C-terminal tails that are distinct in the two proteins.The A1 and B1 domains (residues 19A-168A and 24B-134B, respectively) show an antiparallel four- or five-stranded ;-sheet, flanked by a pair of ;-helices with two additional helices in the N-terminal region of the A1 domain. The A2 and B2 domains (residues 169A-241A and 323A-402A and residues 135B-207B and 278B-365B, respectively) consist of a five-stranded ;-sheet bundled with several ;-helices. These domains bind a [4Fe4S] cluster (cluster 1) that is part of the siroheme-[4Fe4S] cofactor (Fig. 1, A and C). In the A2 domain, this cluster is coordinated by four cysteines (Cys-177A, -183A, -221A, -225A), which are strictly conserved among dSiRs and form the CX5CXnCX3C motif previously identified as the sequence motif for binding of the siroheme-[4Fe4S] cofactor in both aSiRs and dSiRs (5Dahl C. Kredich N.M. Deutzmann R. Truper H.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Ostrowski J. Wu J.Y. Rueger D.C. Miller B.E. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the [4Fe4S] cluster bound by DsrA is in close proximity to a sirohydrochlorin group, i.e. a siroheme that is demetallated (Fig. 2A). The sirohydrochlorin is buried in the interior of the protein and sits on the interface between DsrA and DsrB. In the B2 domain, the iron-sulfur cluster is also coordinated by four cysteines (Cys-151B, -188B, -189B, and -193B) but in a different sequence motif CXnCCX3C. The absence of the CX5CXnCX3C motif in DsrB led to the idea that this protein would not bind a siroheme-[4Fe4S] cofactor, which is now shown not to be true. The CXnCCX3C motif responsible for binding the catalytic cluster 1 in DsrB is conserved in most dSiRs (with the exception of DsrB from Pyrobaculum aerophilum, which has the same CX5CXnCX3C motif in both DsrA and DsrB) and is quite unusual in having two consecutive cysteines ligating the cluster. There are only two examples where this has been reported structurally: for cluster N2 in the Nqo6 subunit of Thermus thermophilus complex I (42Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa adenosine phosphosulfate reductase (43Chartron J. Carroll K.S. Shiau C. Gao H. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, tandem cysteine coordination of a novel [4Fe4S] cluster has also been proposed for a large family of CCG proteins (which includes DsrK) by site-directed mutagenesis (44Hamann N. Mander G.J. Shokes J.E. Scott R.A. Bennati M. Hedderich R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12875-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Close to cluster 1 of DsrB is a siroheme group that is coupled to the cluster through Cys-193B, positioned at ∼2.4 Á from both (Fig. 2B). Thus, in Dvir, the DsrB protein contains the typical exchange-coup"
https://openalex.org/W2090712955,"Background Living birds possess a unique heterogeneous pulmonary system composed of a rigid, dorsally-anchored lung and several compliant air sacs that operate as bellows, driving inspired air through the lung. Evidence from the fossil record for the origin and evolution of this system is extremely limited, because lungs do not fossilize and because the bellow-like air sacs in living birds only rarely penetrate (pneumatize) skeletal bone and thus leave a record of their presence. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a new predatory dinosaur from Upper Cretaceous rocks in Argentina, Aerosteon riocoloradensis gen. et sp. nov., that exhibits extreme pneumatization of skeletal bone, including pneumatic hollowing of the furcula and ilium. In living birds, these two bones are pneumatized by diverticulae of air sacs (clavicular, abdominal) that are involved in pulmonary ventilation. We also describe several pneumatized gastralia (“stomach ribs”), which suggest that diverticulae of the air sac system were present in surface tissues of the thorax. Conclusions/Significance We present a four-phase model for the evolution of avian air sacs and costosternal-driven lung ventilation based on the known fossil record of theropod dinosaurs and osteological correlates in extant birds: (1) Phase I—Elaboration of paraxial cervical air sacs in basal theropods no later than the earliest Late Triassic. (2) Phase II—Differentiation of avian ventilatory air sacs, including both cranial (clavicular air sac) and caudal (abdominal air sac) divisions, in basal tetanurans during the Jurassic. A heterogeneous respiratory tract with compliant air sacs, in turn, suggests the presence of rigid, dorsally attached lungs with flow-through ventilation. (3) Phase III—Evolution of a primitive costosternal pump in maniraptoriform theropods before the close of the Jurassic. (4) Phase IV—Evolution of an advanced costosternal pump in maniraptoran theropods before the close of the Jurassic. In addition, we conclude: (5) The advent of avian unidirectional lung ventilation is not possible to pinpoint, as osteological correlates have yet to be identified for uni- or bidirectional lung ventilation. (6) The origin and evolution of avian air sacs may have been driven by one or more of the following three factors: flow-through lung ventilation, locomotory balance, and/or thermal regulation."

We demonstrate that the MLL1 Win motif is highly conserved among metazoan SET1 family members and is recognized by WDR5 in a mechanism that is crucial for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro. Intriguingly, our functional results suggest that WDR5 preferentially recognizes the conserved Arg-3765 within the MLL1 Win motif using the same arginine binding site as suggested previously for histone H3. To test this hypothesis, we determined the crystal structure of WDR5 bound to a peptide derived from the MLL1 Win motif. Our results are consistent with a model in which WDR5 preferentially recognizes Arg-3765 of MLL1 using the same binding site previously suggested for histone H3. These results suggest that the previously observed histone H3-WDR5 interaction may not be relevant for the enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex.

As a final step of purification and for buffer exchange, all proteins were passed through a gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris(7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 1 μm ZnCl2. The protein was concentrated to 9 mg/ml and mixed with a stock solution of the MLL1 Win peptide (acetylGSARAEVHLRKSNH2) dissolved in the same buffer.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) using the coordinates of the previously determined structure of WDR5 (PDB code: 2H68) as a search model (17Ruthenburg A.J.

After an initial rigid body refinement, the structure was further refined with rounds of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement with a maximum likelihood target using CNS (20Brunger A.T.

Difference Fourier maps were calculated with CNS and used to locate electron density corresponding to bound peptide, and the structure was built using O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal). All experiments were performed at 20 °C in a sample buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. A 0.05 mm solution of full-length WDR5 diluted in sample buffer was placed in the sample cell, and a 0.45 mm solution of peptide made up in sample buffer was loaded into the injection syringe. For each experiment, a 180-s delay at the start of the experiment was followed by 30 injections of 10 μl of the titrant solution, spaced 300 s apart. The sample was stirred at 300 rpm throughout. Blank injections of the peptide into buffer were subtracted from the experimental titrations, and binding isotherms were fit to a theoretical titration curve describing one binding site per titrant. A nonlinear best-fit binding isotherm for the data was used to calculate the protein-titrant stoichiometry, dissociation constant, and standard change in enthalpy using the supplied manufacturer's software Origin 7.0 (Origin-Lab Corp.). We co-crystallized WDR5 with the MLL1 Win peptide consisting of amino acid residues 3762–3773 of MLL1 and determined the x-ray structure of the complex at 1.72-Å resolution (Fig. 1, Table 1). The overall structure of WDR5 is highly similar to that of previously reported structures of WDR5 bound to histone H3 peptides (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Like previously reported structures of WDR5, the present structure is formed by seven WD40 repeats or β-propeller blades that are organized around a central cavity. A water-filled tunnel connects the two openings of the cavity at the top and bottom of the structure (Fig. 1b), with the top opening having a smaller diameter. Previous structures of WDR5 bound to H3 peptides show that the N terminus of histone H3 forms a partial 310-helix when bound to the smaller opening at the top of WDR5, which is anchored by the insertion of H3R2 into the central tunnel (15Couture J.F.

In the present structure, the initial difference electron density map clearly identifies the location of the MLL1 Win peptide, which, consistent with our prediction, is located in the same position as suggested previously for histone H3 peptide binding (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Han Z. Guo L. Wang H. Shen Y. Deng X.W. Chai J. Mol.

Nine residues from the N terminus could be modeled into the density, with the last three residues of the C terminus being disordered. Consistent with the tight binding observed in ITC experiments (see below), the electron density from simulated annealing Fo – Fc omit maps covers most of the modeled peptide, even when contoured at 3σ (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Stereo view of a simulated annealing Fo – Fc omit map contoured at 3σ (gray mesh). WDR5 residues are shown in green (black labels), and MLL1 Win peptide residues are shown in yellow (red labels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Like histone H3 bound to WDR5, the N terminus of the MLL1 Win peptide forms a 310-helix that fits snuggly into the outer opening of the central cavity, like a cork in a bottle (Fig. 1). Conserved MLL1 residues GSARAE all participate in the formation of the 310-helix, which is stabilized by intramolecular i → i+3 main-chain hydrogen bonds between Ser-3763 and Ala-3766 and between Ala-3764 and Glu-3767. This configuration is further stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carboxylate side chain of Glu-3767 and the amide nitrogen of Gly-3762 (Fig. 2). This intramolecular hydrogen bond gives the sequence a cyclical conformation that allows the 310-helix to fit precisely into the outer opening of the central cavity (Fig. 1a). An extensive network of direct and water-mediated intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions stabilizes the binding of the 310-helix to the opening of the central cavity. In previous structures of WDR5 bound to histone H3 peptides, Asp-107 of WDR5 forms a salt bridge with the N terminus of the H3 peptide and coordinates a network of water molecules that fill part of the central cavity (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Han Z. Guo L. Wang H. Shen Y. Deng X.W. Chai J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present structure, these water molecules are displaced by Gly-3762 and Ser-3763 of the MLL1 Win peptide, which participate in multiple hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions with Ala-47, Ala-65, Gly-89, Ile-90, and Asp-107 (Fig. 2). It is likely that these newly observed interactions account in part for the high affinity of WDR5 for the MLL1 Win peptide (Fig. 3). Indeed, the high quality of density at the N-terminal end of the peptide suggests that additional residues at the N terminus could show additional interactions. However, ITC binding experiments with a peptide containing six additional residues on the N terminus shows identical affinity with that of the shorter peptide used for crystallization (Fig. 3), suggesting that the peptide used in this investigation captures most if not all of the important interactions. Ala-3764 and Arg-3765 of the MLL1 Win peptide occupy similar positions as Ala-1 and Arg-2 of the H3 peptide in the previously reported H3-WDR5 complexes (Fig. 4). As in previous structures, the side chain of Arg-3765 of MLL1 inserts into the central tunnel of WDR5 and is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bond, π -π and cation-π, and hydrophobic interactions with WDR5 residues: Ser-91, Phe-133, Ser-175, Ser-218, Cys-261, Phe-263, and Ile-305 (Fig. 2). As previously noted for Arg-2 of histone H3 (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it is likely that the sum of these interactions accounts for the majority of the binding energy between MLL1 and WDR5, which explains why mutation of Arg-3765 in MLL1 is sufficient to abolish the assembly and dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This suggests a reason for the conservation of Arg-3765 in MLL1 orthologs and other SET1 family members. In addition, the guanidinium moiety of Arg-3765 is sandwiched between the conserved aromatic side chains of Phe-133 and Phe-263 of WDR5, which are important for the interaction. This probably explains why the replacement of Phe-133 with alanine significantly diminishes the interaction between MLL1 and the WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L subcomplex in vitro (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in vivo (12Dou Y. Milne T.A. Ruthenburg A.J. Lee S. Lee J.W. Verdine G.L. Allis C.D. Roeder R.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Amino acids on the C-terminal side of Arg-3765 in the MLL1 Win peptide also participate in a number of intermolecular interactions with WDR5. Ala-3766 of MLL1 interacts with Ala-47 and Tyr-260 of WDR5. The aromatic ring of Tyr-260 lines the outer edge of the central cavity and makes van der Waals contacts with Ala-3766, Glu-3767, and Val-3768 of the MLL Win peptide (Fig. 2). Glu-3767 of the MLL1 Win peptide occupies a similar position as Lys-4 of the histone H3 peptide in previous structures with WDR5 (Fig. 4). However, in contrast to previous structures in which the side chain of H3K4 was poorly ordered (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the side chain of Glu-3767 is well ordered in the present structure (Fig. 2). This is due to direct and water-mediated intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving the side chain carboxylate of Glu-3767 and the main chain amides of Gly-3762 and Val-3768. This may explain the high sequence conservation of Glu-3767 in SET1 family members (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-3767 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Tyr-191. The last two residues of the MLL1 Win peptide that could be modeled into the density include His-3769 and Leu-3770, the latter of which was less ordered. The main chain of His-3769 participates in water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Lys-259, whereas the side chain of His-3769 forms hydrogen bond, van der Waals, and T-stacking interactions with WDR5 residues: Phe-149, Asp-172, Pro-173, and Tyr-191. This results in the imidazole of His-3769 being well ordered, even when contoured at 3-σ. Leu-3770 is less ordered than previous residues and does not appear to make any interactions with WDR5. It is likely that these newly observed interactions account in part for the greater affinity of the MLL1 Win peptide when compared with previously published values for histone H3 peptide binding to free WDR5. ITC measurements show that the MLL1 Win peptide binds to WDR5 with an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of 1.7 ± 0.1 μm (Fig. 3), which is between 3- and 45-fold lower than that previously reported for the binding of dimethylated histone H3K4 peptides to WDR5 using a similar technique (15Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Schuetz A. Allali-Hassani A. Martin F. Loppnau P. Vedadi M. Bochkarev A. Plotnikov A.N. Arrowsmith C.H. Min J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the affinity observed in ITC experiments does not appear to completely recapitulate the full interaction surface between MLL1 and WDR5, which interact with a Kd of ∼0.12 μm in solution when measured by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as shown in the accompanying investigation, the same MLL1 Win peptide specifically inhibits the dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex by dissociating the catalytic SET domain of MLL1 from the regulatory WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L subcomplex (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the recognition of Arg-3765 of MLL1 by WDR5 is crucial for the interaction between WDR5 and MLL1. As demonstrated in the accompanying investigation (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), this interaction is essential for the assembly and activity of the MLL1 core complex. Because the MLL1 Win motif is highly conserved among metazoan SET1 family members (22Patel A. Vought V.E. Dharmarajan V. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32162-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), these results can probably be generalized for the interaction of WDR5 with other SET1 family histone methyltransferases.

https://openalex.org/W2094891612,"Preclinical and clinical evaluations of individual proangiogenic/arteriogenic factors for the treatment of ischemic myocardium and skeletal muscle have produced unfulfilled promises. The establishment of functional and stable arterial vascular networks may require combinations of different angiogenic and arteriogenic factors. Using in vivo angiogenesis and ischemic hind-limb animal models, we have compared the angiogenic and therapeutic activities of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in combinations with PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB, two members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, with distinct receptor binding patterns. We show that both PDGF-AA/FGF-2 and PDGF-AB/FGF-2 in combinations synergistically induce angiogenesis in the mouse cornea. FGF-2 up-regulates PDGFR-alpha and -beta expression levels in the newly formed blood vessels. Interestingly, PDGF-AB/FGF-2, but not PDGF-AA/FGF-2, is able to stabilize the newly formed vasculature by recruiting pericytes, and an anti-PDGFR-beta neutralizing antibody significantly blocks PDGF-AB/FGF-2-induced vessel stability. These findings demonstrate that PDGFR-beta receptor is essential for vascular stability. Similarly, PDGF-AB/FGF-2 significantly induces stable collateral growth in the rat ischemic hind limb. The high number of collaterals induced by PDGF-AB/FGF-2 leads to dramatic improvement of the paw's skin perfusion. Immunohistochemical analysis of the treated skeletal muscles confirms that a combination of PDGF-AB and FGF-2 significantly induces arteriogenesis in the ischemic tissue. A combination of PDGF-AB and FGF-2 would be optimal proangiogenic agents for the treatment of ischemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2039782318,"Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases targeted by the second messenger diacylglycerol. It has been implicated in many important cellular processes and pathological conditions. However, further analysis of PKD in these processes is severely hampered by the lack of a PKD-specific inhibitor that can be readily applied to cells and in animal models. We now report the discovery of the first potent and selective cell-active small molecule inhibitor for PKD, benzoxoloazepinolone (CID755673). This inhibitor was identified from the National Institutes of Health small molecule repository library of 196,173 compounds using a human PKD1 (PKCmu)-based fluorescence polarization high throughput screening assay. CID755673 suppressed half of the PKD1 enzyme activity at 182 nm and exhibited selective PKD1 inhibition when compared with AKT, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), CDK activating kinase (CAK), CAMKIIalpha, and three different PKC isoforms. Moreover, it was not competitive with ATP for enzyme inhibition. In cell-based assays, CID755673 blocked phorbol ester-induced endogenous PKD1 activation in LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Functionally, CID755673 inhibited the known biological actions of PKD1 including phorbol ester-induced class IIa histone deacetylase 5 nuclear exclusion, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and the ilimaquinone-induced Golgi fragmentation. Moreover, CID755673 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion. In summary, our findings indicate that CID755673 is a potent and selective PKD1 inhibitor with valuable pharmacological and cell biological potential."
https://openalex.org/W1969916539,"Human carbonyl reductase 1 (hCBR1) is an NADPH-dependent short chain dehydrogenase/reductase with broad substrate specificity and is thought to be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds including xenobiotics.

It has been suggested that the GSH-binding site is near the active site; however, no structures with GSH or GSH conjugates have been reported.

This is in contrast to other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, such as 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 and 2 that interconvert cortisone and cortisol, and the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, which have well defined androgen and estrogen substrates. Previously reported substrates of hCBR1 include prostaglandins and xenobiotics such as the anti-cancer anthracyclin doxorubicin and the vitamin K2 precursor menadione (1Forrest G.L. Gonzalez B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). More recently, hCBR1 has been linked to the detoxification of reactive aldehydes such as 4-oxonon-2-enal and its GSH conjugate that are believed to play a central role in oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (2Doorn J.A. Maser E. Blum A. Claffey D.J. Petersen D.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13106-13114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although extensive biological investigations of hCBR1, including RNA interference, pharmacology, and crystallography of human hCBR1 in complex with substrate mimics, have been carried out (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the endogenous physiological substrate(s) of this enzyme remain to be defined. One well accepted aspect of hCBR1 substrate recognition is the presence of a GSH-binding pocket predicted to be in close proximity to the catalytic site. GSH conjugates of otherwise poorly recognized substrates such as prostaglandin A1 are reduced by hCBR1 (4Tinguely J.N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), supporting this hypothesis. To identify additional physiological substrates of hCBR1, we initiated a structural biology effort to analyze the GSH-binding site of hCBR1, hypothesizing that cellular GSH adducts might serve as particularly good hCBR1 substrates. human carbonyl reductase 1 S-nitrosoglutathione S-hydroxymethylglutathione 3-(1-tert-butyl-4-amino-1H-indazol-3-yl)phenol human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase human carbonyl reductase 1 S-nitrosoglutathione S-hydroxymethylglutathione 3-(1-tert-butyl-4-amino-1H-indazol-3-yl)phenol human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase We solved the x-ray co-crystal structure of hCBR1 in complex with GSH, demonstrating that the GSH-binding pocket lies within the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. To next assess the viability of other candidate substrates, we attempted to obtain crystals of hCBR1 with GSH adducts of reported hCBR1 substrates (e.g. prostaglandin A1-GSH and Menadione-GSH) as well as other cellular GSH adducts not known to be hCBR1 substrates like formaldehyde-GSH. We were able to obtain diffraction quality crystals and solve the structure of the GSH-formaldehyde conjugate, hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH), in complex with hCBR1, but we were unable to co-crystallize other reported GSH adduct substrates. Although HMGSH is a thio-hemiacetal that cannot be reduced by hCBR1 because of the low reduction potential of NADPH, we considered the possibility that other physiological isosteres of HMGSH might be efficient substrates. We found that the nitrogen-containing GSH adduct S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an efficient substrate of hCBR1, which implicates this enzyme in physiological GSNO catabolism.

The reactions contained 100 μm NADPH in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and either 252 nm or 126 nm hCBR1. GSNO substrate was prepared by combining stoichiometric amounts (0.5 m each) of GSH, sodium nitrite, and HCl. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (1 mm) was added to prevent decomposition because of metal ion contamination. The yield of GSNO was verified spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorption of the created SNO group at 335 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.92 mm-1 cm-1. The aqueous GSNO solution was added to samples to achieve concentrations of 151.4, 75.7, 37.85, 30.3, 22.7, and 15.1 μm. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate. The initial rates were calculated from the absorbance decrease (340 nm) using a combined extinction coefficient of 7.06 mm-1 cm-1 for GSNO and NADPH (14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and were applied to the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for Km determination. The kcat was determined at saturating substrate concentration (200 μm NADPH and 200 μm GSNO) using hCBR1 that had been purified by size exclusion chromatography (5Bateman R. Rauh D. Shokat K.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and never frozen. Determination of NADPH and GSNO Stoichiometry—Reactions were prepared in the manner described for Km determination except substrate concentrations including 100 μm NADPH and 50 μm GSNO, 50 μm NADPH and 100 μm GSNO, or 50 μm NADPH and 50 μm GSNO. Stock solutions of GSNO contained diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (1 mm), and the concentration was verified spectrophotometrically (as above). The reactions were performed in triplicate, and the combined decrease in NAD(P)H and GSNO absorbance was determined at the end point for each reaction. Additionally, reaction stoichiometry was determined for human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (hFDH) (15Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) in an analogous manner using NADH. Determination of Nitrite, Hydroxylamine, and Ammonia—The samples (1 ml) were prepared containing 250 mm sodium phosphate, 200 μm GSNO (prepared as above), and 200 μm of either NADH or NADPH. The reactions were initiated by the addition of FDH or hCBR1 respectively and allowed to continue for 1 h at 25 °C. Absorbance was monitored at 340 nm to verify that the reactions were complete. The samples were maintained at -80 °C until analyzed. For all of the determinations, the standards were prepared in the assay buffer (250 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). Nitrite concentration was determined by use of the modified Greiss reagent (Sigma) using the manufacturer's protocol. Hydroxylamine concentration was determined in a manner analogous to those previously described (14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.4) was added to 100-μl sample. Then 200 μl of 1! (v/v) 8-hydroxyquinoline in 50! aqueous ethanol was added with mixing and followed by 200 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. The samples were heated to 95 °C for 7 min and cooled on ice for 1 h, and the absorbance (750 nm) was determined. The hydroxylamine concentration was determined by comparing the sample absorbances to a standard curve prepared with samples containing hydroxylamine·HCl. Ammonia concentration was determined following instructions in the Sigma ammonia diagnostic kit. The standards were prepared using ammonium sulfate in assay buffer. GSNO Reductase Activity from A549 Cell Lysates—A549 cells were cultured using F-12K medium containing 10! fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Following removal of medium, the cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1! Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysates were subsequently clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min), and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The activities were determined spectrophotometrically as above by subtracting the background rate of NADPH/GSNO reduction in the absence of lysate. The reactions were performed in triplicate using 1-cm-path length cuvettes containing 100 μm NADPH or NADH with and without the addition of 100 μm OH-PP-Me (supplemental Fig. S1) (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sodium phosphate (50 mm, pH 6.8) and GSNO (100 μm) were present in all reactions. Binding Mode of GSH and HMGSH to hCBR1—Human carbonyl reductase 1 is an enzyme with extremely broad substrate specificity capable of recognizing large anthracyclin anticancer agents such as daunorubicin as well as autocoids such as prostaglandins (1Forrest G.L. Gonzalez B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which hCBR1 is thought to tolerate divergent carbonyl-containing substrates is through a common glutathione co-factor-binding site that enables recognition of GSH adduct substrates. We sought to first understand how GSH can deliver substrates to the catalytic machinery of hCBR1 using x-ray crystallography. We recently solved the crystal structure of hCBR1 in complex with a substrate-mimic inhibitor (OH-PP) of the enzyme (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although x-ray structures of both the porcine and hCBR1 enzymes have been reported, and both are known to contain functional GSH-binding sites, the location of the GSH-binding site has not been defined structurally. Our attempts to co-crystallize hCBR1 with GSH did not yield protein crystals. Instead, we utilized soaking experiments to introduce GSH into hCBR1 crystals already containing NADP and the substrate mimic OH-PP (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The crystals diffracted to 1.6 Å allowing high resolution analysis of hCBR1 with NADP, OH-PP, and GSH bound. The binding site for GSH is located in the cleft of the enzyme active site with the GSH-Cys oriented toward the nicotinamide moiety of the NADP co-factor and the OH-PP substrate mimic. Because GSH adducts are appended from the GSH-Cys, it appears that the orientation of GSH in these crystals is consistent with the putative mechanism of substrate recognition of GSH adducts (supplemental Fig. S2). Interactions between GSH and hCBR1 are mediated along the entire GSH tripeptide structure, predominantly by polar main chain interactions including the carboxylate of the γ-Glu to Ala192 NH and Tyr193 NH (2.9 Å and 2.8 Å), the cysteinyl NH to the Phe94 carbonyl (2.1 Å), and the glycine carboxylate to Val96 NH (2.9 Å) (Fig. 1, a and b). Interestingly, in addition to the Ala192 and Tyr193 main chain interactions, the α-carboxyl moiety of γ-Glu in GSH is positioned above the N-terminal end of a helix (Ser190–Arg209) and binds isostructurally to the sulfate ion found in the hCBR1·NADP·OH-PP structure (Protein Data Bank code 1WMA). The hydrogen bond between the α-amine of GSH and Q105 Oϵ1 (3.0 Å) is the only side chain interaction observed. Thus, the unique structural aspect of the iso-peptide bond between Glu and Cys in GSH is recognized through multiple protein ligand interactions in hCBR1. The structure of GSH bound to hCBR1 reveals the glutathione-binding pocket but does not further reveal how adducts of GSH can deliver structurally diverse carbonyl-containing compounds to the NADPH co-factor. To address this issue we made GSH adducts with menadione, prostaglandin A1, and formaldehyde, although the latter is not a competent substrate of the enzyme, and it does not contain a carbonyl moiety. The only complex that produced x-ray quality crystals was that of HMGSH, HO-PP, and NADP, which diffracted to 1.5 Å. The binding mode of HMGSH to hCBR1 was found to be isostructural to GSH (Fig. 1, c and d). Hydrogen bonding interactions are evident between Gln105 Oϵ1 and the α-amine of GSH (3.2 Å). The glutamyl carboxylate is anchored to Ala192 NH (2.9 Å) and Tyr193 NH (2.8 Å), the cysteinyl NH to Phe94 carbonyl (2.0 Å), and the glutamyl carboxylate to Val96 NH (2.8 Å) (Fig. 1, c and d). Interestingly, an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of HMGSH and the glutamyl carbonyl (2.4 Å) is apparent. HMGSH is not a carbonyl-containing adduct and is not a substrate for reduction by hCBR1. HMGSH has been shown to be degraded oxidatively to S-formylglutathione by the NADH-dependent enzyme FDH (17Koivusalo M. Lapatto R. Uotila L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 372: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Uotila L. Koivusalo M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 414: 365-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hCBR1 has not been shown to oxidize its substrates using NADP. Nonetheless, we asked whether hCBR1/NADP could oxidize HMGSH. We observed no catalysis of this reaction (data not shown). The crystallographic effort to understand GSH substrate recognition unfortunately did not lead to a competent substrate-containing structure for hCBR1, leading us to focus on a crystal form of the enzyme that might be more catalytically relevant. In this regard, all of our crystals contained OH-PP, a carbonyl substrate mimic poised in contact with the catalytic triad of the active site (Ser139, Tyr193, and Lys197) and adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of NADP. Although the presence of this ligand greatly facilitated crystal formation, we sought a crystal without this ligand bound. Through extensive crystal screening, we were able to solve the structure of apo hCBR1 containing only the NADP co-factor. These crystals grew under different conditions in the space group P43212 and diffracted to 2.2 Å. Comparison of the active site geometry of the OH-PP bound structures of hCBR1 with apo hCBR1 revealed no major loop movements or other major changes to the structure, with the exception of a significant side chain rotation of Cys226 (160°) lining the substrate-binding site. This cysteine movement is coincident with the movement of Phe267 adjacent to the Cys226. Interestingly, the former position of Cys226 Sγ is occupied by a chloride ion that is coordinated between the main chain amides of Ile140 (3.2 Å), Gly228 (3.3 Å), and Cys5 of the nicotinamide co-factor (3.5 Å) (Fig. 2). The movement of Cys226 and occupancy of the Sγ position by a chloride ion explains a previously reported feature of an hCBR1 C226A mutant. The C226A mutant variant was reported to be catalytically inactive, but high concentrations of chloride (200 mm) rescued activity of the enzyme (4Tinguely J.N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, apparently either a negatively charged halide (chloride) or cysteinyl thiolate in the vicinity of Ile140/Gly228 and the nicotinamide co-factor is necessary for catalytic activity. The anion-binding site is located at the N terminus of helix αF′-1. The dipole of this helix is likely to lower the pKa of the Cys226 side chain and to coordinate either the thiolate or chloride anion (see Fig. 3). By soaking experiments, the chloride could be replaced by bromide or iodide, which could be readily visualized crystallography (data not shown). The availability of four crystal structures of hCBR1 with different substrates and substrate mimetics allowed an assessment of relative flexibility of the binding pocket with respect to GSH binding. An overlay of four hCBR1 structures (Fig. 3) reveals flexibility in the loop region formed between Lys95 and Pro102 in four structures of hCBR1. This loop contains critical residues that form a tight complex upon GSH binding. For example the main chain movement of this loop displaces the Val96 NH by 1.0 Å upon introduction of GSH by soaking. The flexibility of the loop contacting GSH in multiple structures suggests there is plasticity in the ability to accommodate GSH substrate adducts of different sizes and is consistent with the broad substrate specificity of hCBR1. We cannot be certain, however, that binding orientation of GSH in the GSH structure with OH-PP represents the binding orientation of this GSH adducts when a substrate mimic inhibitor OH-PP is not present. GSNO Reduction by hCBR1—Considering that the only adduct of GSH we were able to structurally visualize in the hCBR1 active site contains a hydroxymethylene substituent from formaldehyde and that this adduct (HMGSH) is not a substrate for the enzyme led us to consider isosteres of HMGSH as new substrates. A physiological GSH adduct, GSNO, involved in nitric oxide metabolism, is a very close structural analog of HMGSH. GSNO contains an N for CH2 substitution of HMGSH. Furthermore, the NADH-dependent enzyme FDH is able to reduce GSNO, suggesting that the NADPH-dependent hCBR1 would be capable of the same chemistry. GSNO reduction by hCBR1 was assessed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in GSNO and NADPH absorbance at 340 nm. GSNO was prepared from equimolar quantities of GSH, HCl, and NaNO2 and was efficiently reduced by hCBR1 in an NADPH-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S3). hCBR1 appears specific for the GSNO S-nitrosothiol over similar S-nitrosothiols because reduction of S-nitrosocysteine is not catalyzed by hCBR1 (supplemental Fig. S4). The kinetic constants for GSNO reduction by hCBR1 (Table 2) are comparable with those of its best known substrate, menadione.TABLE 2Comparison of kinetic constants for hCBR1- and hFDH-catalyzed GSNO reduction using NADPH and NADH, respectivelyEnzymeSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin–1mm–1 min–1hCBR1GSNO30.1 ± 3.6450 ± 8514,950hCBR1Menadione (4Tinguely J.N.

Therefore, we investigated the products following reduction of the S-NO bond of GSNO by hCBR1 (Fig. 3). Multiple mechanisms of GSNO reduction by hFDH have been proposed (14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Hedberg J.J. Griffiths W.J. Nilsson S.J. Hoog J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In some cases the released GSH may participate in further reduction of intermediate products (Scheme 1). First, to distinguish stoichiometric reduction from other possibilities, we determined the reaction stoichiometry of hCBR1-catalyzed reduction of GSNO by NADPH. We found the reaction stoichiometry to be nearly 1:1 as determined by carrying out reactions with limiting amounts of either GSNO or NADPH; the same reaction stoichiometry was observed following NADH-dependent GSNO reduction by hFDH (supplemental Fig. S5). Given that the reaction stoichiometry is the same, we postulated that the products of both hFDH and hCBR1-catalyzed reactions might be similar. Products formed from the NADH-dependent nitrosoglutathione reductase, hFDH, have been characterized (Scheme 1 and Ref. 14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). With the hFDH enzyme, it is believed that hydride transfer occurs directly to the S-nitrosothiol nitrogen to form an “immediate” product that rearranges to form glutathione sulfinamide and can further be hydrolyzed to glutathione sulfinic acid and ammonia (14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). During these reactions, several measurable products, hydroxylamine, ammonia, and nitrite are produced. We performed a side by side comparison of hFDH and hCBR1-catalyzed GSNO reduction with NADH and NADPH, respectively. Table 3 shows the concentrations of products of both enzyme-catalyzed reactions to be very similar. The most abundant product detected for both hFDH- and hCBR1-catalyzed reactions was hydroxylamine, whereas unaccounted product(s) comprise ∼84! of theoretical yield for both hFDH- and hCBR1-catalyzed reactions. More detailed observations on hFDH (14Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggest that this distribution of products reflects glutathione sulfinamide being the primary product. Given the similarity of product distributions and reaction stoichiometry of hCBR1- and hFDH-catalyzed GSNO reduction, it is likely that glutathione sulfinamide is also the primary product of hCBR1-catalyzed GSNO reduction.TABLE 3Quantitation of hydroxylamine, ammonia, and nitrite for reactions prepared with 200 μm GSNO, 200 μm NADH (hFDH), or 200 μm NADPH (hCBR1) in 250 mm sodium phosphate pH 6.8NH2OHNH3NO2-UnaccountedμmμmμmhCBR130 ± 34.6 ± 0.4<15165hFDH23 ± 55.7 ± 0.4<15171No enzymeaThe background measurements were made in the absence of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid14 ± 101.0 ± 1.031 ± 1154a The background measurements were made in the absence of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid Open table in a new tab hCBR1-dependent GSNO Reductase Activity in Cell Lysates—To assess whether hCBR1 could contribute to cellular GSNO reduction, we assessed GSNO reduction in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which have previously been used to investigate hCBR1 function (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because multiple enzymes could be responsible for observed GSNO reduction, we used the different co-factor (NADH versus NADPH) specificity of the reported GSNO reductase hFDH to differentiate between the two enzymes (hCBR1 utilizes NADPH exclusively, whereas hFDH exclusively uses NADH). Further, we needed to rule out nonenzyme-catalyzed reduction in the cell lysate, reduction caused by other enzymes like the thioredoxin system that may utilize NADPH for the homolytic cleavage of GSNO (20Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and reduction by yet unidentified GSNO reductases. To distinguish between the hCBR1-dependent reductase activity in cell lysates from other NADPH-dependent GSNO reductases, we relied on an inhibitor of hCBR1, OH-PP-Me (supplemental Fig. S1) (3Tanaka M. Bateman R. Rauh D. Vaisberg E. Ramachandani S. Zhang C. Hansen K.C. Burlingame A.L. Trautman J.K. Shokat K.M. Adams C.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 764-776Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Significant NADH-dependent GSNO reductase activity was measured in A549 cell lysates as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (Fig. 4). This activity is likely due to hFDH activity. Consistent with this expectation, the hCBR1 inhibitor OH-PP-Me does not inhibit NADH-dependent GSNO reduction. We find significantly higher overall NADPH-dependent GSNO reductase activity in the A549 cell lysates. The addition of OH-PP-Me inhibits ∼30! of the NADPH-dependent activity, suggesting that this fraction of cellular GSNO reduction may be catalyzed by hCBR1. No decrease in NADH-dependent GSNO reduction was evident in the presence of OH-PP-Me (Fig. 4). Although nearly all NADH-dependent GSNO reductase activity in cells is attributable to hFDH (15Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), there is significant remaining NADPH-dependent activity when A549 cell lysates are treated with the hCBR1 inhibitor OH-PP-Me (Fig. 4). The source of this NADPH-dependent activity may be associated with homolytic cleavage by the thioredoxin system (20Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) or a yet undiscovered GSNO reductase. Relevance of the First Reported NADPH-dependent GSNO Reductase-hCBR1—Glutathione, which is present in cells at up to 10 mm concentration, has the ability to react with NO in cells to form GSNO, the concentration of which is tightly regulated and maintained in the micromolar range (21Gaston B. Singel D. Doctor A. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 2006; 173: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The importance of regulating GSNO concentration is evident given its functions as a carrier of nitric oxide, which may include roles in microbial host defense, smooth muscle relaxation, bronchiolar dilation, and transcription factor regulation (22Fang K. Johns R. Macdonald T. Kinter M. Gaston B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L716-L721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Que L.G. Liu L. Yan Y. Whitehead G.S. Gavett S.H. Schwartz D.A. Stamler J.S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although several enzymes have been reported to degrade GSNO (25Hogg N. Singh R.J. Konorev E. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Hou Y. Guo Z. Li J. Wang P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7828-7834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), only GSH-dependent FDH has been shown to regulate endogenous levels of GSNO (15Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) by use of a nicotinamide co-factor. This enzyme is unusual in that it utilizes NADH for reduction rather than the usual in vivo reductant, NADPH. Although the Km values of hCBR1 and hFDH for GSNO are similar, hFDH does exhibit a 5-fold greater kcat value. This increased catalytic efficiency of hFDH may allow the enzyme to function in the presence of low NADH levels. The physiological relevance of these enzymes depends on the co-factor environment they operate in, and in that regard physiological levels of NADPH in cell have been found to be elevated with respect to NADP, whereas NAD+ levels are maintained higher than NADH. This implies NADPH is the universal reducing equivalent in vivo rather than NADH, and indeed, NAD+-dependent enzymes generally operate in the oxidizing direction (31Ying W. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Although nicotinamide co-factor concentrations have not been determined in A549 cells, rat liver cytosolic analysis of these co-factors has indicated ratios of [NADH]/[NAD+] = 0.0015, and [NADPH]/[NADP] = 162.5 (28Veech R. Eggleston L. Krebs H. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 29Williamson D. Lund P. Krebs H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The total liver concentration of NAD+ and NADH has been reported to be 1.0 μmol/g, and the total NADP and NADPH concentration is ∼0.1 μmol/g (30Reiss P.D. Zuurendonk P.F. Veech R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of these data are consistent with a co-factor environment where NADPH is the general purpose reducing equivalent and is in sufficient concentration to support hCBR1 function. Unlike the thioredoxin system that consumes NADPH during homolytic cleavage of GSNO (releasing GSH and NO), hCBR1 represents the only known NADPH-dependent reductase that results in GSNO catabolism. We have identified hCBR1 as an NADPH-dependent GSNO reducing enzyme (Km = 30 μm, kcat = 450 min-1). GSNO is reduced by hCBR1 with kinetic constants comparable with the best previously reported substrates of hCBR1, suggesting that GSNO may be as important an hCBR1 substrate as the many xenobiotic substrates of the enzyme. The fact that hCBR1 seems to be responsible for substantial fraction of the GSNO reductase activity in at least one cell type may suggest that this enzyme is at least partially responsible for regulation of NO/GSNO levels in tissues.

To test this directly in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse with targeted mutation of Ser1928 to alanine. This mutation did not affect basal L-type current characteristics or regulation of the L-type current by PKA and the β-adrenergic receptor, whereas the mutation abolished phosphorylation of Cav1.2 by PKA. Therefore, our data show that PKA phosphorylation of Ser1928 of Cav1.2 is not functionally involved in β-adrenergic stimulation of Cav1.2-mediated Ca2+ influx into the cardiomyocyte.

This mechanism most likely plays a critical role in physiological processes in the heart, e.g. excitation-contraction coupling, the regulation of inotropy and chronotropy, as well as pathological processes such as heart failure (for review see Refs. 3.Bers D.M.

The molecular basis of ICaL regulation by PKA could not be defined conclusively so far (5.Kamp T.J. Hell J.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This is mainly due to the fact that the extent of regulation of ICaL activity by PKA in experiments in transfected cells (10–50% increase) falls well short of the magnitude recorded in native cardiac cells (200–400% increase). It seems likely that regulatory influences not reproduced in heterologous expression systems are important for the control of the activity of cardiac Ca2+ channels in vivo (2.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). It is a widely accepted finding that phosphorylation of Ser1928 of the Cav1.2 L-type channel subunit is necessary for β-adrenergic regulation of ICaL (5.Kamp T.J. Hell J.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 6.Hulme J.T. Westenbroek R.E. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amino acid Ser1928, which is located in the intracellular C terminus of Cav1.2, has been reported to be the only detectable in vivo and in vitro PKA phosphorylation site of the Cav1.2 subunit (6.Hulme J.T.

Electrophysiological studies using heterologous expression of the Cav1.2 subunit reported contrary findings, i.e. stimulation (11.Sculptoreanu A. Rotman E. Takahashi M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10135-10139Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or no stimulation (12.Zong X. Schreieck J. Mehrke G. Welling A. Schuster A. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of ICaL by PKA when only the Cav1.2 subunit was expressed. In contrast, the necessity of coexpression and phosphorylation of the Cavβ2a subunit was reported (13.Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, the functional importance of Cavβ2a phosphorylation for β-adrenergic regulation of ICaL has been questioned (14.Miriyala J. Nguyen T. Yue D.T. Colecraft H.M. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: E54-E64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Regardless of these findings, mutation of Cav1.2 Ser1928 to alanine prevented phosphorylation and regulation of the channel by PKA in heterologous expression systems (15.Gui P. Wu X. Ling S. Stotz S.C. Winkfein R.J. Wilson E. Davis G.E. Braun A.P. Zamponi G.W. Davis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14015-14025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16.Gao T.

Dell'Acqua M.L. Sather W.A. Neuron. 2007; 55: 261-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, Ganesan et al. (18.Ganesan A.N. Maack C. Johns D.C. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: E11-E18Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) postulated that at least 70% of the β-adrenergic regulation of ICaL in virally transducted heart cells cannot be attributed to the Ser1928 phosphorylation event. However, the viral infection system by Ganesan et al. (18.Ganesan A.N. Maack C. Johns D.C. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: E11-E18Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) only partially reconstituted the regulation of ICaL (the PKA-mediated increase in current was only 50%). On the other hand, Hulme et al. (6.Hulme J.T. Westenbroek R.E. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16574-16579Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) recently correlated β-adrenergic stimulation with phosphorylation of Ser1928 and functional up-regulation of ICaL in intact ventricular myocytes. In addition to these findings, Oliveria et al. (17.Oliveria S.F. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sather W.A. Neuron. 2007; 55: 261-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) postulated a critical role for the Ser1928 phosphorylation in the PKA-mediated regulation of Cav1.2 channels in HEK293 cells and neurons. To analyze this controversial issue in intact, untransfected, native cardiomyocytes containing the complete regulatory system, we generated a knock-in mouse line carrying the Cav1.2S1928A mutation. Generation of Mice Lacking the Ser1928 Phosphorylation Site on Cav1.2—To construct the targeting vector, a 7.4-kb fragment containing exons 44–47 of CACNA1C was isolated from 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA. The targeting vector included a 1.2-kb short arm and 6.2-kb long arm with PGK-neo and the thymidine kinase gene (tk) flanked by two loxP sites. The 3′-side long arm contained exon 45 with the phosphorylation site, serine 1928, mutated to alanine. All mutation procedures were carried out by overlap PCR mutagenesis. The targeting construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells (129/Sv×129/Sv-CP F1) (19.Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot using an outer probe (5′-probe in Fig. 1a). Two positive clones were transfected with a Cre-expressing plasmid to delete the neo/tk marker genes. Five clones with the deletion event were injected in C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeras were crossed to C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous mice were bred to produce homozygotes. The intercross of heterozygotes resulted in production of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous offspring at almost the expected Mendelian ratio (125:215:88). For all analyses, mice with 129/Sv and C57BL/6 hybrid genetic background (Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2) were used. All procedures relating to animal care and treatment conformed to the institutional and Regierung von Oberbayern guidelines. Preparation and Solubilization of Membranes and GST Fusion Proteins—All preparative steps were performed at 4 °C using precooled solutions containing the protease inhibitor mixture (2 μl/ml; Sigma), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 mmol/liter), calpain inhibitor I (8 μg/ml), and calpain inhibitor II (8 μg/ml). Hearts from adult mice were frozen and pulverized under liquid N2 in a porcelain mortar and then resuspended in membrane preparation buffer containing 300 mmol/liter sucrose, 75 mmol/liter NaCl, 20 mmol/liter EDTA, 20 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (1 ml/100 mg of tissue). Homogenates were centrifuged two times at 4,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove larger cell fragments, including nuclei. Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (50,000 rpm at 4 °C) for 30 min, and channels were solubilized for 20 min on ice with 1% deoxycholate, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. Nonsoluble material was removed by a second ultracentrifugation step (50,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—The anti-Cav1.2 and -Cavβ2a antibodies have been described previously (20.Moosmang S. Schulla V. Welling A. Feil R. Feil S. Wegener J.W. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6027-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 21.Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against the catalytic (PKAc) and regulatory subunits (RIIα and RIIβ) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purchased from BD Biosciences. The antibodies against GST and against the β1-adrenergic receptor were obtained from Calbiochem and Upstate, respectively. The phosphospecific antibody against Ser(P)1928 was generated by CovalAb against the peptide NH2-CLGRRA(pS)FHLECLK-COOH. The sensitivity and specificity of the phospho-specific antibody were confirmed utilizing GST fusion proteins/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/incubation with phosphorylated antigenic peptide (CovalAb). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Thesolubilizedmembranes from heart were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) to remove proteins that bind to the resin nonspecifically. After removal of the Sepharose beads by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated on ice with antibodies. After 2.5 h, protein A-Sepharose was added; samples were tilted for 1 h, and the resins were washed and extracted with 1:6 (v/v) SDS sample buffer (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For total cellular protein analysis, hearts were homogenized in lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mmol/liter, Tris, pH 7.4). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and probed with antibodies by using a chemiluminescence detection system or nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described in Ref. 20.Moosmang S. Schulla V. Welling A. Feil R. Feil S. Wegener J.W. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6027-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar. To quantitatively evaluate Ser1928 phosphorylation, blots were first probed with anti-phospho-Ser1928 antibody and subsequently with anti-Cav1.2 antibody to correct for variability in the amount of total Cav1.2. The ratio of the anti-phospho-Ser1928 antibody to the anti-Cav1.2 signal was determined for each sample by blot densitometry using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Ratios were normalized to the ratio of the control animals. Phosphorylation with PKA—For PKA phosphorylation reactions, full-length Cav1.2 was immunoprecipitated with the Cav1.2-specific antibody, and immune complexes were captured on protein A-Sepharose. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Precipitated complexes were resuspended in phosphorylation buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/liter HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter EGTA, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol). Phosphorylation was carried out by mixing the Sepharose pellets with 33 μmol/liter Mg-[γ-32P]ATP (6.6 μCi/reaction). The reaction, initiated by the addition of 5 units of PKAc (Sigma) to either the GST fusion proteins or immunoprecipitated Cav1.2 complexes, was carried out at 23 °C for 5 min (GST fusion proteins) or 10 min (immunoprecipitated Cav1.2 complexes) and terminated by boiling in 1:6 (v/v) SDS sample buffer. Importantly, phosphorylation without the addition of exogenous PKAc yielded no detectable autoradiography signals under these conditions. Proteins were separated on 10 or 12.5% SDS gels, and incorporated 32Pi was detected by autoradiography. To quantitatively evaluate the autoradiography signals, the ratio of the intensity of each signal was determined for each sample using a Fujix Bas1000 PhosphorImager and Aida 2.11 software. Signal intensities were normalized to the signal in the control preparations. Cell Isolation—Ventricular myocytes were isolated as described (AfCS Procedure Protocol PP00000125), maintained at 37 °C, and aerated with 98% O2, 2% CO2. Electrophysiology—Calcium currents (ICa) were recorded in whole-cell mode at room temperature from rod-shaped, striated, calcium-tolerant myocytes within 1–24 h of isolation. The extracellular solution contained 140 mm tetraethylammonium·Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes (1–2 megohms) were filled with an intracellular solution, pH 7.4, containing 135 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. Recordings were discarded if the series resistance was over 6 megohms. Calcium current was elicited by either repeated 200-ms depolarizing pulses to 10 mV or a series of depolarizing pulses to different test potentials (–40 to +80 mV in 10-mV steps) from a holding potential of –40 mV. Calcium current was measured as the difference between the peak inward current and the current at the end of the test pulse. After establishing a solid baseline, the effects of either isoproterenol (100 nmol/liter) containing an equal concentration of ascorbic acid or forskolin (10 μmol/liter) on ICa were examined. H89 (Sigma), ICI118551 (Tocris), and CGP20712A (Tocris) were diluted from stocks in DMSO (H89, 10 mm) and water (10 mm, respectively). Currents were recorded with a patch clamp EPC9 device (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) and sampled at 5 kHz. Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by Pulse+Pulsefit software version 8.54 (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), and data were stored for later off-line analysis. Leak compensation was performed online in Pulse+Pulsefit when necessary. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Telemetric Electrocardiogram (ECG) Recordings—Radiotelemetric ECG transmitters (ETA-F20, DSI, St. Paul, MN) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity under general anesthesia with isoflurane/O2. The ECG leads were sutured subcutaneously onto the upper right chest muscle and the upper left abdominal wall muscle. The animals were allowed to recover for 2 weeks before the experiments. Isoproterenol (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl. After 15 min of base-line recording, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with the drugs used. The ECGs were recorded for 45 min thereafter. The animals were allowed to recover for at least 48 h between experiments. Data were acquired using the DSI acquisition system. Open Field—The open field consisted of a transparent plastic box with a white floor (41 × 41 × 41 cm). The illumination at floor level was 150 lux. Mice were individually placed into the center of the open field, and their behaviors were tracked with an automated activity monitoring system (TSE Systems GmbH, Germany). The overall distance traveled by the mice and the vertical plane entries (rearings) was monitored for 5 min. Beam Walking—The beam consisted of long strips of plastic (1 m) with a 1.0-cm cross-section and grooves (0.5 × 1.0 cm) every 5 cm. The beam was placed horizontally, 50 cm above the bench surface, with both ends mounted on a narrow support. During training mice were placed at the start of the beam and trained once to traverse the beam. 24 h later the number of times the hind feet slipped off the beam was recorded. To detect motor learning, mice had to traverse the beam after 1 h and again after 24 h. Echocardiography—Images were obtained using a Vevo 770 Visual Sonics scanner equipped with a 30-MHz probe (Visual Sonics Inc., Toronto, Canada). The mice were lightly anesthetized (1.5% isoflurane), anchored to a warming platform in dorsal position, and ECG limb electrodes were placed. The chests were shaved and cleaned to minimize ultrasound attenuation. Fractional shortening (FS, reduction of the length of the end-diastolic diameter that occurs by the end of systole) was assessed from the M mode of the parasternal short axis view. Ctr and Ki mice were studied before and 1 min after administration of isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally). We used a gene-targeting strategy that utilized a replacement vector containing the point mutation and a neo/tk gene cassette flanked by loxP sites (Fig. 1a). All homozygous mutants analyzed were F2 mice from a cross between the chimeras (contributing 129 background) and C57BL/6 mice (Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2). The mutants showed no overt cardiovascular phenotype and bred normally. Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 animals could not be differentiated from litter-matched wild type mice in open field, and beam walking tests (data not shown), indicating no obvious changes in behavior or motor performance. We confirmed the mutation of the phosphorylation site by DNA sequencing, Southern blot (Fig. 1b), and immunoblot analysis. The point mutation and the loxP site did not alter the expression of the Cav1.2 protein (Fig. 1c). The Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mutation did not decrease the expression of β1-adrenoceptors or the catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits PKAc, RIIα, and RIIβ in the mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the macromolecular complex between Cav1.2, PKAc, RIIα, and RIIβ (7.Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T.

A. 2006; 103: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) was preserved (Fig. 1d). Using GST fusion proteins, we corroborated that mutation of Ser1928 to alanine in the C terminus of the Cav1.2 results in a complete loss of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 2a). Next, we developed a phospho-specific antibody to detect Ser1928 phosphorylation. In a PKA phosphorylation assay of GST fusion proteins, anti-phospho-Ser1928 phosphorylated at Ser1928. To extend these in vitro data to the Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 animal model, we next evaluated phosphorylation of cardiac Cav1.2 subunits from these mice. Phosphorylation by PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA (5 units) was examined using an immunoprecipitation protocol and autoradiography. Only weak phosphoprotein signals (9.4 ± 4.8% of control level) corresponding to Cav1.2 were observed when heart preparations from Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mutants were used, whereas in controls Cav1.2 phosphorylation could be readily detected (Fig. 2c). In strong agreement with these results, detection of Cav1.2 by the phosphospecific antibody to Ser1928 was barely detectable in the homozygotes (4.4 ± 2.1% of control level). Specificity of the anti-Ser1928 antibody in Cav1.2 full-length preparations was additionally confirmed by preincubation with phosphorylated antigenic peptide, which abolished the immunoblot signal (Fig. 2d). Taken together, these findings suggest that Ser1928 is the only easily detectable Cav1.2 PKA phosphorylation site. Moreover, the Cav1.2 subunit lacking this phosphorylation site is properly targeted to the Cav1.2-associated proteins (7.Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23.Balijepalli R.C. Foell J.D. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), indicating that the phosphorylation site may not be critical for maintaining the steady-state level of channels at the membrane or the assembly of the Cav1.2 signaling complex. Next, we looked at whether the lack of this phosphorylation site on Cav1.2 affects β-adrenergic regulation in adult littermate controls and homozygotes. The current-voltage relationship and expression level measured as current density of the mutant channel were similar to that of the wild type channel (Fig. 3, a and c) indicating that L-type channels show no different voltage dependence for activation or membrane expression in Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mice. To quantitatively correlate phosphorylation of Ser1928 with regulation of ICaL, we measured β-adrenergic stimulation of whole-cell ICaL by isoproterenol (Iso). Iso treatment increased ICaL in control mice 280 ± 25% and in Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mice 268 ± 20%, respectively (Fig. 3, a and b). In addition to the unchanged Iso-induced increase in peak inward ICaL, the 10-mV left shift in the V½ of activation was preserved in cardiomyocytes from Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mice (Fig. 3a). In agreement with the Iso results, we found that the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin enhanced ICaL in both control and mutant cardiomyocytes to identical levels (228 ± 39% versus 240 ± 20%, see Fig. 4, a and b). Application of forskolin completely prevented further isoproterenol stimulation in both genotypes (Fig. 4, a and b), indicating that a membrane-delimited pathway involving the “direct” stimulation of ICaL by a Gs subunit (24.Hartzell H.C. Mery P.F. Fischmeister R. Szabo G. Nature. 1991; 351: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25.Yatani A. Codina J. Imoto Y. Reeves J.P. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Science. 1987; 238: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) was not operative. To further substantiate these findings, we characterized the functional role of additional components of the β-adrenergic pathway in ICaL regulation. The PKA inhibitor H89 consistently blocked the isoproterenol-induced increase in ICaL in litter-matched control and Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5, a and b). The isoproterenol effect was also completely suppressed by application of 0.1 μm of the β1-adrenergic blocker CGP20712A and partially by 0.1 μm of the β2-adrenergic blocker ICI118551 in wild type and mutant mice (Fig. 5c). Taken together, these data rule out a switch of the physiological β-adrenergic regulation of cardiac Cav1.2 in Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 mice. The results shown so far did not rule out the possibility that phosphorylation of Ser1928 is required for the in vivo regulation of cardiac function. First, we looked at a potential role of Cav1.2 Ser1928 phosphorylation in the regulation of heart rate and rhythm using ECG telemetry. There were no detectable differences in basal heart rate (587 ± 24 beats/min versus 567 ± 27 beats/min, t test, p > 0.05). Isoproterenol infusion increased heart rate to the same level (734 ± 15 beats/min versus 741 ± 6 beats/min, t test, p > 0.05) in both control and Cav1.2S1928A-129B6F2 animals (Fig. 6a). We next tested the consequence of ablation of Cav1.2 Ser1928 phosphorylation for cardiac contractility. Echocardiography clearly showed that isoproterenol increased cardiac FS, an indicator of systolic performance, to the same level in both genotypes (Fig. 6, b and c) demonstrating that the positive inotropic effect of β-adrenergic stimulation in vivo is not dependent on Ser1928. Taken together, our results support the notion that PKA phosphorylation of Ser1928 of Cav1.2 is functionally not involved in β-adrenergic regulation of ICaL in murine ventricular cardiomyocytes. The results are in line with the previous finding that β-adrenergic stimulation requires a PKA-mediated phosphorylation step (1.Osterrieder W. Brum G. Hescheler J. Trautwein W. Flockerzi V.

Many questions remain to understand the β-adrenergic regulation of Ca2+ channels. What is the physiological substrate of PKA in the Cav1.2 channel complex responsible for acute stimulation of ICaL, if not Ser1928? The phosphorylation target could be the Cavβ2a subunit (13.Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or the giant protein AHNAK (26.Haase H. Alvarez J. Petzhold D. Doller A. Behlke J. Erdmann J.

Our studies provide the basis to address these critical questions in the future. Because it has been difficult to reconstitute reproducibly ICaL regulation in cultured cells, it is likely that the generation and subsequent analysis of transgenic mice targeting additional components of the ICaL signaling complex will be necessary to understand the physiological process of β-adrenergic regulation of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels.

https://openalex.org/W2016952508,"A link between sites of cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton is essential for regulation of cell shape, motility, and signaling. Migfilin is a recently identified adaptor protein that localizes at cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites, where it is thought to provide a link to the cytoskeleton by interacting with the actin cross-linking protein filamin. Here we have used x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and protein-protein interaction studies to investigate the molecular basis of migfilin binding to filamin. We report that the N-terminal portion of migfilin can bind all three human filamins (FLNa, -b, or -c) and that there are multiple migfilin-binding sites in FLNa. Human filamins are composed of an N-terminal actin-binding domain followed by 24 immunoglobulin-like (IgFLN) domains and we find that migfilin binds preferentially to IgFLNa21 and more weakly to IgFLNa19 and -22. The filamin-binding site in migfilin is localized between Pro5 and Pro19 and binds to the CD face of the IgFLNa21 β-sandwich. This interaction is similar to the previously characterized β7 integrin-IgFLNa21 interaction and migfilin and integrin β tails can compete with one another for binding to IgFLNa21. This suggests that competition between filamin ligands for common binding sites on IgFLN domains may provide a general means of modulating filamin interactions and signaling. In this specific case, displacement of integrin tails from filamin by migfilin may provide a mechanism for switching between different integrin-cytoskeleton linkages.

In this specific case, displacement of integrin tails from filamin by migfilin may provide a mechanism for switching between different integrin-cytoskeleton linkages. Functional connections between transmembrane adhesion receptors and the intracellular cytoskeleton permit transmission of biochemical signals and mechanical force across the plasma membrane and are essential to the development and functioning of multicellular animals (1.Evans E.A. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2007; 316: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In many cases connections are formed at specialized sites involving assemblies of many adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal and signaling adaptors (2.Zaidel-Bar R. Itzkovitz S. Ma'ayan A. Iyengar R. Geiger B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Although many components of these adhesion complexes have now been identified, a complete understanding of how adhesion complexes function will require detailed information on individual components and how they interact or compete with other elements of this complex machinery. Here we characterize the interaction of a recently identified adaptor protein, migfilin, with the actin-binding protein filamin and examine how this influences interactions of filamin with integrin adhesion receptors. Migfilin, also termed filamin-binding LIM protein-1, is a LIM domain protein that localizes to both cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell contact sites, where it is thought to provide a link between the actin cytoskeleton and integrin-extracellular matrix contact sites and cadherin-catenin cell-cell junctions, respectively (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4.Takafuta T. Saeki M. Fujimoto T.T. Fujimura K. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol.

In this way, migfilin can modulate cell shape, migration, and cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Increased migfilin expression is observed in human leiomyosarcoma and expression levels correlate with tumor grade although the molecular basis for this observation remains to be determined (6.Papachristou D.J. Gkretsi V. Tu Y. Shi X. Chen K. Larjava H. Rao U.N. Wu C. Histopathology. 2007; 51: 409-508Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 kDa in size, migfilin is composed of three C-terminal LIM domains, a central proline-rich region, and an N-terminal portion, which lacks any identifiable structural domains or sequence motifs. Alternative splicing can result in removal of the final LIM domain or the proline-rich region (5.Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The LIM domains mediate binding to kindlin-2 (Mig-2) and are required for localization to focal adhesions (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The central proline-rich domain has recently been shown to bind to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, an interaction observed to be important for migfilin modulation of cell migration (7.Zhang Y. Tu Y. Gkretsi V. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12397-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region binds to filamins (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K.

Vertebrates have three homologous genes that encode filamin A, B, and C: of these, filamin A (FLNa) 6The abbreviations used are: FLNa, filamin A; ABD, actin-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is the most abundant and widely expressed (8.Stossel T.P.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These filamins are non-covalent dimers of two 280-kDa subunits composed of an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) followed by 24 immunoglobulin-like domains (IgFLN1-24) with IgFLN24 mediating dimerization (10.Gorlin J.B.

Ylanne J. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A flexible hinge region separates IgFLN1-15 (rod 1), which contains a secondary actin-binding site and IgFLN16-24 (rod 2) allowing filamin to stabilize high angle actin fiber cross-links (12.Nakamura F. Osborn T.M. Hartemink C.A. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1011-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to their role as actin cross-linking proteins, filamins, mostly through their C-terminal domains, IgFLN16-24, bind an array of cytosolic signaling and adaptor proteins and transmembrane receptors (8.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 13.Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Nat.

Sci. 2006; 31: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting that filamins play complex and diverse roles within the cell. We have previously identified IgFLNa21 as the major binding site in FLNa for integrin adhesion receptors and the structure of IgFLNa21 in complex with a β7 integrin peptide showed that IgFLNa21 forms a β-sandwich composed of two β-sheets (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The CD face of the IgFLNa21 β-sandwich is the major interaction site for the β7 integrin peptide. NMR, mutagenesis, and structures of other IgFLN-ligand interactions suggested that the CD face of IgFLN domains represents a common interface for filamin-ligand binding (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid studies and GST-FLNc pull-down assays from cell lysates have mapped migfilin binding to IgFLNc21 and IgFLNa19-24 (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This overlap in the binding specificity of IgFLN21 for migfilin and β-integrin tails raises the following intriguing questions: 1) does migfilin bind the CD face of IgFLN21 in a manner analogous to the interaction between IgFLNa21 and β7 integrin peptide and 2) do migfilin and integrins compete for binding to the same IgFLNa21 protein? More recently a migfilin splice variant (FBLP-1) with an identical N-terminal region to migfilin was shown to interact with IgFLNb10-13, suggesting a potential secondary migfilin binding site within filamins (4.Takafuta T. Saeki M. Fujimoto T.T. Fujimura K. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using biochemical and NMR structure-based analyses we find that FLNa contains multiple migfilin-binding sites; that the N terminus of migfilin is relatively unstructured and, upon binding to IgFLNa21, perturbs residues in the CD face in a similar way to peptides derived from β7 integrin. X-ray crystallography and analysis of mutant proteins reveals the molecular basis of IgFLNa21-migfilin interactions. The interaction between migfilin and IgFLNa21 is capable of competing with integrins because it is of higher affinity. Displacement of integrin tails by migfilin could provide a mechanism for switching from one type of integrin/cytoskeleton linkage to another, perhaps involving kindlin-2 in some cell types. Antibodies and DNAs—Monoclonal antibodies, activating anti-β1 integrin 9EG7 (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD29 (Biolegend) and anti-His (Novagen), and polyclonal anti-GST (Chemicon), anti-GFP (Rockland) were obtained commercially. The anti-FLNa polyclonal antibody has been described previously (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol.

Point mutations were introduced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pull-down Assays with Migfilin—Recombinant migfilin proteins were produced as described for integrin tail proteins and GST-filamin fragments were produced and purified as described previously (15.Kiema T.

Pull-down assays were performed using recombinant migfilin bound to His-bind resin (Novagen) as described previously (18.Lad Y. Harburger D.S. Calderwood D.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting or protein staining. Migfilin peptide (amino acids 5-19) and control (reverse sequence) were obtained from Tufts University Core Facility, Boston, MA. To estimate apparent affinity constants the binding of increasing amounts of purified GST-IgFLNa21 proteins to migfilin tails was quantified by densitometry; data were plotted as percent maximal binding versus input concentration and fitted to a one site binding model (Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X)) using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Immunofluorescence—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 24 h later were detached, allowed to re-adhere, and spread on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After 4 h of plating, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-filamin or Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin (Invitrogen) as described previously (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.

The migfilin-(1-85) was subcloned into a pET-28a vector and produced in non-labeled and 15N-labeled forms following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen), whereas the synthetic migfilin-derived peptides (all N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal amidated) were purchased from EZbiolab. All NMR samples were buffered in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm sodium chloride with 10% D2O added at pH 6.10 and 25 °C. The HSQC type 1H-15N-NOE spectra were recorded using a 500 μm sample in a 500 MHz spectrometer (20.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T.

Lyophilized aliquots of migfilin peptides (0.25-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 12-fold excess over 100 μm protein) were titrated into the protein samples. Where appropriate, the ligand-to-protein ratios were corrected for dilution by weighing the NMR sample tube. The NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (22.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S.

To map the binding site the combined induced chemical shifts (the chemical shift change upon ligand binding) of amide N-H [Δδ(HN,N)] were derived using, Δδ(HN,N)=(ΔδHN)2+(0.154×ΔδN)2(Eq. 1) where ΔδHN and ΔδHN are the ligand-induced chemical shift deviations produced in the proton and nitrogen dimensions, respectively (23.Ayed A.

The binding constants were fitted, assuming a 1:1 interaction model, to typical fast-exchange tracks of peaks with the largest shifts in the proton and nitrogen dimensions as follows, ΔδΔδmax=[P]0+[L]0+Kd-([P]0+[L]0+Kd)2-4[P]0[L]02[P]0(Eq. 2) where Δδmax stands for the maximum shift observed at saturating ligand concentration; [P]0 and [L]0 are the total protein and ligand concentration; in practice, [L]0 was replaced by the product of protein concentration and the ligand-to-protein ratio. Two-parameter fitting (i.e. Kd and Δδmax) was realized using Origin software. Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant IgFLNa21 was produced and purified as previously described (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Crystals were produced at 22 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion using an equimolar (1 mm) mixture of IgFLNa21 and migfilin Pro5-Pro19 peptide. Final crystals were grown in 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4, 5% 2-propanol with the use of seeding. Crystals were transferred into 25% glycerol, 1.6 m (NH4)2SO4, 5% 2-propanol and frozen in liquid N2. The diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-2. Structure Determination and Refinement—The data were processed with XDS (Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany) (25.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) and the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser (26.Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) using Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2BRQ chain A as the search model. Refinement and model building were performed by programs Arp/Warp (27.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), Refmac5 (28.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The Pro5-Pro19 migfilin peptide was built by hand with Coot. Medium tight non-crystallographic symmetry restrains between chains A and B were used in the refinement. The structure factors and coordinates of the structure have been deposited as PDB entry 2W0P. The data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Crystallographic figures were generated and root mean square deviations of superimposed structures were calculated by PyMol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). The interaction surfaces were analyzed with the PROTORP server (www.bioinformatics.sussex.ac.uk/protorp/index.html).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection statisticsData collectionBeamlineESRF ID14-2Wavelength, Å0.933Space groupP212121Cell dimensionsa, b, c, Å36.89, 68.48, 85.22α, β, γ (degree)90, 90, 90Resolution range, Å32.48-1.90 (1.95-1.90)aValues of the last resolution shell in parentheses.Rsym, %13.4 (74.1)I/σI13.5 (2.35)Completeness, %99.9 (97.7)Redundancy2.54 (2.50)RefinementResolution range, Å32.48-1.90 (1.95-1.90)No. of reflectionsRefinement16,730 (1208)Test set895 (68)Rwork/Rfree, %20.9/23.9 (23.3/28.5)Correlation coefficients Fo - Fc/Fo - Fc free0.943/0.926No. of atoms1,532Protein1,452Heterogen10Solvent70Root mean square differencesBond lengths, Å0.021Bond angles (degree)1.789Average B-factor, Å224.88Protein24.24Peptide23.36Solvent29.62B-factor from Wilson plot23.68Amino acids in Ramachandran diagram (%)In most favored regions94.7In additional allowed regions5.3In generously allowed regions0.0a Values of the last resolution shell in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The N-terminal 85 Amino Acids of Migfilin Bind to Filamin A, B, and C—Migfilin, or its alternatively spliced variants, have been described as filamin-binding proteins (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4.Takafuta T. Saeki M. Fujimoto T.T. Fujimura K. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal portion of migfilin has been implicated in filamin binding. To test the generality of this interaction we produced two recombinant migfilin fragments spanning the complete molecule; an N-terminal fragment (migfilin-(1-85)) and a larger 86-373 fragment encompassing the central region and the 3 C-terminal LIM domains. These fragments were expressed in bacteria as N-terminal His-tagged proteins and purified on His-bind resin. Using migfilin-coated beads in pull-down assays we confirmed that migfilin-(1-85) binds FLNa-GFP from Chinese hamster ovary cell lysates, whereas the C-terminal 86-373 portion displayed no detectable FLNa binding (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained for FLNb-GFP (Fig. 1B) and FLNc-GFP (Fig. 1C). Migfilin Binds Sites in Both Rod 1 and 2 of FLNa—Migfilin has been shown to bind sites in the rod 2 region (IgFLN16-24) of FLNa and FLNc (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas the migfilin splice variant FBLP-1, which contains the filamin-binding 1-85 portion, was reported to bind to IgFLNb10-13, within FLNb rod 1 (4.Takafuta T. Saeki M. Fujimoto T.T. Fujimura K. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of His-tagged migfilin fragments to pull-down FLNa amino acids 1-1761-GFP (ABD + rod 1), which contains the actin-binding domains and FLNa amino acids 1762-2647-GFP (rod 2). As shown in Fig. 1D the N terminus of migfilin bound both FLNa fragments, whereas the C-terminal portion failed to interact with either FLNa fragment. Thus the N-terminal 85 amino acids of migfilin mediate binding to all 3 filamins and migfilin can bind filamin at sites in 1-1761 and 1762-2647. Migfilin Binds IgFLNa21 Directly—Although we have demonstrated that migfilin binds to both rod 1 and 2 of FLNa in pull-down assays, most FLN-interacting proteins interact with sites in rod 2 (8.Stossel T.P.

Sci. 2006; 31: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We have also proposed that the CD face of IgFLNa domains in this region serves as a general ligand binding interface (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to further characterize the interactions between migfilin and IgFLNa domains in rod 2. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, Tu et al. (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) localized the migfilin binding site to IgFLNc21 in the rod 2 fragment of FLNc and mapped the binding site in FLNa to IgFLNa domains 19-24. We used direct binding assays with individual GST-IgFLNa domains and His-tagged migfilin-(1-85) to show that, in a purified system, IgFLNa21 binds migfilin (Fig. 2A) but we also detected weak binding to IgFLNa19 and IgFLNa22 (Fig. 2A). The interaction between migfilin-(1-85) and IgFLNa21 is specific, as migfilin did not bind to IgFLNa20, IgFLNa23, or to GST (Fig. 2, A and B). The interaction with IgFLNa21 was dose-dependent and saturable with an apparent Kd of 0.3 ± 0.05 μm (Fig. 2C). We previously characterized the interaction between integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains and IgFLNa21 and identified point mutations in the C and D strands of the IgFLNa21 β sandwich that inhibited integrin binding (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To test whether migfilin binds to a similar surface on IgFLNa21, Ala2272 and Ala2274 in strand C and Ile2283 in strand D were mutated in GST-IgFLNa21 and binding to His-migfilin-(1-85) was assessed. Conservative substitutions AA/ST or I/M had little effect on migfilin-IgFLNa21 binding, whereas AA/DK or I/C substitutions strongly inhibited migfilin binding (Fig. 2D). This result is very similar to that observed for β7-IgFLNa21 binding, suggesting that migfilin and β7 may bind to a similar site on IgFLNa21. The Migfilin-(1-85) Is Unstructured When Free in Solution—To further understand the interaction between migfilin and filamin we sought to investigate the molecular structure of the N terminus of migfilin in solution using NMR. The 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of migfilin-(1-85) (supplemental Fig. S1) has chemical shifts typical of an unstructured species (30.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Moreover, heteronuclear 1H-(15N)-NOE experiments showed complete peak inversion for nearly all the N-H cross-peaks, which implies that the protein chain is extremely flexible (31.Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Migfilin Residues 5-19 Mediate Binding to FLNa—We previously showed (15.Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P.

We thus examined the migfilin-(1-85) sequence for candidate filamin-binding sites using a CLUSTAL-W algorithm to align the structurally defined filamin-binding sequences from β7 (15.Kiema T. Lad Y.

Ylanne J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3993-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with migfilin-(1-85). This led to a prediction that residues between Pro5 and Pro19 could be the filamin-binding site (Fig. 3A), consistent with available published data where loss of amino acids 1-24 or the mutation K7T/R8G in migfilin disrupted filamin binding (3.Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A synthetic, unlabeled 15-mer migfilin Pro5-Pro19 peptide was therefore titrated into a U-15N-IgFLNa21 NMR sample. Clear binding was observed with induced peak shifts spread throughout the HSQC spectra of IgFLNa21, c"

They contain formin homology 1 (FH1) and 2 (FH2) domains as the catalytic machinery for the formation of linear actin cables. A subclass of formins constitutes the Diaphanous-related formins, members of which are regulated by the binding of a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho subfamily. Binding of these molecular switch proteins to the regulatory N-terminal mDiaN, including the GTPase-binding domain, leads to the release of auto-inhibition. From the three mDia isoforms, mDia1 is activated only by Rho (RhoA, -B, and -C), in contrast to mDia2 and -3, which is also activated by Rac and Cdc42. Little is known about the determinants of specificity. Here we report on the interactions of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 with mDia1 and an mDia1 mutant (mDiaN-Thr-Ser-His (TSH)), which based on structural information should mimic mDia2 and -3. Specificity is analyzed by biochemical studies and a structural analysis of a complex between Cdc42·Gpp(NH)p and mDiaN-TSH. A triple NNN motif in mDia1 (amino acids 164-166), corresponding to the TSH motif in mDia2/3 (amino acids 183-185 and 190-192), and the epitope interacting with the Rho insert helix are essential for high affinity binding. The triple N motif of mDia1 allows tight interaction with Rho because of the presence of Phe-106, whereas the corresponding His-104 in Rac and Cdc42 forms a complementary interface with the TSH motif in mDia2/3. We also show that the F106H and H104F mutations drastically alter the affinities and thermodynamics of mDia interactions. Formins are key regulators of actin nucleation and polymerization.

Therefore, FH1-FH2 accelerates the association rate for ATP-G-actin monomers at the barbed end, but it also accelerates the hydrolysis rate of actin-bound ATP (11.Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D.

It has been shown by us and others that mDiaN consists of three subdomains as follows: GBDN, Armadillo repeat region (ARR) also called DID (Diaphanous-inhibitory domain), and dimerization domain (Dim) (33.Otomo T.

The structure of the mDiaN in complex with activated RhoC shows that Rho interacts via switch I and II with the GBD but also with the ARR via the Rho insert helix. The DAD-binding site on mDiaN (DID) has also been described biochemically and structurally (32.Lammers M. Rose R. Scrima A. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4176-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The structure shows that the 16 highly conserved residues of the DAD core region (DCR) form an α-helix, which binds to the ARR in a site not directly overlapping with the Rho-binding site (32.Lammers M. Rose R. Scrima A. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4176-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41.Nezami A. Poy F. Eck M. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Rho actively dissociates DAD from its binding site via long range electrostatic repulsion and short range steric clashes (32.Lammers M. Rose R. Scrima A. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4176-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

This discrimination is because of the conformation of two loop regions, switch I and II, that adopt a defined conformation when connected to the γ-phosphate. Rho proteins interact with a number of different effectors, which in turn regulate the actin cytoskeleton either directly, as with mDia, or indirectly by modifying the activity of actin-binding proteins (44.Vetter I.R.

Binding motifs in Rho effectors are divergent, with a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif in Cdc42/Rac effectors WASP, WAVE, ACK, and PAK (47.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

The Rho effectors Rhophilin, Rhotekin, and protein kinase N, and ROCK bind via an anti-parallel coiled-coil motif (47.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The common feature of these interactions is that Rho proteins not only recruit their effectors to a particular membrane site but that they also allosterically activate the effector (5.Buck M. Xu W. Rosen M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 47.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 57.Leung D.W. Rosen M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5685-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This involves the release of an intramolecular autoinhibited state that can be found in the cases of kinases, e.g. ROCK, protein kinase N, or PAK, but also in the case of WASP, WAVE, and mDia1 (47.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). For mDia1 the release of autoinhibition by Rho binding does not lead to full activation of the actin polymerization activity catalyzed by FH2 (25.Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 40.Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho proteins plays an important role in spatio-temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton inside the cell. Very often, different signal transduction pathways via Rho proteins lead to similar or overlapping cellular responses (58.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Gen. Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Effectors of Rho proteins are nevertheless not promiscuous in responding to either Rho and its homologues, i.e. RhoA, -B, -C, or to Cdc42 and Rac and its homologues such as TC10. Because a particular Rho protein interacts with a number of structurally different effectors via the highly conserved switch I and II regions, a high plasticity in the interface is required (59.Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. EMBO Rep. 2004; 12: 1130-1136Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Numerous Rho family effectors have been described so far, defined as proteins that only bind to the GTP-bound state. ROCK I and II and Rhotekin specifically interact with and are activated by binding of Rho but not Rac or Cdc42 (39.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 60.Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that for ROCK II only residue Glu-40 of RhoA is important for discriminating between RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (61.Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif containing proteins PAK, WASP, and WAVE and others are specific effectors for members for either Rac or Cdc42 but do not interact with Rho. In case of mDia, the situation is different in that mDia1 specifically binds to and is activated by RhoA, -B, and -C (39.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), whereas mDia2 and -3 seem to be highly promiscuous and activated by RhoA-C, Cdc42, and RhoD (36.Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 39.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T.

Nature. 2004; 428: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The question to ask is whether, like in protein kinase C-related kinase, the effector binds to multiple Rho family members at different binding sites or whether different G proteins use the same binding site. Here we analyzed the specificity of interaction between mDia isoforms and Rho proteins. We show that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 use a similar binding site and that most of the specificity is determined by a Asn-Asn-Asn (triple N) motif of mDia1 that is replaced by Thr-Ser-His (TSH) in mDia2 and -3. On the Rho site, specificity is determined by a Phe-His substitution of Phe-106. We also observe for the first time that the insert helix, a specific hallmark of Rho proteins, is involved in effector binding and specificity. Recombinant Proteins—Proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions using the vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7 (37 °C, 160 rpm) and induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C for mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH and at 18 °C for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2 in cases of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by microfluidizing; the extract was applied to a GSH-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2). The fusion protein was digested with 5 units of thrombin (Serva) per mg of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein on the column overnight at 4 °C. Final purification was done with size exclusion chromatography in buffer B using a Superdex S200 for mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH or S75 for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Point mutations were made using the QuikChange method of Stratagene. Mutant proteins were purified like the wild type proteins. Concentrations of mDiaN and mDiaN-TSH were determined using the absorption at 280 nm under denaturing conditions with the extinction coefficient deduced from the sequence, and RhoA/Cdc42/Rac1 concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. Rho was purified and loaded with Gpp(NH)p and mant-Gpp(NH)p as described elsewhere (35.Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Rac1 and Cdc42 were purified using the same strategy. Stopped-flow Kinetics—The experiments were done at 20 °C using a SX18 MW Applied Photophysics apparatus (Leather-head, UK). The mant fluorophore (Molecular Probes) was excited at 366 nm with a bandpass of 6.4 nm. Emission (at 450 nm) was recorded using a 408-nm cutoff filter. All measurements were done with a final concentration of 100 nm mant-Gpp(NH)p-loaded GNBP/mutated GNBP. Increasing concentrations of wild type or mutant mDiaN (1-15 μm) were used in the experiments using pseudo first-order conditions. The observed fluorescence transients were fitted to a single exponential function to obtain kobs. The association rate constant kon was derived from the slope of kobs versus protein concentration. The dissociation rate constants were obtained by mixing a preformed 100 nm mDiaN·RhoA·mant-Gpp(NH)p (or mutated proteins) complex with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Rho protein. All measurements were done in buffer C (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2), which in experiments with RhoA additionally contained 5 mm MgCl2. GraFit 3.0-5.0 was used for data analysis. ITC Measurements—The interaction of mDiaN/mDiaN-TSH and RhoA/Cdc42/Rac1 and DAD-(1145-1200) and mutants was done by ITC based on Wiseman et al. (64.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) (MicroCal™; VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter). All measurements were carried out in buffer B at 20 °C. DAD, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (or mutants) (syringe) were stepwise-injected to the mDiaN, mDiaN-TSH solution (cell). The heating power per injection was observed over the reaction time until equilibrium was reached. The data were analyzed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Crystals of the mDiaN[TSH] domain (69-451) in complex with Cdc42-(1-178)·Gpp(NH)p were grown in buffer D containing Bistris propane, pH 8.8 (pH adjusted with citric acid), 26% PEG3350, 250 mm sodium tartrate to a size of ∼100 × 200 × 100 μm using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method. The protein was solved in buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2.1 μl of protein solution of various concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/μl) was mixed with the reservoir solution. After 1 day crystals were grown to their final size and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using reservoir solution with 35% PEG3350 as cryoprotectant. Data set collection has been performed at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland (Table 4). The native dataset was collected at 100 K on beam line PXII at a wavelength of 0.95 Å using a Mar225 CCD detector. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the XDS package (65.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar).TABLE 4Statistics of data co"
https://openalex.org/W2049601337,"Maintaining and acquiring the pluripotent cell state in plants is critical to tissue regeneration and vegetative multiplication. Histone-based epigenetic mechanisms are important for regulating this undifferentiated state. Here we report the use of genetic and pharmacological experimental approaches to show that Arabidopsis cell suspensions and calluses specifically repress some genes as a result of promoter DNA hypermethylation. We found that promoters of the MAPK12, GSTU10 and BXL1 genes become hypermethylated in callus cells and that hypermethylation also affects the TTG1, GSTF5, SUVH8, fimbrin and CCD7 genes in cell suspensions. Promoter hypermethylation in undifferentiated cells was associated with histone hypoacetylation and primarily occurred at CpG sites. Accordingly, we found that the process specifically depends on MET1 and DRM2 methyltransferases, as demonstrated with DNA methyltransferase mutants. Our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation may be another important epigenetic mechanism for the establishment and/or maintenance of the undifferentiated state in plant cells."

Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) 2The abbreviations used are: Prdx, peroxiredoxin; iPLA2, Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2; GPx, glutathione peroxidases; cPLA2, cellular PLA2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. are a family of peroxidases that reduce mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol, respectively (1Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Prdxs are classified as either 1-Cys or 2-Cys Prdxs, based on whether the protein contains one or two conserved cysteine residues, respectively. In mammals, six members of the Prdx family have been described. Five of these (Prdx1, Prdx2, Prdx3, Prdx4, and Prdx5) are 2-Cys enzymes that use thioredoxin as the electron donor of their catalytic cycle (3Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free. Radic. Biol.

In contrast, Prdx6, the sole mammalian 1-Cys Prdx, does not use thioredoxin as a reductant. In addition to peroxidase activity, Prdx6 has a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activity (5Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol.

The peroxidase activity of Prdx6 has been widely studied in cells and animal models for its antioxidant properties that provide protection against the harmful consequence of oxidative stress (6Wang Y.

Biol. 2006; 34: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the iPLA2 activity of Prdx6 remains poorly understood. Considering the many functions of iPLA2 activity, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (9Song Y. Wilkins P. Hu W. Murthy K.S. Chen J. Lee Z. Oyesanya R. Wu J. Barbour S.E. Fang X. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it may also play an important role in either H2O2-mediated signaling or H2O2-related cellular events. Prdxs like Prdx6 use cysteine as a catalytic center, rather than selenocysteine which characterizes the glutathione peroxidases (GPx) (2Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K.

The N-terminal conserved cysteines (Cys51 of Prdx1) of Prdx1-5 are selectively oxidized by H2O2 to Cys-SOH (10Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Structure. 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The unstable Cys51-SOH reacts with Cys172-SH of another Prdx molecule, creating a homodimer through an intermolecular disulfide bond. The disulfide is then reduced back to the Prdx active thiol form by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system (11Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol.

Under oxidative stress condition, however, the sulfenic intermediate is susceptible to hyperoxidation and thus occasionally hyperoxidized by H2O2, leading to the formation of sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) or sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H), which cannot involve disulfide bond formation with the resolving cysteine (14Woo H.A.

A recent study suggested that hyperoxidation of 2-Cys Prdx2 may control structural transitions of Prdx2 that correlate with cell cycle arrest and recovery (18Phalen T.J. Weirather K. Deming P.B. Anathy V. Howe A.K. Van der Vliet A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), indicating that Prdxs hyperoxidation may activate stress responses that mediate oxidant-induced cell cycle arrest. In contrast, it is poorly understood whether 1-Cys Prdx6 is hyperoxidized upon treatment with H2O2, whether Prdx6 hyperoxidation plays a role in H2O2-induced cellular toxicity, or whether the two enzymatic activities of Prdx6 are functionally linked. In this study, we provide the first evidence that Prdx6 is involved in H2O2-induced cellular toxicity through the hyperoxidation and up-regulation of the iPLA2 activity of Prdx6. Cell Culture—HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cells) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (10% v/v) glutamine and antibiotics. HEK293 cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptotic cells were identified by staining with Annexin V-FITC (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The percentage of Annexin V-positive cells was analyzed with the FACSCalibur™ system and determined with the CellQuest software. RNA Interference—shRNA against human Prdx6 (5′-GGGCATGCCTGTGACAGCT-3′) was produced from chemically synthesized DNA oligonucleotides that were cloned into the pSUPER.retro vector according to the manufacturer's instruction (OligoEngine). DNA transfections were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Sciences) or MP-100 micro-Porator (Digital Bio, Korea) according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to Prdx1, Prdx2, Prdx3, Prdx6, Prdxs-SO2H/SO3, and Prdx6-SO2H/SO3 were purchased from Lab Frontier (18Phalen T.J. Weirather K. Deming P.B. Anathy V. Howe A.K. Van der Vliet A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Antibodies to GAPDH (Cell Signaling), p53 (Cell Signaling), p21 (Cell Signaling), and cyclin B1 (Cell Signaling) were also used. Confocal Microscopy—Hela cells were plated on glass coverslips in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, allowed to grow to 60% confluence, treated with 500 mm H2O2 for 20 min, washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and incubated for various amounts of time as indicated. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and washed several times with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After gentle washing, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating coverslips for 1 h at room temperature with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated with either anti-Prdxs-SO2H (Abcam, ab16830), anti-Prdx6-SO2H (Abcam, ab2844), anti-Prdx1 (Abcam, ab16946), anti-Prdx2 (Abcam, ab16749), or anti-Prdx3 (Abcam, 16753) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with either goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or TRICT (Rhodamine) under identical conditions. Finally, coverslips were stained with Hoechst dye to demarcate the nucleus. Coverslips were mounted on slides, and images were generated at room temperature using a confocal scanning laser microscope (LSM510Meta Duoscan, Carlzeiss Microimaging, GmbH, Germany). Digital images were analyzed with the LSM510 Software (Carlzeiss Microimaging, GmbH, Germany). Cell Cycle Analysis—At 40% confluence, cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min, washed with HBSS, and incubated for an additional 24 h. Attached cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in a fluorochrome staining solution (3.8 mm sodium citrate, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 7 Kunitz unites/ml RNase B) and incubated on ice for 3 h or kept at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks before flow cytometric analysis. The cell cycle was analyzed with the FACSCalibur™ system and determined with the CellQuest software and Modfit LT 3.0 software. Human Prdx6 cDNA Construct and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human Prdx6 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number, NM_004905) was cloned from a human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, into the pCDNA3.0 expression vector. Mutations were made using the MORPH™ plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit supplied by 5′ → 3′ Inc. Cysteine at position 47 was replaced by alanine (C47A) and/or serine at position 32 was substituted by alanine (S32A). Mutagenesis experiments were performed as described previously (5Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Total PLA2 and iPLA2 Activity Assay—Total PLA2 and iPLA2 activities were measured according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were suspended in 200 μl of 50 m m Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, and sonicated at 10% power for 9 s with 9-s intervals for 10 times on ice. Supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing 50 μg of protein in a total volume of 45 μl were added to microplate wells containing 5 μl of pf assay buffer with (iPLA2 activity) or without 10 μm BEL (total PLA2 activity). The reaction was initiated by addition of 200 μl of arachidonoyl thiophosphatidylcholine and was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 25 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm in an Emax precision microplate reader (Molecular devices). The iPLA2 activity was calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antioxidant Effects of Prdx6 against H2O2—To investigate the functional relationship between the peroxidase and iPLA2 activities of Prdx6, we first examined its antioxidant role in defending against oxidative stress. Human Prdx6 was transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), and its protective effects against exogenous H2O2 were evaluated by apoptosis analysis. H2O2-induced apoptosis was attenuated in Prdx6-overexpressing HeLa cells compared with mock-transfected cells after treatment of cells with 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1A). To validate the function of endogenous Prdx6, we designed shRNA toward Prdx6 (supplemental Fig. S1) and generated Prdx6-knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). Knockdown cells were more sensitive to H2O2-induced apoptosis than cells transfected with control shRNA (Fig. 1D). In accordance with a previous study (6Wang Y. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 104: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Prdx6 protects against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Prdx6 Is Hyperoxidized by High Concentrations of H2O2—Upon oxidative stress generated at greater than normal H2O2 concentrations, intracellular 2-Cys Prdxs such as Prdx2 are hyperoxidized and may induce cytotoxicity through cell cycle arrest (18Phalen T.J. Weirather K. Deming P.B. Anathy V. Howe A.K. Van der Vliet A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consequently, hyperoxidation of intracellular Prdxs may play a role in H2O2-induced cellular toxicity. However, whether Prdx6 is also hyperoxidized and thereby implicated in cellular toxicity is still unclear. Therefore, HeLa and HEK293 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of H2O2 (from 0.001 mm to 4.5 mm). Hyperoxidation of Prdxs was monitored by specific antibodies recognizing Cys-SO3H Prdx1, Prdx2, and Prdx3 or Cys-SO3H Prdx6. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, 2-Cys Prdxs were gradually hyperoxidized, and their hyperoxidation plateaued above 500 μm H2O2. Prdx6 was not hyperoxidized below 100 μm H2O2 but was rapidly hyperoxidized at 500 μm H2O2. To further confirm the requirement of the specified concentration of H2O2 for the hyperoxidation of Prdx6, HeLa and HEK293 cells were exposed to 100 μm or 500 μm H2O2 for different amounts of time. At 100 μm H2O2, 2-Cys Prdxs were gradually hyperoxidized in a time-dependent manner, whereas Prdx6 was not hyperoxidized until 2 h (Fig. 2C, HeLa and Fig. 2D, HEK293). However, both 2-Cys Prdxs and Prdx6 were rapidly hyperoxidized at earlier times, and the levels were quickly saturated at 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the requirement of H2O2 molarity for Prdx6 hyperoxidation is higher than that of 2-Cys Prdxs. Hyperoxidized Prdx6 Is Irreversible—A recent report demonstrated that hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prdxs can be reduced and can then reenter the redox cycling pathway (18Phalen T.J. Weirather K. Deming P.B. Anathy V. Howe A.K. Van der Vliet A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is uncertain, however, whether hyperoxidized Prdx6 is also recycled. Thus, HeLa cells were exposed to different concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and incubated for various amounts of time. By Western blot analysis, the degree of Prdx1, Prdx2, and Prdx3 hyperoxidation gradually decreased with time after the removal of H2O2, whereas Prdx6 hyperoxidation remained unchanged during the time course (Fig. 3A). Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we confirmed the two distinct patterns of Prdxs and Prdx6 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, hyperoxidized Prdx6 was localized predominantly in the nucleus and the intensity was unchanged after the removal of H2O2. These results indicate that hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prdxs are reduced, whereas Prdx6 hyperoxidation is irreversible. Prdx6 Hyperoxidation Correlates with H2O2-induced Cellular Toxicity—Recently, it has been proposed that hyperoxidized Prdx2 may be directly recognized as a signal of perturbations in oxidant metabolism and, thereby, may contribute to stress responses that mediate oxidant-induced cell cycle arrest (18Phalen T.J. Weirather K. Deming P.B. Anathy V. Howe A.K. Van der Vliet A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In both HeLa and HEK293 cells, we found that the H2O2-induced cell death was initiated at >100 μm H2O2 (supplemental Table S1), ranges that induce Prdx6 hyperoxidation (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that Prdx6 hyperoxidation is correlated to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. We therefore examined whether hyperoxidized Prdx6 plays a role in cellular toxicity. To generate the different oxidation states of Prdx6, HeLa cells were transiently exposed to different concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min, washed with HBSS, and incubated for 18 h. Consistent with the results presented in Fig. 2C, Prdx6 was rapidly hyperoxidized at high concentrations of H2O2 (>100 μm) and its hyperoxidation was maintained (Fig. 4A, upper blot). Interestingly, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition was initiated at 100 μm H2O2 and plateaued above 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the pattern of cell cycle arrest was very similar to the pattern of Prdx6 hyperoxidation (Fig. 4, A and B). To test whether the arrest is associated with change in cell cycle regulatory proteins (19Saigusa K. Imoto I. Tanikawa C. Aoyagi M. Ohno K. Nakamura Y. Inazawa J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the protein levels of p53, p21, and cyclin B1 were analyzed. Previous studies had shown that G2/M arrest is paralleled by an accumulation of cyclin B1 (20Donà F. Prosperi E. Savio M. Coppa T. Scovassi A.I. Mondello C. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 33: 613-621PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee S.M. Kwon J.I. Choi Y.H. Eom H.S. Chi G.Y. Phytother. Res. 2008; 22: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, it was previously shown that p53 activation and, thus, induction of Cdk inhibitor p21 are involved in G2/M arrest (21Lee S.M. Kwon J.I. Choi Y.H. Eom H.S. Chi G.Y. Phytother. Res. 2008; 22: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the levels of p53 and p21 were enhanced markedly, whereas the cyclin B1 levels decreased. Moreover, the arrest was closely related with apoptotic cell death. At 48 h after transient treatment with H2O2, Annexin V-positive cells were markedly appeared at high concentrations of H2O2 (>100 μm) (supplemental Fig. S2). These results strongly suggest that Prdx6 hyperoxidation plays a role in cellular toxicity by regulating the cell cycle. Hyperoxidation of Prdx6 Is Functionally Related to Its iPLA2 Activity—We next speculated how Prdx6 hyperoxidation might regulate cellular toxicity. Although Prdx6 hyperoxidation alone can induce toxicity, we focused on Prdx6 iPLA2 activity because several studies have shown that iPLA2 induces cellular toxicity though cell cycle arrest or apoptosis under various conditions (9Song Y. Wilkins P. Hu W. Murthy K.S. Chen J. Lee Z. Oyesanya R. Wu J. Barbour S.E. Fang X. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Lauber K. Bohn E. Kröber S.M. Xiao Y.J.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the functional relationship between the peroxidase and iPLA2 activities of Prdx6 may be important for cellular toxicity. We therefore examined whether iPLA2 activity is affected by H2O2. Upon treatment of cells with H2O2, total cellular PLA2 (cPLA2) activity remained unchanged (Fig. 4C), whereas iPLA2 activity gradually increased up to 500 μm H2O2 and was saturated at 1 mm H2O2 (Fig. 4D). To examine whether Prdx6 hyperoxidation is functionally related to its iPLA2 activity, we constructed three mutants, C47A for both the peroxidase activity and the site of hyperoxidation, S32A for iPLA2 activity, and C47A/S32A for both enzymatic activities. After transient transfections, HeLa cells were treated with or without 500 μm H2O2 and the iPLA2 activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 4E, overexpression of wild-type Prdx6 significantly enhanced total iPLA2 activity following treatment with H2O2. iPLA2 activities were also elevated in C47A, S32A, or C47A/S32A double mutants upon H2O2 addition compared with those of without H2O2, indicating intrinsic iPLA2 activities increased by H2O2. The result was similar with Fig. 4D. However, the increased levels of iPLA2 activity were much higher in wild-type Prdx6 than in mutants (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that the hyperoxidation of Prdx6 at C47 by H2O2 is affected on the iPLA2 activity and is correlated with H2O2-induced cellular toxicity. On the basis of our findings, we propose that Prdx6 serves as a cellular indicator of hyperoxidative stress through the hyperoxidation of Prdx6 C47 and plays a role in cellular toxicity. H2O2-induced apoptosis was initiated above 100 μm H2O2 in both HeLa and HEK293 cells (supplemental Table S1) and was consistent with Prdx6 hyperoxidation (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, under moderately increased levels of H2O2 (>100 μm), TNF-α, and LPS (supplemental Fig. S3), Prdx6 was not hyperoxidized, indicating that Prdx6 hyperoxidation is stringently regulated in cells. On the one hand, as depicted in Fig. 4F, 2-Cys Prdxs play key roles in eliminating increased H2O2. Although 2-Cys Prdxs are susceptible to H2O2 and become hyperoxidized, their hyperoxidized forms rapidly reduce into active forms capable of eliminating H2O2. On the other hand, homeostatic Prdx6, having bifunctional activity, iPLA2 and peroxidase, which may play positive roles in cell survival and the protection against H2O2-induced stress, respectively. Under greater than normal H2O2 concentrations, however, Prdx6 is rapidly hyperoxidized, simultaneously increasing its iPLA2 activity and inducing cell cycle arrest, and thereby being involved in H2O2-induced cellular toxicity. In summary, our findings provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that Prdx6 functions both as an antioxidant enzyme and as an inducer of H2O2-induced cellular toxicity. These opposite roles are dramatically dependent on the concentration of H2O2, and may be critical to determine the fate of cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress.

Gene transfer of a dominant negative (d.n.) IKKbeta into rat soleus muscles showed complete inhibition of 7-day disuse-induced activation of a kappaB reporter gene, while overexpression of wild-type (w.t.) IKKbeta did not. Overexpression of a d.n. IKKbeta-EGFP fusion protein showed that atrophy was inhibited by 50%, indicating that IKKbeta is required for the atrophy process. Overexpression of constitutively active (c.a.) IKKbeta-EGFP showed a marked increase in NF-kappaB activity and a decrease in fiber size of weight-bearing soleus muscles, while muscles overexpressing w.t. IKKbeta-HA had no effect. The same results were found for IKKalpha; overexpression of a d.n. form of the protein decreased unloading-induced NF-kappaB activation and inhibited atrophy by 50%, while overexpression of the w.t. protein had no effect. Overexpression of a c.a. IKKalpha-EGFP fusion protein showed that IKKalpha was sufficient to activate NF-kappaB activity and induce fiber atrophy in muscle. Overexpression of d.n. IKKbeta plus d.n. IKKalpha showed an additive effect on the inhibition of disuse atrophy (70%), suggesting that both kinases of the IKK complex are required for muscle atrophy. These data show that both IKKalpha and IKKbeta are necessary and sufficient for physiological muscle atrophy."

Thirty young men and 32 young women (18-31 yr) were studied once, whereas 87 elderly men were studied before and after 1 yr of treatment with 5 mg/day testosterone (T), 75 mg/day dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), or placebo (P); and 57 elderly women were studied before and after 1 yr of treatment with 50 mg/day DHEA or P. [(15)N]Phenylalanine and [(2)H(4)]tyrosine tracers were infused, with measurements in plasma and vastus lateralis muscle. Whole-body protein synthesis per fat-free mass and muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) were lower in elderly than in young individuals (P<0.001), not significantly affected by hormone treatments, and higher in women than in men (P<0.0001), with no sex x age interaction. In regression analyses, peak O2 consumption (VO2peak), resting energy expenditure (REE), and sex were independently associated with muscle FSR, as were VO2peak, REE, and interactions of sex with insulin-like growth factor-II and insulin for whole-body protein synthesis. Women maintain higher protein synthesis than men across the lifespan as rates decline in both sexes, and neither full replacement of DHEA (in elderly men and women) nor partial replacement of bioavailable T (in elderly men) is able to amend the age-related declines."
https://openalex.org/W2018448066,"Limb regeneration requires the coordination of multiple stem cell populations to recapitulate the process of tissue formation. Therefore, bone marrow (BM) -derived cell regulation of skeletal muscle regeneration was examined in mice lacking the CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). Myofiber size, numbers of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs), and recruitment of BM-derived cells and macrophages were assessed after cardiotoxin-induced injury of chimeric mice produced by transplanting BM from wild-type (WT) or CCR2(-/-) mice into irradiated WT or CCR2(-/-) host mice. Regardless of the host genotype, muscle regeneration and recruitment of BM-derived cells and macrophages were similar in mice replenished with WT BM, whereas BM-derived cells and macrophage accumulation were decreased and muscle regeneration was impaired in all animals receiving CCR2(-/-) BM. Furthermore, numbers of MPCs (CD34(+)/Sca-1(-)/CD45(-) cells) were significantly increased in mice receiving CCR2(-/-) BM despite the decreased size of regenerated myofibers. Thus, the expression of CCR2 on BM-derived cells regulated macrophage recruitment into injured muscle, numbers of MPC, and the extent of regenerated myofiber size, all of which were independent of CCR2 expression on host-derived cells. Future studies in regenerative medicine must include consideration of the role of BM-derived cells, possibly macrophages, in CCR2-dependent events that regulate effective skeletal muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2105197388,"Mobilization of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMCs) was shown to have protective effects after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the classical mobilizing agent, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) relapsed after revealing an impaired homing capacity. In the search for superior cytokines, erythropoietin (EPO) appears to be a promising agent. Therefore, we analyzed in a murine model of surgically induced MI the influence of EPO treatment on survival and functional parameters as well as BMC mobilization, homing, and effect on resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs). Human EPO was injected intraperitoneally after ligation of the left anterior descendens (LAD) for 3 days with a total dose of 5000 IU/kg 6 and 30 days after MI, and pressure volume relationships were investigated in vivo. Cardiac tissues were analyzed by histology. To show the effect on BMCs and CSCs, FACS analyses were performed. Homing factors were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. EPO-treated animals showed a significant improvement of survival post-MI (62 vs. 36%). At days 6 and 30, all hemodynamic parameters associated with attenuated remodeling, enhanced neovascularization, and diminished apoptotic cells in the peri-infarct area were improved. BMC subpopulations (CD31(+), c-kit(+), and Sca-1(+) cells) were mobilized, and homing of Sca-1(+) and CXCR4(+) BMCs toward an SDF-1 gradient into the ischemic myocardium was enhanced. However, there was no beneficial effect on CSCs. We have shown that EPO application after MI shows cardioprotective effects. This may be explained by mobilization of BMCs, which are homing via the CXCR-4/SDF-1 axis. However, EPO has no beneficial effects on resident CSCs. Therefore, new treatment regimes using EPO together with other agents may combine complementary beneficial effects preventing ischemic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1968779685,"Multiple interactions between parasite ligands and their receptors on the human erythrocyte are a condition of successful Plasmodium falciparum invasion. The identification and characterization of these receptors presents a major challenge in the effort to understand the mechanism of invasion and to develop the means to prevent it. We describe here a novel member of the reticulocyte-binding family homolog (RH) of P. falciparum, PfRH5, and show that it binds to a previously unrecognized receptor on the RBC. PfRH5 is expressed as a 63 kDa protein and localized at the apical end of the invasive merozoite. We have expressed a fragment of PfRH5 which contains the RBC-binding domain and exhibits the same pattern of interactions with the RBC as the parent protein. Attachment is inhibited if the target cells are exposed to high concentrations of trypsin, but not to lower concentrations or to chymotrypsin or neuraminidase. We have determined the affinity, copy number and apparent molecular mass of the receptor protein. Thus, we have shown that PfRH5 is a novel erythrocyte-binding ligand and the identification and partial characterization of the new RBC receptor may indicate the existence of an unrecognized P. falciparum invasion pathway."

Previous studies have shown that inositol trisphosphate (IP3) sensitizes TRPV4 to mechanical, osmotic, and direct EET stimulation. We now search for the IP3 receptor-binding site on TRPV4 and its relevance to IP3-mediated sensitization. Three putative sites involved in protein-protein interactions were evaluated: a proline-rich domain (PRD), a calmodulin (CaM)-binding site, and the last four amino acids (DAPL) that show a PDZ-binding motif-like. TRPV4-ΔCaM-(Δ812–831) channels preserved activation by hypotonicity, 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, and EET but lost their physical interaction with IP3 receptor 3 and IP3-mediated sensitization. Deletion of a PDZ-binding motif-like (TRPV4-ΔDAPL) did not affect channel activity or IP3-mediated sensitization, whereas TRPV4-ΔPRD-(Δ132–144) resulted in loss of channel function despite correct trafficking.

We have also recently reported a close functional and physical interaction between the inositol trisphosphate receptor 3 (IP3R3) and TRPV4 that sensitizes the latter to the mechano- and osmotransducing messenger 5′-6′-epoxieicosatrienoic acid (EET) (14Fernandes J.

In this study, we reveal that IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4 to EET requires IP3R3 binding to TRPV4 and identify the IP3R3-binding site in a C-terminal region of the TRPV4 that coincides with a previously described CaM-binding site (24Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26541-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Besides, our study has provided further evidence of the importance of the TRPV4 N terminus in channel gating as deletion of a proline-rich domain prevents channel activation by different stimuli despite correct localization and oligomerization. Generation of TRPV4 Mutants—TRPV4 mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) deleting: 13 amino acids (positions 132–144) to generate the mutation lacking the N-terminal PRD domain (TRPV4-ΔPRD); 20 amino acids (positions 812–831) for the mutation lacking the calmodulin-binding domain (TRPV4-ΔCaM); and the last 4 amino acids of the channel (positions 868–871) for the mutation lacking the C-terminal PDZ domain (TRPV4-ΔDAPL). All TRPV4 constructs were tagged with YFP (or cyan fluorescent protein) at the C terminus, and sequences were verified by PCR. Cell Transfection—HEK293 and HeLa cells were transiently transfected with ExGen500 (Fermentas MBI) using 8 eq of polyethyl enimine together with 3 μg of cDNA of the following plasmids: 1.5 μg of rat pcDNA3-IP3R3 plasmid and 1.5 μg of human TRPV4-YPF plasmids, WT, or mutants. Cells were cultured from 24 to 48 h before use. Confocal Imaging—HeLa cells transiently transfected with WT and TRPV4 mutants were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The subcellular localization was analyzed under a ×63 1.32 oil Ph3 CS objective using an inverted Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Original images were not further processed except for adjustments of brightness, contrast, and color balance. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with IP3R3 and TRPV4-YPF plasmids as described before. After 48 h, cells were lysed, total protein was recollected, and Western blot assays were carried out (using 100 μg) as described previously (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to verify the presence of the proteins IP3R3 and TRPV4 channel. Direct and reverse co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done to evaluate the interaction between both proteins. For this, 6μg of anti-GFP (direct immunoprecipitation) or anti-IP3R3 (reverse immunoprecipitation) were incubated for 1 h with 30 μl of G protein (protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C. 1500μg of total protein samples from transfected and non-transfected cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C, gently mixing, with the previous antibody-G protein complex. Immunocomplexes were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 solutions, and Western blot was performed. Primary antibodies used were anti-GFP (1:1000, mouse monoclonal antibody, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and anti-human TRPV4 (1:250, rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the last 19 amino acids. Its specificity has been tested in both heterologous expression systems (27Arniges M. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Albrecht N. Schaefer M. Valverde M.A. J. Biol.

Cytosolic Ca2+ levels are presented as the ratio of emitted fluorescence (510 nm) after excitation at 340 and 380 nm relative to the baseline. All experiments were registered at room temperature, and cells were bathed in an isotonic solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES (∼305 mosmol/liter, pH 7.4). Electrophysiological Recordings—Cationic currents were registered using the patch clamp technique in whole-cell configuration. Patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mm): 20 cesium chloride, 100 cesium acetate, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Na2ATP, and 0.1 NaGTP; 300 mosmol/liter, pH 7.2–7.3. Pipette solutions containing different concentrations of EET (BIOMOL) and IP3 (Calbiochem) were also used and indicated in the corresponding figure (Fig. 4, B–F). Cells were bathed in a solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 1 EGTA (∼310 mosmol/liter, pH 7.3–7.4). HEK293 were clamped at 0 mV, and ramps from –140 mV to +100 mV (400 ms) were applied at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. Ramp data were acquired at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Only those cells that presented YFP fluorescence were recorded. Statistics—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Analysis of variance or Student's t test was performed with the Sigma Plot 8.02 (Systat Software, Inc.) and SPSS to determine statistical significance. Bonferroni's test was used for post hoc comparison of means. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Localization of Wild Type and TRPV4 Mutants—We evaluated three putative IP3R-interacting sites in TRPV4 that may participate in IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4 to mechanical and osmotic stimuli (Fig. 1A). An N-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD), unique to TRPV4 and not present in other TRPV proteins, has been implicated in the channel interaction with the regulatory proteins PACSINs (28Cuajungco M.P. Grimm C. Oshima K. D'hoedt D. Nilius B. Mensenkamp A.R. Bindels R.J. Plomann M. Heller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18753-18762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A shorter C terminus PRD has also been identified in other members of the TRP family (29Montell, C. (2005) Science's STKE 2005, re3Google Scholar) and appears to participate in protein-protein interactions including the Homer family proteins and IP3R, among others (30Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M.

TRPV4 also presents a CaM-binding site on its C terminus (24Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26541-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CaM-binding sites have been recognized in different TRP channels as important regulatory domains, exerting both inhibitory and facilitatory effects on TRPs upon Ca2+-CaM binding (31Zhu M.X. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Besides, there is an overlap between the CaM- and IP3R-binding sites in many TRPs (31Zhu M.X. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that IP3R binding to and displacing CaM from its binding site contributes to the activation of canonical TRP (TRPC) channels (32Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). CaM binding to ankyrin repeats of TRPV1 has also been identified (33Rosenbaum T. Gordon-Shaag A. Munari M. Gordon S.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 34Lishko P.V. Procko E. Jin X. Phelps C.B. Gaudet R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), but we do not know at present whether this N-terminal CaM-binding site is also present in TRPV4. Finally, we checked whether the final four amino acids of TRPV4 (DAPL) that present a PDZ-binding motif-like (35Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), may participate in the interaction with IP3R. The subcellular distribution of wild type (TRPV4-WT, Fig. 1B) and TRPV4 mutants lacking the PRD (TRPV4-ΔPRD) (Fig. 1C), the CaM (TRPV4-ΔCaM) (Fig. 1D), or the final four amino acids (TRPV4-ΔDAPL) (Fig. 1E) was examined by confocal microscopy in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Both WT and deletion TRPV4 mutants localized to the plasma membrane. Activation of WT and TRPV4 Mutants by Cell Swelling and 4αPDD—Intracellular [Ca2+] measurements using the fura-2 dye indicator showed a clear response to 30% hypotonic solutions in HeLa cells co-expressing TRPV4-WT, TRPV4-ΔCaM, or TRPV4-ΔDAPL constructs with IP3R3 (Fig. 2, A, C, and D). On restoration of the isotonic condition and recovering the basal [Ca2+] levels, cells also triggered a robust Ca2+ signal in response to 4αPDD (1 μm), a synthetic activator of TRPV4 (19Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), thereby confirming the channels functional expression. However, cells overexpressing TRPV4-ΔPRD did not respond to either 4αPDD (Fig. 2B) or hypotonic solutions (Fig. 2B, inset) but showed a typical Ca2+ signal in response to the purinergic agonist ATP (100 μm). Altogether, the results indicated that TRPV4-WT, TRPV4-ΔCaM, and TRPV4-ΔDAPL used in this study trafficked to the plasma membrane where they responded to typical TRPV4-activating stimuli. On the other hand, TRPV4-ΔPRD, despite its correct localization, did not elicit Ca2+ signals in response to hypotonicity or 4αPDD and, therefore, was of no use for the identification of the molecular mechanism underlying IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4. Nevertheless, TRPV4-ΔPRD revealed an additional piece of evidence suggesting the relevance of the N terminus in TRPV4 gating. A previous report has already pointed to the PRD as a functionally important domain for TRPV4 channel gating (26D'hoedt D. Owsianik G. Prenen J. Cuajungco M.P. Grimm C. Heller S. Voets T. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6272-6280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). D'Hoedt et al. (26D'hoedt D. Owsianik G. Prenen J. Cuajungco M.P. Grimm C. Heller S. Voets T. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6272-6280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) showed that combined mutation of P142A, P143A, and P152A resulted in channels unresponsive to hypotonic shocks, AA, and heat that retained the response to 4αPDD. Our more drastic approach, deleting the entire PRD, in addition to preventing the response to hypotonicity also induced the loss of 4αPDD response. Deletion of the CaM-binding Site of TRPV4 Prevents IP3RBinding and Sensitization to Hypotonic Stimulus—We have previously reported the modulatory effect of IP3R on TRPV4 activation by mechanical and osmotic stimuli as well as the immunoprecipitation of TRPV4 and IP3R3 (not IP3R1) (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We now address the identification of the IP3R-binding site on TRPV4 and its relevance for IP3-mediated sensitization. Expression of the proteins of interest in the lysates later used for co-immunoprecipitation studies was probed by Western blotting with anti-GFP (to detect TRPV4) and anti-IP3R3 (Fig. 3, A and B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments found that deletion of the CaM-binding site (V4-ΔCaM) abolished IP3R3 binding (Fig. 3C), whereas deletion of the last four amino acids (V4-ΔDAPL) did not affect IP3R3 binding (Fig. 3D). These results were further confirmed by reversed co-immunoprecipitation (results not shown). The functional consequence of the loss of IP3R3 binding to TRPV4-ΔCaM on IP3-mediated sensitization was first evaluated with the intracellular [Ca2+] indicator fura-2. As reported previously (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), concomitant activation of the phospholipase A2-AA-EET and phospholipase C-IP3 pathways using hypotonic solutions and ATP, respectively, resulted in TRPV4 sensitization. Fig. 3E shows Ca2+ signals obtained in HeLa cells expressing TRPV4-WT and IP3R3 challenged with a short exposure to 30% hypotonic solution and then exposed to hypotonic solution containing 1 μm ATP (a concentration that does not trigger Ca2+ response in HeLa cells (14Fernandes J.

The addition of extracellular ATP potentiated the hypotonicity-induced Ca2+ response. Mean increases in the Ca2+ signal are shown in Fig. 3E (bottom). Potentiation of the hypotonicity-induced Ca2+ signal by ATP was also observed in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV4-WT and IP3R3 (not shown). Similar results were obtained examining the TRPV4-ΔDAPL construct that preserves IP3R3 binding (Fig. 3G). However, TRPV4-ΔCaM channels retained their ability to respond to hypotonic solutions but showed no enhancement of the Ca2+ signal when challenged a second time with hypotonic solutions containing ATP (Fig. 3F). In fact, similarly to TRPV4-WT-expressing cells exposed to a second hypotonic challenge in the absence of ATP (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the second hypotonic shock (containing ATP) generated a reduced Ca2+ signal in TRPV4-ΔCaM. Deletion of the CaM-binding Site of TRPV4 Prevents IP3-mediated Sensitization to EET—EET metabolites of arachidonic acid are the final activators of TRPV4 in response to hypotonic shocks (14Fernandes J.

Accordingly, TRPV4-expressing cells respond to either external (18Watanabe H. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) or internal EET-containing solutions (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), an effect that can be potentiated by IP3 (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In our attempt to characterize the importance of the CaM-binding site in the modulation of TRPV4 activation by osmotic stimulus, we studied the impact of deleting the CaM-binding site on the IP3-mediated potentiation of EET-induced TRPV4 currents. Whole-cell TRPV4 currents of equal magnitude were recorded from TRPV4-WT- and TRPV4-ΔCaM-expressing HEK293 cells exposed to 1 μm 4αPDD (Fig. 4A). Similarly, maximal TRPV4 currents recorded in HEK293 cells dialyzed with pipette solutions containing 156 nm EET were undistinguishable between TRPV4-WT- and TRPV4-ΔCaM-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Mean responses measured at +100 mV in TRPV4-WT- and TRPV4-ΔCaM-expressing HEK293 dialyzed with 156 nm EET were 94 ± 22 pA/pF (n = 4) and 79 ± 14 pA/pF (n = 7), respectively (p > 0.05). The electrophysiological data confirmed the observation carried out using intracellular Ca2+ indicators that TRPV4-ΔCaM are functional channels responding to typical TRPV4 stimuli. We have previously reported that low concentrations of EET (1 nm) or 30 μm IP3 (added to the intracellular pipette solutions) hardly activate TRPV4 currents. However, the presence of both 1 nm EET and 30 μm IP3 triggered sizeable TRPV4 currents in both native and heterologously expressing cell systems (14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), indicative of the IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4 to the mechano- and osmotransducing messenger EET. When 1 nm EET intracellular pipette solutions were tested on TRPV4-ΔCaM channels, no differences with TRPV4-WT channels were observed (26 ± 13 pA/pF (n = 5) and 27 ± 12 pA/pF (n = 9), respectively; measured at +100 mV; p > 0.05) (Fig. 4C). A significant difference in current magnitude was detected between the response of TRPV4-WT and TRPV4-ΔCaM channels to the combined presence of 1 nm EET and 30 μm IP3 in the intracellular pipette solutions (Fig. 4D). Considering the reported positive feedback of Ca2+, via Ca2+-CaM binding to TRPV4 (24Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26541-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a possible alternative explanation for the absence of IP3-mediated sensitization in TRPV4-ΔCaM channels may be the lost Ca-CaM binding. Although we considered this an unlikely possibility, as whole-cell patch clamp experiments were carried out in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of EGTA (see also Ref. 14Fernandes J. Lorenzo I.M. Andrade Y.N. Garcia-Elias A. Serra S.A. Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this possibility was further ruled out using the CaM inhibitor W-7. The presence of the CaM inhibitor W-7 (30 μm) did not affected the IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4-WT channels to 1 nm EET and 30 μm IP3 (Fig. 4E). Mean responses measured at +100 mV in YFP-, TRPV4-WT-, and TRPV4-ΔCaM-expressing HEK293 dialyzed with 1 nm EET and 30 μm IP3 are shown in Fig. 4F. Mean response of TRPV4-WT cells dialyzed with 1 nm EET, 30 μm IP3,and 30 μm W-7 are also included. Conclusion—Altogether, our results show that IP3-mediated sensitization of TRPV4 is Ca-CaM independent, that TRPV4 channels lacking the CaM-binding site lose their interaction with IP3R3, and consequently, they also lacked the IP3-mediated sensitization to osmotic and direct EET stimulation. Our data with the TRPV4-ΔPRD also highlight the relevance of the proline-rich N-terminal region of TRPV4 in channel gating. We acknowledge E. Vázquez and C. Plata for excellent technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2020235727,"Background In HIV-infected patients on long-term HAART, virus persistence in resting long-lived CD4 T cells is a major barrier to curing the infection. Cell quiescence, by favouring HIV latency, reduces the risk of recognition and cell destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Several cell-activation-based approaches have been proposed to disrupt cell quiescence and then virus latency, but these approaches have not eradicated the virus. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a CD4+ T-cell subset with particular activation properties. We investigated the role of these cells in virus persistence in patients on long-term HAART. Methodology/Principal Findings We found evidence of infection of resting Tregs (HLADR−CD69−CD25hiFoxP3+CD4+ T cells) purified from patients on prolonged HAART. HIV DNA harbouring cells appear more abundant in the Treg subset than in non-Tregs. The half-life of the Treg reservoir was estimated at 20 months. Since Tregs from patients on prolonged HAART showed hyporesponsiveness to cell activation and inhibition of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte-related functions upon activation, therapeutics targeting cell quiescence to induce virus expression may not be appropriate for purging the Treg reservoir. Conclusions Our results identify Tregs as a particular compartment within the latent reservoir that may require a specific approach for its purging."
https://openalex.org/W2059399597,"Human cytidine deaminase apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) proteins have been classified as either Z1- or Z2-type cytidine deaminases on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of their catalytic domains. Despite the identification of a number of Z1-type domain-containing cytidine deaminases, only one copy of Z2-type cytidine deaminase has been detected in each of the mammalian species evaluated thus far. Z1-type human APOBEC3 proteins are known to exhibit broad activities against diverse retroelements. However, the potential role of the only human Z2-type cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3H (A3H), in the restriction of retroelements has not yet been fully characterized. Here, we demonstrate that human A3H is a potent inhibitor of non-LTR LINE-1 transposition. Interestingly, it was also as efficient as A3G in inhibiting Alu retrotransposition, despite its poor association with Alu RNA. We have further demonstrated, for the first time, that human APOBEC3DE is also a potent inhibitor of Alu retrotransposition. Variants of A3H have divergent antiviral activities against HIV-1-Vif-deficient viruses. Unlike the anti-HIV-1 cytidine deaminases A3G and A3F, A3H is moderately regulated by interferons. These observations suggest that human Z2-type cytidine deaminase A3H variants have varying intrinsic abilities to restrict retroelements and that various APOBEC3 proteins may have evolved distinct inhibitory mechanisms against retroelements."
https://openalex.org/W2120772426,"Covalent modification of cullins by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (neddylation) regulates protein ubiquitination by promoting the assembly of cullin-RING ligase E3 complexes. Like ubiquitination, neddylation results from an enzymatic cascade involving the sequential activity of a dedicated E1 (APPBP1/Uba3), E2 (Ubc12), and an ill-defined E3. We show that SCCRO (also known as DCUN1D1) binds to the components of the neddylation pathway (Cullin-ROC1, Ubc12, and CAND1) and augments but is not required for cullin neddylation in reactions using purified recombinant proteins. We also show that SCCRO recruits Ubc12∼NEDD8 to the CAND1-Cul1-ROC1 complex but that this is not sufficient to dissociate or overcome the inhibitory effects of CAND1 on cullin neddylation in purified protein assays. In contrast to findings in cellular systems where no binding is seen, we show that SCCRO and CAND1 can bind to the neddylated Cul1-ROC1 complex in assays using purified recombinant proteins. Although neddylated (not unneddylated) Cul1-ROC1 is released from CAND1 upon incubation with testis lysate from SCCRO+/+ mice, the addition of recombinant SCCRO is required to achieve the same results in lysate from SCCRO–/– mice. Combined, these results suggest that SCCRO is an important component of the neddylation E3 complex that functions to recruit charged E2 and is involved in the release of inhibitory effects of CAND1 on cullin-RING ligase E3 complex assembly and activity.

Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Given its essential role, ubiquitination is a highly regulated process that involves the sequential action of three enzymes termed as E1, E2, and E3. In this enzymatic cascade, E1 initiates the process by forming a high energy thioester bond with Ub in an ATP-coupled reaction. The Ub is then transferred to E2 as a thioester intermediate. Finally, E3s serve as the targeting arm in the ubiquitination process, mediating the transfer of Ub from E2 to the target protein to create an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine in Ub and a lysine residue on the substrate protein. Once attached, the Ub itself can be modified to generate polyubiquitin chains on the target protein (6Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The functional effects of ubiquitination are influenced by the chain length and the residue on the Ub to which the chain is attached. Polyubiquitination promotes translocation to the 26 S proteasome for degradation. Other functional effects of mono- and polyubiquitination include protein translocation, interaction, and activation. Although there is only one known E1 (except in plants) and relatively few E2s, E3s exist in multiple forms to allow for specific protein targeting (6Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In general, E3s are modular multiprotein complexes that can be divided into two broad categories based on the presence of either a HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) or RING (Really Interesting New Gene)-finger domain-containing protein at their core. Although HECT E3s form a thioester intermediate with the Ub before its transfer, RING-containing complexes serve as scaffolds to facilitate the direct transfer of Ub from E2 to the target protein. Cullin RING ligases (CRLs) constitute the largest class of E3s in mammals (7Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 8Hotton S.K. Callis J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 467-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All CRLs are anchored by cullins, a highly conserved protein family with seven known isoforms in humans (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4a, Cul4b, Cul5, and Cul7). A small RING protein (ROC1) and a variable substrate recognition subunit bind to the cullin core to form the CRL complex. The SCF (SKP1 cullin1 F-box) complex is the prototypic CRL E3 complex and is made up of ROC1 bound to the C terminus and SKP1 adaptor protein bound to the N terminus of Cul1. SKP1 in turn binds to a host of different F-box containing proteins to confer target specificity, and ROC1 binds to E2 to form the catalytic core of the SCF complex. Assembly of CRL complexes serves as a key regulatory step for ubiquitination. Cullins normally exist as part of two mutually exclusive complexes in cells. The majority of cullins are in complex with CAND1 (Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1), which sterically inhibits assembly of CRL complexes. The covalent modification of cullins with the ubiquitin-like protein (Ublp) NEDD8, in a process termed neddylation, dissociates CAND1 and promotes assembly of CRL complexes (9Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q.

In addition, cullin neddylation also enhances CRL activity through the recruitment of ubiquitin E2s to the complex and possibly facilitating cullin heterodimer formation (13Kawakami T. Chiba T.

Cell. 2007; 18: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, deneddylation of cullins, principally by the COP9 signalosome, promotes dissociation of CRL complexes and binding to CAND1. Several studies suggest that cycling of neddylation and deneddylation is required for normal CRL function (8Hotton S.K. Callis J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 467-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J.

Neddylation occurs by mechanisms analogous to Ub or Ublp conjugation, involving the sequential activity of a dedicated E1, E2, and E3. Although APPBP1/Uba3 functions as the E1 and Ubc12 as the E2, the precise components of the neddylation E3 remain to be established. Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified SCCRO (squamous cell carcinoma-related oncogene) within a recurrent amplification peak at 3q26.3 in squamous cell carcinomas (18Sarkaria I. P O.c. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B. Yonekawa Y. Dudas M. Kaufman A. Ryan R. Ghossein R. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Activation of SCCRO by amplification is associated with malignant transformation in vitro and in vivo and an aggressive clinical course in human cancers. Moreover, cancer cell lines carrying amplification are addicted to high SCCRO levels, rapidly undergoing apoptosis with SCCRO suppression using RNAi (18Sarkaria I. P O.c. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B. Yonekawa Y. Dudas M. Kaufman A. Ryan R. Ghossein R. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we show that SCCRO interacts with known cullin isoforms as well as ROC1, Ubc12 and CAND1. SCCRO preferentially binds to Ubc12∼NEDD8 thioester and augments cullin neddylation in both lysate and purified systems. Although SCCRO is not essential in a purified system, activated neddylation is reduced in extracts made from SCCRO–/– mice. In addition, these mice have reduced viability and severe developmental defects, suggesting that SCCRO plays an important role in vivo. Details of the SCCRO knock-out mouse construction and characterization will be published elsewhere. 5A. Kaufman, L. Hyurn, A. Conway, A. Kim, D. Pham, S. Talbot, S. Broderick, G. Huang, P. Morris, K. Manova, G. Hannicut, Y. Ramanathan, and B. Singh, manuscript in preparation. 5A. Kaufman, L. Hyurn, A. Conway, A. Kim, D. Pham, S. Talbot, S. Broderick, G. Huang, P. Morris, K. Manova, G. Hannicut, Y. Ramanathan, and B. Singh, manuscript in preparation. Although SCCRO does not release CAND1 or overcome its inhibition of cullin neddylation in assays using purified protein, Cul1-ROC1 dissociates from CAND1 when incubated in lysate from SCCRO+/+ mice but not SCCRO–/– mice. These findings suggest that SCCRO plays an essential role in neddylation and supports its inclusion as a component of the E3 complex for neddylation. Alignment and Sequence Analyses—Data base and BLAST searches were carried out at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW program. Reagents—All constructs were generated by standard PCR ligation-based methods and verified by automated sequencing. Proteins were expressed as GST fusions in Escherichia coli, induced overnight at 18 °C with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified by passing through glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) followed by thrombin cleavage where required. Cul1-ROC1 was expressed and purified from E. coli essentially as described previously (19Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). APPBP1/Uba3, Ubc12, and NEDD8 were obtained from a commercial source (Boston Biochem). cDNAs for mammalian transfection were cloned into pUSE-amp or pCMV-HA vector (Clontech). Anti-SCCRO RNAi and scrambled RNAi were generated, validated, and used as previously described (18Sarkaria I. P O.c. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B. Yonekawa Y. Dudas M. Kaufman A. Ryan R. Ghossein R. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) using manufacturer's specifications. All cell lines used in this study were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum-containing antibiotics. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-Cul1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Cul2 (Abcam), anti-Cul3 (BD Biosciences), anti-Cul4, anti-Cul5, anti-SKP2 (Santa Cruz), anti-ROC1 (Abcam), anti-SKP1 (Abnova), anti-Ubc12 (Rockland, MA), anti-NEDD8 (Invitrogen), anti-CAND1 (BD Biosciences), anti-tubulin (Calbiochem), anti-HA (Abcam), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). Anti-SCCRO (rabbit polyclonal) antibody was produced and utilized as described previously (18Sarkaria I. P O.c. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B. Yonekawa Y. Dudas M. Kaufman A. Ryan R. Ghossein R. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Anti-SCCRO monoclonal antibody was raised against an N-terminal region of the protein in SCCRO–/– mice. This antibody was found to be highly sensitive and specific in control experiments (data not shown). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz, CA) were used according to the manufacturers' specifications. GST Pulldown Assay—GST tagged proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads by gentle rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed 3 times with EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 20× bead volume. The beads were incubated with 500 μg of HeLa cell lysate or purified proteins as indicated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by 3 washes with EBC buffer at 20× bead volume. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 6× Laemmli buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by Western blot. For mass spectrometric analysis, the resolved proteins were stained with Coomassie R250. Bands were excised and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-reTOF) mass spectrometric analysis. Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described earlier (18Sarkaria I. P O.c. Talbot S.G. Reddy P.G. Ngai I. Maghami E. Patel K.N. Lee B. Yonekawa Y. Dudas M. Kaufman A. Ryan R. Ghossein R. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Ramanathan Y. Singh B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9437-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, all cells were lysed using mammalian cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (Cell Signaling). One mg of lysate was incubated with antibody (αHA, αSCCRO, αROC1, or preimmune sera) bound to agarose beads by gentle rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The same wash and detection sequence was used as for the GST pulldown assay. Thioester Reactions—Reactions were performed at room temperature in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) with 4 mm ATP, 80 nm APPBP1/Uba3, 800 nm Ubc12, and 9 μm NEDD8. Reactions were quenched with 3× non-reducing Laemmli buffer (without DTT), and the presence of Ubc12∼NEDD8 thioester complexes were verified by Western blot for Ubc12 and/or NEDD8 in the presence and absence of 50 mm DTT. Time course experiments showed that incubation times greater that 10 min resulted in the formation of a small fraction of NEDD8 bound to Ubc12 that was not reducible by DTT (supplemental Fig. 1). Accordingly, all thioester reactions were carried out for 10 min or less. For use in binding assays, the reaction mix was quenched with the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm and purified on a G-50 micro spin desalting column. For competition experiments, reaction conditions were identical except for the addition of a gradient of free Ubc12 to the purified thioester reaction mix. Reaction conditions for HeLa transfected with HA-Ubc12 or HA-Ubc12Δ1–26 was the same, except a longer incubation time (30 min) was employed for HA-Ubc12Δ1–26. In Vitro Neddylation—The source of Cullin-ROC1 substrate for in vitro neddylation reactions was either HeLa lysates or mouse tissue extracts or was bacterially derived (see above). Lysates from testes were used, as the SCCRO–/– mouse had developmental defects restricted to the testis.5 For reactions using HeLa or tissue-derived Cullin-ROC1 complexes, 100 or 10 μg, respectively, of lysates (Cul1 concentration ∼20 fmol) were added to reactions containing 0.2–2 pmol of APPBP1/Uba3, 1–12.5 pmol of Ubc12, and 150 pmol of cold NEDD8 or 32P-labeled NEDD8 in neddylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 55 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and stopped with the addition of 6× Laemmli buffer. Reactions with bacterially derived substrate were performed at 30 °C in neddylation buffer containing 20 nm Cul1-ROC1, 4 mm ATP, 10 nm of APPBP1/Uba3, 20 nm Ubc12, and 0.9 μm NEDD8. In reactions containing CAND1, Cul1-ROC1 was preincubated with the indicated amounts of CAND1 for 15 min at room temperature. Proteins were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to autoradiography and/or Western blot analysis. For quantification Western blots were imaged using MultiImage Light Cabinet and quantified using Alpha-EaseFC v3.2.1 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Assay for Binding to Neddylated and Unneddylated Cullins—Neddylation reactions were performed on purified Cul1-ROC1 at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the products were purified on a G-50 micro spin desalting column. A small aliquot of the flow-through was subjected to Western blot analysis for Cul1 to establish the level of cullin neddylation. The remaining flow-through was incubated with GST-SCCRO and/or GST-CAND1 (at limiting concentrations) at room temperature for 20 min followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubation with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 45 min. After three 20× bead volume washes with EBC wash buffer, 6x Laemmli buffer was added to the beads, and bound proteins were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blot for Cul1. To assess the effects of lysate on release of cullins from CAND1, neddylated or unneddylated Cul1-ROC1 was incubated with GST-CAND1 at room temperature for 20 min and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. SCCRO, SCCRO-D241N and/or testis lysate from SCCRO+/+ or SCCRO–/– mice was added onto the beads and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by three 20× bead volume washes with EBC buffer. 6× Laemmli buffer was added to the beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot for Cul1. SCCRO Interacts with Components of the Neddylation Pathway—We identified SCCRO by fluorescent in situ hybridization-based fine resolution mapping of a recurrent amplification at 3q26.3 that is present in multiple human cancers (18Sarkaria I.

As a step toward understanding the molecular function of SCCRO, we sought to identify interacting proteins. GST-SCCRO pulldown from HeLa lysates identified two unique bands relative to GST alone (Fig. 1A). These bands were excised and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-ReTOF) identifying CAND1 and members of the cullin family of proteins (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, and Cul4) as putative binding partners (Fig. 1A). We confirmed these interactions by GST-SCCRO pulldown from HeLa lysates followed by Western blot for each of the identified proteins. In addition, we found that SCCRO also binds to Cul5 and ROC1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). GST pulldown assays using purified proteins showed that SCCRO directly binds to ROC1, consistent with findings in yeast (data not shown) (23Yang X. Zhou J. Sun L. Wei Z. Gao J. Gong W. Xu R.M. Rao Z. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24490-24494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because they are soluble only as a complex with ROC1, we could not assess if SCCRO can also bind to cullins directly. Given the established role of CAND1 and the cullin family of proteins in neddylation, we assessed for binding to other proteins in the neddylation pathway, including NEDD8, APPBP1/Uba3, and Ubc12 and found that SCCRO interacts with Ubc12 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The co-immunoprecipitation of SCCRO with each of its putative binding partners in HA-SCCRO-transfected HeLa cells confirmed that the observed interactions occur in cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2). SCCRO does not bind to Ubc9 (an E2 for sumoylation), SKP1, or SKP2, suggesting that its interactions are specific to the components of the neddylation pathway (data not shown). To confirm these interactions occur in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using a SCCRO monoclonal antibody that is highly sensitive and specific for SCCRO. Western blots on the immunoprecipitates showed that SCCRO binds to Cul1, ROC1, and CAND1 (Fig. 1D, left panel). Similarly, reciprocal immunoprecipitation for ROC1 followed by Western blotting confirmed the interaction with SCCRO as well as CAND1, Cul1 and SKP2 (Fig. 1D, right panel). While SCCRO did not interact with SKP2, ROC1 bound, as expected. To map binding domains, we created a series of SCCRO deletions and point mutants as GST fusions, including those involving the N-terminal UBA (amino acids 8–45) and C-terminal DCUN1 domain (amino acids 60–259) (Fig. 1, B, C, and E, and supplemental Fig. 2). Whereas the N-terminal deletions (SCCROΔ1–33, SCCROΔ1–45, and SCCROΔ1–82) retained binding, C-terminal deletions (SCCROΔ151–259 and SCCROΔ210–259) lost detectable binding to CAND1, Cul-ROC1, and Ubc12, suggesting that these proteins interact with the C-terminal 49 amino acids within the DCUN1 domain of SCCRO (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 3 and 4, and E). Point mutations were generated in highly conserved residues within the C-terminal region of SCCRO and tested for binding to cullins, CAND1, and Ubc12. SCCRO-D241N lost detectable binding to CAND1 and Cul-ROC1 complex but not to Ubc12, suggesting that Ubc12 and CAND1/Cul-ROC1 bind to different regions within the C terminus of SCCRO (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Our findings using a biochemical approach are consistent with results from structure-based analyses of Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DCN-1/Dcn1p where mutations in a similar residue in the SCCRO paralogue DCN1 (Asp-259) also resulted in loss of binding to cullin-ROC1 (23Yang X.

SCCRO Augments Cullin Neddylation—Recently it was reported that DCN-1/Dcn1p, the C. elegans and S. cerevisiae orthologs of SCCRO, facilitate cullin neddylation (23Yang X. Zhou J. Sun L. Wei Z. Gao J.

Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test if the human ortholog also promotes cullin neddylation, we performed in vitro neddylation assays in the presence of varying concentrations of SCCRO. Reactions containing NEDD8, recombinant APPBP1/Uba3 (E1), Ubc12 (E2), ATP, and whole cell lysate from HeLa cells (as a source of cullin-ROC1 substrate) showed a dose-dependent increase in cullin neddylation with SCCRO (Fig. 2, A and B). A time course reaction showed that SCCRO also enhances the rate of cullin neddylation (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether binding is required for the observed functional effects, we supplemented neddylation reactions with SCCRO or selected SCCRO deletions. Whereas the N-terminal deletion (SCCROΔ1–33) enhanced the rate of Cul3 neddylation to levels similar to SCCRO, the C-terminal deletion (SCCROΔ210–259) that loses binding to Ubc12 and Cul-ROC1 failed to augment cullin neddylation beyond basal levels (Fig. 2E). Consistent with these findings, we found that SCCRO, but not the loss of cullin binding mutant SCCRO-D241N, increased neddylation efficiency beyond basal levels (Fig. 2, C and D). These findings suggest that the effects of SCCRO on cullin neddylation require its interaction with Cul-ROC1 and/or Ubc12 and implicate it as a component of the neddylation E3. Furthermore, cullin neddylation increased with transient expression of HA-SCCRO and decreased with knockdown of SCCRO by RNAi (Fig. 3B). The decrease in cullin neddylation as a result of SCCRO protein knockdown by RNAi was rescued by the addition of recombinant SCCRO to the lysate (Fig. 3D). SCCRO Is Not Required for Neddylation in Vitro—Several in vitro studies suggest that ROC1 functions as an E3 ligase and is sufficient to promote neddylation by itself (26Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q.

Although Cul1 neddylation occurred in its absence, the addition of SCCRO enhanced the rate of cullin neddylation (Fig. 2F). This is consistent with published reports showing cullin neddylation occurs in the absence of SCCRO in vitro (26Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Morimoto M. Nishida T. Nagayama Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neddylation is reduced in testis lysates from SCCRO–/– mice (Fig. 3E, right panel) as well as in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae where DCN-1/Dcn1p knockouts lose neddylation activity (24Kurz T. Ozlu N.

Nature. 2005; 435: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) Combined, these findings suggest that although SCCRO is not required for neddylation in vitro, it may be required in vivo. SCCRO Preferentially Interacts with Ubc12 Thioester Intermediate—The mechanisms and reaction processivity involved in the conjugation of Ub and Ublp are highly conserved.

https://openalex.org/W2024317868,"Cdk9 is the catalytic subunit of a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor known as positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). The kinase function of P-TEFb requires phosphorylation of Thr-186 in the T-loop of Cdk9 to allow substrates to access the catalytic core of the enzyme. To identify human phosphatases that dephosphorylate the T-loop of Cdk9, we used a Thr-186-phosphospecific antiserum to screen a phosphatase expression library. Overexpression of PPM1A and the related PPM1B greatly reduced Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation in vivo. PPM1A and Cdk9 appear to associate in vivo as the proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated. The short hairpin RNA depletion of PPM1A resulted in an increase in Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation. In phosphatase reactions in vitro, purified PPM1A could dephosphorylate Thr-186 both with and without the association of 7SK RNA, a small nuclear RNA that is bound to ∼50% of total cellular P-TEFb. PPM1B only efficiently dephosphorylated Cdk9 Thr-186 in vitro when 7SK RNA was depleted from P-TEFb. Taken together, our data indicate that PPM1A and to some extent PPM1B are important negative regulators of P-TEFb function.

Price D.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 2Zhou Q. Yik J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). P-TEFb enhances the processivity of RNA polymerase II through the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the polymerase as well as antagonizing the actions of negative factors such as negative elongation factor and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor. P-TEFb is comprised of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), the kinase core, and its cyclin partner, either Cyclin T1, Cyclin T2, or Cyclin K. Two isoforms of Cdk9 exist, a major 42-kDa protein and a minor 55-kDa protein that contains 117 residues at the amino terminus that are absent in the 42-kDa protein (3Shore S.M. Byers S.A. Maury W. Price D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 307: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In most cells examined, Cyclin T1 is the predominant regulatory subunit for Cdk9. The Cyclin T1/P-TEFb complex has been studied extensively as this P-TEFb complex is targeted by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein to activate RNA polymerase II transcription of the integrated provirus, and this is essential for viral replication. As a key transcription factor, the activity of P-TEFb is carefully regulated within the cell. The first level of control is mediated by the regulated expression of its components, namely Cdk9 and its Cyclin partners. In primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, Cdk9 and Cyclin T2 expression are relatively high, whereas that of Cyclin T1 is low. Upon T cell activation or monocyte differentiation, Cyclin T1 protein expression is strongly up-regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms, whereas expression of Cdk9 and Cyclin T2 remains relatively constant (4Liou L.Y.

Low levels of Cyclin T1 in resting CD4+ T cells and freshly isolated blood monocytes may function as one of the rate-limiting factors not only for transcription of many cellular genes but also for transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 provirus (10Yu W. Wang Y. Shaw C.A. Qin X.F. Rice A.P. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Lassen K.G. Ramyar K.X. Bailey J.R. Zhou Y. Siliciano R.F. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In cells where the overall amount of P-TEFb has reached its steady state, another level of control is used. At this level, P-TEFb is negatively regulated by its reversible association with a small nuclear RNA known as 7SK and the HEXIM proteins HEXIM1 and HEXIM2. In cells examined to date, the HEXIM1 protein is expressed at an approximate 10-fold higher level than the HEXIM2 protein (12Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16360-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, roughly 50% of cellular P-TEFb complexes are associated with 7SK/HEXIM and are catalytically repressed (13Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 14Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that 7SK RNA functions as a scaffold for the formation of the P-TEFb·7SK·HEXIM1 complex. However, the association of 7SK is not sufficient to inactivate the kinase complex as HEXIM1 has been identified as the key suppressor for P-TEFb function both in vitro and in vivo (15Michels A.A.

Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although the binding of 7SK to P-TEFb does not require HEXIM1, the binding of HEXIM1 to P-TEFb is strictly 7SK-dependent (16Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is currently believed that the existence of two pools of P-TEFb in the nucleus, an active 7SK/HEXIM-free and a repressed 7SK/HEXIM-bound pool, allows the cell to maintain P-TEFb activity at a regulated yet dynamic equilibrium (2Zhou Q. Yik J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recent work has also identified LARP7 (17Markert A. Grimm M. Martinez J. Wiesner J. Meyerhans A. Meyuhas O. Sickmann A. Fischer U. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and PIP7S (18He N. Jahchan N.S. Hong E. Li Q. Bayfield M.A. Maraia R.J. Luo K. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 588-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) as proteins associated in the P-TEFb·7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex. Given the importance of P-TEFb regulation in RNA polymerase II transcription, we were interested in identifying cellular factors that regulate P-TEFb activation in addition to 7SK and the HEXIM1/2 proteins. A critical regulatory residue in Cdk9 is Thr-186 in a region of the protein termed the T-loop. Cyclin-dependent kinases contain a conserved threonine in their T-loop, and phosphorylation of this residue induces a conformational change that allows Cdk substrates to access the catalytic core of the enzyme (19Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 20Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). In the case of Cdk9, the association of 7SK with P-TEFb has been shown to be dependent on Thr-186 phosphorylation (21Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that under conditions of stress, either UV irradiation or treatment with high concentrations of hexamethylene bisacetamide, the phosphatases PP2B and PP1α act cooperatively to disrupt P-TEFb from the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein through the dephosphorylation of Thr-186 (22Chen R. Liu M. Li H. Xue Y. Ramey W.N. He N. Ai N. Luo H. Zhu Y. Zhou N. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, kinases and phosphatases that regulate Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation under non-stress conditions have not been identified. Phosphatases that dephosphorylate Thr-186 in Cdk9 are likely to be protein-serine/threonine phosphatases. Cellular protein-serine/threonine phosphatases are classified into three families (23Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar): the PPMs (protein phosphatases, magnesium-dependent), which are mostly monomeric enzymes requiring the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activities; PPPs (phosphoprotein phosphatases) such as PP1A and PP2A, which are mostly oligomeric holoenzymes with related catalytic subunits bound by distinct regulatory subunits; and the less well characterized FCP/SCP (transcription factor IIF-associating CTD phosphatase/small CTD phosphatase) family represented by FCP1 and SCPs that dephosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II. In the present study, we utilized a newly developed antiserum that recognizes phosphorylated Thr-186 in the Cdk9 T-loop. Using a phosphatase expression library, we identified two cellular phosphatases, PPM1A and the related PPM1B, that when overexpressed can dephosphorylate the Cdk9 T-loop in vivo. We found that PPM1A associates with Cdk9 in vivo and can directly dephosphorylate the Cdk9 T-loop in vitro. Depletion of PPM1A with shRNAs resulted in an increase in Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation. Our data also suggest that although 7SK may protect Thr-186 from being dephosphorylated by PPM1B, PPM1A is able to counteract this function and dephosphorylate Cdk9 even in the presence of 7SK association. Our data indicate that PPM1A and PPM1B are negative regulators of P-TEFb function. Cells and Reagents—HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Anti-phospho-Cdk9 (Thr-186) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-Cdk9 (C-20), anti-Lamina A/C, and anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PPM1A monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abeam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody from mouse, anti-FLAG antibody from rabbit, anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody from mouse, and protein A-Sepharose® 4B were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Expression Plasmids—To construct the expression plasmids for HA-tagged Cdk9, the open reading frame of Cdk9 42-kDa isoform or its T186A mutant were amplified by PCR from pFLAG-CMV2-Cdk9 or pFLAG-CMV2-Cdk9T186A (29Gold M.O.

Virol. 1998; 72: 4448-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into a pcDNA6/3HA vector that contained 3 copies of hemagglutinin epitope tag at the amino terminus of the expression cassette. Expression plasmids for PPM1A and PPM1B, namely pRK5/FLAG-PPM1A and pRK5/FLAG-PPM1B, and dominant negative PPM1A (pRK5/FLAG-PPM1AD239N) have been described previously (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with EBC buffer (50 mol of Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mol of NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (New England Biolabs). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 500 μg of whole cell lysates were precleared for 30 min with protein A-Sepharose. Cleared lysates were then incubated with 200 ng of appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h before being immunoprecipitated by protein A-Sepharose (for immunoprecipitation of HA) or FLAG M2 affinity gel (for immunoprecipitation of FLAG). Precipitated beads were washed three times with buffer TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and split into different tubes for immunoblots or other analyses. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblots were performed as described previously using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) for detection (30Wang Y. Rice A.P. Virology. 2006; 352: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were quantified with the Personal Densitometer (GE Healthcare) and Image Quant software. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well dishes prior to plasmid transfections. The cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (31Herrmann C.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using phospho-Cdk9 (Thr-186) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Cyclin T1 (T-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich) antisera for primary incubations and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to green, red, and far-red fluorochromes, respectively. Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and deconvolution microscopy was conducted as described previously (31Herrmann C.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Images were deconvolved, and representative single z-sections from each series were prepared for presentation using Adobe Photoshop. In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—HA-tagged Cdk9 and FLAG-tagged phosphatases were purified from cells lysates by immunoprecipitation. FLAG-phosphatases were eluted from FLAG M2 affinity gel by competition with 150 ng/μl3× FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich). In vitro phosphatase assays were carried out as described previously (24Lin X.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli buffer and boiling at 90 °C for 5 min. Phosphorylation of Cdk9 at Thr-186 was then examined in immunoblots using anti-phospho-Cdk9 (Thr-186) antibody. RNA Extraction and Northern Blots—P-TEFb complex was purified from 2 mg of HeLa cell nuclear extracts by the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Cdk9. 7SK small nuclear RNA was stripped from the complex as described above by first washing with TBS containing 0.3 m KCl and then washing with TBS containing 0.8 m KCl. One-tenth of the purified complex was used for immunoblots analysis, whereas RNA in the remaining portion was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and resolved on a 10% urea-polyacrylamide gel. Northern blotting for the detection of 7SK and U1 small nuclear RNA was carried out as described previously (32Haaland R.E. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Specificity of Antiserum against Phosphorylated Cdk9 T-loop—To identify phosphatases that regulate phosphorylation of the Cdk9 T-loop, we first evaluated the specificity of an antiserum raised against a peptide sequence from Cdk9 containing a phosphorylated Thr-186. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids that express either a FLAG-tagged wild type Cdk9 42-kDa protein or a mutant Cdk9 protein containing an alanine substitution for Thr-186 (T186A). Extracts were prepared, and expression of the wild type and mutant tagged Cdk9 proteins was examined in immunoblots (Fig. 1A). The FLAG antiserum demonstrated that both wild type and T186A Cdk9 proteins were expressed at similar levels. The antiserum against the phospho-T-loop recognized the overexpressed wild type FLAG-Cdk9 but not the FLAG-T186A protein. These data and results of in vitro dephosphorylation assays (see Figs. 4 and 5 below) indicate that the phospho-T-loop antiserum specifically recognizes the phosphorylated Cdk9 T-loop. This antiserum will henceforth be referred to as α-p-Cdk9 antiserum; the antiserum directed against a peptide at the carboxyl terminus of Cdk9 and that recognizes total Cdk9 will be referred to as α-Cdk9.FIGURE 4shRNA depletion of PPM1A increases Cdk9 Thr-186 phosphorylation. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses shRNA against human or mouse PPM1A. Cell extracts were prepared at 3 days post-transfection, and levels of PPM1A, phospho-Cdk9, or total Cdk9 were examined in immunoblots. Immunoblots were quantified as described under “Materials and Methods”; protein levels in human PPM1A shRNA transfected cells are shown relative to arbitrary values of 1 in the negative control mouse PPM1A-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5PPM1 co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Cdk9 and in vitro dephosphorylation assays.

We therefore utilized a previously described phosphatase expression library (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) that contains the catalytic subunits of 39 protein-serine/threonine phosphatases, including 14 PPMs, 13 phosphoprotein phosphatases, five transcription factor IIF-associating CTD phosphatase/small CTD phosphatases, one PH domain phosphatase (PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase), four dual specificity protein phosphatases, and two pyrophosphatases. We used the α-p-Cdk9 antiserum to screen for phosphatases that reduce Cdk9 phosphorylation in overexpression experiments. Cultures of 293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Cdk9 and individual phosphatase expression plasmids, extracts were prepared, and the levels of Thr-186 phosphorylation were examined in immunoblots. Two strong candidate phosphatases were identified in this screen: the related PPM1A and PPM1B proteins. PPM1A and PPM1B (also called PP2Cα and PP2Cβ, respectively) are ubiquitously expressed monomeric enzymes and require Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activity (25Lammers T. Lavi S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Of note, both PPM1A and PPM1B have been shown to dephosphorylate the T-loop of Cdk2 and Cdk6 (26Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Cheng A. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34744-34749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To confirm that these phosphatases regulate Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation, His-tagged expression plasmids for the two phosphatases and for a negative control SCP4 were co-transfected with a FLAG-tagged Cdk9 protein into 293T cells. Extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and proteins present in immunoprecipitations were analyzed in immunoblots (Fig. 2). Overexpression of PPM1A, PPM1B, and SCP4 did not alter the overall expression level of the FLAG-Cdk9 protein present in immunoprecipitates as measured with the α-Cdk9 antibody. However, overexpression of either PPM1A or PPM1B, but not SCP4, greatly reduced Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation. Overexpression of PPM1A and PPM1B also greatly reduced the amount of the HEXIM1 protein that co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Cdk9. The reduction in HEXIM1 associated with Cdk9 was expected as the association of HEXIM1 and 7SK RNA with P-TEFb requires phosphorylation of Thr-186 in the Cdk9 T-loop (21Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We also observed in another co-immunoprecipitation experiment that overexpression of PPM1A reduced the association of 7SK RNA and HEXIM1 with a transfected FLAG-Cdk9 protein (data not shown). PPM1A is localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas PPM1B is found predominantly in the cytoplasm (25Lammers T. Lavi S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that PPM1A is able to dephosphorylate Thr-186 throughout the cell, whereas the activity of PPM1B for Cdk9 may be restricted to the cytoplasm. Additionally our results from experiments described below indicated that PPM1A may play a greater role than PPM1B in regulation of Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation (see Figs. 4 and 5 below). We therefore focused on PPM1A and carried out an immunofluorescence analysis as an independent method to assess the consequence of overexpression on Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation. A control experiment demonstrated that preincubation of fixed HeLa cells with a phosphorylated Thr-186 peptide abolished the immunofluorescence signal with the α-p-Cdk9 antiserum, demonstrating the specificity of the antiserum (data not shown). HeLa cells were transfected with a FLAG-PPM1A expression plasmid, and expression of endogenous Cyclin T1, endogenous Cdk9, and FLAG-PPM1A were examined (Fig. 3). Endogenous Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation was high in cells not expressing the FLAG-PPM1A protein. In contrast, endogenous T-loop phosphorylation was significantly reduced in cells expressing the FLAG-tagged phosphatase. The co-localization of Cyclin T1 with T-loop-phosphorylated Cdk9 was also significantly reduced in cells expressing the FLAG-PPM1A protein relative to non-transfected cells as indicated by the yellow signal in the merged images between Cyclin T1 and T-loop-phosphorylated Cdk9. To further investigate the role of PPM1A in Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation, HeLa cell cultures were transfected with a plasmid that expresses shRNA against human PPM1A or a negative control plasmid that expresses shRNA against mouse PPM1A; the human and mouse target sequences in PPM1A mRNAs are divergent, and the mouse shRNA cannot therefore deplete the human PPM1A protein (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). After 3 days of plasmid transfections, cell extracts were prepared, and immunoblots were performed to examine PPM1A, total Cdk9, and T-loop-phosphorylated Cdk9 (Fig. 4). The small interfering RNA against human PPM1A was able to deplete PPM1A levels about 7-fold relative to the negative control mouse PPM1A small interfering RNA. Although the overall level of Cdk9 was unaffected by the PPM1A depletion, T-loop phosphorylation was increased ∼2.5-fold by the depletion, indicating that a reduction in PPM1A protein expression results in an elevated level of Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation. We conclude from the data presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4 that PPM1A is a cellular phosphatase that can negatively regulate the phosphorylation of Thr-186 in the Cdk9 T-loop. Interaction of PPM1A with Cdk9 in Vivo and Dephosphorylation of T-loop in Vitro—We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether PPM1A or PPM1B can associate with Cdk9 in vivo. Cultures of 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged PPM1A, a catalytically inactive PPM1A-D239N protein (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), or FLAG-PPM1B. Extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitations were performed, and free FLAG peptide was used to release the tagged phosphatases from the antibody complexes. The association of the phosphatases with endogenous Cdk9 was then evaluated in immunoblots (Fig. 5). Cdk9 could be clearly detected in immunoprecipitates with both PPM1A and PPM1A-D239N but not PPM1B. Smaller portions of the purified FLAG-PPM1A and FLAG-PPM1B preparations were analyzed in a separate immunoblot, and the data indicate that the amounts of FLAG-PPM1A and FLAG-PPM1B present in immunoprecipitates are equivalent (Fig. 5B, α-FLAG immunoblot). These data indicate that PPM1A and Cdk9 can associate in vivo, providing further support for the proposal that PPM1A is a bona fide phosphatase for Cdk9. The dominant negative PPM1A-D239N retained the ability to bind Cdk9, indicating that phosphatase activity is not required for the interaction. We note that the level of the D239N protein that was associated with Cdk9 was slightly higher than that of the wild type PPM1A protein, suggesting that the dephosphorylation of the Cdk9 T-loop by PPM1A may contribute to the disruption of the association between the phosphatase and Cdk9. To determine whether PPM1A and PPM1B can directly dephosphorylate Thr-186 in the T-loop in Cdk9, we utilized an in vitro phosphatase assay system described previously (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Cdk9 was expressed by plasmid transfection in HeLa cell cultures and purified by immunoprecipitation. The purified FLAG-PPM1A and FLAG-PPM1B from the experiment shown in Fig. 5A were incubated for 30 min under phosphatase reaction conditions with immobilized Cdk9·P-TEFb immunoprecipitation complexes. The products of dephosphorylation reactions were then examined in immunoblots using the α-p-Cdk9 antiserum (Fig. 5B). PPM1A was able to greatly dephosphorylate the Cdk9 T-loop, whereas PPM1B was able to dephosphorylate ∼50% of Cdk9. These data suggest that PPM1A and to some extent PPM1B can directly dephosphorylated the Cdk9 T-loop. Dependence of Mg2+ for T-loop Dephosphorylation and Effects of 7SK RNA—We wished to evaluate the effect of 7SK on Cdk9 T-loop dephosphorylation in vitro. We therefore evaluated the ability of the phosphatases to dephosphorylate Thr-186 with and without the depletion of 7SK RNA from Cdk9 immunoprecipitates. FLAG-tagged phosphatases were purified from transfected HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation and elution with free FLAG peptide. HA-Cdk9·P-TEFb complexes were immunoprecipitated from transfected HeLa cells, and these bead complexes were used for in vitro phosphatase assays. Depletions of 7SK were carried out by high salt washes of immunoprecipitates. The analysis of portions of salt-washed immunoprecipitates indicated that ∼80% of 7SK RNA was depleted (Fig. 6B). PPM1A was able to largely dephosphorylate Cdk9 both in 7SK-containing and 7SK-depleted immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 8). Dephosphorylation of the T-loop was minimal when Cdk9 was incubated with the catalytically inactive PPM1A-D239N (lane 3), indicating that the dephosphorylation of Cdk9 can be attributed to the phosphatase activity of PPM1A. PPM1B was able to largely dephosphorylate Cdk9 in the 7SK-depleted sample but was considerably less active on the 7SK-containing sample (lanes 4 and 7). This result agrees with the experiment shown in Fig. 4B where ∼50% of Thr-186 was resistant to dephosphorylation by PPM1B, presumably the portion associated with 7SK/HEXIM proteins. A characteristic of the PPM family members is the dependence on Mg2+ or Mn2+ for phosphatase activity. As expected, both PPM1A and PPM1B were unable to dephosphorylate Cdk9 when reactions were carried out without the addition of Mg2+ (lanes 7 and 8). In summary, the data in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that PPM1A can directly dephosphorylate Cdk9 at Thr-186 in both 7SK-containing and 7SK-free P-TEFb complexes. In contrast, PPM1B appears to only efficiently dephosphorylate Cdk9 Thr-186 when it is not associated with 7SK RNA. We have shown here that overexpression of PPM1A greatly reduces phosphorylation of Thr-186 in the Cdk9 T-loop. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further demonstrated that PPM1A and Cdk9 associate in vivo. Additionally phosphatase reactions in vitro showed that purified PPM1A can directly dephosphorylate the Cdk9 T-loop both with and without the association of 7SK RNA with the Cdk9·P-TEFb complex. Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that PPM1A dephosphorylates the Cdk9 T-loop and therefore is a negative regulator of P-TEFb function. The identification of PPM1A as a regulator of Cdk9 is not unexpected as PPM1A has been shown previously to dephosphorylate the T-loops of Cdk2 and Cdk6, two Cdk family members involved in cell cycle regulation (26Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Cheng A. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34744-34749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PPM1A is a key regulator of cell growth and signaling, and a number of its substrates have been identified. PPM1A regulates the cell cycle through the dephosphorylation of Cdk2 and Cdk6 (26Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Cheng A. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34744-34749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PPM1A inhibits mitogen signaling through the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways through the dephosphorylation of factors that regulate these pathways (25Lammers T. Lavi S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PPM1A has an important role in development and other processes by terminating transforming growth factor-β signaling through the dephosphorylation of Smad 2/3 (24Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because P-TEFb is required for the expression of many if not most protein-coding genes, the identification of PPM1A as a negative regulator of Cdk9 provides insight into mechanisms that can control global gene expression. For example, in situations where the transcriptional needs of the cell are low, such as in resting lymphocytes or monocytes, dephosphorylation of Cdk9 by PPM1A may be involved in a general repression of transcription. In this study, we also found that overexpression of PPM1B reduced Cdk9 Thr-186 phosphorylation in vivo. However, our data suggest that PPM1B may be a minor regulator of Cdk9 relative to the regulatory role of PPM1A. PPM1B is largely a cytoplasmic protein, indicating that PPM1B may have activity only for cytoplasmic Cdk9, whereas PPM1A is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and may have activity for all Cdk9 in the cell. PPM1B appears to efficiently dephosphorylate Cdk9 in vitro only after the depletion of 7SK RNA, suggesting that the association of Cdk9 with 7SK/HEXIM proteins protects it from the phosphatase activity of PPM1B. The association of Cdk9 with 7SK/HEXIM proteins is dynamic and shuttles between 7SK/HEXIM-free and 7SK/HEXIM-bound states (2Zhou Q. Yik J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 646-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because the association of Cdk9 with 7SK/HEXIM is dependent upon Thr-186 phosphorylation (21Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the action of PPM1B on the 7SK/HEXIM-free Cdk9 may lead to a near complete dephosphorylation of the Thr-186 as no Cdk9 can associate with 7SK/HEXIM after the action of PPM1B. Although we were able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Cdk9 and overexpressed PPM1A in multiple independent experiments such as the one shown in Fig. 5A, our experiments did not address the nature of the association between PPM1A with P-TEFb. It seems unlikely that PPM1A makes a direct protein-protein interaction with Cdk9 as we were unable to specifically co-immunoprecipitate either endogenous or overexpressed PPM1A with overexpressed Cdk9 in plasmid transfection experiments. However, we could detect Cyclin T1 in co-immunoprecipitations with overexpressed PPM1A (data not shown), suggesting that PPM1A associates with Cdk9 that is bound to a Cyclin subunit. In our screen of a phosphatase expression library, we also observed that both PP1A and PP2B reduced Cdk9 T-loop phosphorylation but not to the extent of PPM1A and PPM1B (data not shown). Additionally PP1A and PP2B did not significantly reduce the association of HEXIM1 with Cdk9 unlike PPM1A and PPM1B, which largely abolished this association. A recent study reported that PP2B can act cooperatively with PP1α to release P-TEFb from the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein through dephosphorylation of Cdk Thr-186 when cells are subjected to stress by either UV irradiation or hexamethylene bisacetamide treatment (22Chen R. Liu M. Li H. Xue Y. Ramey W.N. He N. Ai N. Luo H. Zhu Y. Zhou N. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although we did not carry out phosphatase reactions with purified PP1A or PP2B, it is possible that overexpression of these phosphatases under non-stressed conditions may indirectly lead to reduced Cdk9 T-loop dephosphorylation. PP2A has been shown previously to regulate phosphorylation of several serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl terminus of Cdk9 (28Ammosova T. Washington K. Debebe Z. Brady J. Nekhai S. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is possible that overexpression of PP1A or PP2B may result in dephosphorylation in Cdk9 serine/threonine residues outside the T-loop, and this may lead to forms of Cdk9 in which Thr-186 is susceptible to dephosphorylation by PPM1A or PPM1B. PPM1A and PPM1B are monomeric enzymes and do not require a regulatory subunit for either catalytic function or substrate recognition. An important issue concerning PPM1A and PPM1B is whether the activities of the phosphatases for Cdk9 are regulated. It is possible that they are regulated through some post-translational modifications or by unidentified regulatory partners. Alternatively the activities of PPM1A and PPM1B for Cdk9 may be constitutively active. Thr-186 phosphorylation may be regulated by the reversible association of 7SK RNA and HEXIM1/2 and perhaps other proteins with Cdk9. In this scenario, mechanisms and signals that regulate the association of Cdk9 with 7SK/HEXIM may confer to the cell the ability to adjust Thr-186 phosphorylation levels to meet varying transcriptional requirements.

https://openalex.org/W2062867634,"Synaptic transmission onto dopaminergic neurons of the mammalian ventral tegmental area (VTA) can be potentiated by acute or chronic exposure to addictive drugs. Because rewarding behavior, such as social affiliation, can activate the same neural circuitry as addictive drugs, we tested whether the intense social interaction of songbird courtship may also potentiate VTA synaptic function. We recorded glutamatergic synaptic currents from VTA of male zebra finches who had experienced distinct social and behavioral conditions during the previous hour. The level of synaptic transmission to VTA neurons, as assayed by the ratio of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptor mediated synaptic currents, was increased after males sang to females, and also after they saw females without singing, but not after they sang while alone. Potentiation after female exposure alone did not appear to result from stress, as it was not blocked by inhibition of glucocorticoid receptors. This potentiation was restricted to synapses of dopaminergic projection neurons, and appeared to be expressed postsynaptically. This study supports a model in which VTA dopaminergic neurons are more strongly activated during singing used for courtship than during non-courtship singing, and thus can provide social context-dependent modulation to forebrain areas. More generally, these results demonstrate that an intense social encounter can trigger the same pathways of neuronal plasticity as addictive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2071530340,"TAK1 kinase is an indispensable intermediate in several cytokine signaling pathways including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways. TAK1 also participates in stress-activated intracellular signaling pathways such as osmotic stress signaling pathway. TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) is constitutively associated with TAK1 through its C-terminal region. Although TAB1 is known to augment TAK1 catalytic activity when it is overexpressed, the role of TAB1 under physiological conditions has not yet been identified. In this study, we determined the role of TAB1 in TAK1 signaling by analyzing TAB1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1-induced activation of TAK1 was entirely normal in Tab1-deficient MEFs and could activate both mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-κB. In contrast, we found that osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1 was largely impaired in Tab1-deficient MEFs. Furthermore, we showed that the C-terminal 68 amino acids of TAB1 were sufficient to mediate osmotic stress-induced TAK1 activation. Finally, we attempted to determine the mechanism by which TAB1 activates TAK1. We found that TAK1 is spontaneously activated when the concentration is increased and that it is totally dependent on TAB1. Cell shrinkage under the osmotic stress condition increases the concentration of TAB1-TAK1 and may oligomerize and activate TAK1 in a TAB1-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that TAB1 mediates TAK1 activation only in a subset of TAK1 pathways that are mediated through spontaneous oligomerization of TAB1-TAK1.

Cell shrinkage under the osmotic stress condition increases the concentration of TAB1-TAK1 and may oligomerize and activate TAK1 in a TAB1-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that TAB1 mediates TAK1 activation only in a subset of TAK1 pathways that are mediated through spontaneous oligomerization of TAB1-TAK1. TAK1 kinase is an indispensable intermediate of several innate immune signaling pathways including cytokines TNF 2The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; TAB, TAK1-binding protein; IL, interleukin; TGF, transforming growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEKK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. and IL-1 as well as Toll-like receptors and intracellular bacterial sensor NOD-like receptor NOD1/2 pathways (1Hasegawa M.

In those pathways, TAK1 is recruited into the IκB kinase (IKK) complex through a polyubiquitin chain and activates transcription factor NF-κB (6Adhikari A. Xu M. Chen Z.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3214-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The innate stimuli-activated TAK1 also induces activation of transcription factor AP-1 through MAPKs such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. NF-κB and AP-1 cooperatively modulate gene expression to induce inflammation and cell survival (7Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar, 8Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). TAK1 is involved in several other signaling pathways, for example, in TGF-β signaling pathways, TAK1 participates in the non-Smad pathway by activating p38 and SnoN degradation (9Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J.-I. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Among the stress conditions, we found that osmotic stress-induced JNK activation requires TAK1 (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have identified several TAK1-binding proteins including TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) (14Shibuya H.

Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and TAK1-binding protein 2/3 (TAB2/3) (15Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K.

TAB1 and TAB2 are isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screening using TAK1 protein as a bait, and both endogenous TAB1 and TAB2 are coprecipitated with endogenous TAK1 in many types of cells. TAB2 and its homolog TAB3 are found to bind to ubiquitin and function as an adaptor tethering TAK1 to the IKK complex (17Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of TAB1 in TAK1 signaling under the physiological setting has not yet been explored. In culture cells, TAB1 is found to be constitutively associated with TAK1 (19Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of TAB1 together with TAK1 induces TAK1 autophosphorylation and thereby activates TAK1 kinase in vitro (19Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Only 68 amino acid residues of C-terminal TAB1 are essential and sufficient for binding to TAK1 and induction of autophosphorylation/activation of TAK1 (20Ono K. Ohtomo T. Sato S. Sugamata Y.

Disruption of Tab1 causes embryonic lethality with several developmental dysregulations including failure of cardiovascular morphogenesis (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Disruption of Tak1 also causes early embryonic lethality presumably because of its importance for regulating multiple cytokine signaling pathways (4Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 22Jadrich J.L. O'Connor M.B.

Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). These facts raise the possibility that TAB1 may be involved in TAK1-mediated signaling pathways during development. However, Tab1-deficient embryos are largely normal by embryonic day 14.5 (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is different from Tak1-deficient embryos that are lethal by embryonic day 9.5 (4Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 22Jadrich J.L.

Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). This reveals that TAB1 is not essential for all of the TAK1-mediated signaling pathways, or functions of TAB1 can be compensated by other gene products. An earlier study using Tab1-deficient MEFs has reported that TNF-, and IL-1-induced activation of NF-κB, JNK and p38 is not affected by Tab1 deletion (4Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, Mendoza et al. (24Mendoza H. Campbell D.G. Burness K. Hastie J. Ronkina N. Shim J.H. Arthur J.S. Davis R.J. Gaestel M. Johnson G.L. Ghosh S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have recently reported that IL-1-induced TAK1 activation may be reduced in Tab1-deficient MEFs. Our goal is to define the essential roles of TAB1 under physiological conditions. We have recently generated a Tab1-floxed mouse line that allows us to investigate the role of TAB1 in several different tissues (25Inagaki M. Komatsu Y. Scott G. Yamada G. Ray M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Mishina Y. Genesis. 2008; 46: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the current study, we started determining the TAB1-mediated signaling and investigated which types of TAK1 pathways require TAB1 by using TAB1-deficient MEFs prepared from our newly generated Tab1-floxed mice. Cell Culture and Transfection—Heterozygous mice for the Cre-recombined allele of Tab1 were generated by crossing Sox2-Cre mice and Tab1-floxed (Tab1flox/flox) mice (25Inagaki M. Komatsu Y. Scott G. Yamada G. Ray M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Mishina Y. Genesis. 2008; 46: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The heterozygous mice were intercrossed, and Tab1 control and Tab1-deficient MEFs were isolated from wild type and homozygous mutant embryos at embryonic day 14.5 and spontaneously immortalized by the standard method. Preparation of TAK1+/+ and TAK1Δ/Δ MEFs were described previously (23Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). MEFs and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TAK1 (pCMV-HA-TAK1) and TAB1 (pCMV-TAB1) as described previously (26Uemura N. Kajino T. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7863-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reagents—The reagents used were IL-1β (mouse recombinant; Roche Applied Science), TNFα, TGF-β (human recombinant, Roche), calyculin A, and okadaic acid (Calbiochem). The following polyclonal antibodies were used: TAK1 and Tab1 described previously (3Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), Thr(P)187 TAK1 (27Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

Rabbit monoclonal antibody phospho-AMPK (Cell Signaling) and mouse monoclonal antibodies phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (Cell Signaling) and FLAG-M2 (Sigma) were also used. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The binding reactions contained radiolabeled 32P-NF-κB oligonucleotide probe (Promega), cell extracts, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin to a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, separated by 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblotting—The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). The cell extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare). Retroviral Infection—Retroviral vectors for Tab1 (pMXs-neo-Tab1) was generated by inserting human TAB1 cDNAs into the retroviral vector pMXs-neo (28Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate retroviral vectors for FLAG-TAB1N (pMXs-puro-FLAG-TAB1N), the ClaI-HincII fragment of pCMV-FLAG-TAB1 (encodes FLAG-tagged TAB1 N terminus 1–418 amino acids) (29Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was inserted into pMXs-puro. To generate retroviral vectors for FLAG-TAB1C (pMXs-puro-FLAG-TAB1C), the FLAG tag was fused to C terminus of TAB1 (437–504 amino acids) and inserted into pMXs-puro. EcoPack293 cells (BD Biosciences) were transiently transfected with pMX-neo-TAB1, pMX-puro-FLAG-TAB1N or pMX-puro-FLAG-TAB1C. After 48 h of culture, the growth medium containing retrovirus was collected and filtered with a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane to remove packaging cells. MEFs were incubated with the collected virus-containing medium with 8 μg/ml polybrene for 24 h. The uninfected cells were removed by G418 or puromycin selection. Concentration-dependent Activation of TAK1—Cell lysates from Tab1+/+ and –/– MEFs were incubated and immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 at a high protein concentration (10 mg proteins/ml) or at a low protein concentration (2 mg protein/ml) at room temperature for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in a kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm ATP) at 37 °C for 20 min and subjected to an immunoblot analysis and kinase assay described previously (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Loading amounts of immunoprecipitates were adjusted to yield the same loading of TAK1. Conventional Tab1 knock-out mice have demonstrated that TAB1 is essential for proper embryogenesis (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the roles of TAB1 at the molecular level in cell signaling and morphogenesis are still elusive. To define the in vivo role of TAB1 in several different cell types and tissues, we have recently generated the floxed Tab1 mouse (25Inagaki M. Komatsu Y. Scott G. Yamada G. Ray M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Mishina Y. Genesis. 2008; 46: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this mouse with floxed Tab1, Cre-dependent recombination results in deletion of C-terminal amino acid residues 308–504 of TAB1 protein. Because TAB1 C terminus contains the TAK1-binding domain (20Ono K. Ohtomo T. Sato S. Sugamata Y. Suzuki M. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24396-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the C-terminal truncated TAB1, if produced from the Cre recombined allele, should be functionally inactive in TAK1-mediated signaling pathways. To begin characterizing the role of TAB1, Cre-dependent DNA recombination was introduced to generate heterozygous mice for Tab1. Intercross of the resulted heterozygous mice for Tab1 was set up, and subsequently Tab1-deficient MEFs were isolated from the homozygous embryos for Cre-recombined Tab1 allele at embryonic day 14.5. These cells along with MEFs from control littermates were utilized to determine the essential role of TAB1 in TAK1 signaling pathways. TAK1 is activated by IL-1 and TNF and plays a central role in inflammatory responses by activating JNK, p38, and NF-κB (30Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). We first examined whether TAB1 participates in IL-1- and TNF-induced TAK1 signaling pathway. Because it is a formal possibility that immortalization process may genetically and epigenetically alter cells, we generated Tab1 restored Tab1-deficient MEFs (Tab1-restored) to determine whether the alteration found is truly TAB1-dependent. To generate Tab1-restored cells, we infected Tab1-deficient MEFs with retrovirus expressing Tab1, and a pool of Tab1 expressing cells was used for the following experiments. We treated Tab1 control, -deficient, and -restored MEFs with IL-1 or TNF and determined the activation of JNK, p38, and NF-κB (Fig. 1). Inconsistent with the earlier study (4Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), we found that IL-1- and TNF-induced activation of JNK, p38, and NF-κB was not altered by TAB1 deficiency. We asked whether IL-1 and TNF could activate TAK1 in our Tab1-deficient MEFs. We detected an active form of TAK1 by using the Thr(P)187-specific TAK1 antibody (27Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39891-39896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The levels of TAK1 activation in response to IL-1 or TNF were not significantly reduced by TAB1 deficiency (Fig. 2A). IL-1 and TNF activate TAK1 in MEFs not as strongly as in other types of cells such as 293 that we have previously shown (27Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L.

Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further confirm the activation of TAK1, we pretreated MEFs with type 2A protein phosphatases inhibitor calyculin A, which inhibits down-regulation of TAK1 (27Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39891-39896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and examined activation of TAK1 in response to IL-1. The activation of TAK1 in the presence of calyculin A was also not reduced by Tab1 deletion (Fig. 2B). Thus, TAB1 is dispensable for TNF- and IL-1-induced activation of TAK1.FIGURE 2TAB1 is dispensable for TNF- and IL-1-induced activation of TAK1. A, MEFs were stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-1 (left panels) or 20 ng/ml TNF (right panels). Activation of TAK1 was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-TAK1. TAK1 and TAB1 were detected with anti-TAK1 and anti-TAB1. The asterisks indicate nonspecific bands. B, MEFs were pretreated with 10 nm calyculin A for 1 h and stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-1 for 10 min. Activation of TAK1 was analyzed by immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TAK1 is also activated by stress conditions such as osmotic stress (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and arsenic treatment. 3M. Inagaki, E. Omori, J.-Y. Kim, Y. Komatsu, G. Scott, M. K. Ray, G. Yamada, K. Matsumoto, Y. Mishina, and J. Ninomiya-Tsuji, unpublished results. Among the stress conditions, we have previously found that stringent osmotic stress using 0.5–0.7 m NaCl strongly activates TAK1 and that TAK1 is essential for NaCl-induced JNK activation (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We examined whether osmotic stress-induced signaling events are altered by Tab1 deletion, and measured the osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1 (Fig. 3A). TAK1 was activated at 5–15 min following 0.5 m NaCl treatment in Tab1 control MEFs, whereas osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1 was greatly impaired in Tab1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3A). Expression of exogenous TAB1 in the Tab1-deficient MEFs was able to restore the activation of TAK1. These results demonstrate that TAB1 is essential for osmotic stress-induced TAK1 activation. TAB1 consists of 504 amino acid residues in humans. TAB1 binds to TAK1 through its C-terminal amino acid residues 480–495 (20Ono K. Ohtomo T. Sato S. Sugamata Y. Suzuki M. Hisamoto N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24396-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). TAB1 also binds to and activates p38α through the amino acid residues 373–418 (32Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides direct interaction between TAB1 and TAK1, TAB1 might indirectly mediate TAK1 activation through p38α. We next asked which possibility is more likely for activation of TAK1 in osmotic stress signaling. We infected Tab1-deficient MEFs with retrovirus expressing the N-terminal amino acid residues 1–418 of Tab1 (Tab1N), which include p38α but not the TAK1-binding region, or the C-terminal amino acid residues 437–504 of TAB1 (TAB1C), which only binds to TAK1. Subsequently, pools of the MEFs expressing Tab1Nor Tab1C were treated with 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 3C). We found that TAB1C but not TAB1N was able to restore the activation of TAK1 in response to the osmotic stress. TAB1C is only 68 amino acids, and we could not detect the TAB1C protein by immunoblotting. To confirm whether TAB1C mediates TAK1 activation, we utilized other Tab1-deficient MEFs isolated from conventional Tab1 knock-out embryos (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which are completely different source from the MEFs used in this study and generated Tab1C expressing Tab1-deficient. Those Tab1C expressing MEFs but not the Tab1-deficient MEFs activate TAK1 in response to the osmotic stress (data not shown). These results suggest that TAB1 association with TAK1 is important for osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1. Moreover, this demonstrates that the C-terminal 68 amino acid residues of TAB1 are sufficient to mediate osmotic stress-induced TAK1 activation. We next investigated the cellular responses involving osmotic stress induction that are mediated by the TAB1-TAK1 pathway. We examined activation of JNK and p38 in Tab1 control and Tab1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 4A). Activation of JNK but not of p38 was impaired in Tab1-deficient MEFs. We confirmed that TAB1C but not TAB1N was able to restore osmotic stress-induced JNK activation (Fig. 4B). We have previously reported that osmotic stress-induced activation of JNK but not the p38 is impaired in TAK1-deficient cells (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAB1-TAK1 is predominantly function upstream of JNK but not of p38 in osmotic stress signaling pathway. It has been reported that another MAPK kinase, MEKK3, is important for osmotic stress-induced activation of p38 (33Uhlik M.T. Abell A.N. Johnson N.L. Sun W. Cuevas B.D. Lobel-Rice K.E. Horne E.A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Johnson G.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that TAB1-TAK1 is the major mediator of JNK activation, whereas MEKK3 is the major mediator of p38 activation. We also examined activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4C). Although TAK1 is capable of activating NF-κB and is highly activated under osmotic stress conditions, NF-κB pathway was not activated at all even in wild type MEFs, which is consistent with our previous observation (12Huangfu W.-C.

We think that TAK1 is directed to the JNK pathway in response to osmotic stress by binding to TAO2 kinase as described in our previous report (12Huangfu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to JNK and p38, many stress conditions activate the AMPK pathway that regulates energy metabolism (34Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). TAK1 is previously implicated in activation of AMPK (35Xie M. Zhang D. Dyck J.R. Li Y. Zhang H. Morishima M. Mann D.L. Taffet G.E. Baldini A. Khoury D.S. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17378-17383Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We would like to note that AMPK was activated upon 0.5 m NaCl treatment, and the level of activation was not markedly reduced either by Tab1 deletion or by Tak1 deletion (supplemental Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that osmotic stress activates TAK1 in a TAB1-dependent manner, which is essential for activation of JNK but not of p38 or AMPK. Our results demonstrated that among the TAK1 stimuli, only osmotic stress signaling utilizes TAB1 to activate TAK1. We then attempted to determine the mechanism by which TAB1 activates TAK1 in response to osmotic stress. In IL-1 and TNF pathways, it has been demonstrated that TAK1 is associated with a large signaling complex consisting of a number of proteins including TAB2/3 and TNF receptor-associated factors (36Chen Z.J. Bhoj V. Seth R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TAK1 oligomerization in the signaling complexes is essential for activation of TAK1. In contrast to cytokine signaling, formation of such signaling complexes has not been identified in the osmotic stress pathway. Because oligomerization is one of common mechanisms of enzymatic activation of kinases, we speculated that TAK1 might be oligomerized and activated under an osmotic stress condition in a TAB1-dependent manner. How is TAK1 oligomerized by osmotic stress? There is no specific sensor molecule for osmotic stress in mammalian cells. It has been well known that osmotic stress shrinks cells and that the reduced cell volume is the trigger of cell signaling (37Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1441-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 38Roger F. Martin P.-Y. Rousselot M. Favre H. Feraille E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34103-34110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that the TAB1-TAK1 complex might be spontaneously oligomerized and activated when the concentration of TAB1-TAK1 is increased. To test this possibility, we examined whether TAB1-TAK1 can be spontaneously activated when the protein concentration is increased. We incubated cell lysates from Tab1 control or Tab1-deficient MEFs at a high (10 mg protein/ml) or low (2 mg protein/ml) concentration and measured TAK1 activity (Fig. 5, A and B). A slowly migrating TAK1 on SDS-PAGE, which was phosphorylated, was detected when incubated at the high concentration in the presence of TAB1. In contrast, TAK1 was not phosphorylated at any concentrations in the lysate from Tab1-deficient MEFs. We confirmed that catalytic activity of TAK1 was greatly increased after incubation at the high concentration in a TAB1-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), which suggests that when TAB1-TAK1 concentration is increased, TAK1 is oligomerized and thereby activated. further test this idea, we utilized 293 cells to overexpress HA-tagged TAK1 with TAB1 to increase the concentration of TAB1-TAK1. If an increase of TAB1-TAK1 concentration causes oligomerization and activation of TAK1, exogenously overexpressed HA-TAK1-TAB1 could activate not only HA-TAK1 but also endogenous TAK1. Because HA-tagged TAK1 is significantly bigger than endogenous TAK1, we were able to detect a slower migrating HA-TAK1 band on SDS-PAGE when HA-TAK1 alone was overexpressed (Fig. 5C, top panel, lane 1). We found that when cells were transfected with HA-TAK1 and TAB1, both HA-TAK1 and endogenous TAK1 migrated as slower smear bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5C, top panel, lane 2). The slowly migrated HA-TAK1 and endogenous TAK1 were confirmed as phosphorylated forms (Fig. 5C, middle panel). This suggests that exogenously overexpressed TAB1-TAK1 can interact with and induced activation of endogenous TAK1. These results indicate that TAB1 is essential for concentration-dependent spontaneous activation of TAK1, which may be mediated by TAB1-TAK1 oligomerization. We next attempted to determine whether TAB1-TAK1 is oligomerized under osmotic stress conditions. However, the interaction of TAK1 with TAB1 was not altered by osmotic stress (data not shown), and TAB1 was always coprecipitated with TAK1 regardless of treatment of stimuli including osmotic stress and IL-1, which is consistent with our previous observation (19Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We assume that TAB1-TAK1 complexes are preformed and that some of the complexes may be oligomerized upon stimuli challenges. The necessity of overexpression of both TAK1 and TAB1 for activation of TAK1 (Fig. 5C) supports this idea. We speculate that cell shrinkage under osmotic stress conditions increases the TAB1-TAK1 concentration, which may be sufficient to induce oligomerization of some TAB1-TAK1 in the cells. In summary, TAB1 is essential for osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1, which may be mediated by concentration-dependent oligomerization of TAK1. In contrast, TAK1 is activated in a TAB1-independent manner in response to IL-1 and TNF, which is presumably because TAK1 is oligomerized through other adaptor molecules including TAB2. In addition to these pathways, TAB1 is known to be critically involved in TGF-β family signaling pathways. TAB1 is associated with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and thereby recruiting TAK1 to the TGF-β receptor complex (29Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K.

Cell. 2007; 26: 689-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We examined TGF-β-induced activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, which was previously identified as one of the TAK1-dependent events in TGF-β signaling pathways (10Kajino T. Omori E. Ishii S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9475-9481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 mRNA was not impaired in Tab1-deficient MEFs (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests that TAB1 is dispensable at least for TGF-β-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 induction in MEFs. Because TGF-β family ligand-induced cellular responses are not effectively detected in MEFs, we have not yet determined whether other TGF-β signaling pathways are mediated by TAB1. Mendoza et al. (24Mendoza H. Campbell D.G. Burness K. Hastie J. Ronkina N. Shim J.H. Arthur J.S. Davis R.J. Gaestel M. Johnson G.L. Ghosh S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have recently reported that IL-1-induced TAK1 activation is impaired in Tab1-deficient MEFs. In contrast, our results demonstrated that TAB1 is dispensable for IL-1-induced TAK1 activation. Mendoza et al. used MEFs from the conventional Tab1 knock-out embryos (21Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This Tab1 knock-out embryo lacks exons 10 and 11 of Tab1, which presumably express a C-terminal truncated form of TAB1 that is almost identical to the truncated TAB1 generated in our Cre-mediated Tab1 deletion system. We would like to note that we conducted most of the experiments in this study not only using our Tab1-deficient MEFs but also MEFs from the conventional Tab1 knock-out embryos and that all of the results were the same in both Tab1-deficient MEFs. Therefore, we do not know the reason for the discrepancy between their and our results. It might be possible that MEFs respond differently to IL-1 because of genetic or epigenetic alterations generated during immortalization but not because of TAB1 deficiency. In our study, we utilized Tab1-restored MEFs to confirm the TAB1-dependent cellular responses and found that Tab1 deletion does not significantly affect TNF and IL-1 signaling pathways. It has been well documented that TAK1 deletion almost completely abolishes TNF- and IL-1-induced JNK, p38, and NF-κB activation in several types of cells (4Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T.

This suggests that there is no compensatory mechanism that can activate JNK, p38, and NF-κB in the absence of TAK1 in IL-1 and TNF signaling pathways, which is consistent with our results that activation of TAK1, NF-κB, JNK, and p38 was all intact in Tab1-deficient MEFs. Thus, we conclude that TAB1 is dispensable for TAK1 activation, at least in TNF and IL-1 signaling pathways. In this study, we identified that the C-terminal region of TAB1 is essential and sufficient for osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1. The C-terminal region of TAB1 binding to TAK1 may be important for oligomerization of TAK1, which in turn activates TAK1. Further studies to define the molecular mechanism by which such a small region of TAB1 mediates TAK1 activation in response to osmotic stress will be important. We show here that TAB1 is totally dispensable for IL-1 and TNF signaling pathways but essential for osmotic stress-induced JNK activation. Based on these findings, we assume that TAB1-TAK1 signaling is involved in a subset of stress responses but not in IL-1 or TNF signaling in vivo. Utilizing our Tab1-floxed mice, we anticipate that we can explore the role of TAB1-TAK1 signaling in an in vivo setting. We thank S. Akira for materials. Download .pdf (.49 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2154014322,"The relationship between intermembrane spacing, adhesion efficiency, and lateral organization of adhesion receptors has not been established for any adhesion system. We have utilized the CD2 ligand CD48 with two (wild type CD48 (CD48-WT)), four (CD48-CD2), or five (CD48-CD22) Ig-like domains. CD48-WT was 10-fold more efficient in mediating adhesion than CD48-CD2 or CD48-CD22. Electron tomography of contact areas with planar bilayers demonstrated average intermembrane spacing of 12.8 nm with CD48-WT, 14.7 nm with CD48-CD2, and 15.6 nm with CD48-CD22. Both CD48-CD2 and CD48-CD22 chimeras segregated completely from CD48-WT in mixed contact areas. In contrast, CD48-CD2 and CD48-CD22 co-localized when mixed contacts were formed. Confocal imaging of immunological synapses formed between primary T lymphocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells presenting major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes, and different forms of CD48 demonstrated that CD48-CD2 and CD48-CD22 induce an eccentric CD2/T cell antigen receptor cluster. We propose that this reorganization of the immunological synapse sequesters the T cell antigen receptor in a location where it cannot interact with its ligand and dramatically reduces T cell sensitivity."

An ongoing challenge is to decipher how these different methyllysine histone marks can mediate distinct aspects of chromatin function. The fission yeast checkpoint protein Crb2 is rapidly targeted to sites of DNA damage after genomic insult, and this recruitment requires methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20). Here we show that the tandem tudor domains of Crb2 preferentially bind the di-methylated H4K20 residue. Loss of this interaction by disrupting either the tudor-binding motif or the H4K20 methylating enzyme Set9/Kmt5 ablates Crb2 localization to double-strand breaks and impairs checkpoint function. Further we show that dimethylation, but not tri-methylation, of H4K20 is required for Crb2 localization, checkpoint function, and cell survival after DNA damage. These results argue that the di-methyl H4K20 modification serves as a binding target that directs Crb2 to sites of genomic lesions and defines an important genome integrity pathway mediated by a specific methyl-lysine histone mark.

Post-translational modification of histone proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for controlling chromatin structure and function (1Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). These marks can function by either directly altering the structure of chromatin or by serving as a binding scaffold for the recruitment of regulatory factors. Of the possible modifications, methylation of histone lysine residues offers a unique platform for the control of chromatin function (2Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar, 3Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Histone lysine methylation can be catalyzed to a mono-(me1), di-(me2), or tri-methylated (me3) state. The emerging paradigm is that these different methyl-lysine histone marks can direct distinct avenues of chromatin function by serving as binding targets for chromatin effector proteins. Many chromatin-binding proteins contain methyl-lysine-binding motifs, such as chromo and tudor domains, that can discriminate between the mono-, di-, and tri-methylated modifications (4Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The recognition of a specific methyl-lysine target by a binding module is thought to be essential for the proper localization and function of many chromatin regulatory factors. To ensure their survival after genomic insult, cells initiate a number of molecular pathways leading to checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest and the repair of damaged DNA (5Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Essential to these processes is the rapid localization of a variety of factors to genomic lesions. Recently several distinct histone modifications have been shown to be important marks for the recruitment of key damage response proteins (6Downs J.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2007; 447: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, recruitment of the checkpoint protein Crb2 to double-strand breaks (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; IR, ionizing irradiation; CPT, camptothecin; H4K20, histone H4 lysine 20; Gy, gray(s); wt, wild type. requires two independent modifications: methylation of histone H4K20 (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and C-terminal H2A phosphorylation (referred to as H2AX phosphorylation (8Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). Phosphorylated H2AX in yeast or the equivalent modification in mammalian cells, defined as γH2AX, functions as a damage-specific chromatin mark with multiple roles in genome integrity (6Downs J.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2007; 447: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Fernandez-Capetillo O. Lee A. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In fission yeast loss of H2AX phosphorylation abolishes localization of Crb2 to DSBs, impairs the G2 to mitosis (G2/M) DNA damage checkpoint, and induces genome instability (8Nakamura T.M. Du L.L. Redon C. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6215-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Disruption of the H4K20 methylating enzyme Kmt5/Set9 or its catalytic substrate H4K20 impairs Crb2 recruitment, checkpoint function, and genome stability in a manner very similar to phospho-H2AX deficiency (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Note that as outlined by the unified nomenclature for the naming of histone lysine methyl-transferases (11Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. Pillus L. Reinberg D. Shi Y. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. Workman J. Zhang Y.

Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Unlike phosphorylated H2AX, the methyl H4K20 modification itself does not appear to be specifically targeted to genomic lesions but is constitutively present even in the absence of DNA damage (7Sanders S.L.

Crb2 and related proteins are defined by the presence of two distinct motifs with modification binding potential: a pair of tandem tudor domains and C-terminal BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) repeats (see Fig. 1A and Ref. 19Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio R.A.J. Halazonetis T.D. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). BRCT domains are known phospho-binding modules, and this motif in Crb2 can directly recognize phosphorylated H2AX (20Kilkenny M.L. Dore A.S. Roe S.M. Nestoras K. Ho J.C. Watts F.Z. Pearl L.H. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2034-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments argue that the requirement for H4K20 methylation in Crb2 targeting is mediated through its tandem tudor domains (10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that this motif directly binds the methylated H4K20 residue. Strikingly, the tudor domains of the mammalian 53BP1 protein do indeed preferentially bind the di-methyl H4K20 modification (12Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G.

Like Crb2, 53BP1 localization to DSBs requires both H4K20 methylating enzymes and an intact tudor motif (12Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G.

Together these studies suggest a model whereby tudor domain recognition of the di-methylated H4K20 chromatin mark is required to direct Crb2 and 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage.

In fission yeast a complete abolishment of H4K20 methylation induces genome instability, but whether the mono-, di-, or tri-methylated residue is the essential modification is unknown (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The preferential binding of the 53BP1 tudor motif to H4K20me2 argues that di-methylation is the critical modification, but this has not been directly tested. Further, whether di-methyl H4K20 is indeed the essential modification for Crb2 and 53BP1 targeting in cells is still unclear. Here we have sought to investigate the modification state specificity for H4K20 methylation in controlling fission yeast genome stability. We demonstrate that the tudor domains of Crb2 directly and preferentially bind the di-methylated H4K20 modification. Disruption of the tudor-H4K20me2 interaction results in a loss of Crb2 localization to DSBs, impaired checkpoint function, and DNA damage hypersensitivity that is analogous to inactivation of the Kmt5 H4K20 methylase. By generating several Kmt5 methylation state mutants, we further show that di-methylation of H4K20, but not tri-methylation, is required for Crb2 targeting, checkpoint function, and cell survival after genomic insult. These results argue that di-methylation of H4K20 mediates fission yeast genome stability by directing the checkpoint protein Crb2 to sites of genomic lesions.

A cesium-137 γ-irradiation source with a dose rate of ∼3 Gy/min (localization experiments) or ∼10 Gy/min (phenotyping and checkpoint analysis) was utilized for irradiation experiments.TABLE 1Fission yeast strainsStrainGenotypeYSLS611h- ura4D18 crb2Δura4 kmt5Δkan leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+YSLS702h- crb2Δkan leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+YSLS703h- crb2Δkan leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2T215AYSLS704h- crb2Δkan leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2Y378QYNTG67h- crb2Δnat leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+ kmt5F164Y::CYCTermkanYNTG68h- crb2Δnat leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+ kmt5F178Y::CYCTermkanYNTG69h- crb2Δnat leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+ kmt5F195Y::CYCTermkanYNTG73h- crb2Δnat leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+ kmt5::CYCTermkanYNTG74h- crb2Δnat leu1-32::leu1+ pJK148-REP81-GFP-crb2+ kmt5ΔkanYSLS710h-YSLS711h- crb2T215AYSLS712h- crb2Y378QYSLS716h- crb2ΔkanYSLS718h- kmt5ΔkanYSLS719h- kmt5Δkan crb2T215AYSLS720h- kmt5Δkan crb2Y378QYSLS725h- crb2T215A-Y378QYSLS541h- chk1-HA kmt5ΔkanYARA36h- chk1-HAYARA37h- chk1-HA crb2T215AYARA38h- chk1-HA crb2Y378QYARA41h- chk1-HA crb2ΔkanYNTG75h- kmt5::CYCTermkan chk1-HAYNTG76h- kmt5F164Y::CYCTermkan chk1-HAYNTG77h- kmt5F178Y::CYCTermkan chk1-HAYNTG78h- kmt5F195Y::CYCTermkan chk1-HA972h-YSLS252h- kmt5ΔkanYSLS298h- kmt5::CYCTermkanYNTG39h- kmt5F164Y::CYCTermkanYNTG41h- kmt5F178Y::CYCTermkanYNTG43h- kmt5F195Y::CYCTermkan Open table in a new tab Antibodies—Western blotting and antibody characterization were performed as described (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Similar results were routinely achieved utilizing two different antibodies directed against H4K20me1 (LP Bio AR-0134 and Abcam ab9051), H4K20me2 (LP Bio AR-0135 and Abcam ab9052), and H4K20me3 (LP Bio AR-0136 and Abcam ab9053). Polyclonal anti-Kmt5 has been previously described (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Binding Experiments—A N-terminally tagged glutathione S-transferase expression construct for the Crb2 tudor domain amino acids 354–494 was generated by PCR cloning. Purification of glutathione S-transferase-tagged proteins and peptide pulldowns were performed as described (21Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) except that peptides were cross-linked to SulfoLink resin (Pierce). The Crb2 Tudor Domains Preferentially Bind H4K20me2—Localization of the checkpoint protein Crb2 to ionizing irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs requires H4K20 methylation, and genetic experiments argue that this requirement is mediated through the tudor motifs of Crb2 (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that the tudor domains of Crb2 are methyl H4K20 recognition modules, and NMR experiments do argue that the tudor motif of Crb2 can recognize H4 tail peptides di-methylated at Lys20 (12Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). However, neither the specificity of this interaction toward the di-methyl H4K20 modification nor its relevance to Crb2 function was demonstrated. To examine the methyl binding potential of the Crb2 tudor motif, a peptide pulldown assay was employed (Fig. 1). Purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged tudor domain was mixed with immobilized H4 tail peptides with Lys20 either unmodified or mono-, di-, or tri-methylated. After precipitation and washing, Western blotting with anti-glutathione S-transferase antibody was used to detect peptide bound tudor domain protein. Fig. 1B shows that the Crb2 tudor domains preferentially bound the H4K20me2 peptide. Quantitation of the immunoblot image revealed a 4–5-fold enrichment of the tudor domain protein with the di-methyl peptide relative to the unmodified or mono- or tri-methylated peptides (data not shown). To test the specificity of this interaction, the ability of a mutant tudor domain protein, Y378Q, to bind the methylated H4K20 peptides was also analyzed. Tyr378 is one of the critical residues that forms the methyl-lysine-binding cage in Crb2 (Fig. 1A and Ref. 12Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutation in either human 53BP1 (16Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio R.A.J. Gorgoulis V.G.

Fig. 1B shows that binding of the Crb2 tudor domain to H4K20me2 is specific because the interaction is abolished by the Y378Q mutation. We conclude that the tudor domains of Crb2 preferentially bind the H4K20me2 modification similar to that of the 53BP1 tudor motif (12Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 21Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The Tudor Domain-H4K20me2 Interaction Is Required for Crb2 Targeting to DSBs—The tudor domains of Crb2 can directly bind H4K20me2 (Fig. 1), and H4K20 methylation is required for Crb2 targeting to DSBs in fission yeast cells (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This argues that localization of Crb2 to sites of DSBs is mediated by tudor domain recognition of the di-methylated H4K20 residue. If this hypothesis is correct Crb2 localization to DSBs should be compromised by the tudor-Y378Q methyl-lysine binding mutation similar to that of methyl H4K20 deficiency. To directly test this prediction, live cell imaging of green fluorescent protein-tagged Crb2 was used to examine the ability of Crb2Y378Q to localize to IR-induced DSBs (Fig. 2). In this assay the green fluorescent protein-tagged crb2 allele is under the control of the moderately expressed nmt81 promoter and integrated into the fission yeast genome as the sole source of the protein (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). As a control, Crb2T215A was also analyzed. This mutation severely compromises Crb2 phosphorylation after DNA damage but not its ability to localize to IR-induced DSBs (27Nakamura T.M. Moser B.A. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10721-10730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in minimal medium and processed for imaging either immediately before (0 Gy; Fig. 2) or immediately after (40 Gy; Fig. 2) IR exposure. To examine the stability of Crb2 foci a portion of each irradiated sample was allowed to recover for 1 h prior to image analysis (Fig. 2, 1 Hour Post 40 Gy). Fig. 2 shows that as expected both wt Crb2 and Crb2T215A readily localized to DSBs, as represented by sites of focal enrichment after irradiation. In contrast, cells deficient in either the methyl-lysine-binding motif (Crb2Y378Q) or H4K20 methylation (Δkmt5) displayed a very similar ablation of Crb2 DSB targeting both immediately and 1 h after irradiation (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the tudor H4K20me2 binding module of Crb2 is required for Crb2 localization to IR-induced DSBs. The Tudor Domain-H4K20me2 Interaction Is Required for Genome Integrity and Checkpoint Function—The results from Figs. 1 and 2 argue that tudor domain recognition of the dimethyl H4K20 modification mediates targeting of Crb2 to DSBs. We next sought to examine the role of this interaction in controlling fission yeast genome stability and DNA damage checkpoint function. The loss of H4K20 methylation results in hypersensitivity to genotoxic challenge and impairment of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). From this it would be expected that mutation of the tudor methyl-lysine-binding motif (crb2Y378Q) should yield a similar pattern of defects whether introduced alone or in combination with a loss of the H4K20me2-binding target (Δkmt5). The series of experiments presented in Figs. 3 and 4 argue that this prediction is correct and support our model of H4K20me2-dependent Crb2 recruitment.FIGURE 4Loss of the tudor-H4K20me2-binding motif impairs the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. A, the crb2Y378Q mutation impairs checkpoint arrest similar to loss of H4K20 methylation. The indicated strains were grown in rich medium and G2 synchronized by lactose gradient sedimentation. G2 cells were then either untreated (0 Gy) or IR exposed (500 Gy) and allowed to recover at 30 °C in liquid medium. The cell aliquots were methanol fixed every 15 min (time indicated on x axis), and mitotic progression was assessed by 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole staining (y axis). B, Chk1 phosphorylation is impaired in crb2Y378Q cells. Strains (labeled at the top) harboring a Chk1-HA3 allele were treated with the indicated dose of IR (right) and processed for Western blotting with anti-HA. The slower migrating band marked on the left indicates phosphorylated (P) Chk1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the requirement for the Crb2 methyl-lysine-binding motif in genome integrity, the Y378Q mutation was introduced into the endogenous crb2+ allele, and phenotypic analysis was undertaken. Fig. 3 demonstrates that cells harboring the crb2Y378Q or Δkmt5 mutations, either alone or in combination, display an essentially identical pattern of damage sensitivity. These mutants are hypersensitive to IR, UV light, and the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT) but not to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (data not show). The nonadditive relationship between the crb2Y378Q and Δkmt5 mutations argues that the Crb2 tudor domains and the Kmt5 methylase function in the same genetic pathway. Consistent with previous results (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the loss of either H4K20 methylation or Crb2 tudor domain function results in only a partial inactivation of crb2+ (Fig. 3A). Cells harboring a complete disruption of crb2+ (Δcrb2) are markedly more sensitive to DNA damage than either crb2Y378Q or Δkmt5 cells. Previously we demonstrated that the loss of H4K20 methylation (Δkmt5) combined with a Crb2 phosphorylation defect (crb2T215A) yields a nearly complete abolishment of crb2+ function (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Given that the Crb2 tudor domain and Kmt5 function within the same genetic pathway, it would be expected that combining the crb2Y378Q and crb2T215A mutations would result in a similar ablation of crb2+ function. Fig. 3A demonstrates that this prediction is correct because crb2T215A-Y378Q cells display a level of damage sensitivity similar to that of Δcrb2 and crb2T215A-Δkmt5 cells. Note that unlike with IR or UV irradiation, crb2T215A cells are nearly as sensitive to CPT as Δcrb2 cells (Fig. 3A). Because of this the enhancement of the crb2T215A phenotype by the crb2Y378Q or Δkmt5 mutations is much less pronounced with CPT than with IR or UV irradiation. These results argue that the H4K20me2-binding motif of Crb2 is required for genome stability and underscore the genetic similarities between the Crb2 tudor domain and the H4K20 methylase Kmt5. We next examined the role of the Crb2 tudor domain in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (Fig. 4). The cells were synchronized in G2 by size separation, and their rate of mitotic progression was monitored by 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole staining after either no treatment or IR exposure. In the absence of irradiation all cells progressed through mitosis at a similar rate (see 0 Gy; Fig. 4A). As previously demonstrated (7Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) methyl H4K20 deficient Δkmt5 cells arrested after IR but prematurely released into mitosis ∼45 min prior to wt cells (see 500 Gy; Fig. 4A). Critically, cells harboring a disruption of the tudor H4K20me2-binding motif (crb2Y378Q) displayed an identical premature checkpoint release (Fig. 4A). With both Δkmt5 and crb2Y378Q mutations, >90% of those cells that released within the first 2 h after IR exposure underwent a catastrophic mitosis (data not shown). This is indicative of cells re-entering cell cycle progression with damaged DNA (data not shown). To investigate checkpoint function at the molecular level, IR-induced phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1 was examined. Fig. 4B demonstrates that abolishment of either H4K20 methylation in Δkmt5 cells or tudor domain function in crb2Y378Q cells resulted in a similar decrement in Chk1 activation as monitored by loss of the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated band. These results indicate that disruption of either the di-methyl H4K20 recognition module of Crb2 or its binding target yield essentially identical defects in checkpoint function.

https://openalex.org/W1980039529,"Background Arguably the most influential force in human history is the formation of social coalitions and alliances (i.e., long-lasting coalitions) and their impact on individual power. Understanding the dynamics of alliance formation and its consequences for biological, social, and cultural evolution is a formidable theoretical challenge. In most great ape species, coalitions occur at individual and group levels and among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape societies remain essentially hierarchical, and coalitions rarely weaken social inequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to egalitarianism, and human coalitions and alliances occur not only among individuals and groups, but also among groups of groups. These observations suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of human coalitions can only be understood in the context of social networks and cognitive evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we develop a stochastic model describing the emergence of networks of allies resulting from within-group competition for status or mates between individuals utilizing dyadic information. The model shows that alliances often emerge in a phase transition-like fashion if the group size, awareness, aggressiveness, and persuasiveness of individuals are large and the decay rate of individual affinities is small. With cultural inheritance of social networks, a single leveling alliance including all group members can emerge in several generations. Conclusions/Significance We propose a simple and flexible theoretical approach for studying the dynamics of alliance emergence applicable where game-theoretic methods are not practical. Our approach is both scalable and expandable. It is scalable in that it can be generalized to larger groups, or groups of groups. It is expandable in that it allows for inclusion of additional factors such as behavioral, genetic, social, and cultural features. Our results suggest that a rapid transition from a hierarchical society of great apes to an egalitarian society of hunter-gatherers (often referred to as “egalitarian revolution”) could indeed follow an increase in human cognitive abilities. The establishment of stable group-wide egalitarian alliances creates conditions promoting the origin of cultural norms favoring the group interests over those of individuals."

In vitro evidence suggests a stepwise assembly process involving pre-assembled modules. However, whether these modules also exist in vivo is as yet unresolved. To answer this question, we here applied submitochondrial fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to HEK293 cells expressing 6 GFP-tagged subunits selected on the basis of current CI assembly models. We established that each subunit was partially present in a virtually immobile fraction, possibly representing the holo-enzyme. Four subunits (NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFA2, and NDUFA12) were also present as highly mobile matrix-soluble monomers, whereas, in sharp contrast, the other two subunits (NDUFB6 and NDUFS3) were additionally present in a slowly mobile fraction. In the case of the integral membrane protein NDUFB6, this fraction most likely represented one or more membrane-bound subassemblies, whereas biochemical evidence suggested that for the NDUFS3 protein this fraction most probably corresponded to a matrix-soluble subassembly.

Our results provide first time evidence for the existence of CI subassemblies in mitochondria of living cells. The vast majority of cellular ATP is produced by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 2The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; CI, complex I; DDM, dodecyl maltoside; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; MIM, mitochondrial inner membrane; NDUF, NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BN-PAGE, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.2The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; CI, complex I; DDM, dodecyl maltoside; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; MIM, mitochondrial inner membrane; NDUF, NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BN-PAGE, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The OXPHOS system consists of five multisubunit complexes of which NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex I (CI) is the largest (∼1 MDa) and least understood (1.Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CI liberates electrons from NADH, channels them to ubiquinone, and uses part of their energy to expel protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. The complex consists of 45 subunits, seven of which are encoded by the mtDNA and the remainder by the nuclear genome (2.Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Its catalytic core comprises 14 evolutionary conserved subunits (3.Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), which, in humans, are encoded by the nuclear NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, and NDUFS8 genes and the mitochondrial ND1-ND6 and ND4L genes. Once assembled, the complex has an l-shaped structure with one arm protruding into the matrix and the other arm embedded in the inner membrane. The matrix-protruding, or peripheral, arm is involved in electron channeling and contains the flavo-mononucleotide group and eight iron-sulfur clusters. The membrane arm includes all of the mtDNA-encoded subunits and is believed to play a role in proton translocation (3.Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). At present, it is still unclear how the different subunits are exactly pieced together during CI biogenesis. Understanding this process is also clinically relevant because mutations in CI subunits prevent proper CI assembly, causing a variety of mitochondrial disorders (reviewed in Ref. 4.Janssen R.J.

The current hypothesis is that CI assembly occurs by a stepwise mechanism during which prefabricated modules, or assembly intermediates, are combined (5.Antonicka H. Ogilvie I. Taivassalo T.

Biol. 2007; 27: 4228-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, we recently demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial translation caused an accumulation of the NDUFS3 subunit in two distinct subassemblies (7.Vogel R.O. Dieteren C.E. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Koopman W.J. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7582-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Apart from this, recent in vitro import and assembly studies revealed a mechanism involving the replacement of earlier incorporated subunits by newly formed ones (9.Lazarou M. McKenzie M. Ohtake A. Thorburn D.R. Ryan M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4228-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that such a mechanism might serve to maintain the functional integrity of CI. Up to now, most insights into the mechanism of CI assembly were obtained from studies using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of mitochondrial cell fractions. Here, we extended our investigations into the CI assembly process to living cells. To allow doing so, we generated a collection of human cell lines that expressed AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits at a low level. In these cell lines, the mobility of the tagged subunits was investigated using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (10.Gupte S.S. Chazotte B. Leesnitzer M.A. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochim.

By comparison with matrix-soluble and mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM)-bound versions of AcGFP1 of different size, we could establish the presence of these CI subunits in mobile (matrix-soluble) and/or immobile (membrane-bound) subassemblies. Our findings provide the first evidence that CI assembly occurs in a modular manner in vivo. Generation of Inducible Cell Lines—cDNA fragments of the following genes were generated by Gateway-adapted PCR procedures according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen): the cox8 leader sequence (first 210 base-pairs of sequence NM_00004074), NDUFS3 (NM_004551), NDUFV1 (NM_007103), NDUFA2 (NM_002488), NDUFA12 (NM_018838), NDUFB6 (NM_002493; transcript variant 1). Entry clones were generated from the resulting PCR products by recombination with pDONR201 (Invitrogen) using Gateway Clonase II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Entry clones containing NDUFV2 (BC_001632; Clone HsCD00041552) and human ANT1 (BC_008664; Clone HsCD00040509) without stop codons were ordered from The Plasmid Information data base (18.Zuo D. Mohr S.E. Hu Y. Taycher E. Rolfs A. Kramer J. Williamson J. LaBaer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D680-D684Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A destination vector was generated by subcloning the BamHI/NotI restriction fragment of pAcGFP1-N1 (Clontech, Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) in-frame behind Gateway Reading Frame Cassette B (Invitrogen) in pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). To obtain an inducible vector containing mitochondrial-targeted AcGFP1 and C-terminally AcGFP1-tagged proteins, the entry vectors were recombined with the AcGFP1-Destination vector by using Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). In the same manner, a tandem mitochondrial AcGFP1 expression vector was created by first making an entry vector containing the cox8 leader sequence linked to the N terminus of AcGFP1 (without the stop codon) and then recombining this entry clone with the AcGFP1-Destination vector. Flp-In T-Rex293 cells (Invitrogen) were stably transfected using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's procedures and cultured for selection in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem, Brunschwig, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) and 50 μg/ml blasticin (Invitrogen). To induce expression of the fusion proteins, 1 μg/ml of doxycycline (Sigma) was added to the medium, followed by incubation for 24 h. BN-PAGE Analysis—Native mitochondrial proteins were isolated, and BN 5–15% gradient gels were loaded with 40–80 μg of protein as described before (19.Nijtmans L.G. Henderson N.S. Holt I.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, in-gel fluorescence was determined using an imaging analyzer FLA5000 (Fujifilm, Tilburg, The Netherlands) (473-nm excitation laser, FITC filter >510 nm). After scanning, gels were further processed for in-gel activity assays and Western blotting, as described previously (19.Nijtmans L.G. Henderson N.S. Holt I.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE Analysis—Mitochondrial lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel as described previously (7.Vogel R.O. Dieteren C.E. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Koopman W.J. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7582-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and scanned for in-gel fluorescence. Mitochondrial Subfractionation—NDUFS3 cells were resuspended in isotonic buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and mechanically disrupted with a 5-ml glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (clearance 0.025 mm; 8 strokes at 1800 rpm; 0 °C). After adding 1 ml of isotonic buffer the homogenate was centrifuged (10 min; 600 × g; 4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged again (25 min; 10,000 × g; 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in ACBT (1.5 m aminocaproic acid, 75 mm Bis-Tris) and sonicated for 10 s on ice. Unbroken mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min; 10,000 × g; 4 °C). The supernatant was divided over ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged (60 min; 100,000 × g; 4 °C). Each pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ACBT, and dodecyl maltoside (DDM) was added to a final concentration of 0, 0.5, and 2%. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged (60 min; 100,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was used for BN-PAGE analysis. Antibodies and ECL Detection—Immunodetection of OXPHOS proteins was performed using primary antibodies against NDUFA9 (Invitrogen), the CII 70-kDa subunit (SDHA; Invitrogen), and EGFP (a kind gift of Dr. F. J. van Kuppeveld, Dept. of Medical Microbiology, RUNMC, Nijmegen). Secondary detection was performed using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (Invitrogen). The signal was generated using ECL (Pierce). FRAP Analysis—For FRAP analysis, HEK293 cells were seeded on a Wilco dish (Intracel Ltd., Royston, UK) and grown to ∼70% confluence. During FRAP measurements cells were maintained in a colorless HEPES-Tris (HT) solution (132 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). As a reference, a cox8-AcGFP1-expressing cell line was included in the analysis on each day of experiments. FRAP measurements were carried out at 20 °C to minimize mitochondrial movement (20.Koopman W.J. Visch H.J. Smeitink J.A. Willems P.H. Cytometry A. 2006; 69: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using a ZEISS LSM510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss B.V., Sliedrecht, The Netherlands). Images were acquired at a rate of 10 Hz using a ×63 oil immersion objective (N.A. 1.4; Carl Zeiss). Routinely, a zoom factor of 4 was used, and pinhole settings were chosen to achieve an optical section thickness of <2 μm. Only single mitochondria that were fully within the focal plane were used for analysis. This was confirmed by an axial (Z) scan through the filament. A FRAP region of 10 × 10 pixels (1.4 × 1.4 μm) was used. After acquiring the base level of fluorescence, the AcGFP1 in the FRAP region was photobleached during 500 ms using 488-nm light delivered by an argon-ion laser set at 100% transmission. Importantly, intense illumination of AcGFP1 is not phototoxic (21.Bulina M.E. Chudakov D.M. Britanova O.V. Yanushevich Y.G. Staroverov D.B. Chepurnykh T.V. Merzlyak E.M. Shkrob M.A. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). On resuming image acquisition, AcGFP1 fluorescence intensity was reduced by 60–70% (Table 1, F0). Only mitochondria in which FRAP was paralleled by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) in a part distal to the FRAP region were considered to possess a continuous mitochondrial matrix and included in the analysis. Following bleaching, fluorescence recovery in the FRAP region was monitored using normal 488-nm excitation (0.1% transmission). Individual FRAP curves (F(t)) were calculated as described previously (14.Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2005; 37: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using Equation 1. F(t)=100×(F(t)FRAPegion−F(t)backgroud)(F(t)totalmito−F(t)backgroud)×(Fi,totalmito−Fbackgroud)(Fi,FRAPregion−Fbackgroud)(Eq. 1) Here the fluorescence intensity in the bleached mitochondrial region (F(t)FRAPregion) and for the total mitochondrion (F(t)totalmito) is background-corrected (F(t)background) at each time point. Next, the corrected fluorescence signal in the bleached region is divided by the corrected intensity of the total mitochondrion to correct for the loss of fluorescence during the bleach. This is important because in our experiments the bleach area is relatively large compared with the size of the mitochondrion. The data are normalized to the background-corrected pre-bleach intensity (Fi,totalmito and Fi,FRAPregion) and multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage of initial fluorescence. Mean recovery curves were calculated by averaging individual FRAP curves and fitted by a two-component exponential association model (17.Picard D. Suslova E. Briand P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3949-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using Equation 2, F(t)=y0+A1(1-e-t/tfast)+A2(1-e-t/tslow)(Eq. 2) with tfast and tslow being the time constant of the fast and slow recovery phase, respectively and A1 + A2 + y0 being the fluorescence intensity (F∞) at t = t∞. Importantly, for all FRAP experiments the two-component model was more appropriate than a single-component exponential model (i.e. a model without the 3rd term in Equation 2) (22.Koopman W.J.

The mobile fraction (Fm) was calculated from the averaged recovery curves using Equation 3 (14.Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K.

Values from multiple experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. AcGFP1-tagged CI Subunits Are Mitochondrially Localized and Incorporated in CI—For live cell analysis of CI assembly, we used HEK293 cell lines that expressed a monomeric variant of GFP, AcGFP1, fused to the C terminus of a nDNA-encoded CI subunit of interest. Subunits were selected on the basis of current CI assembly models (Fig. 1A and Ref. 8.Vogel R.O. Smeitink J.A. Nijtmans L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A total of six cell lines were generated (schematically depicted in Fig. 1B) for inducible expression of subunits of either the dehydrogenase (green, NDUFV1 and NDUFV2), hydrogenase (purple, NDUFS3), or membrane (yellow, NDUFB6) module or accessory subunits (pink, NDUFA2 and NDUFA12). Confocal microscopy showed that all AcGFP1-tagged subunits were readily expressed and mitochondrially localized (supplemental Fig. S1). Five of the six cell lines (NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS3, NDUFA2, and NDUFA12) expressed the tagged subunit already under non-induced conditions (leakage). This gave us the opportunity to minimize the risk of overexpression artifacts. An additional advantage is that under non-induced conditions incorporation of tagged subunit is at steady state (7.Vogel R.O. Dieteren C.E. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Koopman W.J. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7582-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Fluorescence scanning of native gels of mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 1C, lanes indicated with f) of these five cell lines showed a fluorescent band at the height of holo-CI (closed arrowheads). Their incorporation in CI was confirmed by immunodetection with an anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 1C, lanes indicated with a). Distinct bands of lower MW, previously identified as CI assembly intermediates (7.Vogel R.O. Dieteren C.E. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Koopman W.J. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7582-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were found in NDUFS3 cells (Fig. 1C, open arrowheads 1–6). Other (faint) bands of lower MW, not seen before, were observed in NDUFV1, NDUFV2, and NDUFA2 cells. Both detection methods showed for low-level induced NDUFB6 cells a dim smear at and below the height of the holo-complex, which was in line with the assembly pattern of endogenous NDUFB6 (7.Vogel R.O. Dieteren C.E. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Koopman W.J. Nijtmans L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7582-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Further induction of the tagged subunits increased their incorporation into CI without altering the CI amount and in-gel activity (supplemental Fig. S2). This indicates that the AcGFP1 tag did not interfere with proper assembly and functioning of the holo-complex. Submitochondrial FRAP Discriminates between Matrix-soluble and MIM-associated Proteins—Before FRAP analysis of the AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits was performed, we first established that submitochondrial FRAP analysis was able to distinguish matrix-soluble from MIM-associated proteins. Given the fact that the mobility of matrix-soluble proteins might depend on their size (23.Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), we first assessed the relationship between protein size and mobility in the matrix. To this end, we generated two inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing either an N-terminal fusion from AcGFP1 to the mitochondrial leader sequence of cox8 or a mitochondria-targeted tandem fusion of AcGFP1 (Fig. 2A, cell lines designated GFP and GFP2, respectively). Fluorescence scanning (Fig. 2B, lanes indicated f) and anti-EGFP immunostaining of Western blots (Fig. 2B, lanes indicated a) revealed a specific band of the expected size on SDS-PAGE gels. Fig. 2C depicts a typical FRAP experiment with GFP cells. Following the bleach pulse, the fluorescence signal in the FRAP region (square) rapidly recovered to prebleach values. Recovery kinetics was appropriately fitted by a two-component model. Averaged FRAP curves are shown in Fig. 2D. Calculation of the mobile fraction (Fm) revealed values of 1.01 and 0.99 for GFP and GFP2 cells, respectively (Table 1), demonstrating that both unconjugated matrix proteins were fully mobile. In GFP cells, fluorescence recovered with time constants of 0.216 s (tfast) and 1.12 s (tslow). For GFP2 cells, both time constants (0.442 s and 2.42 s for tfast and tslow, respectively) were 2-fold slower, indicating that the mobility of matrix-soluble GFP decreases with size. Next, we verified whether submitochondrial FRAP could distinguish between GFP, GFP2, and AcGFP1 fused to an integral protein of the MIM. To this end, an inducible HEK293 cell line was generated that expressed an N-terminal fusion from AcGFP1 to mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (Fig. 2A, cell line designated ANT). Fluorescence scanning (Fig. 2B, lanes indicated f) and anti-EGFP immunostaining of Western blots (Fig. 2A, lanes indicated a) confirmed the presence of a specific product of the correct size after SDS-PAGE. The averaged ANT recovery curve is shown in Fig. 2D. Calculation of Fm revealed a value of 0.63 for ANT cells (Table 1). In contrast to GFP and GFP2, which were fully mobile, 37% of AcGFP1-tagged ANT was virtually immobile. The remaining fraction of AcGFP1-tagged ANT displayed a much slower mobility than GFP and GFP2 (Fig. 2D). This is reflected by tslow, which was much larger for ANT cells (8.04 s) than for GFP (1.12 s) and GFP2 (2.42 s) cells. Proper calculation of tfast was not feasible for ANT cells given the limited number of data points constituting the fast phase of the recovery curve (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that matrix-soluble and MIM-associated proteins display different submitochondrial FRAP kinetics. This property can be used to study CI assembly, which is thought to occur in the mitochondrial matrix and MIM (Fig. 1A). Evidence for Coexistence of Mobile and Immobile CI Assemblies within the Mitochondrion—After having established the FRAP characteristics of matrix-soluble and MIM-bound proteins, we next applied this technique to the cell lines expressing the tagged CI subunits (Fig. 3, A–F, red curve). Again, recovery kinetics was adequately described with a two-component model. Calculation of Fm revealed that in all six cell lines significant amounts of the AcGFP1-tagged subunit resided in the immobile fraction (Table 1). Concerning the mobilities of GFP-tagged subunits, the results obtained for GFP and GFP2 cells show that these can only be compared if the size of the subunits is taken into account. Thus, a plot of tfast versus MW shows that the values for fully mobile GFP and GFP2 lie on a line through the origin, whereas those for the AcGFP1-tagged subunits are below this line (Fig. 4A). This suggests that our cell lines contained AcGFP1-tagged product(s) that move faster than predicted on the basis of the MW of the intact fusion protein. NDUFA2 and NDUFA12 cells displayed similar tfast values as observed in GFP cells, demonstrating the presence of fully mobile AcGFP1 in these two cell lines. To enquire the presence of fluorescent breakdown products, we analyzed mitochondrial enriched fractions by SDS-PAGE. The fluorograms (Fig. 4B, lanes indicated f) show that mast cell lines displayed, in addition to a clear band of correct size (closed arrowheads), bands of lower MW. The relative intensity of these latter bands was low in NDUFS3 and NDUFA2 cells, but high in NDUFA12 cells. Because GFP fluorescence is extremely sensitive to truncations (24.Li X. Zhang G. Ngo N. Zhao X. Kain S.R. Huang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28545-28549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the lower MW breakdown products most probably consist of full-length AcGFP1 alone or fused to partially truncated subunit. Together, these results support the conclusion that the fast component of the FRAP signal reflects the movement of lower MW breakdown products demonstrated to be present in these cell lines. This is substantiated by the fact that the fast component of the FRAP signal was virtually absent in ANT and NDUFB6 cells, which do not contain lower MW breakdown products (see Figs. 2B and 4B). Also in a plot of tslow versus MW, the values for GFP and GFP2 lie on a line through the origin (Fig. 4C). In this case, however, the values for the AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits are either on this line (NDUFA2 and NDUFA12 cells), above this line but within the 95% confidence interval (NDUFV2 and NDUFV1 cells) or well above the 95% upper confidence limit (NDUFS3 and NDUFB6 cells), indicating that these subunits moved either as predicted (NDUFA2 and NDUFA12 cells), possibly slower than predicted (NDUFV2 and NDUFV1 cells) or significantly slower than predicted (NDUFS3 and NDUFB6 cells) on the basis of their MW. The tslow value for NDUFS3 cells is clearly above the line through the origin but below the tslow value for ANT cells, suggesting that AcGFP1-tagged NDUFS3 moves faster than expected when bound to the MIM. In contrast, the tslow value for NDUFB6 cells is above the ANT line, suggesting that this AcGFP1-tagged subunit moves considerably slower than expected when bound to the MIM. The most simple explanation for these results is that in NDUFS3 cel"
https://openalex.org/W2036831850,"CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are important mediators of immune tolerance. A subset of Treg can be generated in the periphery by TGF-beta dependent conversion of conventional CD4+CD25− T cells into induced Treg (iTreg). In chronic viral infection or malignancy, such induced iTreg, which limit the depletion of aberrant or infected cells, may be of pathogenic relevance. To identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention, we investigated the TGF-beta signaling in Treg. In contrast to conventional CD4+ T cells, Treg exhibited marked activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity prevented the TGF-beta-dependent conversion of CD4+CD25− T cells into Foxp3+ iTreg in vitro. Of note, the suppressive capacity of nTreg was not affected by inhibiting p38 MAP kinase. Our findings indicate that signaling via p38 MAP kinase seems to be important for the peripheral generation of iTreg; p38 MAP kinase could thus be a therapeutic target to enhance immunity to chronic viral infection or cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2167658131,"Calcium (Ca2+) is a highly versatile second messenger that regulates various cellular processes. Previous studies showed that elevation of intracellular Ca2+ regulates the activity of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3). However, the effect of Ca2+-dependent signaling on NHE3 activity varies depending on cell types. In this study, we report the identification of IP3 receptor-binding protein released with IP3 (IRBIT) as a NHE3 interacting protein and its role in regulation of NHE3 activity. IRBIT bound to the carboxyl-terminal domain of NHE3, which is necessary for acute regulation of NHE3. Ectopic expression of IRBIT resulted in Ca2+-dependent activation of NHE3 activity, whereas silencing of endogenous IRBIT resulted in inhibition of NHE3 activity. Ca2+-dependent stimulation of NHE3 activity was dependent on the binding of IRBIT to NHE3. Previously Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NHE3 was demonstrated in the presence of NHERF2. Co-expression of IRBIT was able to reverse the NHERF2-dependent inhibition of NHE3. We also showed that IRBIT-dependent activation of NHE3 involves exocytic trafficking of NHE3 to the plasma membrane and this activation was blocked by inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) or CaM-dependent kinase II. These results suggest that the overall effect of Ca2+ on NHE3 activity is balanced by IRBIT-dependent activation and NHERF2-dependent inhibition.

However, for Ca2+ to regulate multiple cellular processes in different cells with different outcomes, Ca2+ homeostasis must be tightly regulated temporally and spatially (1Berridge M.J.

Na+/H+ exchange in mammals is mediated by the Na+/H+ exchange gene family (NHE) consisting of 9 members (7Brett C.L. Donowitz M. Rao R. Am. J.

Among diverse stimuli and second messengers that regulate NHE3, Ca2+ remains an enigmatic second messenger because the effect on NHE3 by Ca2+ varies depending on cell types (13Choi J.W. Lee-Kwon W.

NHE3 and other mammalian Na+/H+ exchangers consist of two structurally and functionally distinct domains, the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus (16Levine S.A. Nath S. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Montrose M.H.

We provide evidence that IRBIT activates NHE3 activity in response to Ca2+. Plasmid Constructs—The bait plasmid, pGBKT7-C832, was constructed by cloning the coding region of the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of rabbit NHE3 (aa 475-832) into the yeast DNA-binding vector pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). NHE3 COOH-terminal domains, aa 475-591 and 475-696, were cloned in pGBKT7 to generate pGBKT7-C591 and pGBKT7-C696, respectively. pACT-IRBIT is the GAL4 activation domain plasmid containing the entire coding sequence of IRBIT. The cDNAs corresponding to aa 1-105, 1-224, and 105-530 of IRBIT were cloned into the GAL4-activation domain plasmid, pACT2, to generate pACT-105R, pACT-SB, and pACT-105T, respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid—The bait plasmid, pGBKT7-C832, was transformed into the yeast strain AH109. The resulting AH109 (pGBKT7-C832) yeast strain was mated with >3 × 106 clones of the yeast strain Y187 pretransformed with a human kidney Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech). The resulting yeast strain was plated on synthetic dropout plates lacking adenosine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp). Yeast colonies formed after 5 days were replated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Positive library plasmids were rescued from the yeast colonies and transformed together with pGBKT7-C832 into AH109 and double transformants were selected by growth on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates. Resulting yeast colonies were plated on SD/-Ade/-His/Leu/-Trp plates to reconfirm the interaction. Positive clones were sequenced to identify their cDNA inserts. Cell Cultures—PS120 cells stably expressing rabbit NHE3 fused at the COOH terminus with an antibody epitope derived from vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), PS120/NHE3V, was previously described (18Yun C.C.

PS120/NHE3V truncation mutants with portions of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain deleted, PS120/NHE3V-585 and PS120/NHE3V-689, were previously described and were kindly provided by Dr. Ming Tse, Johns Hopkins University (16Levine S.A.

All PS120 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Caco2BBE cells transfected with NHE3V, Caco2BBE/NHE3V, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm NaHCO3, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Transfection and Gene Silencing—cDNA encoding IRBIT was tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the NH2 terminus by PCR and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Hygro (Invitrogen). PS120 and Caco2BBE cells and their variants were transfected with pcDNA-HA-IRBIT by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation and selected with 600 μg/ml hygromycin. pLKO.1 harboring small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs for IRBIT were obtained from Sigma. PS120/NHE3 cells were transfected with shRNA plasmids and selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoprecipitation—PS120 cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche). The crude lysate was sonicated for 2 × 15 s and spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Lysate (500 μg) was pre-cleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h and the supernatant was then incubated overnight with either monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody or polyclonal anti-IRBIT antibody. Immunocomplex was purified by incubating with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h, followed by 3 washes in lysis buffer and 2 washes in PBS. All the above steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The bound immunocomplex was eluted by incubating the protein A beads in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western immunoblot. Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of NHE3 was performed as previously described (20Wang D. Sun H. Lang F. Yun C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C802-C810Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated with 100 nm thapsigargin, 500 nm ionomycin, or ethanol for 10 min, followed by rinsing twice in PBS and 10 min incubation in borate buffer composed of 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm H3BO3 (pH 9.0). Cells were then incubated for 40 min with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer. Unbound NHS-SS-biotin was quenched with Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells were then rinsed with PBS, scraped, lysed in the lysis buffer described above, and sonicated for 2 × 15 s. The lysate was agitated for 30 min and spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove the insoluble cell debris. An aliquot was retained as the total fraction representing the total cellular NHE3 and IRBIT. Protein concentration was determined and 1 mg of lysate was then incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2 h. The strepavidin-agarose beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and twice in PBS. All the above procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Biotinylated surface proteins were then eluted by boiling the beads at 95 °C for 10 min. Dilutions of the total and surface NHE3 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-VSVG antibody or anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Densitometric analysis was performed using Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health). Na+-dependent Intracellular pH Recovery—The Na+-dependent changes in intracellular pH (pHi) by NHE3 was determined with the use of the ratio fluorometric, pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) as previously described (20Wang D. Sun H. Lang F. Yun C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C802-C810Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on coverslips, grown to 70-80% confluence for PS120 or 5 days post-confluence for Caco2 cells, and then serum starved overnight. Cells were washed in Na+ buffer (30 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm tetramethylammonium-PO4 (TMA-PO4), 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 18 mm glucose) and then were dye-loaded by incubating for 20 min with 6.5 μm BCECF-AM in the same solution. The coverslips were mounted on a perfusion chamber mounted on an inverted microscope, and were superfused with NH4+ buffer (40 mm NH4Cl, 90 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm TMA-PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 18 mm glucose) and subsequently with TMA+ buffer (130 mm TMA-Cl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm TMA-PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 18 mm glucose), with each containing 100 nm thapsigargin, 500 nm ionomycin, or ethanol as a control. Na+ buffer supplemented with (for Caco2BBE) or without (for PS120) 50 μm HOE-694 was then reintroduced to drive Na+-dependent pH recovery. Calibration of the fluorescence signal was performed using the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin as described previously (21Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The microfluorometry was performed on a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope with a Nikon CFI Super Fluor ×40 objective, coupled to a Lambda 10-2 filter wheel controller equipped with a multiwavelength filter set designed for BCECF. Photometric data were acquired using the Metafluor software (Molecular Devices). Na+/H+ exchange rate was described by the rate of pHi recovery, which was calculated by determining slopes along the pHi recovery by linear least-squares analysis over a minimum of 9 s (20Wang D. Sun H. Lang F. Yun C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C802-C810Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Production of Anti-IRBIT Antiserum—The cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal region (aa 1-104) of IRBIT was subcloned into the bacterial hexahistidine (His6) fusion vector pET-16b (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) to generate the IRBIT-(1-104)-His6 recombinant protein. The expressed IRBIT-(1-104)-His6 protein was then purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits by Convance Research Products (Denver, PA) to produce anti-IRBIT serum. Confocal Immunofluorescence—PS120/NHE3V/HA-IRBIT and PS120/NHE3V/pcDNA cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-VSVG antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes, 10 min each, with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG or Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen) and observed under a Zeiss LSM510 laser confocal microscope (Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) coupled to a Zeiss Axioplan2e with ×63 Pan-Apochromat oil lenses. Statistical Analysis—Results were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered significant. IRBIT Interacts with NHE3—To identify proteins interacting with NHE3, we screened a human kidney cDNA library under high stringency with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3 as bait. Screening of >3 × 106 independent clones yielded 4 positive clones containing cDNA encoding calcineurin homologous protein, which was previously shown to interact with NHE3 (22Di Sole F. Cerull R. Babich V. Quinones H. Gisler S.M. Biber J. Murer H. Burckhardt G. Helmle-Kolb C. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2962-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Six other clones contained cDNA inserts encoding S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like 1 (AdoHcyL1). The relative strength of interaction of calcineurin homologous protein and AdoHcyL1 with NHE3 was robust and comparable based on the size of yeast colonies and the β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). AdoHcyL1 was recently shown to interact with IP3R and was termed IRBIT (4Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). AdoHcyL1 will be referred to as IRBIT hereafter. To confirm the interaction between NHE3 and IRBIT in a two-hybrid system, we tested co-immunoprecipitation of NHE3 and IRBIT in PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts transfected with HA-IRBIT. As shown in Fig. 1A, IRBIT co-immunoprecipitated with NHE3V in PS120/NHE3V/HA-IRBIT cells confirming the results from the two-hybrid screen. This interaction was specific as the presence of IRBIT was not detected in the absence of an anti-VSVG antibody or in sham-transfected cells. Fig. 1B shows an opposite experiment where IRBIT was pulled down with an anti-IRBIT antibody and co-immunoprecipitation of NHE3V was detected by Western blot. Having confirmed the interaction between NHE3 and IRBIT, we next determined domains of NHE3 and IRBIT mediating their interaction using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Results shown in Fig. 2A indicate that the truncation of a region distal to aa 696 of NHE3 (C696: aa 475-696) did not affect its interaction with IRBIT as compared with C832 (aa 475-832). A larger deletion of aa 592-832 of NHE3 (C591: aa 475-591) completely abrogated its ability to bind IRBIT, indicating that the region necessary for the interaction with IRBIT lies between aa 591 and 696. Fig. 2B shows that the binding of IRBIT to C832 was significantly attenuated by deletions of parts of IRBIT. The NH2-terminal 105 amino acids of IRBIT (105R) showed no interaction with C832. The 105T construct (aa 105-530) resulted in several isolated yeast colonies, suggesting a marginal capacity, if any, to bind NHE3. The SB construct of IRBIT (aa 1-224) weakly interacted with NHE3 compared with full-length IRBIT based on the number of yeast colonies. These results were reproducible in three independent matings. The domains involved in NHE3-IRBIT association were further explored by co-immunoprecipitation in PS120 cells. HA-IRBIT was expressed in PS120/NHE3V, PS120/NHE3V-689, and PS120/NHEV-585 cells and NHE3 and its variants were immunoprecipitated with anti-VSVG, followed by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody to detect co-immunoprecipitated HA-IRBIT. The upper and middle panels of Fig. 2C show the expression of NHE3 variants and IRBIT, respectively, in each cell line. The bottom panel shows Western blot of the immunocomplex pulled down by an anti-VSVG antibody. The results shown in Fig. 2C confirmed that IRBIT bound to NHE3V-689 as well as full-length NHE3V. Although the expression level of NHE3V-585 was significantly lower, no apparent interaction was observed between IRBIT and NHE3V-585. We confirmed the absence of interaction between NHE3V-585 and IRBIT by using as much as 4 mg of lysate with no sign of co-immunoprecipitated IRBIT (data not shown). Fig. 2D shows co-immunoprecipitation of IRBIT and its variants with NHE3V. The expression level of 105T protein in PS120 cells was extremely low relative to IRBIT and 105R, suggesting that the 105T protein may not be stable in these cells. Neither 105T nor 105R co-immunoprecipitated with NHE3V. On the other hand, a small amount of SB co-immunoprecipitated with NHE3V, but the relative intensity of the SB band compared with IRBIT indicated that its interaction was significantly compromised, which was consistent with the results from two-hybrid analysis. IRBIT-mediated Activation of NHE3 Dependent on Ca2+ Elevation—Recent studies have shown that IRBIT regulates intracellular Ca2+ via its ability to bind IP3R (4Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Ando H. Mizutani A. Kiefer H. Tsuzurugi D. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Mol.

Physiol. 2007; 581: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hence, we explored the possibility that IRBIT may regulate NHE3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner by overexpressing HA-IRBIT in PS120/NHE3V cells (Fig. 3A). Ectopic expression of IRBIT did not affect the basal transport activity of NHE3 of PS120/NHE3V cells (Fig. 3B). We next examined whether the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor thapsigargin (100 nm) regulates NHE3 activity in PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts. Fig. 3, C and D, show that thapsigargin had no effect on NHE3 activity in PS120/NHE3V cells. Similarly, the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (500 nm), did not affect NHE3 activity. On the other hand, both thapsigargin and ionomycin increased NHE3 transporter activity by ∼60% in PS120/NHE3V/IRBIT cells (Fig. 3, E and F). These results show that IRBIT mediates Ca2+-dependent stimulation of NHE3 activity. To affirm the importance of IRBIT in Ca2+-mediated activation of NHE3, we knocked down endogenous expression of IRBIT in PS120/NHE3V cells. Two shRNA constructs, sh-1 and sh-2, were able to knock down IRBIT expression by ∼75% in PS120/NHE3V cells (Fig. 4A). Importantly, in contrast to untransfected or control transfected cells in which thapsigargin exerted no effect on NHE3 activity, thapsigargin inhibited NHE3 activity in sh-1 or sh-2 transfected cells by ∼20% (Fig. 4B), confirming the role of IRBIT in up-regulation of NHE3 activity. Having shown the role of IRBIT in NHE3 regulation, we sought to determine whether binding of IRBIT to the COOH-terminal domain of NHE3 is necessary for the regulation of NHE3 activity. We examined the effect of thapsigargin on Na+/H+ exchange activity in PS120/NHE3V-585/IRBIT and PS120/NHE3V-689/IRBIT cells. Earlier we showed that IRBIT bound to NHE3V-689 but not to NHE3V-585 (Fig. 2). Consistent with the IRBIT binding, thapsigargin stimulated Na+/H+ exchange activity in PS120/NHE3V-689/IRBIT cells (Fig. 5B), but not in PS120/NHE3V-585/IRBIT (Fig. 5A), providing evidence that the interaction of IRBIT and NHE3 is necessary for IRBIT-dependent activation of NHE3 activity. To verify that IRBIT-dependent regulation of NHE3 is dependent on the rise in intracellular Ca2+, we prevented the change in Ca2+ by pretreating cells with the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM (40 μm) for 20 min during dye loading showed no inhibitory effect on basal NHE3 activity, but completely blocked thapsigargin-induced stimulation of NHE3 activity (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that the IRBIT-dependent stimulatory effect on NHE3 activity requires a change in intracellular Ca2+. Expression of IRBIT Reverses NHERF2-dependent Ca2+ Inhibition of NHE3 Activity—Previous reports suggested that NHERF2 is required for Ca2+-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity (15Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W.

https://openalex.org/W2154354257,"Although there has been tremendous progress in understanding the mechanics of the nervous system, there has not been a general theory of its computational function. Here I present a theory that relates the established biophysical properties of single generic neurons to principles of Bayesian probability theory, reinforcement learning and efficient coding. I suggest that this theory addresses the general computational problem facing the nervous system. Each neuron is proposed to mirror the function of the whole system in learning to predict aspects of the world related to future reward. According to the model, a typical neuron receives current information about the state of the world from a subset of its excitatory synaptic inputs, and prior information from its other inputs. Prior information would be contributed by synaptic inputs representing distinct regions of space, and by different types of non-synaptic, voltage-regulated channels representing distinct periods of the past. The neuron's membrane voltage is proposed to signal the difference between current and prior information (“prediction error” or “surprise”). A neuron would apply a Hebbian plasticity rule to select those excitatory inputs that are the most closely correlated with reward but are the least predictable, since unpredictable inputs provide the neuron with the most “new” information about future reward. To minimize the error in its predictions and to respond only when excitation is “new and surprising,” the neuron selects amongst its prior information sources through an anti-Hebbian rule. The unique inputs of a mature neuron would therefore result from learning about spatial and temporal patterns in its local environment, and by extension, the external world. Thus the theory describes how the structure of the mature nervous system could reflect the structure of the external world, and how the complexity and intelligence of the system might develop from a population of undifferentiated neurons, each implementing similar learning algorithms."

In contrast to the advanced understanding of cytoplasmic control of NF-κB activation, its regulation in the nucleus has not been fully understood despite its importance in selective gene expression. We previously identified an inducible nuclear protein, IκB-ζ, and demonstrated that this molecule is indispensable for the expression of a group of NF-κB-regulated genes. In this study, we established a unique gene induction system, in which IκB-ζ is expressed independently of inflammatory stimuli, to specifically investigate the molecular basis underlying IκB-ζ-mediated gene activation. We show that in the presence of IκB-ζ other primary response genes are dispensable for the expression of the target secondary response genes. ChIP analyses revealed that IκB-ζ is required for stimulus-induced recruitment of NF-κB onto the target promoter in a gene-specific manner. Surprisingly, IκB-ζ is also necessary for the gene-selective promoter recruitment of another inflammatory transcription factor, C/EBPβ, and the chromatin remodeling factor Brg1.

We propose a new gene regulatory mechanism underlying the selective expression of inflammatory genes. Many cellular responses are mediated by orchestrated gene expression. When cells are exposed to diverse inflammatory stimuli, such as microbial components, a large number of genes are induced to elicit inflammatory responses. These genes include cytokines/chemokines, anti-microbial peptides, and cell adhesion molecules, and many of them are known to be induced through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF) 2The abbreviations used are: NF, nuclear factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; BMM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; CHX, cycloheximide; RT-qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; sMT, sheep metallothionein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. -κB (1Akira S.

In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitors IκB-α, -β, and -ϵ. Upon receptor stimulation, dozens of receptor-associated molecules induce activation of the IκB kinase, resulting in degradation of the IκBs by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NF-κB liberated from IκBs is translocated into the nucleus, where it participates in the transcriptional activation of target genes. As the cytoplasmic activation of NF-κB does not require new protein synthesis, this transcription factor is capable of inducing target inflammatory genes within a short period. Nonetheless, the induction of NF-κB-regulated genes is not solely defined by the nuclear entry of NF-κB. Growing evidence suggests that each NF-κB-regulated gene has its own expression profile (for example, kinetics, cell type/stimulus-specificity and requirements of regulators), indicating the importance of gene-specific regulation after the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Expression of individual inflammatory genes with their own profiles is considered to be crucial for the integrity of particular inflammatory responses. In contrast to the advanced comprehension of the regulatory machinery of NF-κB in the cytoplasm, the regulation of NF-κB in the nucleus is not fully understood (4Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 5Natoli G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, it was proposed that inflammatory genes could be categorized into two groups based on their requirement of de novo protein synthesis for induction (6Doyle S. Vaidya S. O'Connell R.

While primary response genes are rapidly induced independently of new protein synthesis, induction of secondary response genes takes longer and is impeded in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Thus, the expression of at least one primary response gene is assumed to be necessary for the induction of a set of secondary response genes. We previously cloned an inducible nuclear protein, IκB-ζ, by screening the genes rapidly induced in response to a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in macrophages (8Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Other two groups have reported the identical molecule through similar screening of inducible genes upon inflammatory stimulation (9Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M.

Expression of IκB-ζ is barely detectable in unstimulated cells, but is robustly induced upon inflammatory stimulation. IκB-ζ harbors six ankyrin repeats, which are most similar to those of other nuclear IκB proteins, Bcl-3 and IκBNS. Similar to them (11Franzoso G. Bours V. Azarenko V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M.

Subsequent analyses revealed that IκB-ζ is indispensable for the expression of a group of NF-κB-regulated genes (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). IκB-ζ is encoded by a primary response gene, Nfkbiz, and its induction depends on NF-κB activation (14Eto A. Muta T. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Acta. 2008; 1779: 108-114PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that IκB-ζ-regulated genes are induced via a two-step machinery. In fibroblast cells, IκB-ζ was induced in response to LPS and IL-1β, but not TNF-α (8Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We have shown that TNF-α induced the transcription of the Nfkbiz gene but did not stabilize IκB-ζ mRNA, indicating that the stimulus-specific expression of IκB-ζ is determined post-transcriptionally (15Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1678-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is still unknown how IκB-ζ is involved in the transcriptional activation of its target genes. First, the requirement of NF-κB for the expression of IκB-ζ itself makes it difficult to directly define whether or not NF-κB is indeed involved in IκB-ζ-mediated gene activation. In the present study, we devised a gene expression system in which IκB-ζ is induced independently of NF-κB activation. This system is composed of zinc-induced IκB-ζ expression and cellular activation by TNF-α stimulation, the latter of which activates NF-κB, but does not induce IκB-ζ expression. Using this system, we extended the characterization of IκB-ζ-mediated gene regulation and identified components that are essential for this process. Importantly, our ChIP experiments revealed the gene-specific requirement of IκB-ζ for the promoter recruitment of NF-κB and other transcription regulators involved in inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that IκB-ζ plays a critical role in the selective gene expression by controlling the association of key transcription regulators with target promoters in the nucleus. Cells, Mice, and Antibodies—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. IκB-ζ-deficient mice were previously described (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N.

LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, cycloheximide (CHX), and Helenalin were purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA), Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland), respectively. Mouse recombinant IL-1β and TNF-α proteins were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). All of the antibodies used in this study were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except for the anti-IκB-ζ antibody (15Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Construction of Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—The DNA fragment containing the sheep metallothionein Ia (sMT-Ia) promoter (−600/+72) was obtained by PCR using sheep genomic DNA as template. The CMV promoter region in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was replaced with the sMT-Ia promoter using the restriction sites BglII and HindIII. The IκB-ζ fragment of coding region was inserted into the resultant vector. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science), and cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Nakalai) to obtain stably transfected cells. Quantitation of mRNA Levels by Real Time PCR—Total RNA isolated using TRIsure (BIOLINE, London, UK) was reverse-transcribed by ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The cDNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) on the Roter-Gene 6200 system (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia). The primer sequences used for RT-qPCR analyses are available upon request. Immunoblotting of Nuclear and Total Cellular Proteins—Nuclear protein was extracted as described (6Doyle S. Vaidya S.

Nuclear proteins were extracted with the buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 0.6 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA, on ice for 30 min and separated from debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The immunoblot was performed as described previously (8Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) Assay—ChIP was performed as previously described (16Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 108-114PubMed Google Scholar, 19Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with formaldehyde (1%) at room temperature for 10 min and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, twice. After a sonicated chromatin solution was pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) at 4 °C for 2 h, the antibody of interest (1.5 μg) was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with continuous rotation. Antigen-antibody complexes captured by protein G-Sepharose were extensively washed, and DNA-protein complexes were eluted with elution buffer containing 1% SDS and 100 mm sodium bicarbonate. After cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight, proteins were digested with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) at 45 °C 3 h. 1/25th of the DNA preparation was used for PCR analysis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated, and luciferase activities were determined by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). Retroviral Infection and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—Gene transduction via retroviral infection was carried out as previously described (17He J.Q. Zarnegar B. Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Yamazaki S. Doyle S.E. Dempsey P.W. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Supernatant of 293T cells transfected with Moloney Murine Leukemia virus-ΨA helper plasmid and pBABEpuro construct was used for the infection. Transfection of cells with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine2000 as previously described (18Matsuo S. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Muta T. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Duplexed modified RNA oligonucleotides (Stealth RNAi) were obtained from Invitrogen. The sequences of the sense strands of the siRNAs are as follows: 5′-GAGAAUGGACAGAACAGCAGGAUGU-3′ for the mouse NF-κB p50 subunit 1, 5′-GCAGAUGGCCCAUACCUUCAAAUAU-3′ for the mouse NF-κB p50 subunit 2, 5′-GCAGUAUCCAUAGCUUCCAGAACCU-3′ for the mouse NF-κB p65 subunit 1 and 5′-UCCCAAUGGUCUCUCCGGAGAUGAA-3′ for the mouse NF-κB p65 subunit 2. Stealth RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen) were used as controls. Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated and subjected to RT-qPCR or immunoblotting. A Gene Expression System for IκB-ζ-regulated Genes—We attempted to construct a gene induction system, in which IκB-ζ is expressed independently of NF-κB activation. Because the basal level of IκB-ζ is very low, we chose an inducible expression system to avoid undesirable artificial effects caused by its constitutive overexpression. The sheep metallothionein Ia (sMT-Ia) promoter is reportedly activated in response to zinc treatment exclusively (20Peterson M.G. Mercer J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Shanahan C.M. Rigby N.W. Murray J.D. Marshall J.T. Townrow C.A. Nancarrow C.D. Ward K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5473-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sMT-Ia promoter was activated when NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were treated with zinc, but was unresponsive to LPS stimulation (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the control ELAM1 reporter selectively responded to LPS. We generated a transgene, in which the coding region of IκB-ζ was placed downstream of the sMT-Ia promoter, and stably introduced it into NIH3T3 cells. Treatment of the transfected cells with zinc induced IκB-ζ protein with similar kinetics to the induction of endogenous IκB-ζ protein in response to IL-1β and LPS (Fig. 1, B and C, Ref. 15Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1678-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously, TNF-α stimulation minimally induced IκB-ζ protein (Fig. 1C, Refs. 8Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 15Yamazaki S. Muta T. Matsuo S. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1678-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of Lcn2 (Lipocalin-2, 24p3), Csf3 (G-CSF), and Cebpd (C/EBPδ) is highly dependent on IκB-ζ in MEFs (Fig. 2A). In the cells harboring the sMT-Ia-IκB-ζ transgene, these IκB-ζ-dependent genes were not significantly induced in response to either TNF-α or zinc alone, but co-treatment of the cells with TNF-α plus zinc elicited their robust expression (Fig. 2B, left panels). These genes were not expressed in control cells (Fig. 2B, right panels). By contrast, the primary response genes Tnfaip3 (A20), Cxcl1 (KC) (Fig. 2B), and Cxcl2 (MIP-2) (data not shown) were induced in response to TNF-α alone, and their expression was largely unaffected by the addition of zinc. The zinc-induced expression of IκB-ζ protein and TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of p65 were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). IκB-ζ Is the Only Primary Response Gene Necessary for Its Target Gene Induction—IκB-ζ-regulated genes are secondary response genes, because their expression was impaired in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (Ref. 16Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 108-114PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). We attempted to determine whether new synthesis of any primary response genes other than IκB-ζ is also necessary for the expression of IκB-ζ-regulated genes (Fig. 3B). Induction of Lcn2 and Csf3 in response to TNF-α plus zinc was abrogated in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), while expression of the primary response genes Tnfaip3 and Cxcl1 was strongly augmented by CHX (Fig. 3B, columns 4 and 5) due to an mRNA-stabilizing effect (16Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 108-114PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the results seen after simultaneous treatment of cells with TNF-α plus zinc, Lcn2 and Csf3 were induced when cells were pretreated with zinc and then stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 3B, columns 4 and 6). Importantly, when the cells were pretreated with zinc, inhibition of new protein synthesis by CHX treatment did not affect induction of IκB-ζ-regulated genes by subsequent TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3B, columns 5 and 7). Thus, we conclude that IκB-ζ is the only primary response gene necessary for expression of the target secondary response genes tested. Required Components in IκB-ζ-mediated Gene Induction—Next, we verified the requirement of NF-κB for induction of IκB-ζ-regulated genes. Blockade of NF-κB activation by expression of a super-repressor mutant of IκB-α (IκB-α(SR)) resulted in impaired induction of Lcn2 and Csf3, as well as that of primary response genes, following stimulation of cells with TNF-α plus zinc (Fig. 4A). The expression of IκB-α(SR) did not affect zinc-induced IκB-ζ expression (Fig. 4B). To better understand the molecular machinery involved, we examined the requirement of individual NF-κB subunits using siRNAs (Fig. 5). While both p65 and p50 subunits were necessary for maximal induction of Lcn2, another IκB-ζ-regulated gene, Csf3, required only p50 for its induction when cells were treated with TNF-α plus zinc (Fig. 5, A and C). Induction of Tnfiap3 was impaired by p65 siRNA, but not by p50 siRNA. In contrast to the results of stimulation with TNF-α plus zinc, the induction of Csf3 in response to LPS required the p65 subunit, which could be explained by a requirement of p65 for IκB-ζ induction in response to LPS (Fig. 5E). The efficacy of siRNA-mediated gene knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5, B and D). It has been reported that Helenalin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is an alkylating agent specific for NF-κB p65 subunit while it does not modify the DNA binding of p50 (22Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To validate the gene-specific requirement of p65 subunit, we examined sensitivity of the Lcn2 and Csf3 expression to Helenalin. Induction of Lcn2 in response to TNF-α plus zinc, but not that of Csf3, was specifically suppressed in the presence of Helenalin (Fig. 5F). We have recently shown an involvement of C/EBP family proteins in addition to NF-κB in IκB-ζ-mediated activation of target promoters (18Matsuo S. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Muta T. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To explore the involvement of C/EBP proteins in IκB-ζ-mediated gene induction, we tested the effect of expression of a dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPβ, LIP (Fig. 6A). As LIP was supposed to form non-functional heterodimers with other C/EBP family members (23Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 24Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of LIP seems to be effective for the functional suppression of members of this redundant protein family. The expression of LIP inhibited induction of Lcn2 and Csf3, but did not largely affect that of Tnfaip3 and Cxcl1. The expression of LIP did not affect zinc-inducible expression of IκB-ζ protein (Fig. 6B). IκB-ζ Is Required for Promoter Recruitment of Inflammatory Transcription Regulators in a Gene-specific Manner—To elucidate the role of IκB-ζ in the nucleus, we examined the requirement of IκB-ζ for the recruitment of NF-κB onto target promoters by ChIP experiments (Fig. 7). When the cells harboring the sMT-Ia-IκB-ζ transgene were stimulated with either TNF-α or zinc alone, the NF-κB p65 subunit was not detectable at the Lcn2 promoter. By contrast, p65 was recruited to the Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 promoters upon TNF-α stimulation. Remarkably, co-stimulation of cells with TNF-α plus zinc induced p65 recruitment to the Lcn2 promoter with slow kinetics, suggesting a requirement of IκB-ζ expression for this recruitment process. We also examined the promoter recruitment of C/EBPβ (Fig. 7). Unlike p65, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 promoters were not enriched with C/EBPβ in a stimulus-dependent manner. Surprisingly, C/EBPβ was recruited onto the Lcn2 promoter only when cells were stimulated with TNF-α plus zinc, indicating that the promoter recruitment of C/EBPβ is also dependent on IκB-ζ. It was recently reported that induction of secondary response genes is accompanied by remodeling of nucleosomes, and that this process is mediated by the two ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm1 (7Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, as with p65 and C/EBPβ, stimulus-dependent Brg1 recruitment to Lcn2 promoter also requires IκB-ζ (Fig. 7). The requirement of IκB-ζ for the association of these transcription regulators with specific target promoters was also investigated in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The expression of Lcn2 gene was highly dependent on the presence of IκB-ζ in BMMs, and we observed a gene dose dependence (Fig. 8A). Consistent with the ChIP results obtained from the fibroblasts harboring the sMT-Ia-IκB-ζ transgene, p65, c-Rel, C/EBPβ, and Brg1 were all localized to the Lcn2 promoter only when IκB-ζ is present (Fig. 8B). The recruitment of these transcription regulators to the control promoters (Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) was not dependent on IκB-ζ. Taken together, these findings suggest that IκB-ζ determines the accessibility of target promoters to these transcription regulators in the nucleus. In the present study, we established a unique expression system to specifically analyze the IκB-ζ-mediated gene regulation. This system allowed us to directly define essential components involved in the process. Overexpression of IκB-α(SR) in our system revealed that the activation of NF-κB is not only required for IκB-ζ induction but also is substantially involved in the transcriptional up-regulation of the IκB-ζ-regulated secondary response genes. As the NF-κB p65 subunit is necessary for induction of IκB-ζ expression and IκB-ζ controls the participation of p65 in the transcriptional up-regulation of selective target genes, these secondary response genes are not regulated by a simple two-step machinery in which distinct molecules are sequentially activated. Rather, it is likely that NF-κB and IκB-ζ comprise a reciprocally limiting loop to activate the selective genes. The physiological significance of this feed-forward mechanism will be discussed below. It has been reported that the stimulus-induced recruitment of p65 to the secondary response promoters is slower than that to the primary response promoters (19Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This delay could be accounted for by the time necessary for IκB-ζ induction. Using our gene expression system, we also demonstrated the direct involvement of the C/EBP protein in activation of IκB-ζ-regulated genes (Fig. 6). The ChIP experiments suggested that IκB-ζ regulates accessibility of the selective promoters to C/EBP proteins as well as NF-κB p65 (Figs. 7 and 8). It is noteworthy that comprehensive cDNA microarray analyses have identified common target genes between IκB-ζ and C/EBPβ in LPS-stimulated macrophages (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 5378-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding sites for C/EBP proteins have been identified in the promoter regions of many IκB-ζ-regulated genes, and we have previously shown the importance of these sequences in the promoter activation (18Matsuo S. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Muta T. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As expression of IκB-α(SR) suppressed the association of C/EBβ with the Lcn2 promoter, but LIP expression did not perturb p65 recruitment, 3S. Yamazaki, unpublished observation. promoter recruitment of NF-κB seems to be a prerequisite for C/EBPβ recruitment. Our ChIP analyses using two types of cells revealed that IκB-ζ is required for recruitment of the chromatin-remodeling factor Brg1 to the selective promoter (Figs. 7 and 8). As the experiment using CHX indicated that IκB-ζ is the only primary response gene necessary for the expression of its target secondary response genes (Fig. 3), the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for the Brg1-mediated nucleosome remodeling (7Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) could be explained by expression of IκB-ζ protein. During the preparation of this report, Kayama et al. (26Kayama H. Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Yamamoto M. Mizutani T. Kuwata H. Iba H. Matsumoto M. Honda K. Smale S.T. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12468-12477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported the involvement of MyD88-dependent signaling and IκB-ζ in selective expression of pro-inflammatory genes. As they showed that the promoter association of Brg1 and nucleosome remodeling at the target promoters are defective in MyD88-deficient cells but are normal in IκB-ζ-deficient cells, they hypothesized at least one other MyD88-dependent molecule that is required for Brg1-mediated nucleosome remodeling. Although the exact reason for the differences between this study and the published report regarding the role of IκB-ζ is unknown, there could be differences in regulation among IκB-ζ-dependent genes. Furthermore, we observed a cell type-specific requirement of IκB-ζ for induction of some genes.3 In this study, we focused on the target genes whose expression is highly dependent on IκB-ζ both in fibroblasts and macrophages. Although IL-6 production was severely impaired in IκB-ζ-deficient macrophages (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), the expression of IL-6 in response to TNF-α was not significantly augmented by zinc-induced IκB-ζ as that of Lcn2 and Csf3 (data not shown). As the TNF-α-induced IL-6 production in MEFs was shown to be unaffected by IκB-ζ deficiency (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), it is likely that IκB-ζ is not a limiting factor in this response. Gene knockdown experiment using specific siRNAs indicated the close functional relationship between IκB-ζ and the NF-κB p50 subunit. We have previously shown a preferential physical interaction of IκB-ζ with p50 rather than other NF-κB subunits, and an overlap in the target genes of IκB-ζ and p50 (8Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The experiments using siRNA and Helenalin revealed that while p65 was necessary for induction of Lcn2, it was dispensable for Csf3 expression (Fig. 5). It is likely that p50 and IκB-ζ could form a core element for transcriptional activation of target genes (see below), and transcriptional activity of p65 might be required for full activation of some target genes. Because p50 does not contain a transactivation domain, transcriptional activity derived from other sources should be involved in the induction of Csf3, which is possibly mediated by IκB-ζ itself and C/EBP proteins (18Matsuo S. Yamazaki S. Takeshige K. Muta T. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Motoyama M. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7444-7451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Requirement of C/EBPβ for expression of Csf3 has been reported thus far (28Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It is still an enigma how IκB-ζ regulates the promoter accessibility of the key transcription regulators in a gene-selective manner. Because IκB-ζ has no obvious DNA binding motif, it is unlikely that IκB-ζ associates with the target promoter prior to the DNA-binding proteins. It is conceivable that IκB-ζ induced upon stimulation could form a complex with the p50 homodimer, which is known to be constitutively present in the specific promoters (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 29Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Then, this complex might act as a landmark for recruitment of Brg1, p65, and C/EBP. IκB-ζ could stabilize or assist the promoter binding of these transcription regulators by an unknown mechanism. Despite a careful comparison among the promoter sequences of IκB-ζ-regulated genes, no consensus structural features have been deduced thus far. Epigenetic factors, including covalent modifications of promoters and histones, could be a determinant of IκB-ζ dependence. Intriguingly, Kayama et al. (26Kayama H. Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Yamamoto M. Mizutani T. Kuwata H. Iba H. Matsumoto M. Honda K. Smale S.T. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12468-12477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated the involvement of IκB-ζ in stimulus-dependent histone H3K4 trimethylation of the secondary response promoters. Along with the constitutively associated p50 subunit, low level of this modification at the specific target promoters could be directly or indirectly recognized by IκB-ζ. The biological importance of the IκB-ζ-mediated regulation of its target secondary response genes seems to be different from that of the interferon-β-mediated induction of secondary response genes, which potentially amplifies antiviral gene programs in an autocrine/paracrine fashion (6Doyle S. Vaidya S. O'Connell R. Dadgostar H. Dempsey P. Wu T. Rao G. Sun R. Haberland M. Modlin R. Cheng G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). IκB-ζ could play a key role in forming a stimulus-specific gene expression pattern. In fact, it has been reported that IκB-ζ-regulated genes are preferentially induced in response to IL-1β rather than TNF-α (30Cowland J.B. Sorensen O.E. Sehested M. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Tsutsumi-Ishii Y. Nagaoka I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4226-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, given that expression of IκB-ζ-regulated genes is inevitably delayed, IκB-ζ might act as a timing device to determine the durations of gene expression. IκB-ζ-mediated gene regulation appears to be crucial for the accomplishment of a specific inflammatory response (32Foster S.L. Hargreaves D.C. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2007; 447: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar).

The paradigm of eukaryotic gene activation centers on activators recognizing and binding to unique sequences of DNA and then recruiting coactivators and the transcription machinery (1Ptashne M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 275-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The order of recruitment events has been determined for several yeast genes, including HO (2Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L.

Based on these and other studies, the idea of activation has evolved beyond simple ordered recruitment.One of the reasons for this evolving picture of activation is the finding that many coactivator complexes can play multiple roles. For example SAGA 4The abbreviations used are: SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase complex; SWI/SNF, SWI/SNF complex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; QPCR, real-time quantitative PCR; FMA, formaldehyde; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate); pol II, RNA polymerase II; NuSA, nucleosome scanning assay; HA, hemagglutinin, HAT, histone acetyltransferase; PIC, pre-initiation complex; TFIIB, general transcription factor IIB; NuA4, nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 complex. 4The abbreviations used are: SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase complex; SWI/SNF, SWI/SNF complex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; QPCR, real-time quantitative PCR; FMA, formaldehyde; EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate); pol II, RNA polymerase II; NuSA, nucleosome scanning assay; HA, hemagglutinin, HAT, histone acetyltransferase; PIC, pre-initiation complex; TFIIB, general transcription factor IIB; NuA4, nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 complex. functions as a histone-acetyltransferase (HAT) at the HO promoter (10Mitra D. Parnell E.J. Landon J.W. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4095-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but it is required for a non-HAT function at the GAL1 promoter (7Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In cases such as these, knowing the order in which SAGA arrives at a promoter is insufficient for understanding its role in activation. The dual nature of coactivators emphasizes the need to look not only at their recruitment to the promoter, but also at the functional consequences of this recruitment. Glucose-regulated genes, under the control of Snf1, the homolog of the mammalian AMP-activated kinase, provide a model for such comprehensive studies. In response to glucose starvation, ∼200 genes are activated by Snf1, many of which depend on the transcription factors Adr1 and Cat8 (11Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has established that SAGA, SWI/SNF, and Mediator are recruited by these two activators upon derepression (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the specific roles of these coactivators and their interactions at these genes remain undetermined.This subset of genes allowed us to address several factors that may influence the mechanisms of activation. First, we focused on two genes, ADH2 and FBP1, which have differential dependences on both the activators Adr1 and Cat8 (13Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and on the repressor Mig1 (14Zaragoza O. Vincent O. Gancedo J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), allowing us to determine if trends were regulator-specific. Second, these promoters have established chromatin structures providing a basis for examining the impact of promoter architecture on the events leading up to activation (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Agricola E. Verdone L. Xella B. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8878-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Tachibana C. Biddick R. Law G.L. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37308-37315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, because these genes are both regulated by Snf1, we could ask whether or not genes that share a common upstream regulator also share a common mechanism of activation.We sought to delineate the steps leading up to activation, including the roles of the coactivators and the order in which they appear at the promoter, using a combination of expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and chromatin-remodeling assays. The results from these combined studies did not always support the paradigm of activated transcription; they suggest that coactivator recruitment is possible without associated changes in chromatin remodeling or gene expression, and furthermore that chromatin remodeling does not necessarily lead to gene activation. In addition we clearly demonstrate that one role for coactivators is to stabilize Cat8 binding. We provide evidence that SAGA is required for forming a scaffold at the promoter that is important for downstream recruitment events, and that SWI/SNF is required for chromatin remodeling. Our results suggest that there are both shared and unique aspects in the mechanism of activation for co-regulated genes and that there are also redundancies in this mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth of Cultures—All strains used in this study were derived from W303 and are described in supplemental Table S1. Deletions of activators and epitope tagging of all protein components were introduced according to previously published work (17Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 18Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The med17ts strain was constructed by first transforming with YCpsrb4–138(leu2::URA3), which was created from RY2882 (srb4–138 LEU2 ars cen), a gift from S. Hahn, followed by deletion of chromosomal MED17 according to a previous study (17Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). For the med17 ts experiments, cultures were grown overnight at room temperature and then shifted to 37 °C for 30 min before taking the repressed sample; cultures were then spun down in a pre-warmed centrifuge and resuspended in 37 °C low glucose media and grown at 37 °C. Wild-type strains were grown in the same manner for comparison to eliminate indirect effects of the high temperature. Strains overexpressing Adr1 were created by introducing a plasmid (pNKA1-U) based on pKD17, which expresses Adr1 from the ADH1 promoter, with only a minor modification from its original form (19Dombek K.M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in the various coactivator mutant backgrounds. These strains were grown in synthetic media lacking the appropriate amino acid for plasmid selection with either 5% glucose (repressed) or 0.05% glucose (derepressed). In all experiments, repressed samples (R) were isolated just before cells were switched to low glucose media.ChIP and Real-time PCR (QPCR)—ChIP was performed as previously described, using both dimethyl adipimate (Pierce Chemicals) and formaldehyde (FMA) as cross-linking agents (except where noted) and using QPCR instead of standard PCR (13Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additional ChIP for Cat8 was performed with two variations: 1) FMA was added directly to the culture at a final concentration of 1% for 15 min and then treated as above and 2) EGS (Pierce Chemicals) was used in place of dimethyl adipimate at a final concentration of 1.5 mm, with all other steps the same as above. Monoclonal antibodies against c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-40), HA (F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7293), and FLAG (Sigma F3165) epitopes were used for most immunoprecipitations except for pol II, which was immunoprecipitated using the 8WG16 antibody (Abcam ab817). To carry out ChIP for five proteins in the same cell lysates for the time-course experiment (Fig. 6), an antibody against Snf2 (gift from J. Reese) was used, as well as IgG-Sepharose to bind tandem affinity purification epitopes. Sequences of primers used for QPCR are available upon request. QPCR was performed on an MJ Research DNA Engine using SYBR Green SensiMix (Quantance Ltd., London, UK). Experiments were performed in biological duplicate or triplicate at two time points of derepression, and all results were averaged together. Values were calculated as the ratio of ChIP to input at the specific locus divided by the ratio at the telomere region. The associated error results from the standard deviation of the biological replicates.mRNA Isolation and QPCR—mRNA was isolated from strains grown in either repressing (YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) with 5% glucose) or derepressing (YPD with 0.05% glucose) media for the time indicated and processed as detailed in a previous study (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared from biological triplicates and quantitated in duplicate.Chromatin Remodeling Assays—NuSA was performed as in Ref. 12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar using samples from cells grown in either repressing medium or derepression medium for 4 h (see above). Supercoiling assays were performed as in a previous study (16Tachibana C. Biddick R. Law G.L. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37308-37315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using the pLLTY1 plasmid, carrying the –640 to +135 region of the ADH2 gene and the pLLTY3 plasmid in which the ADH2 TATAA box was changed to GAGAA. The Southern blots were probed using either a 32P-labeled probe as in Tachibana (16Tachibana C. Biddick R. Law G.L. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37308-37315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or using the AP direct labeling and detection system from GE, following the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSCoactivators Are Required for Stable Cat8 Binding—We previously established that SAGA, SWI/SNF, and Mediator occupy the promoters of ADH2 and FBP1 and contribute to their activation (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of these coactivators, we first asked whether these complexes are required for the transcription factors Adr1 and Cat8 to bind to the promoters. ChIP assays for Adr1 and Cat8 in coactivator deletion strains showed that Adr1 binding at ADH2 was unaffected by these mutations, but Cat8 binding at FBP1 was reduced (Fig. 1, A and B). This result was surprising in light of the fact that the Cat8 binding site is in a nucleosome-free region at FBP1 (20del Olmo M.L. Sogo J.M. Franco L. Perez-Ortin J.E.

It was moderately reduced compared with wild type (Fig. 1C), but ADR1 expression was similarly reduced (supplemental Table S2) with no observable defect in Adr1 binding. Thus it does not seem likely that the lack of binding was due to compromised CAT8 transcription. We also measured Cat8 protein levels by immunoprecipitating tagged Cat8 from equal amounts of cell extract isolated from either wild type or SAGA, SWI/SNF, and Mediator mutant strains and found comparable levels after 4 h of derepression (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, this demonstrates that the ChIP results were not due simply to reduced levels of Cat8.We next asked if Cat8 was still at the promoter but unable to be detected by ChIP due to transient or unstable Cat8 binding in the coactivator mutants. To test this, we repeated the ChIP with two variations: adding formaldehyde directly to the cultures in an attempt to rapidly “trap” any transient binding events, or using EGS, a 16.1-Å-long cross-linker that uses N-hydroxysuccinimide ester chemistry, which has been used to improve weak ChIP signals (24Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both of these methods gave marginally improved results; occupancy of Cat8 in snf5Δ increased from roughly 5% of the wild-type level with the standard assay to ∼10% when EGS was used, and in med17 ts, occupancy increased modestly when EGS was used and nearly doubled when FMA was used (Fig. 1D). This increase suggested that some Cat8 was at the promoter in these mutants, but probably less stably bound than in wild type.To further confirm our hypothesis that Cat8 was still at the promoter in these mutants despite the low ChIP signal, we asked whether the FBP1 expression in the coactivator mutant strains was Cat8-dependent. When we combined either GCN5 or SNF2 and CAT8 deletions, expression of FBP1 decreased to background (Fig. 1E). The fact that FBP1 expression was still strongly Cat8-dependent in the coactivator mutant backgrounds proves that Cat8 was at the promoters, but with less frequency or stability than in a wild-type strain.The Role of SAGA—To extend our analysis of the functions of coactivators at glucose-repressed genes we looked in depth at each complex using a three-pronged approach: gene expression, ChIP, and chromatin remodeling assays. We began with the deletion of the HAT component of SAGA, Gcn5. Gcn5 is required for changes in nucleosome position that accompany derepression and full activation of ADH2 (25Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We confirmed a role for Gcn5 in activation by measuring gene expression over 6 h of derepression (Fig. 2). Loss of Gcn5 resulted in >65% reduction in mRNA levels of both ADH2 and FBP1.FIGURE 2SAGA, SWI/SNF, and Mediator are required for full expression of ADH2 and FBP1. mRNA analysis throughout 6 h of derepression of (A) ADH2 and (B) FBP1 from gcn5Δ (LLTY72), ada1Δ (LLTY73), snf2Δ (KKTY3), and med17 ts (RBY93).

Error bars represent the standard deviation of two biological replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There is precedent that the HAT activity of SAGA is required at promoters to loosen chromatin and allow successive recruitment events, notably at HO and PHO8 (10Mitra D. Parnell E.J. Landon J.W. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4095-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Reinke H. Gregory P.D. Horz W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To see if Gcn5 was similarly required at ADH2 and FBP1 we assayed occupancy of other coactivators in a gcn5Δ strain after 4 and 6 h of derepression. Because expression in the coactivator mutants was very low at early points in derepression, we chose to look at recruitment of other coactivators at later times to ensure that if we observed little or no recruitment, it was due to loss of the coactivator rather than simply due to low levels of transcription. We did look at one earlier time in the gcn5Δ strain, however, but no significant recruitment was observed at this point (supplemental Fig. S5). Occupancy of Snf2, Med15, and Med17 was less than half the wild-type levels at both promoters (Fig. 3A). In contrast, binding of Sua7, a component of TFIIB, and pol II persisted in this mutant, indicating that HAT activity was not required for stable recruitment of the transcription machinery. We did not observe an increase in recruitment between 4 and 6 h of derepression, and so, for simplicity sake, these values have been averaged together (as was done for all other ChIP experiments). Additionally, we assayed for two other SAGA components, Ada1 and Spt8, both of which occupied the promoters under derepressed conditions in a gcn5Δ strain, verifying that loss of Gcn5 resulted only in loss of HAT activity, and not total loss of the complex (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B).FIGURE 3Coactivators binding is interdependent at ADH2 and FBP1. ChIP for coactivators in gcn5Δ (RBY110, RBY115, RBY116, and RBY155) (A); ada1Δ (RBY106, RBY108, RBY111, RBY113, and RBY154) (B); snf2Δ (RBY109, RBY112, RBY117) (C); and med17 ts (RBY119, RBY120, RBY121) at ADH2 (light bars) and FBP1 (black bars) (D). Data for coactivator occupancy in a WT strain was obtained using RBY3, RBY5, RBY8, RBY9, and RBY11. Values are expressed as the -fold over the WT repressed (R) value, as in Fig. 1A (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). WT data is shown for 4-h derepression (no error bar) or an average of 4- and 6-h derepression (with error bars representing the standard deviation) and data for all mutant strains is based on the average for 4- and 6-h derepression. Error bars of the mutant values indicate the standard deviation of at least three independent biological replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that activation of ADH2 is associated largely with changes in nucleosome density and not nucleosome position (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the role of Gcn5 in chromatin remodeling, we employed a plasmid-based supercoiling assay that allows us to monitor the nucleosome density at the ADH2 promoter (16Tachibana C. Biddick R. Law G.L. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37308-37315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, a downward shift in the topoisomer distribution represents a decrease in nucleosome density on the plasmid. In a wild-type strain, there was a clear shift in the density of topoisomers upon derepression, indicating the loss of approximately one nucleosome (Fig. 4, A (lanes 1 and 2) and B).FIGURE 4Coactivators differentially contribute to chromatin remodeling at the ADH2 promoter. A, supercoiling analysis on strains containing a plasmid with the ADH2 promoter was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples from WT (W303a) stain containing the WT plasmid, pLLTY1 or from WT strain containing a plasmid in which the ADH2 TATAA box was mutated to GAGAA, pLLTY3, were repressed (R) or 4-h derepressed (DR). The locations of nicked DNA and Band 1 are indicated. Quantitation of supercoiling assays in WT (W303a) (B), gcn5Δ (LLTY72) (C), ada1Δ (LLTY73) (D), snf2Δ (KKTY3) (E), and med15Δ (LLTY120) (F), all carrying pLLTY1. Samples were from cells either repressed (dashed), or derepressed for 2.5 h (gray) or 5 h (black) and subjected to supercoiling analysis. The topoisomer distributions were quantified using phosphorimaging. The data are presented as relative intensity for each of eight bands. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. A shift to the right represents a decrease in overall nucleosome density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We first established that this loss was not simply a result of transcription per se, but rather due to the concerted action of chromatin-remodeling complexes by performing the assay using a version of the plasmid in which the TATA box had been mutated, abolishing transcription. We still saw the shift with this mutant (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4), confirming that the loss of nucleosomes occurs in the steps leading up to initiation. Importantly, the transcription from the plasmid driven by the ADH2 promoter was glucose-repressed and both Adr1- and Cat8-dependent as was the decrease in nucleosome density upon derepression (data not shown). This agrees with published studies (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that our plasmid-based system is an accurate reflection of the events on the chromosome. The shift indicative of decreased nucleosome density that accompanied derepression in a wild-type strain was only partially observed in the gcn5Δ strain (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with previously published data showing a role for Gcn5 in ADH2 chromatin remodeling (28Verdone L. Wu J. van Riper K. Kacherovsky N. Vogelauer M. Young E.T. Grunstein M. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Previous work establishing the role of SAGA in ADH2 regulation was limited to examining the effects of deleting Gcn5. SAGA has functions other than HAT activity, however, such as recruitment of TATAA-binding protein, deubiquitination, and stabilization of pre-initiation complexes (PICs) (29Daniel J.A. Grant P.A. Mutat. Res. 2007; 618: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that are differentially required for expression. For example, it is known that the GAL genes require SAGA for activation, but not Gcn5 (30Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SAGA has a function in the regulation of ADH2 and FBP1 beyond its HAT activity, we used a strain lacking Ada1, an adaptor protein required for the structural integrity of SAGA (31Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Expression of both ADH2 and FBP1 was significantly reduced by loss of Ada1 (Fig. 2).Without Ada1, recruitment of coactivators to ADH2 was very low (Fig. 3B, light bars), despite full Adr1 binding (Fig. 1A), which we previously showed was sufficient for coactivator recruitment in a wild-type strain (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sua7 and pol II occupancy were very low, consistent with the reduced transcription in this mutant. Recruitment of coactivators and the general transcription machinery to FBP1 in the ada1Δ strain was also very low, in agreement with the weak gene activation we observed (Fig. 3B, dark bars).Chromatin remodeling of the ADH2 promoter in this mutant closely resembled wild type (Fig. 4D). Deletion of Ada1 destabilizes SAGA, including Gcn5 (supplemental Fig. S2C), and yet the chromatin remodeling defect in this mutant was milder than the gcn5Δ defect (Fig. 4C). This discrepancy could be explained by compensation by another chromatin-remodeling complex (such as NuA4) that gains access to the promoter in the absence of the whole SAGA complex, but not when only Gcn5 is missing.We also wanted to assay chromatin remodeling at the FBP1 promoter in the ada1Δ strain to determine if SAGA was functioning in the same manner as at ADH2. In contrast to the ADH2 promoter, the chromatin remodeling at FBP1 includes nucleosome repositioning (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a change that is not detectable by supercoiling assays. We instead used NuSA (nucleosome scanning assay), which maps the positions of nucleosomes at the chromosomal locus by determining the relative protection of DNA during micrococcal nuclease digestion (12Biddick R.K. Law G.L. Young E.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). (To assess the comparability of these two methods, we performed NuSA on the supercoiling plasmid from wild-type cells and observed similar results on the plasmid and for the chromosomal locu"

We previously showed that β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2 (β3Gn-T2) and β3Gn-T8 can form a heterodimer in vitro and that the complex exhibits much higher enzymatic activity than either enzyme alone (Seko, A., and Yamashita, K.

Here we examined this activation and the biological significance of complex formation in differentiated HL-60 cells. β3Gn-T2 and -T8 were co-immunoprecipitated from the lysates of both-transfected COS-7 cells, indicating their association in vivo. We prepared inactive mutants of both enzymes by destroying the DXD motifs. The mixture of mutated β3Gn-T2 and intact β3Gn-T8 did not exhibit any activation, whereas the mixture of intact β3Gn-T2 and mutated β3Gn-T8 had increased activity, indicating the activation of β3Gn-T2 via complex formation. Next, we compared expression levels of β3Gn-T1-T8 in HL-60 cells and DMSO-treated differentiated HL-60 cells, which produce larger poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. The expression level of β3Gn-T8 in the differentiated cells was 2.6-fold higher than in the untreated cells. Overexpression of β3Gn-T8, but not β3Gn-T2, induced an increase in poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in HL-60 cells. These results raise a possibility that up-regulation of β3Gn-T8 in differentiated HL-60 cells increases poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains by activating intrinsic β3Gn-T2.

Glycosyltransferases are present in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes, cytoplasm, cell surface, and body fluids. In the presence of appropriate sugar donors, they work for the biosynthesis of various glycoconjugates. Recently, it has been shown that some glycosyltransferases form protein complexes with other glycosyltransferases and/or non-glycosyltransferase proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Seko A. Trends Glycosci.

In these cases, glycosyltransferases exhibit little enzymatic activity when expressed alone, but their catalytic activities emerge if their respective cofactor proteins are simultaneously expressed. Because the activation does not occur by in vitro mixing of the glycosyltransferases and cofactor proteins, the process of complex formation appears to involve intermolecular disulfide bond formation or complicated interactions during early stages of polypeptide synthesis.

Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because in vitro mixing of individually expressed fractions of β3Gn-T2 and -T8 is sufficient for enzymatic activation, dimer formation and enzymatic activation should occur with the completely folded proteins. However, it has been unclear whether the two enzymes associate with each other in vivo and which of the one or more enzymes are catalytically activated in the complex.Poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) is a linear glycan chain consisting of repeating N-acetyllactosamine units (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3)n. The glycan chains occur in glycosphingolipids and N-linked/O-linked glycan chains of specific glycoproteins. In some cases, the 3-OH and/or 6-OH of galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues are modified by sialic acids, fucose (Fuc), and/or sulfate residues, which serve as determinants for various carcinoembryonic antigens and ligands for various cell recognition-associated lectins (15Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 211-253Google Scholar). In HL-60 cells, polyLacNAc chains exist primarily on lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamps) (16Carlsson S.R. Roth J. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18911-18919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells can differentiate to granulocytic cells in the presence of DMSO. Lee et al. (17Lee N. Wang W.-C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20476-20487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that polyLacNAc chains increase in the DMSO-treated differentiated HL-60 cells. They also showed that β3Gn-T activities in the differentiated HL-60 cells are 1.5-fold higher than those in the undifferentiated cells, suggesting that β3Gn-T is a rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of longer polyLacNAc chains. This linear glycan is biosynthesized by the repeating action of β1,4-galactosyltransferase and β3Gn-T. β3Gn-T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T7, and -T8 have been shown to possess the ability to synthesize polyLacNAc chains (14Seko A.

However, it is unclear which of the one or more enzymes are responsible for the increase in polyLacNAc chains in the differentiated HL-60 cells.In this study, we have addressed the following issues: whether β3Gn-T2 and -T8 associate with each other in vivo; whether β3Gn-T2 and/or -T8 are catalytically activated in a complexed state; and which one or more β3Gn-Ts are associated with the increase in polyLacNAc chains in differentiated HL-60 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (2.2 TBq/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.

The fragment was amplified by PCR from pcDNA3-β3Gn-T2 (21Seko A. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-tttaagcttGAGAAATGAGTGTTGGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ttttctagaGCATTTTAAATGAGCACT-3′ (reverse primer). The cDNA was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV™-14 between the HindIII and XbaI sites. The resulting plasmid (pFLAG-T2) was sequenced with a Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. C-terminally myc-tagged β3Gn-T8 (pMyc-T8) was prepared similarly. The cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR from pcDNA3-β3Gn-T8 (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-tttaagctt-GGGTCATGCGCTGCCCCAAGTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ttttctagaGCACTGGAGCCTTGGGT-3′ (reverse primer). The cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA4/myc-His® expression vector (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and XbaI sites. Expression vectors for C-terminally FLAG-tagged β3Gn-T8 (pFLAG-T8) and C-terminally myc-tagged β3Gn-T2 (pMyc-T2) were obtained from pMyc-T8 and pFLAG-T2, respectively, by HindIII and XbaI digestion and ligation into the respective plasmids.Pichia pastoris expression vectors for the truncated forms of human β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8, lacking cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, were prepared previously (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 mutated in their DXD motifs were prepared using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-CTGAGTTTGTTTTCAAGGGCGCTGACGATGTTTTTGTG-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-CACAAAAACATCGTCAGCGCCCTTGAAAACAAACTCAG-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-GAGTTTTGTCTTGCGAGCTGCGGACGATGCCTTTGTAC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T8), and 5′-GTACAAAGGCATCGTCCGCAGCTCGCAAGACAAAACTC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T8). Mutated plasmids were used for the transformation of P. pastoris KM71 cells, and the recombinant proteins were purified from the culture media as described previously (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The yields for recombinant human β3Gn-T2, β3Gn-T8, mutated β3Gn-T2 (T2-DA), and mutated β3Gn-T8 (T8-QA) from 100 ml of buffered methanol-complex media were 17, 130, 2.1, and 94 μg, respectively.The cDNA fragments for the truncated forms of murine β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA from NIH 3T3 cells, because both were encoded in each single exon. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-TTTGAATTCTCCAAAAACAGTAGCCAAGAC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCAGCTCATGTCTATTTCAGCA-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-TTTGAATTCAAAAAGGCTGAACCCCGGGGC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T8), and 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCCGGTCAGCACTGGAGCTC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T8). The cDNA was cloned into pPIC9 expression vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The yields for recombinant murine β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 from 100 ml of buffered methanol-complex media were 5.6 and 8.6 μg, respectively. Peptide:N-glycosidase F (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Assay of β3Gn-T Enzymatic Activity—The assay conditions were as described previously (21Seko A. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixtures (20 μl) consisted of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 mm tetraGP, 2.5 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (6.7 × 106 dpm), 50 μg/ml protamine chloride, 0.5 mm spermine, and appropriately diluted enzyme fractions. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The 3H-labeled products were separated by paper electrophoresis (pyridine:acetic acid:water, 3:1:387, pH 5.4) and then by paper chromatography (pyridine:ethyl acetate:acetic acid:water, 5:5:1:3). After drying, the paper was monitored for radioactivity with a radiochromatogram scanner.Co-immunoprecipitation—The plasmids (5 μg) pFLAG-T2 and pFLAG-T8 were transfected into semi-confluent COS-7 cells on 10-cm dishes using 20 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were isolated by selection using 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). A second transfection for transient expression was performed with 10 μg of the appropriate plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were harvested after 24 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After adding 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), the cell pellets were suspended and lysed on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and incubated with 1 μg of anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen) and 15 μl of Protein G-Sepharose™ 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, England) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resins were washed with the lysis buffer four times. Equal aliquots of the resins were used for SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot® Transfer Medium, Hercules, CA). Tag-conjugated proteins on the membranes were treated with horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (0.3 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-myc antibody (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and detected with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare).Reverse Transcription-PCR for β3Gn-Ts—HL-60 cells (Health Science Research Resources Bank, Sennan, Japan) were differentiated by 1.5%-DMSO treatment for 3 days. The cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers used for PCR were 5′-AGGTCTTTGACAAGCTAGCCAGG-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T1), 5′-TCCTGCCACGTAGAATGGCTCC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T1), 5′-CCACCCCGACCTTTCAGATATGC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-ACCTGGTCAGTGATATGGTACAGC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T2), 5′-CACGAGGCCCGCAAGGTCAAC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T3), 5′-GACAGGCGTTGCGATGGAGCC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T3), 5′-GATCCGCTCCCCCAGCCCAG-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T4), 5′-CATCTTCCATGATAGCCTGGAGG-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T4), 5′-TCCACTGGAGGGAGAAGAACTAC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T5), 5′-GCAGGGATGATAAGGAGTTTTACC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T5), 5′-GGGGCAAGAGCGCAGCTACGG-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T6), 5′-CTGTGCGCCAGGCAGCTGCAC-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T6), 5′-AGGAGCGCACGCACTACCAGC-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T7), 5′-CAGGGTGTCGCAGGCATGGTG-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T7), 5′-GGCCTGACCTAGACTCACTAGTG-3′ (forward primer for β3Gn-T8), and 5′-CGCAGTGCGGTCTGCTGGCCAG-3′ (reverse primer for β3Gn-T8). PCR was performed under following conditions: 28 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. After agarose-gel electrophoresis, the amplified products were quantified using an FLA-2000 multi-imager (Fuji Photo Film, Japan).Tomato-lectin Blotting—The plasmids (10 μg) were transfected into HL-60 cells (1 × 106) using 20 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. Aliquots of cell homogenates (3 μg of protein) were used for SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Parts of membranes were digested with Escherichia freundii endo-β-galactosidase (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) (50 milliunits of enzyme in 0.1% bovine serum albumin-50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 25 °C for 16 h). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was treated with 10 μg/ml biotin-conjugated lectin from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato, Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 1 h. The detection was performed using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents. Chemiluminescence was quantified using a LAS-1000 multi-imager (Fuji Photo Film, Japan).RESULTSβ3Gn-T2 Associates with β3Gn-T8 in Vivo—We previously found that the mixture of β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 exhibited much higher enzymatic activity than either enzyme alone and that the two enzymes could form a heterodimer in vitro (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear whether the two enzymes interacted with each other in vivo. To assess this, co-immunoprecipitation was performed. β3Gn-T2 FLAG tagged at the C terminus (T2-FL) and β3Gn-T8 myc tagged at the C terminus (T8-myc) were simultaneously expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). T2-FL co-immunoprecipitated with T8-myc and was detected by anti-FLAG antibody, indicating that β3Gn-T2 associates with β3Gn-T8 in vivo.β3Gn-T2 Is Activated by β3Gn-T8—Increased enzymatic activity in the mixture of β3Gn-T2 and -T8 indicated that the enzyme(s) were activated in the complex. To assess which β3Gn-T was activated, we prepared mutated proteins that were enzymatically inactive, but could form the complex. Glycosyltransferases generally have a DXD motif (23Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which is involved in binding to divalent cations and sugar nucleotides and is thus essential for their catalytic activities. β3Gn-T2 and -T8 contain 245DDD247 and 246QDD248, respectively, as DXD motifs. We constructed expression vectors with mutated β3Gn-T2 (T2-DA) and -T8 (T8-QA), which had 245ADD247 and 246ADD248, respectively. The ability of T2-DA and T8-QA to form a complex in vivo was examined by co-immunoprecipitation as above. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows that the substitutions in their DXD motifs did not affect their ability to interact with their wild-type counterpart. Next, we examined the enzymatic activities of T2-DA, T8-QA, and 1:1 mixtures with wild-type β3Gn-T2 and -T8. Soluble forms of (His)6-tagged T2-DA and T8-QA were produced using with the P. pastoris protein expression system, as previously described (14Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and purified by Ni-NTA agarose chromatography (Fig. 2). Both mutant proteins electrophoresed as smeared bands, similar to the wild-type proteins. Peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment showed that the polypeptide moieties of T2-DA and T8-QA had the same molecular masses (∼45 kDa) as the wild-type enzymes (Fig. 2). The smeared profiles were attributed to heterogeneity in yeast large N-linked glycans. The enzymatic activities are shown in Fig. 3. Neither T2-DA nor T8-QA had any enzymatic activity, indicating that the DXD motifs are required for catalytic activity. The mixture of wild-type β3Gn-T2 and T8-QA had 6.3-fold higher enzymatic activity (1.9 ± 0.05 pmol/min) than β3Gn-T2 alone (0.30 ± 0.04 pmol/min), whereas the mixture of wild-type β3Gn-T8 and T2-DA had the same level of activity as β3Gn-T8 alone (0.014 ± 0.002 pmol/min). The same results were obtained from another independent experiment using individually prepared enzymes. These results indicate that β3Gn-T2 is activated by β3Gn-T8, and that the mutant T8-QA, which has no enzymatic activity, is also able to activate β3Gn-T2.FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE of soluble forms of β3Gn-T2 (T2), β3Gn-T8 (T8), and the mutated proteins, T2-DA and T8-QA, produced by P. pastoris. Purified proteins were applied to the gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were detected by Sypro Orange staining. The digests by peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) are also shown in the right four lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Specific activities of β3Gn-T2 (T2), β3Gn-T8 (T8), T2-DA, T8-QA, and their combinations. Each protein (7 ng) was assayed for enzymatic activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tetra-antennary N-linked oligosaccharide was used as an acceptor substrate. The enzymatic activities are the means of five independent experiments. The minimal detectable amount of the activity was 0.005 pmol/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined whether murine β3Gn-T8 could activate murine and human β3Gn-T2. Amino acid similarities for catalytic domains of β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 between human and murine were 87 and 75%, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the Vmax/Km value of the mixture, murine β3Gn-T2 and murine β3Gn-T8, was approximately twice higher than that of murine β3Gn-T2 alone. Interestingly, murine β3Gn-T8 could activate human β3Gn-T2, although the degree of the activation by murine β3Gn-T8 was lower than that by human β3Gn-T8. In converse, human β3Gn-T8 could also activate murine β3Gn-T2. These results indicate that the ability of β3Gn-T8 to activate β3Gn-T2 is conserved between human and murine.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of human β3Gn-T2 (H2), human β3Gn-T8 (H8), murine β3Gn-T2 (M2), murine β3Gn-T8 (M8), and the mixtures of each two enzymeH2H2+H8H2+M8M2M2+M8M2+H8Km (mm)0.420.150.250.330.0710.18Vmax (nmol/min/mg of protein)15061039017074360Vmax/Km3604100160052010002000 Open table in a new tab Furthermore, to assess whether β3Gn-T8 could stabilize β3Gn-T2 or not, the stability of the enzymatic activities of human β3Gn-T2 in the presence or absence of human β3Gn-T8 was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, the enzymatic activities of β3Gn-T2 alone and the mixture of β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 decreased in the same manner. This suggests that β3Gn-T8 does not have the ability to stabilize the enzymatic activity of β3Gn-T2 at least in vitro.FIGURE 4Stability of the enzymatic activities of human β3Gn-T2 (closed circle) and the mixture of human β3Gn-T2 and β3Gn-T8 (open circle). Equal amounts of enzyme proteins were incubated in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.2) at 37 °C, and at the indicated time, aliquots of the enzyme solution were assayed for the β3Gn-T activity. Four independent experiments were performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β3Gn-T8 Is Involved in Increasing PolyLacNAc Chains in the Differentiated HL-60 Cells—By structural studies for N-linked glycan chains of lamps, Lee et al. (17Lee N. Wang W.-C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20476-20487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the amount of polyLacNAc chains in HL-60 cells increased with differentiation by DMSO treatment. They also assayed the enzymatic activities of β3Gn-Ts, β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V, and β,4-galactosyltransferases, and found that only β3Gn-T activity increased 1.6-fold in the differentiated HL-60 cells using a linear substrate Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ1→R. We assayed β3Gn-T activity in these cells using tetraGP, which is a good substrate for all β3Gn-Ts (14Seko A. Yamashita K.

As shown in Table 2, the β3Gn-T activities in HL-60 cells and in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells were 6.5 ± 0.7 and 35 ± 1.8 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, indicating that the activity increased 5.3-fold in the course of differentiation. To assess which β3Gn-Ts were up-regulated in the process of differentiation of HL-60 cells, we compared expression levels of transcripts for β3Gn-Ts in HL-60 cells and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. It has been shown previously that β3Gn-T1, -T2, -T3, -T4, -T7, and -T8 are able to synthesize poly-LacNAc chains (14Seko A. Yamashita K.

Among these, transcript levels increased for only β3Gn-T2 and -T8 (1.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively) after DMSO treatment. This result suggests that the increased expression level of either β3Gn-T2 or -T8 is responsible for the increase in β3Gn-T activity. Next we examined whether the expression level of polyLacNAc chains increased with overexpression of β3Gn-T2 or -T8 in HL-60 cells. Expression vectors for β3Gn-T2 and -T8 were transiently transfected into HL-60 cells, and the cell homogenates were subjected to tomato-lectin blotting analysis. Because this lectin recognizes three or more linear units of repeating LacNAc (24Merkle R.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2000881847,"Nucleoside transporters are plasma membrane proteins essential for nucleoside salvage. Among them, human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3, SLC28A3) plays an essential role in this process because of its broader substrate selectivity and higher concentrative ability than the other members of the SLC28 protein family, hCNT1 and hCNT2. The aim of this study was to characterize an isoform of hCNT3, encoded by an alternatively spliced SLC28A3-related mRNA, the first identified for a CNT protein. This variant, named hCNT3ins, is the result of the insertion of 176 bp corresponding to an intron located between exons 2 and 3 of the gene. This insertion results in a shift of the reading frame, yielding a protein lacking 69 residues of the N terminus. hCNT3 and hCNT3ins mRNAs are simultaneously expressed both in normal and transformed cells and are differentially regulated by activation and differentiation. Because of the N-terminal deletion, hCNT3ins is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it shows a typical hCNT3-related activity. hCNT3ins exhibits a shorter half-life than its plasma membrane counterpart, being degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway. We suggest that this novel hCNT3 isoform would be involved in the salvage of intracellular nucleosides from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2003443978,"Induced pluripotent stem cell technology, also termed iPS, is an emerging approach to reprogram cells into an embryonic stem cell-like state by viral transduction with defined combinations of factors. iPS cells share most characteristics of embryonic stem cells, counting pluripotency and self-renewal, and have so far been obtained from mouse and humans, including patients with genetic diseases. Remarkably, autologous transplantation of cell lineages derived from iPS cells will eliminate the possibility of immunological rejection, as well as current ethical issues surrounding human embryonic stem cell research. However, before iPS can be used for clinical purposes, technical problems must be overcome. Among other considerations, full and homogeneous iPS reprogramming is an important prerequisite. However, despite the fact that cells from several mouse tissues can be successfully induced to iPS, the overall efficiency of chimera formation of these clones remains low even if selection for Oct4 or Nanog expression is applied. In this report, we demonstrate that cells from the mouse meningeal membranes express elevated levels of the embryonic master regulator Sox2 and are highly amenable to iPS. Meningeal iPS clones, generated without selection, are fully and homogeneously reprogrammed based on DNA methylation analysis and 100% chimera competent. Our results define a population of somatic cells that are ready to undergo iPS, thus highlighting a very attractive cell type for iPS research and application."

In the current study, surface TLR4 expression were similar but TLR4 activation (lipid A, 10 μg/ml) resulted in lower TNF-α release by HIV+ human macrophages compared with healthy cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K (LY294002) normalized TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages and augments ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in response to lipid A. Importantly, HIV+ macrophages demonstrated increased constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate formation, increased phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at Ser9, and reduced PTEN protein expression. As a functional assessment of GSK-3β phosphorylation, TLR4-mediated interleukin-10 release was significantly higher in HIV+ human macrophages compared with healthy cells. Incubation of human macrophages with exogenous HIV Nef protein induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β (whereas phosphorylation was reduced by PI3K inhibition) and promoted interleukin-10 release.

Immunol. 2008; 126: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the use of HAART may not be associated with a significant reduction in the risk for common bacterial pneumonia (5Benito N. Rano A. Moreno A. Gonzalez J. Luna M. Agusti C. Danes C. Pumarola T. Miro J.M. Torres A. Gatell J.M. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 2001; 27: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations strengthen the notion that other factors may contribute to pneumonia pathogenesis in HIV+ persons. AM are the most abundant immune cells in the alveolar airspace and represent critical effector cells in the innate immune response to infectious challenge in the lungs, including bacterial pathogens (6Sibille Y. Reynolds H.Y. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 471-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). AM constitutively express a number of surface receptors involved in pathogen recognition, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for Gram-positive bacteria (example, TLR2) and Gram-negative bacteria (example, TLR4) (7Maris N.A. Dessing M.C. de Vos A.F. Bresser P. van der Zee J.S. Jansen H.M. Spek C.A. van der Poll T. Eur. Respir. J. 2006; 28: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TLR activation by bacterial products triggers intracellular signaling cascades that activate antimicrobial pathways (such as reactive oxygen species) and host defense genes (including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α) that promote pathogen control and elimination of invading bacteria (8Brightbill H.D. Modlin R.L. Immunology. 2000; 101: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HIV-1 can infect AM (9Park I.W. Koziel H. Hatch W. Li X. Du B. Groopman J.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and may result in specific defects in macrophage innate immune function such as mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis (10Koziel H. Eichbaum Q. Kruskal B.A. Pinkston P. Rogers R.A. Armstrong M.Y. Richards F.F. Rose R.M. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and NF-κB activation in response to Pneumocystis (11Zhang J. Zhu J. Imrich A. Cushion M. Kinane T.B. Koziel H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3147-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and impairs TNF-α mediated macrophage apoptotic response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12Patel N.R. Zhu J. Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Wan Z. Saukkonen J. Koziel H. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 6973-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent investigation of AM from HIV+ persons demonstrated significantly reduced TNF-α release in response to TLR4 stimulation, suggesting the anti-microbial response of these AM may be suboptimal (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release was in part attributed to constitutively active cellular phosphatases such as MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), as pharmacological inhibition of MKP-1 partially restored TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, other factors or pathways that may contribute to the reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in AM from HIV+ persons have not been completely identified. PI3K is a member of the lipid kinase family and elicits TLR-mediated signaling. PI3K activation links to downstream intracellular signaling events that influence innate immune responses including cytoskeletal reorganization and inflammatory gene expression (14Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4639) Google Scholar). Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by TLRs can activate PI3K, which in turn activates Akt, a key effector of the PI3K pathway (15Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Robeff P.K. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to the activating role that PI3K/Akt play in immune receptor signaling, these enzymes have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB driven gene transcription (16Guha M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32124-32132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In addition, activated Akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), resulting in GSK-3β inactivation and a dampened pro-inflammatory immune response mediated by enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (17Fukao T. Tanabe M. Terauchi Y. Ota T. Matsuda S. Asano T. Kadowaki T. Takeuchi T. Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 18Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), thus suppressing the TLR-mediated inflammatory response (19Fukao T. Koyasu S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, whether the PI3K signaling pathway is intact in HIV+ AM and the determination of its role in regulating TLR4-mediated signaling events have not been previously investigated. Using human macrophage cell lines and clinically relevant human AM, we show that reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in AM from HIV+ persons at risk for bacterial pneumonia is attributable to increased constitutive activation of PI3K signaling pathway. Importantly, reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages can be partially restored by inhibiting PI3K, identifying PI3K as a potential pharmacological target in restoring macrophage innate immune response in HIV+ persons. Study Subjects—Healthy and asymptomatic HIV+ individuals were recruited without evidence of active pulmonary disease and with normal spirometry. Healthy individuals were without known risk factors for HIV infection and were confirmed to be HIV-negative by ELISA, performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abbot Diagnostics, North Chicago, IL). Demographic characteristics for all participants were recorded on standardized forms and included age, gender, smoking status, HIV risk factor, medical history, and prescribed antiretroviral medications. Reagents—Lipid A (the biologically active component of lipopolysaccharide, and specific TLR4 ligand) from Escherichia coli F583 Rd mutant, protease inhibitor mixture, phorbol myristic acid, and SB16763 were purchased from Sigma, and wortmannin and LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant Nef was from Trinity Biotech (Dublin, Ireland) and from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Bethesda, MD). Antibodies—Anti-TLR4, anti-phospho-GSK-3β, anti-GSK-3β, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, and anti-PTEN antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverley, MA), cytokine ELISA kits were from R & D (McKinley Place, Minneapolis, MN), and anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Macrophage Cell Lines—Macrophages were differentiated from human promonocytic U937 (American Type Culture Collection) and HIV-infected U1 cell lines (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program; Bethesda, MD). U1 cells (HIV-infected subclone of U937 cells) contain two integrated copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA and are characterized by low levels of constitutive virus expression that can be modulated by cytokines and pharmacological agents (20Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments, U937 and U1 cells were harvested during exponential growth phase, washed, and then incubated in complete medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (fetal calf serum), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To allow differentiation to macrophages, U937 and U1 cells were incubated with 100 nm phorbol myristic acid at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 24 h. Adherent cells were then washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline (to remove phorbol myristic acid) and incubated in complete media (without phorbol myristic acid) for an additional 24 h before use in experiments. Human Alveolar Macrophages—To determine clinical relevance of the study, select experiments were performed using human AM. Recruited healthy and asymptomatic HIV+ individuals were without evidence for active pulmonary disease and had normal spirometry. Healthy individuals were confirmed to be HIV-seronegative by ELISA and had no known risk factors for HIV infection. For the HIV+ subjects, peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts were >200 cells/mm3, and HIV risk factors included intravenous drug use and homosexual exposures. All were prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy, all had undetectable serum viral load (<50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml), and none experienced a prior opportunistic pneumonia. Using standard techniques, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to obtain lung immune cells (21Fraser I.P. Koziel H. Ezekowitz R.A. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed on consenting adults following protocols approved by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center institutional review board and the Committee for Clinical Investigations. Cells were cultured for 24–48 h, and non-adherent cells were washed away followed by the addition of fresh media before experimentation (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses—Adherent human macrophages were washed 2× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and placed on ice for 20 min (22Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Cushion M. Koziel H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 81: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis with designated antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Resolved bands were quantified by densitometry (Amersham Biosciences). PI3K Assay and Quantitation of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3) Formation—PI3K enzymatic assay and PIP3 formation were measured using a PI3K ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT). In brief, cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody and incubated with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate substrate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Enzymatic reactions were stopped by centrifugation and were incubated with PIP3 detector and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, reacted mixtures were transferred to the detection plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, immediately secondary detection was added, and the color was allowed to develop for 1–15 min in the dark. Color reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 n H2S04 stop solution. Absorbance was recorded at 450 nm, and the enzyme activity was interpolated from the standard curve generated following the manufacturer's instructions. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Knockdown in AM—To determine the functional relevance of PI3K pathway in TLR4 signaling, RNA-mediated interference-mediated knockdown of PTEN was performed using synthetic duplex RNA oligonucleotides. We used On-Target plus SMART pool siRNA PTEN (catalog #L-003023-00, Dharmacon, Boulder, CO). Target sequences were GACUUAGACUUGACCUAUA, GAUCAGCAUACACAAAUUA, GAUCUUGACCAAUGGCUAA, and CGAUAGCAUUUGCAGUAUA. On-target plus non-targeting siRNA were used as controls (catalog #D-001810-01-05, Dharmacon). The target sequence was UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA. Macrophages were electroporated with 100 nm siRNA using Amaxa system following the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). PTEN siRNA-mediated knockdown was determined by Western blot probed with anti-PTEN antibody 24–48 h after transfection. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell surface expression of TLRs was determined by Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) with a laser power of 5.76 milliwatts. The instrument was calibrated before each measurement with standardized fluorescent particles (Immunocheck; AMAC, Inc. Westbrook, ME). Fluorescent signals of the cells were measured simultaneously by three photomultiplier tubes and optical filters and shown as the mean of the log fluorescence intensity of the cell population within gate. Macrophages were incubated with an anti-TLR4 antibody on ice for 60 min, washed 3×, incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min on ice protected from light, fixed in Optilyse (Beckman/Coulter, Miami, FL) at room temperature for 5–10 min, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Human macrophages were first identified by the characteristic forward and side scatter parameters on unstained cells and confirmed by staining with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated primary anti-human HLA-DR (Beckman Coulter). Data were expressed as a mean relative fluorescence units and the percentage of cells staining positive. Isotype primary conjugated antibodies served as a negative control. Samples were prepared and analyzed in duplicate, and a minimum of 5000 cells was counted for each sample. ELISA—Cultured supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and assayed immediately or stored at –80 °C until assayed. Cytokine measurements were performed using commercially available ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a Bio kinetic Elisa reader (Bio-Tek Instruments; Winooski, VT). The detection limit for TNF-α was 4.4 pg/ml. All measurements were performed in duplicate, and the mean values of the two measurements were used for statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis—Group comparisons were performed using Student's t test (two sample tests) or one-way analysis of variance. Calculations were performed with StatView (SAS Institute, Inc; Cary, NC) and INSTAT2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software package. Results are given as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was accepted for p < 0.05. Inhibition of PI3K Is Associated with Enhanced TLR4-mediated TNF-α Release in HIV+ Macrophages—TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ AM is reduced, and the mechanism was in part due to constitutive activation of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of other signal transduction pathways, we examined TLR4-mediated PI3K activation in these cells. PI3K activation is known to limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and macrophages (19Fukao T. Koyasu S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 23Martin M. Schifferle R.E. Cuesta N. Vogel S.N. Katz J. Michalek S.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but whether PI3K signaling influences TLR-meditated TNF-α release in HIV+ AM has not been established. Human macrophage U937 cells exhibited robust TNF-α release in response to lipid A, whereas this response in HIV+ U1 macrophages is severely reduced (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, left panel). This reduction was not attributable to lower surface TLR4 expression comparing these two cell lines (Fig. 1A, right panel). Such invariance also exists between clinically relevant human alveolar macrophages obtained from healthy persons and asymptomatic HIV+ individuals (Fig. 1B, left and right panels). In separate experiments preincubation of human macrophage U937 cell lines with a PI3K inhibitor (50 μm LY294002) did not influence TLR4-mediated TNF-α release, whereas preincubation of HIV+ U1 macrophages with the PI3K inhibitor increased TLR4-mediated TNF-α release (Fig. 1C). A similar pattern was also observed in AM obtained from healthy and asymptomatic HIV+ persons (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that constitutive PI3K activation may in part account for the reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages as TNF-α release is restored in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. PI3K Signaling Pathway Is Constitutively Active in HIV+ Macrophages—PI3K is a lipid kinase that induces the transfer of phosphate group to the D-3 position of myoinositol ring of phosphoinositides that leads to the formation of PIP3. PIP3 is a critical second messenger that targets the downstream molecule Akt and influences innate immune responses such as inflammatory gene expression (14Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4639) Google Scholar). Using PIP3 formation as a measure of PI3K activity, levels of PIP3 were detected in unstimulated human U937 macrophages and significantly increased in response to TLR4 agonist, lipid A (Fig. 2A). In contrast, constitutive release of PIP3 was higher in unstimulated HIV+ U1 macrophages compared with unstimulated U937 cells, increased significantly in response to lipid A, and returned to unstimulated conditions in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2A). As another measure of PI3K activity, Akt phosphorylation was elevated in unstimulated HIV+ human AM and further increased in response to TLR4 agonist and returned to a basal state in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2B). PTEN is a major lipid phosphatase antagonist of PI3K signaling pathway. PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, converting to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Thus, PTEN antagonizes the effect of PI3K, favoring the accumulation of Akt over phosphorylated Akt and suppressing phosphorylated Akt formation leading to increased activation of PI3K (24Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of HIV tat protein into human fetal microglial cell line decreases expression of PTEN (25Chugh P. Fan S. Planelles V. Maggirwar S.B. Dewhurst S. Kim B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PTEN levels would be reduced in HIV+ macrophages. This is in agreement with our finding that constitutive PTEN protein expression is lower in AM from asymptomatic HIV persons compared than those obtained from healthy persons (Fig. 2C). Taken together these findings support the concept of constitutive PI3K activation (as measured by elevated levels of PIP3, increased constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, and lower levels of PTEN) in HIV+ macrophages) and suggest that elevated PI3K activity may contribute to reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages. Enhanced Constitutive GSK-3β Phosphorylation in HIV+ Macrophages—GSK-3β is an important downstream signaling molecule of the PI3K signaling pathway. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3β on serine 9 (26Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar) results in GSK-3β inactivation and TLR-mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release while promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine release such as IL-10 (18Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In the current study, constitutive phosphorylation of GSK-3β in HIV+ AM is increased compared with healthy AM and was reduced in the presence of GSK-3β inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of constitutively active GSK-3β at position Ser9 results in inhibition of GSK-3β and, consequently, an increase in TLR-mediated IL-10 release (18Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Consistent with enhanced GSK-3β phosphorylation in HIV+ alveolar macrophages, TLR4-mediated IL-10 release was higher in alveolar macrophages from asymptomatic HIV+ persons compared with alveolar macrophages from healthy individuals (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate enhanced GSK-3β phosphorylation and enhanced TLR4-mediated IL-10 release (a functional consequence of enhance GSK-3β phosphorylation) and are consistent with increased constitutive PI3K activation in AM from HIV+ persons. PI3K Attenuates TLR4-induced TNF-α Release by Limiting ERK1/2 MAP Kinase Activation in HIV+ Macrophages—Ligation of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide induces an immune response through activation of MAP kinases (27Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), with subsequent release of critical host defense molecules such as TNF-α in vitro (28Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). We have shown that ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity is down-regulated in HIV+ macrophages with concomitant down-regulation of TNF-α in response to TLR4 activation (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PI3K activity on TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages, we examined the effects of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation in U1 cells in response to TLR4 activation. We observed that pretreatment of U1 cells with LY294002 resulted in markedly enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation ERK1/2 MAP kinase in response to lipid A (Fig. 3C). Such enhanced ERK1/2 activity was noted at 15 min, appeared maximal at 30 min, and gradually declined by 60 min after lipid A treatment, consistent with enhancement of lipid A-induced TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages in the presence of PI3K inhibitor (Figs. 1, C and D). In contrast to its effect on ERK1/2 augmentation, LY294002 treatment did not affect phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, indicating that PI3K blockade did not affect p38 MAP kinase within this time frame (data not shown). These results suggest that blockade of PI3K results in augmented and prolonged ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation in HIV+ macrophages. Gene Silencing of PTEN Results in Diminished TNF-α Release in Response to Lipid A in HIV+ Macrophages—Consumption of the 3-phosphorylated product of PI3K resulted from an increase in inositol phosphatase activity of PTEN (3Cao X. Wei G. Fang H. Guo J. Weinstein M. Marsh C.B. Ostrowski M.C. Tridandapani S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4851-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether PTEN regulates TLR4-mediated TNF-α release, functional assays were performed using targeted functional gene silencing of PTEN. A reduced PTEN level was demonstrated in human AM after PTEN siRNA gene silencing by ∼50% (Fig. 4A). TLR4-mediated TNF-α release was robust in healthy AM with non-silencing siRNA, whereas in PTEN-silenced cells, the lipid A-mediated TNF-α release was significantly diminished (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these data in clinically relevant human AM, similar results were observed in our model U937 human macrophages (Fig. 4, C and D). After electroporation and siRNA transfection, replated macrophage cell viability was 76%, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion (n = 2). HIV rNef Is Sufficient to Induce Akt Phosphorylation and GSK-3β Phosphorylation and Induce IL-10 Release in Human Macrophages—HIV Nef protein was detected in the serum of HIV-infected subjects in the range of 5–10 ng/ml (29Fujii Y. Otake K. Tashiro M. Adachi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and antibodies directed against Nef have been found in a large proportion of infected subjects (30Ameisen J.C. Guy B. Chamaret S. Loche M. Mouton Y. Neyrinck J.L. Khalife J. Leprevost C. Beaucaire G. Boutillon C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1989; 5: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Exogenous Nef has been found to enter cells by adsorptive endocytosis after nonspecific binding to the surface of CD4 T-cells, primary macrophages, and U937 cells and to activate the signaling pathway such as STAT-1 in human monocyte macrophages (31Federico M. Percario Z. Olivetta E. Fiorucci G. Muratori C. Micheli A. Romeo G. Affabris E. Blood. 2001; 98: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro HIV infection promotes Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane leading to Akt phosphorylation in primary human macrophages (32Chugh P. Bradel-Tretheway B. Monteiro-Filho C.M. Planelles V. Maggirwar S.B. Dewhurst S. Kim B. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nef has been shown to bind to the C terminus of p85 component of PI3K (33Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Mandic R. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 2002; 294: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and exogenous addition of Nef cultures of U937 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells leads to increased IL-10 release (34Brigino E. Haraguchi S. Koutsonikolis A. Cianciolo G.J. Owens U. Good R.A. Day N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether a viral-secreted protein is sufficient to induce the activation of PI3K signaling pathway, U937 macrophages were incubated with recombinant HIV Nef (rNef) protein and analyzed for PI3K induction. Exogenous HIV rNef promoted Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, and Akt phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of either PI3K inhibitors, LY294002, or wortmannin (Fig. 5A). Similarly, HIV rNef enhanced GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 in a dose-dependent manner, and phosphorylation was inhibited by PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the response is specific to PI3K activity. Furthermore, exogenous HIV rNef induced IL-10 release in human U937 macrophages, and HIV rNef-mediated IL-10 release was reduced in the presence of PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 5C). Importantly, rNef failed to induce the release of TNF-α when added alone, whereas when added in the presence of lipid A, rNef inhibits lipid A-induced TNF-α in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we observed that Nef protein is expressed in HIV+ U1 cells but not in U937 cells (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data show that HIV rNef is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β and promote IL-10 release but failed to induce the release of TNF-α. Furthermore, Nef is expressed in HIV+ U1 cells. These data support the concept that rNef may in part contribute to the reduced TNF-α release and enhanced IL-10 release observed in HIV+ macrophages following TLR4 stimulation. In this study we demonstrated that the PI3K signaling pathway is constitutively active in HIV+ macrophages, and enhanced constitutive PI3K activation may in part contribute to reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in alveolar macrophages from HIV+ persons. Up-regulated PI3K signaling pathway in HIV+ macrophages is supported by our finding that after pharmacological inhibition of PI3K in HIV+ macrophages, the effects of TLR4 activation on TNF-α release were normalized. Importantly, measurement of the PI3K signaling pathway showed that HIV+ macrophages demonstrated increased constitutive PIP3 formation, increased constitutive phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules Akt and GSK-3β, and reduced PTEN protein expression. As a functional assessment of GSK-3β phosphorylation, TLR4-mediated IL-10 release was significantly higher in HIV+ human macrophages compared with healthy cells. In addition, targeted gene silencing of U937 cells and AM PTEN reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release, suggesting that PTEN plays a role in modulating innate immune responses mediated by TLR4. Taken together, these data demonstrate increased constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in HIV+ macrophages and support the concept that PI3K activation may contribute to reduced TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ human macrophages and impair host cell innate immune response to bacterial cell wall products. The mechanism by which constitutively enhanced PI3K activity reduces TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages appears in part due to regulation of GSK-3β activity. PI3K can be activated by TLRs, which in turn activates (phosphorylates) Akt, a key effector of the PI3K in alveolar macrophages (15Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Robeff P.K. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Activated Akt in turn phosphorylates GSK-3β, resulting in GSK-3β inactivation and a consequent dampened pro-inflammatory response (23Martin M. Schifferle R.E. Cuesta N. Vogel S.N. Katz J. Michalek S.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our data show that HIV infection is associated with constitutive Akt phosphorylation and GSK-3β phosphorylation, which is associated with reduced TLR4-mediated release of TNF-α and enhanced IL-10 release in alveolar macrophages from asymptomatic HIV+ persons. Furthermore, inhibition of the PI3K pathway rescues TLR4-mediated ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity, which could lead in part to restoration of TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ human macrophages. Enhanced constitutive PI3K activity may in part be related to specific HIV proteins such as HIV Nef. Nef-mediated effects on cells are pleiotropic. Association between Nef and PI3K influenced cell survival (35Wolf D. Witte V. Laffert B. Blume K. Stromer E. Trapp S. d'Aloja P. Schurmann A. Baur A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and blocked platelet-derived growth factor receptor-mediated signaling by interfering with PI3K (36Graziani A. Galimi F. Medico E. Cottone E. Gramaglia D. Boccaccio C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6590-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Direct association between Nef and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K induced the activation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) leading to increased production of HIV-1 (33Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Mandic R. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 2002; 294: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the current study incubation of human macrophages with exogenous HIV Nef protein induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β (whereas phosphorylation was reduced by PI3K inhibition), and promoted IL-10 release in response to TLR4 stimulation. In addition, the exogenous addition of rNef alone did not induce the release of TNF-α but impaired TNF-α release in response to lipid A. These data support the mechanism that HIV Nef may be sufficient to induce Akt phosphorylation and phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 and promote IL-10 release. This is the first study to report that HIV Nef induces the phosphorylation of GSK-3β. As a consequence of phosphorylation, GSK-3β activity is inhibited, leading to diminished TLR4-mediated TNF-α release and enhanced IL-10 production. This finding is consistent with the report that exogenous Nef induces the production of IL-10 in U937 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (34Brigino E. Haraguchi S. Koutsonikolis A. Cianciolo G.J. Owens U. Good R.A. Day N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, this finding is consistent with the report that inhibition of GSK-3β stimulates IL-10 production (18Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). IL-10 has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory properties (37Lalani I. Bhol K. Ahmed A.R. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1997; 79: 469-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which through a negative feedback mechanism deactivates macrophages (38Fiorentino D.F. Zlotnik A. Mosmann T.R. Howard M. O'Garra A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3815-3822PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bogdan C. Vodovotz Y. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). IL-10 also reduces the formation of TNF-α in vivo (40Gerard C. Bruyns C. Marchant A. Abramowicz D. Vandenabeele P. Delvaux A. Fiers W. Goldman M. Velu T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and the intensity of cellular recruitment at the lung level upon lipopolysaccharide challenge (41Rogy M.A. Auffenberg T. Espat N.J. Philip R. Remick D. Wollenberg G.K. Copeland III, E.M. Moldawer L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2289-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Nef induces phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β is currently under investigation. In the current study the results of in vitro experiments may not accurately reflect signaling pathways in vivo. However, the use of clinically relevant primary human AM may allow more direct translation to human disease. Although HIV Nef was sufficient to promote Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation in human U937 macrophages, the role of other HIV proteins was not specifically investigated. Other limitations of the study include that other pathways and effector molecules downstream of PI3K activation were not specifically investigated, and whether the PI3K pathway dysregulation is limited to TLR4 or may be applicable to other TLRs was not determined. In conclusion, the current study shows that AM from asymptomatic HIV+ persons exhibit constitutively activated PI3K signal transduction pathway, as evidenced by elevated levels of Akt phosphorylation and GSK3-β phosphorylation, reduced levels of PTEN, and enhanced IL-10 release in response to TLR4 stimulation. Enhanced PI3K activity may in part contribute to impaired TLR4-mediated TNF-α release, as PI3K inhibition restores TLR4-mediated TNF-α release in HIV+ macrophages. Taken together with recent studies, HIV infection is associated with impaired TLR4-mediated host cell response and may be the consequence of targeted activation of inhibitory intracellular pathways such as MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (13Tachado S.D. Zhang J. Zhu J. Patel N. Koziel H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and PI3K (this study). Furthermore, PI3K inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic target to restore the macrophage host cell response to bacterial product challenge in HIV+ persons.

These processes are dependent on the proper assembly of dimeric secreted proteins that signal in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner (1Woodruff T.K. Lyon R.J. Hansen S.E. Rice G.C.

The regulation of pro-ligands in the TGFβ superfamily is an emerging area of interest, particularly because it is related to both developmental and reproductive phenotypes in animals deficient in protein cleavage enzymes (7Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Inhibin and activin are unique members of the TGFβ superfamily. First, inhibin is an antagonist to activin signaling and has a more established role as an endocrine feedback modulator of the pituitary (8Ling N. Ying S.Y. Ueno N. Esch F. Denoroy L. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7217-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) biosynthesis and release from the anterior pituitary gonadotrope cells rely heavily on the moment-by-moment regulation by both inhibin and activin from the ovary and pituitary. Second, inhibin and activin share a common β-subunit. Inhibin is the only TGFβ ligand with two dissimilar subunits, a unique α-subunit and one activin β-subunit to produce two isoforms of inhibin: inhibin A (α/βA) and inhibin B (α/βB). The activins are homodimers of two β subunits to give rise to activin A (βA/βA), activin B (βB/βB), or activin AB (βA/βB). Very little is known about the intracellular assembly, processing, and secretion of inhibin and activin dimers. Mature inhibin and activin ligands are derived from large precursor proteins that undergo a series of steps to release mature bioactive hormones into the extracellular environment in a tightly regulated manner. An early step in the production of inhibin proteins involves the attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides to the inhibin α- and β-subunits in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously demonstrated that specific oligosaccharide attachments to the subunits direct the differential assembly of inhibin and activin dimers (9Antenos M. Stemler M. Boime I. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1670-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, misfolded inhibin subunit proteins exhibit secretion defects (9Antenos M. Stemler M. Boime I. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1670-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is evident that the biosynthesis and secretion of inhibin subunit precursors and mature dimers is a highly controlled process. Our findings led us to question what role proteolytic processing plays in the release of bioactive inhibin and activin ligands. Fig. 1A schematically represents the structures of the inhibin subunits. The consensus recognition motif for proconvertase enzyme cleavage is conserved in each precursor protein. Cleavage of activin A precursor (pro-βA) is necessary for the release of bioactive mature ligand (βA), whereas cleavage of precursor inhibin α-subunit (pro-αN-αC) to mature (αC) protein is not necessary because the precursor proteins have biological activity once secreted from the cell (10Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The bioprocessing of inhibin and activin subunits has been given limited attention in favor of studies investigating the expression pattern of the genes and the secretion dynamics of ligands in the reproductive cycles from a variety of animals. Members of a family of higher eukaryotic endoproteases, named proprotein convertases (PCs) (11Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 12Scamuffa N. Calvo F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1954-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) are good candidates for endogenous inhibin subunit convertases. As with TGFβ ligands, the inhibin precursor molecules are apparent substrates for furin cleavage. Furin is the mammalian prototype for this family of enzymes. This membrane-associated, calcium-dependent serine protease is primarily concentrated in the trans-Golgi apparatus where precursor substrates containing the RXXR recognition motif are post-translationally converted into active forms (13Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furin is responsible for the maturation of several members of the TGFβ family, including TGFβ1 (14Dubois C.M. Blanchette F. Laprise M.H. Leduc R. Grondin F. Seidah N.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), BMP4 (15Cui Y. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L.

Robertson E.J. Development. 2000; 127: 245-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Müllerian inhibiting substance (18Nachtigal M.W. Ingraham H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The inhibin α- and βA-subunit contain this furin recognition motif, and both proteins are believed to be processed by furin. The inhibin βB-subunit cleavage site is instead IRKR and does not contain this exact furin cleavage motif but satisfies the sequence rules that govern cleavage by furin (19Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional response of LβT2 cells to activin has been demonstrated (20Zhang H. Bailey J.S. Coss D. Lin B. Tsutsumi R. Lawson M.A. Mellon P.L. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2909-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), there have been no reports that evaluate the intracellular assembly and secretion of endogenous inhibin subunits from pituitary gonadotrope cells. Here we sought to identify novel determinants that direct the assembly and secretion of activin homodimers and inhibin heterodimers. We demonstrate enhanced secretion and proteolytic processing of mature activin B and inhibin B following activin A treatment. We show that furin, stimulated by activin A, is a key enzyme responsible for subunit maturation. The data demonstrate a positive feedback loop between inhibin subunits and furin in pituitary gonadotrope cells. Recombinant Ligands, Plasmids, and Chemical Reagents—Recombinant human activin A was purified as reported previously (21Pangas S.A. Woodruff T.K. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant activin B (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was reconstituted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The human inhibin α-subunit and βB-subunit cDNAs were provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). The human furin promoter-luciferase construct (pGL2-furin P1) was generously provided by Dr. C. Dubois (Université de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). The furin inhibitor, dec-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Cell Lines—An immortalized mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell line, LβT2 cells (kindly provided by Dr. P. L. Mellon, University of California, San Diego, CA) and CHO cells were passaged as described (21Pangas S.A. Woodruff T.K. J.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 318-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LoVo cells) was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). LoVo and human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic. Cell Culture Treatments and Transient Transfections—For experimental treatments, LβT2 cells were plated in a 24-well or 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection at a confluency of ∼80%. The cells were transfected the next day with the furin P1 promoter reporter construct. After 18 h, the cells were treated with the appropriate ligand at various doses for 24 h in phenol-free, serum-free F12:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then harvested for luciferase assays or RNA isolation. For siRNA transfections, the cells were plated at 60–70% confluency 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with nonspecific control siRNA or specific siRNAs targeted to each of the Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). siRNAs targeted to furin (l-044065-01), Smad2 (M-040707-00), and Smad3 (M-040706-00), and a nonspecific control (D-001206-09-00) were purchased from (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). Transfections were performed in Opti-mem medium (Invitrogen). To demonstrate the effect of down-regulation of siRNA oligoduplexes on the furin P1 promoter activity, the cells were treated with control medium, activin A, or activin B at a concentration of 20 and 100 ng/ml, respectively, for 24 h. The furin inhibitor, dec-RVKR-CMK was added to cultures 24 h before treatment with activin ligands. Following the appropriate time points, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays, and the emitted luminescence was measured for 30Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 31Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar using an AutoLumat Luminometer (Berthold Technologies Co., Oak Ridge, TN). The data are reported as fold induction representative of the means ± S.E. of at least three separate transfection or activin treatment experiments. RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA from LβT2 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (1 μg) were primed with random hexamer primers using the Advantage Reverse PCR kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). On-column DNase digestion was performed using an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR was programmed according to the manufacturer's instructions. From the original reverse transcription reaction, 1.5 μl was subjected to PCR amplification in a 25-μl volume with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following conditions: 50 °C hold for 2 min, 95 °C hold for 10 min, the 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Primer and probe sets were 6-carboxy-fluorescein-labeled and acquired from Applied Biosystems assays on demand and designed to span intron/exon borders for inhibin βA (Mm00434338), βB (Mm01286587), α (Mm00439683), and furin (Mm00440646). The data were normalized with VIC-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control (ΔCt). The threshold levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were not altered by any treatments. Standard errors of the means from replicates are represented as 2∧−ΔΔCt as described (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123265) Google Scholar), which represents the relative change in gene expression as analyzed by real-time PCR. Mutagenesis of Inhibin βB-Subunit Cleavage Site—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR as described previously (9Antenos M. Stemler M. Boime I. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1670-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1.

Stemler M. Boime I. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1670-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inhibin subunit antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. W. Vale (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2, 3101), phospho-Smad3/phospho-Smad1(pSmad3/pSmad1, 9514), and total Smad3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). A total Smad2 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. An anti-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Immunoblot results were visualized using an ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed at varying time points onto an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Densitometric analysis of signals were quantified using the Kodak Imaging Software, version 4.0.1, and are presented as relative density of unprocessed precursor proteins to processed mature inhibin subunits. Statistics—The values are reported as the means ± S.E. and analyzed using Prism (version 4.0a) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Analysis of variance, followed by the appropriate post-test (Tukey's, Bonferroni, or Kruskal-Wallis), was used to evaluate differences between treatments. The statistical significance was reported if p < 0.05. Expression of Inhibin α-, βA-, and βB-Subunits in Adult Mouse Pituitary and in LβT2 Gonadotrope Cells—In the pituitary, as in many other tissues, activins are produced and act locally to regulate the function of their targets, including gonadotropes and other cell types (24Bilezikjian L.M. Blount A.L. Leal A.M. Donaldson C.J. Fischer W.H. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 225: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The expression of inhibin α-, βA-, and βB-subunits in adult mouse pituitary and LβT2 gonadotropes were quantitatively assessed by real time PCR of total RNA from these cells. In our characterization of adult mouse pituitary, real time PCR data showed expression of the inhibin α- and βB-subunits but undetectable levels of the βA-subunit (Fig. 1B). The level of the βB-subunit was 2-fold in excess of the α-subunit. A similar distribution of inhibin subunits was observed in the LβT2 gonadotropes, which also had undetectable levels of βA-subunit mRNA. There is approximately a 3-fold excess of inhibin βB-subunit mRNA to the inhibin α-subunit mRNA in this cell line. Based on this mRNA data, we infer that an excess of βB-subunits results in the assembly of activin B dimers rather than inhibin B dimers in the pituitary. Activin A Stimulates the Inhibin α- and βB-Subunits in Mouse Pituitary Gonadotrope Cells—We hypothesized that activin augments the expression of inhibin subunits in pituitary cells. To investigate the effect of activin A on the transcription of the inhibin subunits, LβT2 gonadotropes were treated with activin A (20 ng/ml) for 48 h, and RNA was prepared for quantitative real time PCR analysis. Activin A treatment significantly increased the mRNA levels of both the inhibin α- and βB-subunits 6.7- and 14.2-fold, respectively, in LβT2 cells (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). The level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was unchanged with activin A treatment. The up-regulation of inhibin βB-subunit mRNA transcripts following activin A treatment was ∼2-fold greater than that of inhibin α-subunit, suggesting that the homodimerization of inhibin βB-subunits to produce activin B (βB/βB) was more likely than the heterodimerization of inhibin B (αC/βB). To confirm this, media from these cells were collected and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated for analysis by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions to determine whether dimeric activin B was in excess of inhibin B with activin A treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, dimeric forms of activin B were detected with an inhibin βB-subunit antibody after activin A (20 ng/ml) treatment. Inhibin B dimers were observed following treatment with higher concentrations of activin A. These data show that activin B dimers are assembled in excess of inhibin B dimers when cells are treated with 20 ng/ml of activin A. RNA and conditioned media from LβT2 cells pretreated with follistatin to block both exogenous and endogenous activins were also analyzed. Co-treatment with follistatin abolished the observed increase in inhibin subunit mRNA transcripts (data not shown). Follistatin treatment blocked the increase in protein secretion of the inhibin βB-subunit (Fig. 1E) as well as inhibin α-subunit (Fig. 1F). The data suggest that endogenous mouse inhibin α- and βB-subunits are induced by activin and can be efficiently blocked by follistatin. The secretion of inhibin subunits following activin A treatment was also assessed under reducing conditions. We analyzed the conditioned media from LβT2 gonadotropes treated with activin A for 48 h. Consistent with the mRNA data, both the inhibin α- and βB-subunits were secreted with activin A treatment (Fig. 1, G and I). This increase correlated with an increase in inhibin pro-βB-subunit and αC accumulation and subunit maturation. Densitometric quantification of immunoreactive mature βB protein over unprocessed protein levels revealed a 1.5-fold increase in pro-βB processing (Fig. 1H, asterisk). The amount of unprocessed pro-βB is not significantly different when stimulated with different concentrations of activin A. An immunoreactive mature αC band was ∼4-fold greater with activin A treatment (20 ng/ml) when compared with no ligand treatment (Fig. 1J). An increase in inhibin subunit maturation prompted us to question whether there was an increase in proconvertase processing enzymes such as furin, because furin was identified as a key relevant TGFβ1-converting enzyme (14Dubois C.M. Blanchette F. Laprise M.H. Leduc R. Grondin F. Seidah N.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Effect of Activin A Treatment on Furin mRNA Accumulation—The increase in mature inhibin α- and βB-subunits suggests that activin treatment might regulate the cellular levels of endogenous furin convertase. To test this, LβT2 cells were treated with increasing doses of activin A ligand for 24 h, and RNA was collected for quantitative real time PCR analysis. A concentration-dependent effect of activin A on inhibin α- and βB-subunits was confirmed (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, furin mRNA levels increased with activin A treatment, up to a 3.5-fold increase observed with 400 ng/ml of activin A (Fig. 2C). We next compared the effect of activin A treatment on these mRNAs at different time points. Stimulation of inhibin α-subunit mRNA levels was observed following 9 h of treatment with activin A (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 2D), whereas a significant increase in inhibin βB subunits was observed by 6 h (Fig. 2E). No significant change in furin mRNA levels were observed until 9 h (Fig. 2F), with a maximum 1.5-fold stimulation occurring at 24 h. The level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was unchanged with activin A treatment. Our results demonstrate that activin A can augment the mRNA levels of the inhibin α- and βB-subunits as well as furin. Treatment of LβT2 cells with actinomycin D (RNA synthesis inhibitor) or cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) abolished the increase in furin mRNA following activin A treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). These data confirm that the regulation of endogenous furin mRNA levels by activin is at the transcriptional level. Because many TGFβ superfamily ligands are processed by furin, we sought to test whether other ligands of this family could regulate cellular levels of furin convertase mRNA. LβT2 cells were treated with activin A, inhibin A, bone morphogenic proteins (BMP3 and BMP4), and TGFβ-1, -2, and -3 ligands for 24 h, and furin mRNA levels were measured by PCR (Fig. 2G). Inhibin A, BMP, and TGFβ ligands had no significant stimulatory effect on furin mRNA levels. These data demonstrate that in the mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell line, only activin A can regulate endogenous furin mRNA levels. Relationship between Furin Gene Expression and Mature Inhibin α- and βB-Subunits—We next investigated the relationship between furin and inhibin subunit processing. LβT2 cells were pretreated with a potent furin and PC inhibitor, decanoyl-RVKR-CMK for 1 h. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of activin A for 48 h. Medium was collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and subjected to Western blot analysis under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, increasing concentrations of activin A resulted in the enhanced secretion of both inhibin α-subunit (Fig. 3A) and inhibin βB-subunits (Fig. 3B). Treatment with CMK inhibited the ability of all proconvertase enzymes to cleave the inhibin subunits. Accumulation of unprocessed proteins suggests that this inhibitor affects cleavage and not secretion. These results imply a direct relationship between activin A-dependent expression of furin and the maturation of the inhibin subunits expressed and secreted from LβT2 gonadotropes. To assess whether the inhibin α- and βB-subunits are targets for processing by furin, lysates from CHO cells transfected with the human inhibin α-subunit or the βB-subunit were subjected to an in vitro digestion assay using recombinant furin. These lysates contain an abundance of inhibin precursor proteins that are not completely cleaved by the proteoloytic enzymes endogenously expressed in CHO cells. Inhibin subunits were incubated with purified furin in the solution and proteolytic cleavage of the precursor was assayed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4A, inhibin α-subunit and inhibin βB-subunit precursors incubated in the presence of recombinant furin were cleaved to their respective mature forms. The furin-deficient LoVo cell line (25Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was utilized to determine whether overexpression of a furin expression vector would cleave the inhibin subunits. LoVo cells were transiently transfected with the inhibin α- and βB-subunits and a furin expression vector. Overexpression of furin results in the cleavage of the pro-αN-αC and pro-βB proteins (Fig. 4A, right panel). The size of these mature products is consistent with cleavage at the minimal furin consensus sequence in each protein sequence. Together, these data confirm that furin can cleave the inhibin subunits. To verify that the predicted IRKR site in the inhibin βB-subunit is the proteolytic processing site, the cleavage motif was mutated. Three βB-subunit mutants (IRKA, IRAA, and IAAA) were generated and expressed in HEK 293 cells. Mutagenesis of Arg292 in the IRKA mutant displayed ∼40% total cleavage activity, and unprocessed precursor protein accumulated (Fig. 4B). The IRAA and IAAA mutants had very low to undetectable levels of mature βB-subunit. These results confirm that cleavage of the βB-subunit occurs at the consensus furin motif and the requirement of basic residues at specific positions. The effects of furin inhibition were also assessed using mouse furin-specific siRNA oligoduplexes. LβT2 cells were transiently transfected with furin siRNA followed by treatment with activin A for 24 h. RNA was harvested from these cells, and the specificity of the furin siRNA duplex was assessed by real time PCR. We determined that endogenous furin mRNA levels were decreased by 72% with the furin siRNA following activin A treatment, and no significant decrease in endogenous furin mRNA was observed with nonspecific control siRNA oligoduplexes (Fig. 4C). The medium collected from these cells was also analyzed by immunoblot analysis, and the knockdown of endogenous furin mRNA resulted in decreased mature inhibin αC (Fig. 4D) as well as mature βB-subunit (Fig. 4E). Similar to the CMK experiments presented in Fig. 6, these data demonstrate that furin is a key processing enzyme for the inhibin α- and βB-subunits. Activins Increase Furin Gene Activity and Stimulates the Furin Promoter—To further understand the regulation of the furin gene by activin, a vector with the human furin promoter region upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (pGL2-furin P1) was utilized. LβT2 cells were transiently transected with the pGL2-furin P1 luciferase reporter construct. The cells were treated with either activin A or activin B ligand for 24 h. We observed a dose-dependent effect with activin A treatment, where at 5 ng/ml maximal luciferase activity was observed with a 5-fold increase over unstimulated controls (Fig. 5A). Activin B could not as efficiently activate the furin-luciferase reporter construct, and a dose of 20 ng/ml resulted in only a 2.7-fold increase over unstimulated controls (Fig. 5B). This may be due to the fact that activin B and follistatin are endogenously expressed within these cells. These results suggest that the activin signal transduction pathway transactivates the furin gene. Involvement of Smads in Activin-induced Furin Transcription—To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the furin mRNA up-regulation following activin stimulation, we analyzed the involvement of Smad regulatory proteins. Previous work demonstrated the presence of three Smad-binding elements in the furin promoter known to be responsive to Smad2/4 and Smad3/4 complexes (26Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 are necessary for the activin-induced activation of the furin promoter in LβT2 cells. Smad2 and Smad3 siRNA were utilized to individually suppress these two Smad molecules in LβT2 cells. The cells were transiently co-transfected with siRNA oligoduplexes to either Smad2 or Smad3 and the furin P1-luc reporter construct. The cells were then treated with activin A or activin B ligands for 24 h, and luciferase activity was assessed. The results of the luciferase assays show that the down-regulation of Smad2 or Smad3 by siRNA reduced activin-mediated induction of the furin promoter back to unstimulated control levels (Fig. 5, C and D). These data suggest that the receptor-restricted Smads are both necessary to mediate the activin-induced transactivation of the furin promoter. Specificity of Smad2 or Smad3 knockdown was assessed by immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad3, which are the activated forms of Smad proteins that mediate activin signaling (Fig. 5, E and F, respectively). An antibody to actin protein was utilized as a loading control for cell lysates. Quantitation of protein band intensity after normalization against the actin controls revealed that endogenous phosphorylated Smad2 protein was decreased by 54%, whereas phosphorylated Smad3 protein was decreased by 57% with Smad2 and Smad3 siRNA, respectively. Total Smad proteins were also examined following siRNA transfection, and Smad2 and Smad3 proteins were reduced to 42 and 45%, respectively. We observed a significant decrease in furin-reporter activation with Smad2 and Smad3 siRNA, implying that different promoter sites may bind different Smad proteins. These results suggest that Smad2 and Smad3 are both indispensable for the activin-induced transcriptional activation of the furin promoter in LβT2 cells. The gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary synthesize and secrete FSH, a major physiological regulator of the female reproductive axis. Activin is the main positive regulator of FSHβ subunit expression, where inhibin dimers target these cells and antagonize the actions of activin. In this report, we provide evidence that of all TGFβ ligands tested, only activin stimulates the biosynthesis, secretion, and proteolytic maturation of the inhibin α- and β-subunits. This is, in part, due to an activin-induced increase in furin expression. Overall, these data provide a mechanism where the regulation of furin and inhibin subunits cooperate in a novel positive feedback loop that augments the regulation and secretion of bioactive mature activin B and inhibin B dimers necessary for local FSHβ regulation. We have utilized the immortalized mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell line, LβT2, to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the post-translational processing of inhibin and activin proproteins. Although a previous report has also demonstrated that the inhibin α- and βB-subunit genes are induced with activin treatment in LβT2 cells (20Zhang H. Bailey J.S. Coss D. Lin B. Tsutsumi R. Lawson M.A. Mellon P.L. Webster N.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2909-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), no reports have shown that activin can stimulate the proprotein convertase, furin mRNA. Real time PCR experiments have shown that of the TGFβ superfamily ligands tested in our assay, only activin A positively regulates furin mRNA levels. BMP4 is proteolytically activated by furin (15Cui Y. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4735-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); however, BMP ligands do not regulate furin expression in mouse pituitary gonadotrope cells that express both BMP type I and type II receptors (27Nicol L. Faure M.O. McNeilly J.R. Fontaine J. Taragnat C. McNeilly A.S. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 196: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that TGFβ1 can regulate furin gene expression in rat synoviocytes (28Blanchette F. Day R. Dong W. Laprise M.H. Dubois C.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), this ligand cannot regulate furin mRNA in mouse pituitary gonadotrope cells because LβT2 cells lack endogenous TGFβ type II receptor and therefore are not responsive to TGFβ ligand (29Suszko M.I. Woodruff T.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 36: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This selective auto-regulation of furin by activin suggests that furin plays an important role in regulation of hormone biosynthesis and secretion from pituitary gonadotrope cells. Additionally, it provides evidence that furin may be involved in the increased bio-availability of FSHβ mediators such as mature inhibin and activin dimers. Our results with the furin inhibitor CMK, furin-deficient LoVo cells, and furin siRNA oligoduplexes establish that the inhibin α- or βB-subunits are targets of furin processing and that furin is one of the key enzymes responsible for the cleavage and maturation of the inhibin α- and the βB-subunits observed by immunoblotting procedures. Our results confirm that cleavage occurs at the consensus furin motifs. Furthermore, we predict that the consensus motif is also a cleavage site for other proconvertase proteins in different cells. 3M. Antenos and T. K. Woodruff, manuscript in preparation. Inhibin βB production following pituitary stimulation with activin A suggests that its processing is tightly regulated in these cells in an autocrine manner. Endogenous furin expression may be the limiting factor in the amounts of mature bioactive activin B the gonadotrope cells synthesize. We have shown that furin is a novel activin transcriptional target in LβT2 pituitary gonadotrope cells. The furin P1 promoter construct is transactivated by both activin isoforms, A and B. To understand the molecular mechanism involved in the activin regulation of the furin promoter, we assessed the involvement of Smad regulatory proteins. The furin P1 proximal promoter region contains SMAD-binding elements (26Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of both Smad2 and Smad3 by specific siRNA oligoduplexes abolished the effect of activin on the furin promoter. Activin-mediated stimulation of the endogenous furin and the furin P1-luciferase reporter gene is dependent on both the intracellular Smads. The furin gene is only regulated by activin ligands in pituitary gonadotrope cells and not any other TGFβ ligands and provides an additional level of control in the regulation of pituitary function and hormone biosynthesis that has not been previously discovered with respect to reproductive functions. Few reports have uncovered the physiological functions of proprotein convertases in the regulation of female reproductive function (12Scamuffa N. Calvo F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1954-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The generation of null mice for the furin gene results in embryonic lethality approximately at embryonic day 11. Embryos failed to undergo axial rotation and ventral closure (32Roebroek A.J. Umans L. Pauli I.G. Robertson E.J. van Leuven F. Van de Ven W.J. Constam D.B. Development. 1998; 125: 4863-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in embryo implantation were observed when the PC5/6 gene, PCSK5, was inactivated, resulting in death at embryonic days 4.5–6.5 (33Essalmani R. Hamelin J. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Prat A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PC1 plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of prohormones and neuropeptides, and a compound heterozygous mutation in PC1 has been described in a woman with obesity, hypocortisolemia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (34Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L. Sanders L. Montague C.T. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The reproductive defect in this case may be the result of impaired gonadotropin-releasing hormone processing and/or abnormalities in neuropeptides related to GnRH secretion. Our data suggest a novel correlation between the proprotein convertase, furin, and regulation of the reproductive hormones, inhibin and activin, that are vital regulators of the pituitary-gonadal axis (Fig. 6). In conclusion, our results identify furin as a tightly regulated activin target gene. Furin may be an important modulator of the inhibin subunit maturation and activation involved in autocrine signaling in the pituitary gonadotrope cell line, LβT2. The activin-specific regulation of furin could represent a novel intracellular mechanism by which activin regulates the reproductive processes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and hormone biosynthesis. We predict that the biosynthesis and secretion of the inhibin α- and β-subunits are tightly regulated and finely tuned and that proteolytic processing is an additional step important for the actions of these hormones.

https://openalex.org/W2045664930,"HNF4α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α) plays an essential role in the development and function of vertebrate organs, including hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells by regulating expression of multiple genes involved in organ development, nutrient transport, and diverse metabolic pathways. As such, HNF4α is a culprit gene product for a monogenic and dominantly inherited form of diabetes, known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). As a unique member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, HNF4α recognizes target genes containing two hexanucleotide direct repeat DNA-response elements separated by one base pair (DR1) by exclusively forming a cooperative homodimer. We describe here the 2.0 Å crystal structure of human HNF4α DNA binding domain in complex with a high affinity promoter element of another MODY gene, HNF1α, which reveals the molecular basis of unique target gene selection/recognition, DNA binding cooperativity, and dysfunction caused by diabetes-causing mutations. The predicted effects of MODY mutations have been tested by a set of biochemical and functional studies, which show that, in contrast to other MODY gene products, the subtle disruption of HNF4α molecular function can cause significant effects in afflicted MODY patients.

Further underscoring the importance of HNF4α in pancreatic β-cells, mutations on HNF4α in humans are directly linked to the onset of MODY1 (maturity onset diabetes of the young 1) (Fig. 1A), one of the most common monogenic causes of diabetes, mainly characterized by impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the β-cells (16Yamagata K.

A recent genome-wide expression profiling study revealed that both HNF1α and HNF4α are the master regulators of the β-cells directly affecting their physiology (19Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R.

Fraenkel E. Bell G.I. Young R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). HNF4α is functionally very closely related to HNF1α, since they cross-regulate each other and form a common network of transcription factors that controls the development and function of hepatocyte and pancreatic islets (21Boj S.F.

Rev. 2008; 29: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As a result, the diabetic phenotype in MODY1 due to HNF4α mutations is virtually indistinguishable from that due to HNF1α mutations (23Pearson E.R. Pruhova S. Tack C.J. Johansen A. Castleden H.A.

There is even an additional MODY mutation within the HNF4α recognition site of human HNF1α promoter (13Gragnoli C. Lindner T. Cockburn B.N. Kaisaki P.J. Gragnoli F. Marozzi G. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), underscoring the interplay between HNF1α and HNF4α. HNF4α belongs to the NR superfamily, and a typical NR comprises the all-cysteine zinc finger DNA binding domain (DBD), lipophilic ligand binding domain (LBD), and additional domains with activation function (24Bain D.L.

These discrepancies await further investigations. The DBD is the most highly conserved domain shared by NRs and consists of two all-cysteine zinc finger motifs. The crystal structures of several NR-DBDs revealed that the protein structures formed by zinc fingers facilitate sequence specific interactions with the major groove of the DNA double helix containing its response elements (32Khorasanizadeh S. Rastinejad F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These response elements contain hexameric sequences that can be arranged in various configurations (direct or inverted orientation). Orphan NRs can bind either one hexanucleotide (half-site or subrecognition site) or two direct hexanucleotides spaced by 1-5 nucleotides in between (DR1-DR5) with high selectivity (1Benoit G. Cooney A. Giguere V. Ingraham H. Lazar M. Muscat G. Perlmann T. Renaud J.P. Schwabe J. Sladek F. Tsai M.J. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 798-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). HNF4α predominantly recognizes target genes, including HNF1α, that contain the DR1 recognition sites although it can also bind a nonnatural DR2 with a much weaker affinity (33Jiang G. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1218-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The NR-DBD also contains the C-terminal extension that facilitates dimerization through the T-box element and, in some cases, additional half-site recognition by the C-terminal A-helix (Fig. 1B). When the dimeric recognition occurs, the target DNA leads to the formation of a highly specific dimer interface, which places the DBDs in register with the half-sites of their respective response elements. Many of the nonsteroid hormone NRs form heterodimers with retinoid x receptor (RXR). However, HNF4α represents a nonsteroid receptor that exclusively functions as a homodimer despite its similar DNA binding specificity and amino acid sequence homologous to that of RXR (33Jiang G. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1218-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the major determinant for dimerization stability and selectivity appears to reside within the LDB, which spontaneously forms a dimer in solution (25Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y.I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), there is an additional dimerization determinant within the DBD that allows the formation of a dimer only in the presence of DNA and provides the cooperativity and additional selectivity when it binds DNA (33Jiang G. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1218-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Holmbeck S.M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol.

To understand the molecular principles underlying the recognition of a naturally occurring DR1 target DNA sequence and the molecular basis of MODY mutations, we have solved the crystal structure of the homodimeric human HNF4α-DBDs in complex with a high affinity DNA containing the HNF1α (MODY3 gene) promoter sequence composed of a tandem direct repeat of half-sites separated by one base pair (DR1) and harboring an additional MODY single nucleotide mutation site. This structure, refined at 2.0 Å, shows the critical features of the protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions. The predicted effects of the MODY mutations were further tested by a set of biochemical and functional studies, and the regulatory post-translational modification sites are discussed. Construction of Overexpression Vectors for Wild Type and Mutants and Protein Purification—Two different versions of the recombinant proteins were used in our studies: tag-free wild type for crystallization and maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins for biochemical characterizations of wild type and MODY mutants due to low yields or low solubility of some of the tag-free mutant proteins. However, the same vector constructs were used, either performing or skipping a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease digestion to remove or retain the MBP tag. The cDNA harboring the full-length human HNF-4αB splice variant (35Kritis A.A. Argyrokastritis A. Moschonas N.K. Power S. Katrakili N. Zannis V.I. Cereghini S. Talianidis I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Steve Shoelson from Joslin Diabetes Center. A modified MBP fusion expression vector, pET41a MBP, was used for our studies. In this modified vector, the MBP fragment of pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET41a vector (GE Healthcare) by inserting the fragment between the NdeI and HindIII sites to replace the GST tag, and a thrombin cleavage site was replaced by a TEV protease cleavage site for higher specificity. A fragment of human HNF4α cDNA (amino acids 46-126) was subcloned by standard PCR into pET41a MBP vector to produce the proteins fused with MBP at the N-terminal end with the TEV cleavage site. For tag-free protein purification, HNF4α-DBD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (Novagen) with induction of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.8-1.0 at 37 °C and harvested after culturing for an additional 4-6 h. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the expressed MBP-fusion proteins were isolated in the presence of 0.6 m NaCl to prevent nonspecific binding to bacterial DNA. HNF4α-DBD was released by TEV digestion from amylose magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) after overnight incubation at 4 °C and further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono-S FPLC). The purified protein was estimated to be at least 98% pure as judged by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on an 8-25% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Lu P. Liu J. Melikishvili M. Fried M.G. Chi Y.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fractions were pooled; concentrations were measured by UV absorption and stored at -80 °C as a 10% (v/v) glycerol stock. For MBP fusion protein purification for in vitro biochemical studies with wild type and MODY mutants, the TEV digestion step was skipped due to insolubility of the cleavage products (e.g. the G115S mutant heavily precipitated after digestion). Instead, the MBP fusion proteins were directly eluted from the beads with 10 mm maltose in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and subsequently purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono-S FPLC). Fractions were pooled and stored at -80 °C as a 10% (v/v) glycerol stock. Site-directed Mutagenesis Analysis—QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate constructs with each point mutation of HNF4α-DBD according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid templates used in the mutation were pET41a MBP-HNF4α DBD (amino acids 46-126) and pcDNA3 HNF4α. All of the generated constructs with the mutated sequences were verified with DNA sequencing. Preparation of DNA Oligonucleotides—Tritylated oligonucleotides were purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX) and further purified by reverse phase HPLC. Excess mobile phase-containing acetonitrile was removed using HiTrapQ (GE Healthcare), and the trityl groups were removed with 80% acetic acid. The deprotected oligonucleotides were precipitated with 75% ethanol, dissolved in water for concentration measurement, and lyophilized before storage at -80 °C. When needed, double-stranded DNAs were generated by heating equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides to 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooling to 4 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of the complex has been reported previously (36Lu P. Liu J. Melikishvili M. Fried M.G. Chi Y.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein-DNA complexes were made by dialyzing them with a molar ratio of 2 HNF4α and 1.2 double-stranded DNA in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 2.5 h and concentrated to at least 10 mg ml-1. The crystals were grown at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with an overhang 21-mer duplex DNA. The optimized crystals were grown with the well solution containing 26% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 80 mm magnesium acetate, and 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.8, and transferred into the mother liquor containing an additional 15% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant before being directly plunged into liquid nitrogen and stored for data collection. The native data were collected at 100 K at APS (SER-CAT 22BM) using a MAR-225 CCD detector and processed using HKL2000 (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystals belong to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 121.628 Å, b = 35.425 Å, c = 70.985 Å, and β = 119.364° and diffraction to 2.0 Å resolution. There is one complex in the asymmetric unit (41.5% solvent content). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method by the use of MOLREP (38Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1002-1025Crossref Scopus (4136) Google Scholar). As a search model, we used the previous structure of RXR·RAR·DNA complex (Protein Data Bank accession code 1DSZ) (39Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The best solution had a correlation coefficient of 38.5%, 11.4% above the second best solution. The Rcryst value after molecular replacement was 0.514. After one round of rigid body refinement, Rcryst and Rfree dropped to 0.502 and 0.498, respectively. Protein residues were mutated in order to match the sequence of HNF4α, and the model was refined by simulated annealing with CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc maps as well as omit maps were calculated at regular intervals to allow manual rebuilding. Tight restraints on the zinc-sulfur coordination and base pairing were released, and solvent water molecules based on higher than 3σ peaks in Fo - Fc σA-weighted maps were added conservatively at appropriate sites. Inclusion of individual atomic temperature factors during the final stages of refinement was accompanied by a substantial decrease in Rfree values (Table 1). Iterative building and refinement were performed using the program O (41Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. KjeldgaardActa Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab HNF4α/DNA Binding Titration through Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Single-stranded oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Fig. 2B) were dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 20 °C) and 1 mm EDTA. Oligonucleotide 1 was 5′-end-labeled with 32P as described (42Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5422) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotide 1 was mixed with a 1.1-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide 2, and the samples were heated to 90 °C and cooled slowly to 20 °C. DNA was transferred by dialysis into binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (v/v) glycerol). DNA concentrations were measured by absorbance, using a molar extinction coefficient (ϵ1cm260 = 2.57 × 105). Pure recombinant wild type HNF4α-DBD-(46-126) was prepared as described previously (36Lu P. Liu J. Melikishvili M. Fried M.G. Chi Y.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Samples were stored at -20 °C until use. EMSAs were carried out as described (43Hellman L.M. Fried M.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels cast and run in 45 mm Tris-borate, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.3 at 20 °C). Autoradiographic images were captured on storage phosphor screens (type GP; GE Healthcare) detected with a Typhoon PhosphorImager. Band intensities were determined using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Binding affinity (K) and cooperativity (ω) were evaluated using the McGhee-von Hippel isotherm (44McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar), as modified by Record and co-workers (45Tsodikov O.V. Holbrook J.A. Shkel I.A. Record Jr., M.T. Biophys.

Because the total concentration of protein binding sites on DNA was always much less than that of the protein, the approximation [P] = [P]total was used. Cell Cultures—The HeLa cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin, and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and MIN6 cells of passages 26-28 were used in this study. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The full-length cDNA of human HNF4α wild type or mutant was subcloned into the pcDNA3(+)/Neo vector (Invitrogen), and the reporter vector pGL3-(BA)3 containing three copies of the HNF4α response element (-77 to -65) within the promoter of human apolipoprotein B was constructed by subcloning this promoter fragment from p(BA1)5CAT (kindly provided by Dr. Margarita Hadzopoulou-Cladaras (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece)) into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Similarly, the reporter vector pGL3-HNF1α-298 containing one copy of the HNF4α response element (-64 to -52) within the promoter of human HNF1α (-298 to the first AGT) was constructed and used for Fig. 4B. HeLa cells or MIN6 cells were transfected using Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or Nucleofactor reagent V (Amaxa), respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, a total of 50 ng of pcDNA3-HNF4α and 50 ng of pGL3-(BA)3 or pGL3-HNF1α-298 and 10 ng of pRL-TK (control Renilla luciferase vector) were used for transfection of 1 × 105 HeLa cells seeded on 24-well plate 1 day before transfection. For MIN6 cells, a total of 500 ng of pcDNA3-HNF4α and 500 ng of pGL3-(BA)3 and 100 ng of pRL-TK were used for transfection of 2 × 106 MIN6 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with luciferase lysis buffer supplied with the Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) and a luminometer. All values were normalized in a relative ratio of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. At least three independent transfections were performed in quadruplicate. Protein Stability Assays (Pulse-Chase Experiment)—Stability of the mutants in cultured cells was measured by means of pulse-chase experiments. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were serum-starved for 1 h before being incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus Met/Cys for 30 min and then labeled with 100 μCi/ml Trans35S labeling mix (MP Biomedicals) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeling medium was removed thereafter, and the 35S-labeled cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated periods of time (0-18 h) and lysed. The nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuc-Buster protein extraction kit (Novagen). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and incorporated radioactivity was analyzed by autoradiography using BioMax film (E"

Like protein kinase C isozymes, chimaerins possess a C1 domain capable of binding phorbol esters and the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in vitro. Here we identified an autoinhibitory mechanism in α2-chimaerin that restricts access of phorbol esters and DAG, thereby limiting its activation. Although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused limited translocation of wild-type α2-chimaerin to the plasma membrane, deletion of either N- or C-terminal regions greatly sensitize α2-chimaerin for intracellular redistribution and activation. Based on modeling analysis that revealed an occlusion of the ligand binding site in the α2-chimaerin C1 domain, we identified key amino acids that stabilize the inactive conformation. Mutation of these sites renders α2-chimaerin hypersensitive to C1 ligands, as reflected by its enhanced ability to translocate in response to PMA and to inhibit Rac activity and cell migration. Notably, in contrast to PMA, epidermal growth factor promotes full translocation of α2-chimaerin in a phospholipase C-dependent manner, but not of a C1 domain mutant with reduced affinity for DAG (P216A-α2-chimaerin). Therefore, DAG generation and binding to the C1 domain are required but not sufficient for epidermal growth factor-induced α2-chimaerin membrane association. Our studies suggest a role for DAG in anchoring rather than activation of α2-chimaerin. Like other DAG/phorbol ester receptors, including protein kinase C isozymes, α2-chimaerin is subject to autoinhibition by intramolecular contacts, suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for the activation of this Rac-GAP.

Signaling via the small GTPase Rac has been implicated in a wide range of cell processes such as cytoskeleton reorganization, migration, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. Rac is a molecular switch that cycles between GTP-loaded “on” and GDP-loaded “off” states. Tight mechanisms exist to fine-tune Rac responses by controlling the cycling between Rac active and inactive states. In the off state, cytosolic GDP-bound Rac is associated with Rho family-specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) (1.Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In response to an activating signal, such as the stimulation of tyrosine kinase or G protein-coupled receptors, Rac translocates to the plasma membrane where guanine nucleotide exchange factors promote the exchange of GDP for GTP, rendering Rac active. On the other hand, termination of Rac signal is mediated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), 3The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; SH2, Src homology domain 2; PLC, phospholipase C; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdV, adenovirus; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pfu, plaque forming unit.3The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; SH2, Src homology domain 2; PLC, phospholipase C; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdV, adenovirus; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pfu, plaque forming unit. which interact with GTP-bound Rac and accelerate GTP hydrolysis, leading to Rac inactivation (2.Bustelo X.R.

Although the mechanisms by which Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor promote Rac activation have been extensively studied, much less is known about the mechanistic basis of Rac inactivation by Rac-GAPs.The chimaerin family of Rac-GAPs (α1-, α2-, β1-, and β2-chimaerin) gained significant attention in the last years due to their unique regulatory properties, as they represent the only Rac-GAPs regulated directly by the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). Chimaerins have a single C1 domain, a 50-amino acid motif originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes and involved in DAG binding. Chimaerin Rac-GAPs bind DAGs and DAG-mimetics such as phorbol esters in vitro with similar affinities to PKC isozymes, an indication that DAG can signal through pathways independent of PKC (4.Areces L.B.

It is now well established that DAG can also signal through other C1-domain containing proteins, such as protein kinase D isozymes, RasGRPs, and DAG kinases (6.Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Beside the C1 domain and the C-terminal GAP domain with high specificity toward Rac, α2- and β2-chimaerin have a poorly characterized N-terminal region containing a SH2 domain possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. Recent studies established that activation of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors leads to β2-chimaerin activation and translocation to the plasma membrane, a mechanism that depends on DAG generated by phospholipase C (PLC) (7.Siliceo M.

This redistribution places the Rac-GAP in close proximity to activated Rac and serves the purpose of limiting the intensity and duration of Rac activation, arguing for a key role for DAG in the termination of Rac signaling in response to receptor activation.Among the members of the chimaerin family, α2-chimaerin has gained recent attention due to its important roles in development. α2-Chimaerin modulates neuritogenesis and plays a central role in motor circuit formation and growth cone collapse mediated by EphA4 forward signaling (9.Hall C.

Despite this emerging functional information, little is known regarding the mechanisms that lead to α2-chimaerin activation. Although α2-chimaerin may interact with tyrosine kinase receptors via the SH2 domain in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and probably through the C terminus (10.Beg A.A. Sommer J.E.

Moreover, whether receptors coupled to PLC and DAG generation can modulate α2-chimaerin localization and activity is unknown. Addressing this issue would be relevant to define potential cross-talks between DAG and small G-protein signaling and more importantly, it may define a novel DAG effector unrelated to PKC.In this study we report that α2-chimaerin adopts a conformation in which the C1 and Rac-GAP domains are not fully exposed. Using a series of deletions and point mutants we revealed that release of this autoinhibition facilitates the access of C1 domain ligands, which favors the relocalization of α2-chimaerin to the cell periphery to render the Rac-GAP active. Our analysis led to the identification of amino acids that play key roles in stabilizing the inactive conformation of α2-chimaerin. Furthermore, we established for the first time that α2-chimaerin is an effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), suggesting a role for this Rac-GAP in limiting Rac activation in response to physiological stimuli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and GF109203X were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. U73122 was purchased from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-1 and HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfection of plasmids (0.5-1.0 μg) into cells (∼60% confluence) was carried out in 6-well or 60-mm plates using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.α2-Chimaerin Cloning and Plasmid Constructions—Full-length (1.3 kb) human α2-chimaerin was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from SW480 colon cancer cell mRNA using the following primers (XhoI and EcoRI sites are underlined): sense 5′-CTCGAGATGGCCCTGACCCTGTTTGAT; antisense 3′-GAGTTCTTAAAATAAAATGTCTTCGTTTTTGATAAGC). The PCR product was ligated into pCRII using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and the sequence was verified by sequencing analysis. To generate HA- and GFP-tagged constructs EcoRI-EcoRI or XhoI-EcoRI fragments were isolated from pCRII and subcloned into pCEFL-HA or pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), respectively. All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.Generation of α2-Chimaerin Mutants—Single point mutants for α2-chimaerin were generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using pCEFL-HA-α2-chimaerin as a template. The corresponding inserts were isolated and subcloned into XhoI-EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C3.Deletion mutants of α2-chimaerin were generated by PCR from pEGFP-C3 α2-chimaerin. The following primers were used (XhoI and EcoRI sites are underlined): for pEGFP-C3-ΔN-α2-chimaerin, 3′-CTCGAGTATTATGGAAGAGAGTTTCATGGC and 5′-GAGTTCTTAAAATAAAATGTCTTCGTTTTTGATAAGC; for pEGFP-C3-ΔSH2-α2-chimaerin, 3′-CTCGAGGCAGCAGAATACATTGCCAAG and 5′-GAGTTCTTAAAATAAAATGTCTTCGTTTTTGATAAGC; for pEGFP-C3-ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin, 3′-CTCGAGATGGCCCTGACCCTGTTTGAT and 5′-GAATTCGCTTACAGTCATTTGGGAC. PCR products were ligated into pCRII using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen).Generation of Adenoviruses and Infections—To generate adenoviruses (AdVs), XhoI-HindIII inserts of wild-type or the mutant I122A-α2-chimaerin were excised from pCRII and subcloned into the HA epitope-tagged vector pShuttle-CMV-HA (15.Menna P.L. Skilton G. Leskow F.C. Alonso D.F. Gomez D.E. Kazanietz M.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2284-2291PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Statagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For infections, 5 × 105 cells were plated onto 60-mm plates and 2 h before infection incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then infected with the corresponding AdV overnight at different multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). Experiments were carried out 48 h after infection.Translocation Assays—COS-1 cells (2 × 105) in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmids encoding for α2-chimaerin wild-type or mutants, as described above. Twenty-four h after transfection cells were treated with different concentrations of PMA for 20 min. Experiments were performed in the presence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (5 μm), added 30 min before and during PMA stimulation. Cells were harvested into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell and tissue extract, 1:500, Sigma). Separation of cytosolic (soluble) and particulate fractions was performed by ultra-centrifugation as previously described (5.Caloca M.J. Fernandez N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M.

Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunostained with anti-HA (1:2000; Covance, Emeryville, CA), anti-GFP (1:3000; Covance), or anti-PKCα (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) antibodies.Localization Studies and Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated in glass coverslips in 12-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding for the different GFP-fused proteins or infected with AdVs, as described above. After 48 h cells were treated with PMA or EGF and fixed with 100% methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Infected cells were then immunostained with mouse anti-HA primary (1:500; Covance) and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse secondary (0.5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) antibodies. Slides were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Images were viewed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope.Determination of Rac-GTP Levels—Rac-GTP levels were determined using a pull-down assay essentially as described before (16.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 4 μg of GST-PAK1 binding domain, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C, 10 min) and then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (4 °C, 1 h). After extensive washing, the beads were boiled in loading buffer. Samples were run in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (1:3000; Upstate Biotechnology). For experiments using EGF, cells were infected overnight with different AdVs and then serum-starved for 24 h previous to EGF treatment.Wound Assays—HeLa cells (8 × 105) in 35-mm dishes were infected with AdVs for either wild-type or I122A-α2-chimaerin, as described above. After reaching confluence (∼48 h) a wound was made using a p10 pipette tip. Measurements of wound closure were carried out at t = 0 h and t = 24 h. The wound width was measured in three different fields using Adobe Photoshop. Results were expressed as percentage of the width at t = 24 h relative to width at t = 0 h.Modeling Studies—Molecular modeling of α2-chimaerin was performed with the Swiss-Model protein modeling server using β2-chimaerin (1XA6A) as a template. Energy minimizations were done with the GROMOS96 implementation of Deep-View/Swiss-pbdViewer. Figures were made with PyMOL viewer (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA).RESULTSLimited Intracellular Translocation of α2-Chimaerin by PMA—The C1 domain in α- and β-chimaerin isoforms has the typical phorbol ester and DAG binding motif (HX12CX2CXnCX2CX4HX2CX7C, where H is histidine, C is cysteine, X is any other amino acid, and n is 13) and presents all the structural determinants required for ligand binding (4.Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays revealed that chimaerins bind phorbol esters and DAGs with nanomolar binding affinities that are comparable with those of cPKCs and nPKCs (4.Areces L.B. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19553-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Caloca M.J. Fernandez N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As in vitro binding assays are normally carried out under saturated lipid conditions (100% phosphatidylserine vesicles), those assays may not necessarily reflect responses in a cellular environment. To determine whether α2-chimaerin responds to C1 domain ligands in cells, we examined its translocation in response to PMA. To rule out the involvement of PKCs in the phorbol ester response, experiments were carried out in the presence of the pan-PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (5 μm). COS-1 cells ectopically expressing α2-chimaerin were treated with various concentrations of PMA for 20 min and subjected to fractionation into soluble and particulate fractions. Despite having a high affinity phorbol ester binding domain, translocation of α2-chimaerin could only be detected at high PMA concentrations (EC50 > 1 μm, n = 8, Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, PMA caused a significant translocation of PKCα from the soluble to the particulate fraction, as expected. The EC50 for translocation of PKCα was 18 ± 6 nm (n = 3), as revealed by densitometric analysis. The limited translocation of α2-chimaerin in cells was also confirmed by imaging cells using GFP-tagged α2-chimaerin (Fig. 1C). These studies showed that whereas substantial translocation of PKCα to the plasma membrane is observed with 100 nm PMA, translocation of α2-chimaerin could only be observed at a very high PMA concentration (3 μm). A Pro to Ala mutation in position 216 of α2-chimaerin (Pro11 in the C1 domain motif), which reduces ligand affinity by ∼100-fold without affecting the overall tertiary folding of the C1 domain (17.Kazanietz M.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), abolished the limited α2-chimaerin translocation caused by 3 μm PMA (Fig. 1C). No translocation of the P216A-α2-chimaerin mutant was observed up to 10 μm PMA using a fractionation assay (Fig. 1, A and B). Endogenous α2-chimaerin is also poorly translocated by PMA (18.Caloca M.J. Delgado P. Alarcon B. Bustelo X.R. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 758-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas α2-chimaerin is capable of binding phorbol esters via the C1 domain in vitro, its limited sensitivity to PMA in a cellular context suggests an inhibitory mechanism that limits its access to cellular membranes.Deletion of N-terminal, SH2, or GAP Domains Enhances Membrane-associated α2-Chimaerin—The reduced sensitivity of α2-chimaerin to translocation by PMA suggests a limited exposure of the ligand-binding site. We reasoned that deletion of domains either at the N or C termini may overcome a potential hindrance of the C1 domain and therefore enhance α2-chimaerin redistribution to membranes. We generated three mutants, ΔN-α2-chimaerin (deletion in amino acids 1-44), ΔSH2-α2-chimaerin (deletion in amino acids 1-128), and ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin (deletion in amino acids 265-459), and expressed them in COS-1 cells. A schematic representation of the mutants is presented in Fig. 2A. In cells growing in 10% fetal bovine serum, ∼25% of wild-type α2-chimaerin is localized to the particulate fraction. Interestingly, a much larger proportion of the deleted mutants was found in the particulate fraction (Fig. 2, B and C). Translocation of ΔSH2-α2-chimaerin and ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin was detected at concentrations of PMA as low as 10 nm. Although only 38 ± 10% (n = 3) of wild-type α2-chimaerin was found in the particulate fraction in response to 1 μm PMA, a much greater proportion was found for the mutants (83 ± 3%, n = 3, for ΔSH2-α2-chimaerin; 87 ± 8%, n = 3, for ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin). Notably, most of the mutant lacking the first 44 amino acids (ΔN-α2-chimaerin) was found in the particulate fraction both in the absence or presence of PMA (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2PMA-induced translocation of α2-chimaerin is sensitized by deletion of N- or C-terminal regions. A, schematic representation of the constructs used in these experiments. B, COS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP plasmids encoding for GFP-fused wild-type (wt), ΔN-, ΔSH2-, or ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin, and 24 h later treated with increasing concentrations of PMA (10 nm-10 μm) in the presence of the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (5 μm). Cells were then fractionated into soluble and particulate fractions and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody. A densitometric analysis of the immunoreactivity in the particulate fraction in unstimulated cells is shown (n = 3). C, representative experiment showing the effect of PMA on the redistribution of α2-chimaerin (wild-type and mutants). D, densitometric analysis of the immunoreactivity in the soluble fraction after PMA treatment. In B and D, results are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments and expressed as percentage of total protein. **, p < 0.005 compared with cells expressing wild type α2-chimaerin with Student's t test. E, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated pEGFP plasmids, as in B, and 48 h later treated with PMA (100 nm, 20 min). Cells were then fixed and visualized by confocal microscopy. Similar results were observed in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the α2-chimaerin-deleted mutants fused to GFP (Fig. 2E). In the absence of PMA stimulation some peripheral localization was observed for the mutants. As predicted from the fractionation experiments, significant disappearance of cytosolic fluorescence and a corresponding increase in peripheral fluorescence were observed for the deleted mutants in response to 100 nm PMA. This is in clear contrast with the limited translocation observed for the wild-type protein under the same experimental condition (see Fig. 1C). We have also noticed significant perinuclear redistribution, particularly with the N-terminal deleted mutants, which agrees with previous studies for C1 domain-responsive proteins, including PKCs and β2-chimaerin (19.Wang H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20.Maissel A. Marom M. Shtutman M. Shahaf G. Livneh E. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a hindrance of the C1 domain by regions located at either end of the protein. It should be noted that removing only the first 44 amino acids was sufficient to facilitate the exposure of membrane-binding sites in α2-chimaerin.The N-terminal Region Is Essential to Keep α2-Chimaerin in an Inactive State—Next, we examined whether deletion of the N-terminal region in α2-chimaerin affects its activation status. COS-1 cells expressing wild-type or mutated α2-chimaerin proteins were subject to Rac-GTP pull-down assays using a GST-Pak1 binding domain. Assays were optimized at expression levels in which wild-type α2-chimaerin caused only a marginal effect on Rac-GTP levels. Notably, at comparable low levels of expression (Fig. 3A), ΔN-α2-chimaerin and ΔSH2-α2-chimaerin caused a much stronger reduction of Rac-GTP levels than wild-type α2-chimaerin (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, the GAP-deleted mutant (ΔGAP-α2-chimaerin) was inactive. Therefore, deletion of the N-terminal region not only exposes the C1 domain but also renders α2-chimaerin hyperactive. It could be speculated that the N-terminal region of α2-chimaerin serves as an autoinhibitory domain that keeps the molecule in an inactive state in which the Rac-binding site is spatially occluded.FIGURE 3N-terminal deleted α2-chimaerin mutants are hyperactive. A, COS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP vectors encoding for wild-type (wt) α2-chimaerin, deleted α2-chimaerin mutants, or empty vector. After 24 h growing in 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were lysed and subjected to a Rac-GTP pull-down assay. Total Rac and GFP fusion proteins were monitored by Western blot using anti-Rac and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. B, densitometric analysis of Rac-GTP levels, expressed as percentage of control (empty vector-transfected cells). Results are the mean ± S.E. of four individual experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with cells expressing wild type α2-chimaerin (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Modeling Analysis of α2-Chimaerin and Characterization of Inhibitory Amino Acids Involved in Intramolecular Interactions—C1 domains have been reported to exist in exposed and non-exposed conformations (22.Colon-Gonzalez F.

This would also argue for the requirement of a massive conformational change to expose the ligand-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2130307781,"Transitory binding between photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho* or Meta II) and the G protein transducin (Gt-GDP) is the first step in the visual signaling cascade. Light causes photoisomerization of the 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore in rhodopsin (Rho) to all-trans-retinylidene, which induces conformational changes that allow Gt-GDP to dock onto the Rho* surface. GDP then dissociates from Gt, leaving a transient nucleotide-empty Rho*-Gt(e) complex before GTP becomes bound, and Gt-GTP then dissociates from Rho*. Further biochemical advances are required before structural studies of the various Rho*-Gt complexes can be initiated. Here, we describe the isolation of n-dodecyl-beta-maltoside solubilized, stable, functionally active, Rho*-Gt(e), Rho(e)*-Gt(e), and 9-cis-retinal/11-cis-retinal regenerated Rho-Gt(e) complexes by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In these complexes, Rho* spectrally remained in its Meta II state, and Gt(e) retained its ability to interact with GTPgammaS. Removal of all-trans-retinylidene from Rho*-Gt(e) had no effect on the stability of the Rho(e)*-Gt(e) complex. Moreover, opsin in the Rho(e)*-Gt(e) complex with an empty nucleotide-binding pocket in Gt and an empty retinoid-binding pocket in Rho was regenerated up to 75% without complex dissociation. These results indicate that once Rho* couples with Gt, the chromophore plays a minor role in stabilizing this complex. Moreover, in complexes regenerated with 9-cis-retinal/11-cis-retinal, Rho retains a conformation similar to Rho* that is stabilized by Gt(e) apo-protein."
https://openalex.org/W2150891508,"In prion disease, direct interaction between the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and its misfolded disease-associated conformer PrPSc is a crucial, although poorly understood step promoting the formation of nascent PrPSc and prion infectivity. Recently, we hypothesized that three regions of PrP (corresponding to amino acid residues 23–33, 98–110, and 136–158) interacting specifically and robustly with PrPSc, likely represent peptidic components of one flank of the prion replicative interface. In this study, we created epitope-tagged mouse PrPC molecules in which the PrP sequences 23–33, 98–110, and 136–158 were modified. These novel PrP molecules were individually expressed in the prion-infected neuroblastoma cell line (ScN2a) and the conversion of each mutated mouse PrPC substrate to PrPSc compared with that of the epitope-tagged wild-type mouse PrPC. Mutations within PrP 98–110, substituting all 4 wild-type lysine residues with alanine residues, prevented conversion to PrPSc. Furthermore, when residues within PrP 136–140 were collectively scrambled, changed to alanines, or amino acids at positions 136, 137, and 139 individually replaced by alanine, conversion to PrPSc was similarly halted. However, other PrP molecules containing mutations within regions 23–33 and 101–104 were able to readily convert to PrPSc. These results suggest that PrP sequence comprising residues 98–110 and 136–140 not only participates in the specific binding interaction between PrPC and PrPSc, but also in the process leading to conversion of PrPSc-sequestered PrPC into its disease-associated form."

Presentation on the icosahedral hepatitis B virus capsid (HBcAg) is known to strongly enhance immunogenicity of foreign sequences, most efficiently if they are inserted into the dominant c/e1 B cell epitope, a surface-exposed loop in the center of the constituent core protein primary sequence. Even some complete proteins were successfully inserted but others, e.g. the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, impaired formation of capsid-like particles (CLPs). This difference can be rationalized by the requirement for the termini of the insert to fit into the predetermined geometry of the two acceptor sites in the carrier. We reasoned that cleavage of one of the two bonds connecting insert and carrier should relieve these constraints, provided the cleaved protein fragments remain competent to support the particle structure. Indeed, HBcAg CLPs containing a recognition site for tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease in the c/e1 loop remained intact after cleavage, as did CLPs carrying a 65-residue peptide insertion. Most importantly, in situ cleavage of a core-OspA fusion protein by coexpressed TEV protease strongly enhanced CLP formation compared with the uncleaved protein. These data attest to the high structural stability of the HBcAg CLP and they significantly widen its applicability as a carrier for heterologous proteins. This approach should be adaptable to any protein-based particle with surface-exposed yet sequence-internal loops.

Intervirology. 2001; 44: 98-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that even some complete proteins can be inserted into this site, without compromising folding of the insert or the carrier part (27Nassal M. Skamel C. Vogel M. Kratz P.A. Stehle T. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 298: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) yielded, in Escherichia coli, highly fluorescent CLPs that evoked a strong anti-GFP antibody response (28Kratz P.A. Böttcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar); efficient CLP formation and strong, including neutralizing, antibody responses were also achieved with the outer surface protein C (OspC) of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi (29Skamel C.

With the recent exception of the Flock House virus capsid (30Manayani D.J. Thomas D. Dryden K.A. Reddy V. Siladi M.E. Marlett J.M. Rainey G.J. Pique M.E. Scobie H.M. Yeager M. Young J.A. Manchester M. Schneemann A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), HBcAg is the only carrier for which such native whole chain protein display has been accomplished.However, analogous insertion of OspA, another important B. burgdorferi antigen (31Steere A.C. Glickstein L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32Hovius J.W. van Dam A.P. Fikrig E. Trends Parasitol. 2007; 23: 434-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), caused insolubility and prevented CLP formation, unless the insert was flanked by very long connecting linkers (10 and 22 aa on the N and C proximal side, respectively); even then the major products were nonregular multimers (33Nassal M. Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Though they still induced potent, protective anti-OspA antibodies, the extra linker sequences may have an antigenic potential on their own and thus not be desirable for vaccine applications (33Nassal M. Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).This and additional work (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that the structure of the inserted protein is key to CLP formation (Fig. 1): in both GFP (35Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) and OspC (36Kumaran D. Eswaramoorthy S. Luft B.J. Koide S. Dunn J.J. Lawson C.L. Swaminathan S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) the N and C termini are closely juxtaposed, naturally fitting into the acceptor sites in the HBcAg carrier; OspA, by contrast, has an extremely elongated structure with far apart termini (37Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Hence the use of HBcAg as a particulate protein carrier appeared to be inherently restricted to heterologous proteins with compatible structures. Similar constraints apply to insertions into surface-exposed but sequence-internal loops (38Taylor K.M. Lin T. Porta C. Mosser A.G. Giesing H.A. Lomonossoff G.P. Johnson J.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Manayani D.J. Thomas D. Dryden K.A. Reddy V. Siladi M.E. Marlett J.M. Rainey G.J. Pique M.E. Scobie H.M. Yeager M. Young J.A. Manchester M. Schneemann A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) of any protein-based nanoparticle carrier.We reasoned that the steric strain imposed by the two-sided fixation might be overcome if one of the two bonds connecting the insert to the N-terminal (coreN) and C-terminal (coreC) core protein segments were cleaved, provided the intra- and intersubunit interactions in the particle remain intact even if the polypeptide chain is interrupted. As shown below, this was indeed the case. Moreover, the approach was also applicable to core protein fusions carrying a 65-residue heterologous peptide and, most importantly, the entire 256-aa OspA ectodomain, with strongly enhanced CLP formation compared with the contiguous chain coreOspA fusion (33Nassal M. Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hence single-sided protease cleavage of an insertion is a promising novel means of broadening the applicability of HBcAg CLPs, and by inference also other carrier systems, to the display of whole proteins regardless of their three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, cleavage in the c/e1 loop creates new functional groups at the most exposed site of the particle enabling numerous further derivatizations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—All core protein constructs are based on plasmid pET28a2-HBc149H6 (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which carries a synthetic core gene (39Nassal M. Gene. 1988; 66: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) encoding the first 149 aa of the core protein plus a C-terminal His6 tag under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The TEV protease recognition sequence ENLYFQ-G (the dash indicates the scissile bond) was introduced into this and into previously described pET vectors encoding core fusions with the ACID peptide (40O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 41Böttcher B. Vogel M. Ploss M. Nassal M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and OspA (33Nassal M. Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by conventional PCR-mediated mutagenesis, using primers encoding in addition appropriate restriction sites. For co-expression of the TEV protease, the MBP-TEV fusion gene in pRK793 (42Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) encoding the largely autoproteolysis resistant S129V mutant was modified via PCR to remove the MBP part and the C-terminal Arg5 sequence. The PCR product, including a T7 promoter sequence, was used to replace the lysozyme gene in the rare tRNA providing pLysSRARE plasmid (Novagen). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression and Purification—The S129V variant of TEV protease was expressed from plasmid pRK793 essentially as described (42Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The specific activity on c149_TEV_H6 protein as substrate was similar to that of a commercial TEV protease preparation (Invitrogen), as indicated by the comparable amounts of either preparation required to achieve about 50% cleavage in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA as reaction buffer. Core protein derivatives were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Codonplus cells (Stratagene) as previously described (43Vogel M. Diez M. Eisfeld J. Nassal M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5211-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); for TEV protease co-expression, BL21(DE3) cells were instead co-transformed with the pET vector plus the modified pRARE plasmid. In brief, cleared lysates from induced E. coli cultures were subjected to sedimentation in 10-60% sucrose step gradients in a TST41.14 rotor run for 2 h at 20 °C and 41,000 rpm (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); analytical sedimentations (44Nassal M. Leifer I. Wingert I. Dallmeier K. Prinz S. Vorreiter J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13218-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were performed in sucrose mini gradients (1.4 ml; TLS-55 rotor; 45 min 55,000 rpm at 20 °C); fourteen fractions (860 μl each for TST41.14 and 100 μl each for TLS-55 runs) were collected from the top.Material from the center gradient fractions (fr. 7 to 9) was used further, usually without further purification. Western blotting was performed as previously described (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), using mAbs directed against linear epitopes (45Bichko V. Schödel F. Nassal M. Gren E. Berzinsh I. Borisova G. Miska S.

Native agarose gel electrophoresis (NAGE) was performed in 1% agarose gels; proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue (CB) for direct detection, or the gel contents were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and immunologically detected as described (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Succinylation of c149OspA_TEV_H6 Proteins—Gradient-enriched c149OspA_TEV_H6 protein expressed without or with TEV protease was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. 50 μl containing about 50 μg (1 nmol) of the respective proteins were mixed with 200 μl of 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5, plus 50 μg (about 500 nmol) of succinic anhydride in 20 μl of DMSO. After 60 min at room temperature, the reactions were concentrated (Amicon Centricon cartridges, cut-off 10 kDa), diluted with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and concentrated again. This procedure was repeated three times. To the final concentrate (about 100 μl), 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 was added to quench unreacted anhydride, and aliquots of this solution were used for NAGE.Electron Microscopy—Negative staining EM using 2% uranyl acetate was performed as previously described (44Nassal M. Leifer I. Wingert I. Dallmeier K. Prinz S. Vorreiter J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13218-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).RESULTSHBcAg CLPs Remain Intact after Virtually Complete Proteolytic Cleavage in the c/e1 Epitope—To ensure site-specific cleavage, we engineered a TEV protease recognition sequence (ENLYFQ-G (42Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar); dash indicates the scissile bond) flanked by G4T and TG4 linkers between aa 78 and aa 81 of a C-terminally truncated (aa 1-149) core protein with a C-terminal His6 tag (Fig. 1C). When expressed in E. coli (yield about 20 mg per liter of culture), the corresponding protein, c149TEV_H6, sedimented in sucrose gradients (Fig. 2A) into the particle-typical (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) center fractions (fr. 7 to 9 of 14). An aliquot from fraction 9 was incubated with recombinant TEV protease (core protein: protease molar ratio about 5:1), and aliquots were withdrawn over a time course of 20 h to analyze specificity and efficiency of cleavage; unmodified c149_H6 CLPs served as control (Fig. 2B). The band corresponding to the intact 19 kDa c149TEV_H6 protein disappeared nearly completely over 20 h, simultaneously a (not very well resolved) double band appeared in the 10-kDa range of the gel, as expected from cleavage at the desired site (calculated masses of the fragments: 9.9 and 9.1 kDa; for additional immunological evidence see below); complete cleavage was achieved at higher protease:substrate ratios (not shown). The unmodified c149_H6 protein remained completely stable. The reaction products after 20 h of protease treatment were sedimented in a 10-60% sucrose mini gradient (Fig. 2C). The cleavage products peaked in the center fractions (around fr. 7); when mixed with the uncleaved protein, both sedimented into the identical fractions, suggesting the cleaved protein was present as intact CLPs. This was confirmed by native agarose gel electrophoresis (NAGE) where particles with their low diffusion coefficient migrate as more distinct bands than non-multimeric proteins; in 1% agarose gels, mobility of HBV-CLP-sized spherical particles (∼30 nm diameter) is mostly determined by surface charge rather than size (47Serwer P. Khan S.A. Griess G.A. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 698: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cleavage products ran as a single band with slightly but distinctly lower mobility than the uncleaved c149_TEV_H6 CLPs (Fig. 2D), likely due to small changes in surface charge mediated by creation of the new N and C termini at the cleavage site (Fig. 1B), suggesting the bulk of the cleaved protein was still present as distinct CLPs. Intact particles were also detected by negative staining (EM); at this resolution, no significant morphological differences to the uncleaved CLPs were seen (Fig. 2E). The small number of particles in the cleaved versus uncleaved sample correlates with the dilution of the protein during the prior cleavage procedure. Hence essentially complete cleavage of preassembled HBcAg CLPs in the c/e1 loop was fully compatible with maintainance of an intact particle structure.FIGURE 2Protein c149TEV_H6 CLPs remain intact after site-specific cleavage with TEV protease. A, enrichment by preparative sucrose gradient sedimentation. Crude lysate from bacteria-expressing protein c149TEV_H6 was sedimented through a preparative 10-60% sucrose step gradient; 14 fractions of 860 μl each were harvested from the top. Aliquots of 8 μl each were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue (CB) staining; M, marker proteins with their molecular masses (in kDa) indicated on the left. The bulk of protein c149TEV_H6 (arrow) was found in fractions 8 and 9, as is typical for intact CLPs (34Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). B, TEV protease cleavage. CLPs from fraction 9 in A were incubated, at a 5:1 molar ratio of core protein subunits to protease, with TEV protease (apparent molecular mass about 27 kDa). Aliquots withdrawn at the indicated time points were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and CB staining; Ø, sample aliquot before TEV protease addition. Protein c149_H6 CLPs served as control. No change was seen after 20 h of incubation. C-E, cleaved c149TEV_H6 remains particulate. C, sucrose mini gradient sedimentation.

Virol. 2007; 81: 13218-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), collected in 14 100-μl fractions from the top, and 15-μl aliquots of the indicated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and CB staining; uncl, sample of the uncleaved protein. D, NAGE. Aliquots of the indicated proteins before (-TEV) or after 20 h of incubation with the protease (+TEV) were run in 1% agarose gels, and subsequently stained with CB. E, EM, aliquots of protein c149TEV_H6 without TEV protease cleavage (-TEV; from fr. 8 of the gradient in A), or after TEV protease digestion (+TEV; from fr. 7 of the gradient in C) were negatively stained with uranyl acetate.

ACID can adopt a coiled-coil structure with the complementary BASE peptide (40O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) but on its own it is largely disordered (41Böttcher B. Vogel M. Ploss M. Nassal M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein c149ACID-TEV_H6 was also well expressed in E. coli (about 40 mg per liter of culture), sedimented into the particle-typical fraction (Fig. 3A), and was cleaved by TEV protease with similar kinetics as c149_TEV_H6 (Fig. 3B). Due to the extra peptide sequence, the N-terminal cleavage product is now discernably larger than the C-terminal product (16 versus 9.1 kDa), in full accord with the band pattern observed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Sedimentation behavior, including exact cosedimentation with the uncleaved protein when both were mixed (not shown), and mobility during NAGE (again distinctly reduced compared with the uncleaved sample) were also fully compatible with an intact CLP structure (Fig. 3, C and D), and the presence of particles was corroborated by EM (Fig. 3E). Hence the cleavage approach was also applicable to HBcAg carrying a medium-sized heterologous insertion.FIGURE 3Protein c149ACID_TEV_H6 CLPs remain intact after site-specific cleavage with TEV protease.

Protein c149ACID_TEV_H6 samples were treated and analyzed as shown in Fig. 2 for c149_TEV_H6.

Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Into the C-terminal linker of this construct, the TEV recognition sequence was introduced (Fig. 1C). Upon sedimentation of crude bacterial lysates the 48-kDa c149_OspA_TEV-H6 protein, expressed at about 7 mg per liter of bacterial culture, was similarly broadly distributed from fractions 5 to 12 (Fig. 5A, top panel); its identity was confirmed (Fig. 5B, top panel) using the OspA-specific mAb LA-2 (48Schaible U.E.

Upon negative staining EM, material from fraction 8 revealed mostly aggregates, some appearing, by curvature, like incomplete CLPs (Fig. 5, C and D; panels -TEV). In vitro incubation with TEV protease yielded the expected 39-kDa and 9-kDa fragments; however with distinctly slower kinetics than with the previous constructs.

https://openalex.org/W2111491649,"Pax-8 is a transcription factor belonging to the PAX genes superfamily and its crucial role has been proven both in embryo and in the adult organism. Pax-8 activity is regulated via a redoxbased mechanism centered on the glutathionylation of specific cysteines in the N-terminal region (Cys45 and Cys57). These residues belong to a highly evolutionary conserved DNA binding site: the Paired Box (Prd) domain. Crystallographic protein-DNA complexes of the homologues Pax-6 and Pax-5 showed a bipartite Prd domain consisting of two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs separated by an extended linker region. Here, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance, we show for the first time that the HTH motifs are largely defined in the unbound Pax-8 Prd domain. Our findings contrast with previous induced fit models, in which Pax-8 is supposed to largely fold upon DNA binding. Importantly, our data provide the structural basis for the enhanced chemical reactivity of residues Cys45 and Cys57 and explain clinical missense mutations that are not obviously related to the DNA binding interface of the paired box domain. Finally, sequence conservation suggests that our findings could be a general feature of the Pax family transcription factors.

Pax-8 is an important eukaryotic transcription factor that is responsible, during embryogenesis, for the differentiation of several organs such as kidney, thyroid, and neural tube. Pax-8 is also essential in the adult organism, where it activates thyroid hormone production. During development, Pax-8 functionality is regulated by alternative splicing, generating isoforms that exhibit different transactivation properties but maintain unaltered the DNA binding domain (1Kozmik Z.

Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The Pax family shares a bipartite functionality consisting of a N-terminal binding region and a C-terminal transactivation region. The N-terminal region is usually comprised of three domains, namely a Paired Box (Prd) domain, a conserved octapeptide, and a further homeodomain (see Fig. 1). Differences in conservation and functionality in these domains have been used as evolution markers for the Pax family (10Balczarek K.A. Lai Z.C. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which has been subdivided into four groups according to the sequence homology in the N-terminal region. In particular, the N-terminal region of Pax-8 is composed by all three domains but presents an incomplete and inactive homeodomain. The Prd domain consists of a well conserved 128-residue-long region, formed by two distinct subdomains known in literature as PAI (N-terminal) and RED (C-terminal) (11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding studies have demonstrated that the two subdomains of the Pax-8 Prd domain bind DNA independently (12Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), are both required for proper promoter activation (13Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that binding is redox state dependent (14Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tell G. Scaloni A. Pellizzari L. Formisano S. Pucillo C. Damante G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although both subdomains contain cysteine residues, it was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro that PAI subdomain DNA-binding activity depends on a reducing environment, whereas RED subdomain binding activity does not (16Cao X. Kambe F. Lu X. Kobayashi N. Ohmori S. Seo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25901-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, the conserved PAI cysteines (Cys45 and Cys57), which are predicted to be in the DNA binding interface, were shown to be sensitive to oxidation by glutathionylation, whereas reduction by APE1/Ref-1 restores Pax-8 functionality. The structures of three homologues of Pax-8 Prd domain have been characterized using x-ray diffraction techniques, in co-crystallization with their consensus DNA: the Drosophila (17Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), Pax-6 (18Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O.

For all the homologues, both subdomains are folded as helix-turn-helix (HTH) 2The abbreviations used are: HTHhelix-turn-helixPrdpaired boxCDcircular dichroismr.m.s.root mean squareNOEnuclear Overhauser effect. motifs connected by an extended linker region when bound to DNA. The N-terminal subdomain is preceded by an N-terminal β-hairpin that contacts DNA in the minor groove. With the exception of the Drosophila Prd domain, all the Prd homologues contact DNA both with the N- and C-terminal subdomains (12Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L.

Christophe D. Costagliola S. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 4285-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As a resulting phenotype, the thyroid is misplaced, severely reduced in size or totally absent. Most of these mutations are located in the N-terminal subdomain where a splicing variant has also been found (23Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although only one mutation in the RED subdomain (20Macchia P.E. Lapi P. Krude H. Pirro M.T. Missero C. Chiovato L. Souabni A. Baserga M. Tassi V. Pinchera A. Fenzi G. Gruters A. Busslinger M. Di Lauro R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) has been characterized. Mutations in the Pax-8 Prd domain are also associated to Wilms' tumor (1Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dörfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not all the affected residues are part of the predicted DNA binding surface (24Congdon T. Nguyen L.Q.

LeFrancois P. Abramowicz M. Vassart G. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutants could affect folding of the Prd domain. In contrast to the DNA bound state of the Prd domains, the structure of the unbound state is still unknown. Early attempts using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and classical homonuclear NMR approaches suggested that the free Prd domain is largely unstructured (27Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using CD spectroscopy, studies of the structure of the Pax-8 Prd domain under oxidizing and reducing conditions concluded that the free domain has a low α-helical content (≈19% at 277 K) that increases upon DNA binding (13Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the unbound and isolated PAI and RED subdomains also maintain a basal, low α-helical content. In summary, these experiments suggested a lack of secondary and tertiary organization of the free domain in solution. However, the C-terminal subdomain of the Drosophila Prd domain is not bound to the DNA, but is nonetheless structured (18Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes De. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the activity of Cys45 and Cys57 in the free protein, raises questions about the nature of the unbound state and justifies further research. Here, we investigate the unbound state of the Pax-8 Prd domain using high resolution heteronuclear NMR, providing the first detailed characterization of a free Prd domain. Based on NOE and chemical shift data, we show that the two subdomains have a well defined secondary structure and a defined tertiary HTH-fold. Our data indicate that the two subdomains behave as independent “beads” on an otherwise flexible “string.” Our data show that the conserved cysteines in the N-terminal PAI subdomain have reduced pKa values, whereas the RED subdomain cysteine is largely buried, thereby providing a structural basis for the difference in glutathionylation susceptibility of the PAI and RED subdomains. Moreover, our findings help to explain the deleterious effects of mutations involving residues that do not belong to the DNA binding interface. Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence encoding residues 1–146 of the human PAX-8 gene (SwissProt ID Q06710) cloned into a pIVEX2.3 MCS vector (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was a kind donation of Prof. Cao. This construct has been thoroughly described elsewhere (16Cao X. Kambe F. Lu X. Kobayashi N. Ohmori S. Seo H. J. Biol.

The 13C-15N doubly labeled fusion protein was expressed and purified by ASLA Biotech ltd. (Riga, Latvia) using an optimized ad hoc protocol described in the supplemental data.

All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K using a sample containing 0.9 mm U-13C/15N Pax-8 Prd domain in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.2 in 90%, 10% H2O/D2O, supplemented with 10–15 mm d10-dithiothreitol and 0.1% NaN3.

Interproton distance restraints were obtained from 15Nor 13C resolved three-dimensional HSQC-NOESY spectra, both recorded with a mixing time of 100 ms. Further details are described in supplemental data. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid, whose resonance was set to 0.00 ppm whereas 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid, using the absolute frequency ratio (43Wishart D.S.

(2004) The Computer Aided Resonance Tutorial, First Edition, ISBN 3-85600-112-3. was used for spectral analysis. Collection of Conformational Restraints, Structure Calculation, and Refinement—Full backbone assignment of the Pax-8 Prd (residues 11–138 of the 159-amino acid protein construct) could be obtained with the exception of Pro44 and 85% of the nonexchangeable side chain resonances could be assigned. For the full construct residues 1–2 and 153–159 could not be assigned due to unfavorable water exchange or overlap. Chemical shifts values and NOE data for the N- and C-terminal cloning artifacts indicate that they are unstructured and do not interact with the Prd domain. In the following, the discussion will focus only on the Prd domain. NOE cross-peaks from the three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-resolved NOESY spectra were assigned and converted into distance restraints using a homemade script. Dihedral angle restraints for the φ and Ψ angles were derived from N, C′, Cα, Hα, and Cβ chemical shifts using TALOS (45Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The collected restraints were analyzed to remove redundant information and resulted in 1794 distance values, which, together with 123 dihedral angle restraints, formed the experimental data set for the restrained modeling. A trans-conformation was assumed for Pro44, supported by our experimental NOE restraints for the surrounding region. After applying standard pseudoatom corrections (46Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W.

The system was simulated for 10 ns. In the simulation the temperature was kept constant through a simple velocity rescaling procedure, whereas the pressure was controlled through a Berendsen bath (57Berendsen H.J.C.

The volume of the box was fluctuating about 540 nm3 with a standard deviation of less than 0.002 of its value. All structural analyses, in particular r.m.s. deviations, secondary structure, and angular order parameter analyses, have been performed using the program MOLMOL. Cysteine pKa Calculation—pKa values for cysteines were calculated, based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, essentially according to the method of Antosiewicz et al. (58Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A.

The starting structures were a model built by homology with Pax-6 (PDB code 6PAX) as template, and the 20 NMR structures. pKa calculations have been also performed on Pax-5 and Pax-6 structures. Circular Dichroism—The purified Pax-8 Prd domain was used for CD spectroscopy at a concentration of 15 μm using a Jasco J-600 CD/ORD spectropolarimeter interfaced to a computer for data collection.

Spectra are presented in terms of mean residue molecular ellipticity ([θ]; deg cm2 dmol-1), based on a mean residue weight of 110.4 Da. Data Deposition—Chemical shifts have been deposited at the BMRB data base, with access code 15693, whereas the protein coordinates were deposited in the protein data bank (PDB code 2K27). NMR Secondary Structure Identification—The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is a sensitive indicator of the structural and dynamical properties of a protein. The spectrum of free Pax-8-Prd shows a chemical shift dispersion typical of an all α-helical folded protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Secondary structure assessment based on diagnostic sequential and medium-range NOEs and chemical shift deviation from random coil values (60Wang Y. Jardetzky O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14075-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 61Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of six α-helices, consistent with the Prd domain crystal structures described in literature (Fig. 2 and supplemental S2). The helices are named starting from the N-terminal by ordinal numbering. The total helix content of the free Pax-8 Prd amounts to ∼42%. This value is in agreement with control CD experiments (supplemental Fig. S3), which show an α-helical content that, depending on the analysis method adopted, varies from ∼28 to ∼39% (62Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 63Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). CD experimental conditions were the same as those of the NMR with exception of protein and dithiothreitol concentrations. The reduced state of the Prd domain in solution is confirmed by α and β carbon chemical shifts of the conserved cysteines, which are in agreement with the values reported by Sharma and Rajarathnam (64Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Pax-8 Prd Domain Conformation—Analysis of the NOESY cross-peaks resulted in the identification of 76 long range NOEs that reflect crucial interactions within each subdomain and are typical of a tertiary organization (supplemental Fig. S4). The backbone traces of the lowest energy structure and the ensemble of structures of the free Pax-8 Prd domain are shown in Fig. 3. Structural statistics are reported in Table 1. The tertiary organization of the free Pax-8 DNA binding domain shows the characteristics of a canonical Prd domain: two HTH motifs are connected by an unstructured linker region. NOE data and chemical shift differences from random coil values (60Wang Y. Jardetzky O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14075-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) support the random coil nature of the linker (Figs. 2 and supplemental S4). Furthermore, the backbone chemical shifts of the linker are consistent with a highly flexible backbone, according to the random coil index (65Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S5). Additionally, the random coil index indicates a random coil-like structure and high backbone flexibility for the C- and N-terminal regions flanking the two HTH domains. The flexibility and lack of structure of the linker and the absence of NOEs between the two subdomains indicate that the two HTH subdomains are independent “beads on a string” and explain the high global coordinate r.m.s. deviation. The individual N- and C-terminal subdomains have considerably lower pairwise r.m.s. deviations values for both backbone and heavy atoms (∼1.6 and 2.7 Å, respectively) in comparison with the whole Prd domain; these values are consistent with a defined tertiary fold for both subdomains but are somewhat higher than typical for a well defined rigid structure. Closer inspections reveals that, whereas the individual helices are well defined with pairwise r.m.s. deviation of ∼0.6 Å, the interhelical segments and the interhelical angles have considerable lower definition, resulting in an increased r.m.s. deviation. We suggest that the lack of a precise definition of the tertiary structure is a signature of protein dynamics. This is also reflected in the increased random coil index and predicted flexibility for the interhelical segments. Thus, whereas the free domain has a well defined secondary structure and a defined tertiary fold, it is most likely a dynamic structure. Both the PAI and RED subdomains contain three helices consistent with the HTH motif (see Table 2 for an analysis).TABLE 2Inter-helix tilt (degrees) comparisons in helix-turn-helix motifsPax-8Pax-5Pax-6Helix I–II114 ± 14143141Helix I–III108 ± 97877Helix II–III103 ± 18124117Helix IV–V112 ± 7120122Helix IV–VI73 ± 87577Helix V–VI121 ± 6103104 Open table in a new tab Helix I and II in the PAI subdomain pack against each other in an antiparallel arrangement and are almost perpendicular to helix III, which is the DNA recognition helix.

Tasks that allow for automatization typically involve repeated encoding of information that is paired with a constant response. Much remains unknown about the effects of practice on encoding and response selection in an automated task. Methodology To investigate function-specific effects of automatization we employed a variant of a Sternberg task with optimized separation of activity associated with encoding and response selection by means of m-sequences. This optimized randomized event-related design allows for model free measurement of BOLD signals over the course of practice. Brain activity was measured at six consecutive runs of practice and compared to brain activity in a novel task. Principal Findings Prompt reductions were found in the entire cortical network involved in encoding after a single run of practice. Changes in the network associated with response selection were less robust and were present only after the third run of practice. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that automatization causes heterogeneous decreases in brain activity across functional regions that do not strictly track performance improvement. This suggests that cognitive performance is supported by a dynamic allocation of multiple resources in a distributed network. Our findings may bear importance in understanding the role of automatization in complex cognitive performance, as increased encoding efficiency in early stages of practice possibly increases the capacity to otherwise interfering information."
