In Vietnam, small- and medium-scale livestock producers dominate the domestic market and regulatory pushes have done little to decrease antibiotic use. In order to inform future policy directions, this study aims to explore knowledge, attitudes, and practices amongst livestock producers to identify their perspectives on antibiotic use and resistance. A total of 392 small- and medium-scale producers specialized in pig, poultry and aquaculture production participated in the study. The results showed that the primary reason for antibiotic use reported by producers was for the treatment of infections (69%). However, prophylactic use was also evident, with farmers reporting other reasons for antibiotic use such as ""animals display abnormal symptoms or behaviour"" (55%), the ""weather is about to change"" (25%), or ""animals on neighboring farms fall ill"" (27%). Only one-fifth of producers demonstrated favorable attitudes towards antibiotic use and preventing antibiotic resistance. Moreover, administering antibiotics remained the preferred countermeasure directly applied by farmers at the first indication of disease (17%), compared to enacting hygiene (10%) or quarantine (5%) measures. The results showed divergent trends amongst producers, with pig producers demonstrating higher levels of knowledge, more favorable attitudes, and higher self-reported utilization of good practice. Better knowledge, attitudes, and practices were also associated with producers who engaged in efforts to explore information on antibiotic use and resistance, which improved incrementally with the number of sources consulted and hours invested. However, there were some areas where increased knowledge or more favorable attitude scores did not translate into better practices. For instance, producers with higher levels of formal education performed significantly better than those with lower education in terms of knowledge and attitude, though both groups reported similar practices. The findings of this study may support future interventions to prevent both antibiotic misuse and the development of antimicrobial resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2976365388,"Recent data suggested a causative role of uric acid (UA) in the development of renal disease, in which endothelial dysfunction is regarded as the key mechanism. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and shedding of the glycocalyx are early changes of endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether UA induced EndoMT in HUVECs and an animal model of hyperuricemia fed with 2% oxonic acid for 4 wk. UA induced EndoMT in HUVECs with a generation of reactive oxygen species via the activation of membranous NADPH oxidase (from 15 min) and mitochondria (from 6 h) along with glycocalyx shedding (from 6 h), which were blocked by probenecid. GM6001, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, alleviated UA-induced glycocalyx shedding and EndoMT. Antioxidants including N-acetyl cysteine, apocynin, and mitotempo ameliorated EndoMT; however, they did not change glycocalyx shedding in HUVECs. In the kidney of hyperuricemic rats, endothelial staining in peritubular capillaries (PTCs) was substantially decreased with a de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin in PTCs. Plasma level of syndecan-1 was increased in hyperuricemic rats, which was ameliorated by allopurinol. UA caused a phenotypic transition of endothelial cells via induction of oxidative stress with glycocalyx shedding, which could be one of the mechanisms of UA-induced endothelial dysfunction and kidney disease.-Ko, J., Kang, H.-J., Kim, D.-A., Kim, M.-J., Ryu, E.-S., Lee, S., Ryu, J.-H., Roncal, C., Johnson, R.

https://openalex.org/W2975722194,"Background The emergence of multidrug-resistance (MDR), production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and carbapenemase in members of fermentative gram-negative bacilli are a serious threat to public health. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the burden of multi-drug resistance, the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), and carbapenemase in fermentative Gram-negative bacilli in Ethiopian Public Health Institute. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2017 to June 2018. Different clinical samples were collected, inoculated, and incubated according to standard protocols related to each sample. Bacterial identification was performed by using the VITEKR 2 compact system using the GNR card. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Production of ESBL and carbapenemase were confirmed by combination disc and modified Hodge Test method respectively. Results A total of 238 fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were recovered during the study period, among which E.coli were the predominant isolates followed by K. pneumoniae. The highest percentage of antibiotic resistance was noted against ampicillin (100%) followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.9%). The isolates showed better sensitivity towards carbapenem drugs. Out of 238 isolates, 94.5% were MDR and of which 8.8% and 0.8% were extensively and pan drug resistant, respectively. Nearly 67% and 2% of isolates were producers of ESBL and carbapenemase, respectively. The isolation rates of MDR, ESBL, and carbapenemase producing stains of the isolates were ≥70% in intensive care unit while the isolation rates in other wards were ≤25%. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed that the burden of MDR and ESBL was high and carbapenemase producing isolates were also identified which is concerning. This situation warrants a consistent surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of fermentative Gram-negative bacilli and implementation of an efficient infection control program."
https://openalex.org/W2976532919,"The evidence that exposure to ozone air pollution causes acute cardiovascular effects is mixed. We postulated that exposure to ambient levels of ozone would increase blood markers of systemic inflammation, prothrombotic state, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction in healthy older subjects, and that absence of the glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene would confer increased susceptibility. This double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 87 healthy volunteers 55–70 years of age was conducted at three sites using a common protocol. Subjects were exposed for 3 h in random order to 0 parts per billion (ppb) (filtered air), 70 ppb, and 120 ppb ozone, alternating 15 min of moderate exercise and rest. Blood was obtained the day before, approximately 4 h after, and approximately 22 h after each exposure. Linear mixed effect and logistic regression models evaluated the impact of exposure to ozone on pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes. The definition of statistical significance was p<0.01. There were no effects of ozone on the three primary markers of systemic inflammation and a prothrombotic state: C-reactive protein, monocyte-platelet conjugates, and microparticle-associated tissue factor activity. However, among the secondary endpoints, endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, increased from pre- to post-exposure with ozone concentration (120 vs 0 ppb: 0.07 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.14; 70 vs 0 ppb: -0.03 pg/mL, CI -0.09, 0.04; p = 0.008). Nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidative and nitrosative stress, decreased with increasing ozone concentrations, with marginal significance (120 vs 0 ppb: -41.5, CI -70.1, -12.8; 70 vs 0 ppb: -14.2, CI -42.7, 14.2; p = 0.017). GSTM1 status did not modify the effect of ozone exposure on any of the outcomes. These findings from healthy older adults fail to identify any mechanistic basis for the epidemiologically described cardiovascular effects of exposure to ozone. The findings, however, may not be applicable to adults with cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2976125294,"Stormwater biofilters are used to attenuate the flow and volume of runoff and reduce pollutant loading to aquatic systems. However, the capacity of biofilters to remove microbial contaminants remains inadequate. While biochar has demonstrated promise as an amendment to improve microbial removal in laboratory-scale biofilters, it is uncertain if the results are generalizable to the field. To assess biochar performance in a simulated field setting, sand and biochar-amended sand biofilters were periodically dosed with natural stormwater over a 61-week conditioning phase. Impact of media saturation was assessed by maintaining biofilters with and without a saturated zone. Biochar-amended biofilters demonstrated improved Escherichia coli removal over sand biofilters during the first 31 weeks of conditioning though media type did not impact E. coli removal during the last 30 weeks of conditioning. Presence of a saturated zone was not a significant factor influencing E. coli removal across the entire conditioning phase. Following conditioning, biofilters underwent challenge tests using stormwater spiked with wastewater to assess their capacity to remove wastewater-derived E. coli, enterococci, and male-specific (F+) coliphage. In challenge tests, biochar-amended biofilters demonstrated enhanced removal of all fecal indicators relative to sand biofilters. Additionally, saturated biofilters demonstrated greater removal of fecal indicators than unsaturated biofilters for both media types. Discrepant conclusions from the conditioning phase and challenge tests may be due to variable influent chemistry, dissimilar transport of E. coli indigenous to stormwater and those indigenous to wastewater, and differences in E. coli removal mechanisms between tests. Mobilization tests conducted following challenge tests showed minimal (<2.5%) observable mobilization of fecal indicators, regardless of media type and presence of a saturated zone. While our results emphasize the challenge of translating biochar’s performance from the laboratory to the field, findings of this study inform biofilter design to remove microbial contaminants from urban stormwater."
https://openalex.org/W2975721919,"Recently, high-resolution magnetometry surveys have led to the discovery of a special category of buildings-so-called 'mega-structures'-situated in highly visible positions in the public space of Tripolye giant-settlements of the late 5th and first half of the 4th millennium BCE. In this paper we explore what these buildings actually are and how they can contribute to the understanding of the development of social space in Tripolye giant-settlements. For this investigation, we linked newly obtained excavation data from the giant-settlement Maidanetske, Ukraine, with a much larger sample of such buildings from magnetic plans obtained in the region between the Carpathian foothills and the Dnieper River. Accordingly, Tripolye mega-structures represent a particular kind of integrative building documented in many non-ranked ethnographic contexts. Based on our results we are interpreting that these buildings were used for various ritual and non-ritual activities, joint decision-making, and the storage and consumption of surplus. In Tripolye giant-settlements at least three different categories of mega-structures could be identified which most likely represent different levels of socio-political integration and decision-making. The emergence of this hierarchical system of high-level integrative buildings for the whole community and different low-level integrative architectures for certain segments of local communities was related to the rise of Tripolye mega-sites. The presence of different integrative levels most likely reflects the fusion of different previously independent communities in the giant-settlements. Later in the mega-site development, we observe how low-level integrative buildings increasingly lose their importance indicated by shrinking size and, finally, their disappearance. This observation might indicate that the power which was previously distributed across the community was transferred to a central institution. It is argued that the non-acceptance of this concentration of power and the decline of lower decision-making levels might be a crucial factor for the disintegration of Tripolye giant-settlements around 3600 BCE."
https://openalex.org/W2975168441,"Nitrogen (N) is an important element required for plant growth and development, which also affects plant yield and quality. Autophagy, a conserved pathway in eukaryotes, degrades and recycles cellular components, thus playing an important role in N remobilization. However, only a few autophagy genes related to N remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) have been reported. Here, we identified a core autophagy gene in rice, OsATG8b, with increased expression levels under N starvation conditions. It was investigated the function of OsATG8b by generating three independent homozygous 35S-OsATG8b transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines. The overexpression of OsATG8b significantly enhanced autophagic flux in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. It was also showed that over-expressing OsATG8b promoted growth and development of Arabidopsis, in which the rosette leaves were larger than those of the wild type (WT), and the yield increased significantly by 25.25%. In addition, the transgenic lines accumulated more N in seeds than in the rosette leaves. Further examination revealed that overexpression of OsATG8b could effectively alleviate the growth inhibition of transgenic Arabidopsis under nitrogen (N) stress. N partitioning studies revealed that nitrogen-harvest index (NHI) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were significantly increased in the transgenic Arabidopsis, as well as the 15N-tracer experiments revealing that the remobilization of N to seeds in the OsATG8b-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis was high and more than WT. Based on our findings, we consider OsATG8b to be a great candidate gene to increase NUE and yield, especially under suboptimal field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2975289988,"Objective A clinical decision support system (CDSS) for empirical antibiotic treatment has the potential to increase appropriate antibiotic use. Before using such a system on a broad scale, it needs to be tailored to the users preferred way of working. We have developed a CDSS for empirical antibiotic treatment in hospitalized adult patients. Here we determined in a usability study if the developed CDSS needed changes. Methods Four prespecified patient cases, based on real life clinical scenarios, were evaluated by 8 medical residents in the study. The “think-aloud” method was used, and sessions were recorded and analyzed afterwards. Usability was assessed by 3 evaluators using an augmented classification scheme, which combines the User Action Framework with severity rating of the usability problems and the assessment of the potential impact of these problems on the final task outcomes. Results In total 51 usability problems were identified, which could be grouped into 29 different categories. Most (n = 17/29) of the usability problems were cosmetic problems or minor problems. Eighteen (out of 29) of the usability categories could have an ordering error as a result. Classification of the problems showed that some of the problems would get a low priority based on their severity rating, but got a high priority for their impact on the task outcome. This effectively provided information to prioritize system redesign efforts. Conclusion Usability studies improve lay-out and functionality of a CDSS for empirical antibiotic treatment, even after development by a multidisciplinary system."
https://openalex.org/W2976705539,"The concentrations of the bioactive compounds in potato tubers are determined by both genetic potential and environmental factors. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the influence of organic and integrated production on the expression of the genetic potential with respect to the antioxidant properties of potato tubers and to evaluate its stability under different environmental conditions. This phenotyping was performed on seven new breeding lines (tetraploid clones) and three modern cultivars: Jelly, Satina and Tajfun. The results indicated that production system and location significantly influenced the antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP method. Organic farming and the location Chwałowice were characterized by higher values. Furthermore, anitioxidative capacity measured by FRAP method was correlated with chlorogenic acid content (r = 0.590**) and glutathione fractions, especially with the reduced form (GSH, r = 0.692**). Multidimensional comparative analysis (MCA) proved a better development of antioxidant properties of potato tubers in the organic cultivation system when compared with the integrated. Especially favorable were growing conditions at Boguchwała (organic) and worst at Młochów (integrated). From all investigated varieties, the best antioxidant properties were found in ‘Satina’ and ‘Jelly’. Clones TG-97-403 and 13-VIII-45 developed the weakest health promoting traits."
https://openalex.org/W2976878681,"Abstract The role of RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and its association with misfolded protein expression in cancer cells are unclear. Herein we report that PKR regulates misfolded protein clearance by preventing it release through exosomes and promoting lysosomal degradation of misfolded prion proteins in cancer cells. We demonstrated that PKR contributes to the lysosome function and regulates misfolded prion protein clearance. We hypothesized that PKR-associated lysosome function is critical for cancer but not normal cell survival, representing an effective approach for highly targeted cancer therapy. In screening a compound library, we identified two PKR-associated compounds 1 and 2 (Pac 1 and 2) did not affect normal cells but selectively induced cell death in cancer cells depending on their PKR expression status. Pac 1 significantly inhibited the growth of human lung and breast xenograft tumors in mice with no toxicity. Pac 1 binds to PI4K2A and disrupts the PKR/PI4K2A-associated lysosome complex, contributing to destabilization of cancer cell lysosomes and triggering cell death. We observed that PKR and PI4K2A play significant prognostic roles in breast cancer patients. These results demonstrate that targeting of a PI4K2A/PKR lysosome complex may be an effective approach for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2977164550,"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and blue whales (B. musculus) are the two largest species on Earth and are widely distributed across the world's oceans. Hybrids between these species appear to be relatively widespread and have been reported in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific; they are also relatively common, and have been proposed to occur once in every thousand fin whales. However, despite known hybridization, fin and blue whales are not sibling species. Rather, the closest living relative of fin whales are humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). To improve the quality of fin whale data available for analysis, we assembled and annotated a fin whale nuclear genome using in-silico mate pair libraries and previously published short-read data. Using this assembly and genomic data from a humpback, blue, and bowhead whale, we investigated whether signatures of introgression between the fin and blue whale could be found. We find no signatures of contemporary admixture in the fin and blue whale genomes, although our analyses support ancestral gene flow between the species until 2.4-1.3 Ma. We propose the following explanations for our findings; i) fin/blue whale hybridization does not occur in the populations our samples originate from, ii) contemporary hybrids are a recent phenomenon and the genetic consequences have yet to become widespread across populations, or iii) fin/blue whale hybrids are under large negative selection, preventing them from backcrossing and contributing to the parental gene pools."
https://openalex.org/W2976361257,"Swine influenza virus (SIVs) infections cause a significant economic impact to the pork industry. Moreover, pigs may act as mixing vessel favoring genome reassortment of diverse influenza viruses. Such an example is the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus that appeared in 2009, harboring a combination of gene segments from avian, pig and human lineages, which rapidly reached pandemic proportions. In order to confront and prevent these possible emergences as well as antigenic drift phenomena, vaccination remains of vital importance. The present work aimed to evaluate a new DNA influenza vaccine based on distinct conserved HA-peptides fused with flagellin and applied together with Diluvac Forte as adjuvant using a needle-free device (IntraDermal Application of Liquids, IDAL®). Two experimental pig studies were performed to test DNA-vaccine efficacy against SIVs in pigs. In the first experiment, SIV-seronegative pigs were vaccinated with VC4-flagellin DNA and intranasally challenged with a pH1N1. In the second study, VC4-flagellin DNA vaccine was employed in SIV-seropositive animals and challenged intranasally with an H3N2 SIV-isolate. Both experiments demonstrated a reduction in the viral shedding after challenge, suggesting vaccine efficacy against both the H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes. In addition, the results proved that maternally derived antibodies (MDA) did not constitute an obstacle to the vaccine approach used. Moreover, elevated titers in antibodies both against H1 and H3 proteins in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) was detected in the vaccinated animals along with a markedly increased mucosal IgA response. Additionally, vaccinated animals developed stronger neutralizing antibodies in BALFs and higher inhibiting hemagglutination titers in sera against both the pH1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses compared to unvaccinated, challenged-pigs. It is proposed that the described DNA-vaccine formulation could potentially be used as a multivalent vaccine against SIV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2976596414,"Connexin (Cx) gap junction channels comprise two hemichannels in neighboring cells, and their permeability is well-described, but permeabilities of the single Cx hemichannel remain largely unresolved. Moreover, determination of isoform-specific Cx hemichannel permeability is challenging because of concurrent expression of other channels with similar permeability profiles and inhibitor sensitivities. The mammalian Cx hemichannels Cx30 and Cx43 are gated by extracellular divalent cations, removal of which promotes fluorescent dye uptake in both channels but atomic ion conductance only through Cx30. To determine the molecular determinants of this difference, here we employed chimeras and mutagenesis of predicted pore-lining residues in Cx43. We expressed the mutated channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes to avoid background activity of alternative channels. Oocytes expressing a Cx43 hemichannel chimera containing the N terminus or the first extracellular loop from Cx30 displayed ethidium uptake and, unlike WT Cx43, ion conduction, an observation further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Additional C-terminal truncation of the chimeric Cx43 hemichannel elicited an even greater ion conductance with a magnitude closer to that of Cx30. The inhibitory profile for the connexin hemichannels depended on the permeant, with conventional connexin hemichannel inhibitors having a higher potency toward the ion conductance pathway than toward fluorescent dye uptake. Our results demonstrate a permeant-dependent, isoform-specific inhibition of connexin hemichannels. They further reveal that the outer segments of the pore-lining region, including the N terminus and the first extracellular loop, together with the C terminus preclude ion conductance of the open Cx43 hemichannel.

With all three segments of the predicted pore-lining region potentially being involved in pore selectivity, this structural rearrangement may alter the channel permeability between a given connexin-based gap junction and its hemichannel and thus provide these two channel configurations with distinct permeability profiles.

Once open, these channels display distinct selectivity to fluorescent dye versus atomic ions (current) with Cx26 promoting membrane currents and little, if any, ethidium uptake, Cx30 promoting membrane current and ethidium uptake, and Cx43 promoting ethidium uptake but no membrane current (at physiological membrane potentials) (11Nielsen B.S.

To resolve the molecular determinants underlying the ability of Cx43 hemichannels to discriminate between atomic ions and a fluorescent dye in its permeation pathway, we expressed different connexin isoforms, as well as chimeras and point mutants thereof, in isolation in Xenopus oocytes. The biophysical characterization, aided by molecular dynamics simulations, of these constructs pointed to the outer sections of the predicted pore-lining region of the hemichannel configuration, namely the N terminus and the extracellular loop 1, as the molecular determinants preventing Cx43 hemichannel-mediated membrane conductance. To determine the molecular determinants underlying the ability of Cx43 to discriminate between atomic ions and ethidium, we created a homology model of Cx43 based on the high-resolution structure of Cx26, presumably in its gap junctional configuration (12Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E. Oshima A. Fujiyoshi Y. Tsukihara T. Structure of the connexin 26 gap junction channel at 3.5 Å resolution.Nature. 2009; 458 (19340074): 597-60210.1038/nature07869Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). With this model, Cx43 pore-lining residues could be identified and aligned with the equivalent region in Cx26 and Cx30 (see Fig. 1B). Those amino acids that differed between Cx43 and the ion-conducting Cx26 and Cx30 isoforms were subsequently replaced by site-directed mutagenesis with the amino acid found at the equivalent site in Cx30 (illustrated in Fig. 2A). To reveal if single amino acid chains could be decisive for hemichannel-mediated conductance, the membrane current and ethidium uptake of uninjected and Cx-expressing Xenopus oocytes were determined in control solution (frog Ringer's solution, containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+), in divalent cation-free solution (DCFS), and in DCFS containing the connexin hemichannel inhibitor gadolinium (Gd3+). Cx30 hemichannel-mediated membrane current has a low Ca2+ sensitivity, and the 1 mm Ca2+ in the standard frog Ringer does not suffice to fully block the hemichannel activity, hence the elevated control current in oocytes expressing this isoform (30Hansen D.B. Braunstein T.H. Nielsen M.S. MacAulay N. Distinct permeation profiles of the connexin 30 and 43 hemichannels.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588 (24503060): 1446-145710.1016/j.febslet.2014.01.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Nielsen B.S.

Of the 11 mutated Cx43 constructs individually expressed in oocytes, none displayed the DCFS-induced membrane conductance observed in Cx30-expressing oocytes (Fig. 2, B and C) and thus behaved similarly to uninjected and WT Cx43–expressing oocytes. A subset of the mutant Cx43 hemichannels (A6T, K13G, L35M, G38V, and R53V) displayed DCFS-mediated ethidium uptake comparable with the Cx30- and Cx43-expressing oocytes, whereas the remainder of the mutant constructs (and the uninjected oocytes) displayed no DCFS-induced ethidium uptake (Fig. 2D). Verification of plasma membrane expression of the mutated Cx43 hemichannels was conducted with surface biotinylation of oocytes expressing these constructs followed by Western blotting (Fig. 2E). Our results indicate that no single amino acid in the Cx43 hemichannel pore acts as a determinant of hemichannel conductance. Because single amino acid substitutions in the pore-lining region of Cx43 failed to confer ion conductivity to Cx43 hemichannels, we created a chimeric Cx43, in which the entire predicted pore-lining region (consisting of the N terminus, the first transmembrane segment, and the first extracellular loop (12Maeda S. Nakagawa S. Suga M. Yamashita E. Oshima A. Fujiyoshi Y. Tsukihara T. Structure of the connexin 26 gap junction channel at 3.5 Å resolution.Nature. 2009; 458 (19340074): 597-60210.1038/nature07869Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar)) of Cx43 was exchanged with that of the ion-conducting Cx30 (Cx4330; illustrated in Fig. 3A). Surface biotinylation of oocytes expressing the chimeric Cx4330 showed proper expression and translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, bottom right corner). Despite abundant Cx4330 membrane expression, Cx4330-expressing oocytes displayed no DCFS-induced membrane conductance or ethidium uptake (Fig. 3, B–D). These data illustrate that incorporation of the entire predicted pore-lining region of Cx30 into Cx43 produced a nonfunctional hemichannel. We therefore, instead, exchanged single sections of the predicted pore-lining region in Cx43 with that of Cx30: the N terminus (Cx4330NT), the transmembrane domain 1 (Cx4330TM1), or the extracellular loop 1 (Cx4330E1), illustrated in Fig. 4A. Expression and translocation of these chimeras to the oocyte plasma membrane were verified by surface biotinylation and Western blotting (Fig. 4A, bottom right corner). Replacement of the N terminus (Cx4330NT) or the extracellular loop (Cx4330E1) with that of Cx30 yielded small, but detectable, DCFS-activated conductance in oocytes expressing these constructs (Fig. 4, B and C). The membrane conductance was paralleled by DCFS-induced ethidium uptake similar to that of the Cx30- and Cx43-expressing oocytes (Fig. 4D). Oocytes expressing the chimeric version of Cx43 with the first transmembrane domain replaced with that from Cx30 (Cx4330TM1) did not demonstrate DCFS-induced membrane conductance or ethidium uptake (Fig. 4, B–D). These results suggest that the outer sections of the predicted pore-lining region of Cx43, the N terminus and the extracellular loop 1, are crucial structures for the ability of Cx43 to selectively discriminate between atomic ions and ethidium in its permeation pathway.Figure 4Cx43 chimeras containing the N terminus or the extracellular loop 1 of the Cx30 display DCFS-activated membrane currents.

https://openalex.org/W2976680862,"Background Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of macrophages using the translocator protein (TSPO) tracer (R)-[11C]PK11195 has shown the promise to image rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To further improve TSPO PET for RA imaging, second generation TSPO tracers [11C]DPA-713 and [18F]DPA-714 have recently been evaluated pre-clinically showing better imaging characteristics. Objective A clinical proof of concept study to evaluate [11C]DPA-713 and [18F]DPA-714 to visualize arthritis in RA patients. Methods RA patients (n = 13) with at least two active hand joints were included. PET/CT scans of the hands were obtained after injection of [18F]DPA-714, [11C]DPA-713 and/or (R)-[11C]PK11195 (max. 2 tracers pp). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) and target-to-background (T/B) ratios were determined. Imaging data of the 3 different tracers were compared by pooled post-hoc testing, and by a head to head comparison. Results Clinically active arthritis was present in 110 hand joints (2–17 pp). Arthritic joints were visualized with both [11C]DPA-713 and [18F]DPA-714. Visual tracer uptake corresponded with clinical signs of arthritis in 80% of the joints. Mean absolute uptake in PET-positive joints was significantly higher for [11C]DPA-713 than for [18F]DPA-714, the latter being not significantly different from (R)-[11C]PK11195 uptake. Background uptake was lower for both DPA tracers compared with that of (R)-[11C]PK11195. Higher absolute uptake and lower background resulted in two-fold higher T/B ratios for [11C]DPA-713. Conclusions [11C]DPA-713 and [18F]DPA-714 visualize arthritic joints in active RA patients and most optimal arthritis imaging results were obtained for [11C]DPA-713. Second generation TSPO macrophage PET provides new opportunities for both early diagnosis and therapy monitoring of RA."
https://openalex.org/W2975198798,"Heme is an essential molecule synthetized through a broadly conserved 8-step route that has been lost in trypanosomatid parasites. Interestingly, Leishmania reacquired by horizontal gene transfer from γ-proteobacteria the genes coding for the last 3 enzymes of the pathway. Here we show that intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania major can scavenge heme precursors from the host cell to fulfill their heme requirements, demonstrating the functionality of this partial pathway. To dissect its role throughout the L. major life cycle, the significance of L. major ferrochelatase (LmFeCH), the terminal enzyme of the route, was evaluated. LmFeCH expression in a heterologous system demonstrated its activity. Knockout promastigotes lacking lmfech were not able to use the ferrochelatase substrate protoporphyrin IX as a source of heme. In vivo infection of Phlebotomus perniciosus with knockout promastigotes shows that LmFeCH is not required for their development in the sandfly. In contrast, the replication of intracellular amastigotes was hampered in vitro by the deletion of lmfech. However, LmFeCH-/- parasites produced disease in a cutaneous leishmaniasis murine model in a similar way as control parasites. Therefore, although L. major can synthesize de novo heme from macrophage precursors, this activity is dispensable being an unsuited target for leishmaniasis treatment.-Orrego, L.

https://openalex.org/W2975937522,"Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis provides information on the evolutionary aspects of populations. Recently, haplotype blocks have been used to increase the power of quantitative trait loci detection in genome-wide association studies and the prediction accuracy of genomic selection. Our objectives were as follows: to compare the degree of LD, LD decay, and LD decay extent in popcorn populations; to characterize the number and length of haplotype blocks in the populations; and to determine whether maize chromosomes also have a pattern of interspaced regions of high and low rates of recombination. We used a biparental population, a synthetic, and a breeding population, genotyped for approximately 75,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The sample size ranged from 190 to 192 plants. For the whole-genome LD and haplotype block analyses, we assumed a window of 500 kb. To characterize the block and step patterns of LD in the populations, we constructed LD maps by chromosome, defining a cold spot as a chromosome segment including SNPs with the same LDU position. The LD and haplotype block analyses were also performed at the intragenic level, selecting 12 genes related to zein, starch, cellulose, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The populations with the higher and lower frequencies of |D'| values greater than 0.75 were the biparental (65–74%) and the breeding population (26–58%), respectively. There were slight differences between the populations regarding the average distance for SNPs with |D'| values greater than 0.75 (in the range of approximately 207 to 229 kb). The level of LD expressed by the r2 values was low in the populations (0.02, 0.04, and 0.04, on average) but comparable to some non-isolated human populations. The frequency of r2 values greater than 0.75 was lower in the biparental population (0.2–0.5%) and higher in the other populations (0.2–1.6%). The average distance for SNPs with r2 values greater than 0.75 was much higher in the biparental population (approximately 80 to 126 kb). In the other populations, the ranges were approximately 6 to 19 and 6 to 35 kb. The heatmaps for the regions covered by the first 100 SNPs in each chromosome, in each population (1 to 3.3 Mb, approximately), provided evidence that the comparatively few high r2 values (close to 1.0) occurred only for SNPs in close proximity, especially in the synthetic and breeding populations. Due to the reduced number of SNPs in the haplotype blocks (2 to 3) in the populations, it is not expected advantage of a haplotype-based association study as well as genomic selection along generations. The results concerning LD decay (rapid decay after 5–10 kb) and LD decay extent (along up to 300 kb) are in the range observed with maize inbred line panels. The LD maps indicate that maize chromosomes had a pattern of regions of extensive LD interspaced with regions of low LD. However, our simulated LD map provides evidence that this pattern can reflect regions with differences in allele frequencies and LD levels (expressed by |D'|) and not regions with high and low rates of recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2977206255,"Trade involving elasmobranch products in Bangladesh is a four-decade-long practice in large scale and there is little understanding of its impact on species composition, population, and subsequent conservation. Capacity for monitoring and identification is lacking in landing and shark processing centres. A rapid survey and collection of tissue samples were performed in three landings and nine shark processing centres between 2016 and 2017 in the south-eastern coastal region of Bangladesh. Sequencing for a 707-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was used to assess the taxonomic status and species composition from 71 elasmobranch tissue samples collected from the shark processing centre only. Good quality COI sequences were obtained for 34 specimens representing 21 species—the majority of which are threatened with extinction. A total of ten species of sharks (Carcharhinus brevipinna, C. amboinensis, C. leucas, C. sorrah, C. amblyrhynchoides, Chiloscyllium burmensis, Galeocerdo cuvier, Rhincodon typus, Scoliodon laticaudus, and Sphyrna lewini), eleven species of rays (Aetomylaeus maculatus, Gymnura poecilura, Mobula mobular, M. kuhlii, Neotrygon indica, Pateobatis uarnacoides, Rhinoptera javanica, and R. jayakari), including three species of guitarfish (Glaucostegus granulatus, G. obtusus, and G. typus), were identified. Four species (14.7% of samples) were found to be listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Appendix II. Sixteen species (59% of the specimens) were threatened with extinction according to IUCN Red List, whereas 41% were data deficient or not assessed. The results have important implications for the management of regional fisheries and the conservation of elasmobranchs as they 1) represent a preliminary understanding of elasmobranch diversity in trade; 2) depict a lack of awareness and monitoring; and 3) demonstrate a need for urgent monitoring and regulation of elasmobranch trade in Bangladesh."

Besides their role in N-reductive drug metabolism, only little is known about their physiological functions. In this study, we characterized an existing KO mouse model lacking the functional MARC2 gene and fed a high-fat diet and also performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to characterize reductase activity toward known MARC substrates. MARC2 KO significantly decreased reductase activity toward several N-oxygenated substrates, and for typical MARC substrates, only small residual reductive activity was still detectable in MARC2 KO mice. The residual detected reductase activity in MARC2 KO mice could be explained by MARC1 expression that was hardly unaffected by KO, and we found no evidence of significant activity of other reductase enzymes. These results clearly indicate that MARC2 is mainly responsible for N-reductive biotransformation in mice. Striking phenotypical features of MARC2 KO mice were lower body weight, increased body temperature, decreased levels of total cholesterol, and increased glucose levels, supporting previous findings that MARC2 affects energy pathways. Of note, the MARC2 KO mice were resistant to high-fat diet–induced obesity.

Although, there is substantial interest in mass production of S. icipe for human food and animal feed, no information exists on the impact of temperature on their bionomics. Temperature-dependent development, survival, reproductive and life table parameters of S. icipe was generated and integrated into advanced Insect Life Cycle Modeling software to describe relative S. icipe population increase and spatial spread based on nine constant temperature conditions. We examined model predictions and implications for S. icipe potential distribution in Africa under current and future climate. These regions where entomophagy is widely practiced have distinctly different climates. Our results showed that S. icipe eggs were unable to hatch at 10 and 40°C, while emerged nymphs failed to complete development at 15°C. The developmental time of S. icipe was observed to decrease with increased in temperature. The lowest developmental threshold temperatures estimated using linear regressions was 14.3, 12.67 and 19.12°C and the thermal constants for development were 185.2, 1111.1- and 40.7-degree days (DD) for egg, nymph and pre-adult stages, respectively. The highest total fecundity (3416 individuals/female/generation), intrinsic rate of natural increase (0.075 days), net reproductive rate (1330.8 female/female/generation) and shortest doubling time (9.2 days) was recorded at 30°C. The regions predicted to be suitable by the model suggest that S. icipe is tolerant to a wider range of climatic conditions. Our findings provide for the first-time important information on the impact of temperature on the biology, establishment and spread of S. icipe across the Africa continent. The prospect of edible S. icipe production to become a new sector in food and feed industry is discussed."

We sought to identify risk factors for unsuccessful treatment outcomes in children with drug-susceptible tuberculosis identified in eight hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan.We conducted a retrospective cohort study among children (<15 years old) treated with first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs for presumed or confirmed drug-susceptible tuberculosis between 2016 and 2017. We assessed risk factors for experiencing an unsuccessful treatment outcome through multivariable logistic regression analysis.In total, 1,665 children initiated tuberculosis treatment, including 916 (55.0%) identified through intensified case finding. Unsuccessful treatment outcomes were experienced by 197 (11.8%) children, comprising 27 (1.6%) deaths, 16 (1.0%) treatment failures, and 154 (9.3%) lost to follow-up. An additional 47 (2.8%) children had outcomes not evaluable. In multivariable analysis, children 0-4 years old (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.07-3.04), males (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11), and those with bacteriologic confirmation of disease (OR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.98, 5.80) had increased odds of experiencing an unsuccessful treatment outcome.Our findings suggest a need to deploy strategies to identify children earlier in the disease process and point to the need for interventions tailored for young children once treatment is initiated."
https://openalex.org/W2976738066,"Lipid and fatty acid composition of female Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF, Thunnus orientalis) reproductive and somatic tissues in southwestern North Pacific and Sea of Japan spawning grounds are compared. Total lipid (TL) levels are higher in liver than white muscle tissues. An increased gonadosomatic index (GSI) during the early spawning season coincided with decreased TL. Levels of triacylglycerols (TAG) in PBF liver tissues from the Nansei Islands and Sea of Japan, and white muscle in fishes from the Sea of Japan, decreased during the spawning season, while TAG in ovary tissues did not. Concurrent reductions in TL and increases in GSI early in the spawning season suggest TAG depletion was caused by allocation from liver and white muscle tissues to oocytes, that the liver is one of the important lipid-storage organs in PBF, and this species mostly reliant on capital deposits as a mixed capital-income breeder. Differences of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels between spawning grounds were lower in ovary than in muscle and liver tissues. However, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) levels that influence egg development and embryo and larval growth are significantly higher in PBF tissues from the Sea of Japan than Nansei Islands, which coincided with larval quality. These suggest a maternal effect exists, with egg quality influencing offspring survival, and that the reproductive strategy of PBF varies according to local variation at each spawning ground."
https://openalex.org/W2974945746,"Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the surface of eukaryotic cells to generate motility and to sense and respond to environmental cues. In order to carry out these functions, the complement of proteins in the cilium must be specific for the organelle. Regulation of protein entry into primary cilia has been shown to utilize mechanisms and components of nuclear gating, including nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that nucleoporins also localize to the base of motile cilia on the surface of trachea epithelial cells. How nucleoporins are anchored at the cilium base has been unclear as transmembrane nucleoporins, which anchor nucleoporins at the nuclear envelope, have not been found to localize at the cilium. Here we use the directed yeast two-hybrid assay to identify direct interactions between nucleoporins and nephronophthisis proteins (NPHPs) which localize to the cilium base and contribute to cilium assembly and identity. We validate NPHP-nucleoporin interactions in mammalian cells using the knocksideways assay and demonstrate that the interactions occur at the base of the primary cilium using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We propose that NPHP proteins anchor nucleoporins at the base of primary cilia to regulate protein entry into the organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2976326098,"Castanea sativa is classified as non-indigenous in Britain and Ireland. It was long held that it was first introduced into Britain by the Romans, until a recent study found no corroborative evidence of its growing here before c. AD 650. This paper presents new data on the genetic diversity of C. sativa in Britain and Ireland and potential ancestral sources in continental Europe. Microsatellite markers and analytical methods tested in previous European studies were used to genotype over 600 C. sativa trees and coppice stools, sampled from ancient semi-natural woodlands, secondary woodlands and historic cultural sites across Britain and Ireland. A single overall genepool with a diverse admixture of genotypes was found, containing two sub groups differentiating Wales from Ireland, with discrete geographical and typological clusters. C. sativa genotypes in Britain and Ireland were found to relate predominantly to some sites in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Romania, but not to Greece, Turkey or eastern parts of Europe. C. sativa has come to Britain and Ireland from these western European areas, which had acted as refugia in the Last Glacial Maximum; we compare its introduction with the colonization/translocation of oak, ash, beech and hazel into Britain and Ireland. Clones of C. sativa were identified in Britain, defining for the first time the antiquity of some ancient trees and coppice stools, evincing both natural regeneration and anthropogenic propagation over many centuries and informing the chronology of the species’ arrival in Britain. This new evidence on the origins and antiquity of British and Irish C. sativa trees enhances their conservation and economic significance, important in the context of increasing threats from environmental change, pests and pathogens."

They are rare and endangered and are regarded as the ‘national treasure’ and ‘living fossil’ in China. For the time being, there are only about 2500 giant pandas in the world. Therefore, we still have to do much more efforts to protect the giant pandas. In captive wildlife, the cataract incidence of mammalian always increases with age. Currently, in China, the proportion of elderly giant pandas who suffering from cataract has reached 20%. The eye disorder thus has a strong influence on the physical health and life quality of the elderly giant pandas. To discover the genes associated with the pathogenesis of cataract in the elderly giant panda and achieve the goal of early assessment and diagnosis of cataract in giant pandas during aging, we performed whole genome methylation sequencing in 3 giant pandas with cataract and 3 healthy giant pandas using methylation-dependent restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (MethylRAD). In the present study, we obtained 3.62M reads, on average, for each sample, and identified 116 and 242 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between the two groups under the context of CCGG and CCWGG on genome, respectively. Further KEGG and GO enrichment analyses determined a total of 110 DMGs that are involved in the biological functions associated with pathogenesis of cataract.

https://openalex.org/W2976393050,"Background Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon L.) fruit quality traits encompass many properties. Although visual appearance and fruit nutritional constitution have usually been the most important attributes, cranberry textural properties such as firmness have recently gained importance in the industry. Fruit firmness has become a quality standard due to the recent demand increase for sweetened and dried cranberries (SDC), which are currently the most profitable cranberry product. Traditionally, this trait has been measured by the cranberry industry using compression tests; however, it is poorly understood how fruit firmness is influenced by other characteristics. Results In this study, we developed a high-throughput computer-vision method to measure the internal structure of cranberry fruit, which may in turn influence cranberry fruit firmness. We measured the internal structure of 16 cranberry cultivars measured over a 40-day period, representing more than 3000 individual fruit evaluated for 10 different traits. The internal structure data paired with fruit firmness values at each evaluation period allowed us to explore the correlations between firmness and internal morphological characteristics. Conclusions Our study highlights the potential use of internal structure and firmness data as a decision-making tool for cranberry processing, especially to determine optimal harvest times and ensure high quality fruit. In particular, this study introduces novel methods to define key parameters of cranberry fruit that have not been characterized in cranberry yet. This project will aid in the future evaluation of cranberry cultivars for in SDC production."
https://openalex.org/W2976674387,"Heterochromatin is a conserved feature of eukaryotic genomes and regulates various cellular processes, including gene silencing, chromosome segregation, and maintenance of genome stability. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin formation involves methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9), which recruits Swi6/HP1 proteins to heterochromatic loci. The Swi6/HP1–H3K9me3 chromatin complex lies at the center of heterochromatic macromolecular assemblies and mediates many functions of heterochromatin by recruiting a diverse set of regulators. However, additional factors may be required for proper heterochromatin organization, but they are not fully known. Here, using several molecular and biochemical approaches, we report that Vgl1, a member of a large family of multiple KH-domain proteins, collectively known as vigilins, is indispensable for the heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing in S. pombe. ChIP analysis revealed that Vgl1 binds to pericentromeric heterochromatin in an RNA-dependent manner and that Vgl1 deletion leads to loss of H3K9 methylation and Swi6 recruitment to centromeric and telomeric heterochromatic loci. Furthermore, we show that Vgl1 interacts with the H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4, and that loss of Vgl1 impairs Clr4 recruitment to heterochromatic regions of the genome. These findings uncover a novel role for Vgl1 as a key regulator in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing in S. pombe."

Quantitative determination of pyridostigmine bromide (PR) in existence of its two associated substances; impurity a (IMP A) and impurity b (IMP B); was utilized as a case study for achieving comparison. A series consisting of 16 mixtures with numerous percentages of the studied compounds was applied for implementation of a 3 factor 4 level experimental design. Additionally, a series consisting of 9 mixtures was employed in an independent test to verify the predictive power of the suggested models. Significant improvement of predictive abilities of the two studied chemometric models was attained via implementation of OPLS processing method. The root mean square error of prediction RMSEP for the test set mixtures was employed as a key comparison tool. About PLSR model, RMSEP was found 0.5283 without preprocessing method, 1.1750 when first derivative data was used and 0.2890 when OPLS preprocessing method was applied.

An ultrasonic humidifier was used to fill the environment with a fog (droplets with diameters of 1–5 μm) containing 0.25 ppm of hypochlorous acid. The weaning room was fogged for 3 min at 30 min intervals during five hours of aerosol disinfection. An innovative sample treatment with propidium monoazide dye in conjunction with cyclonic air sampling was optimised and adapted for discerning live/dead bacteria in subsequent molecular quantification steps. Without fogging, total bacterial load ranged from 5.06 ± 0.04 to 5.75 ± 0.04 Log10 CFU/m3. After the first hour of fogging, a 78% total bacterial reduction was observed, which further increased to > 97% after the second hour, > 99.4% after the third and 99.8% after the fourth hour, finally resulting in a 99.99% reduction from the farm environment over five hours. Unlike the current formaldehyde spray disinfection protocol, which requires a long empty period because of its hazardous properties, this economically viable and environmentally friendly disinfection protocol may significantly lower downtime. Moreover, ECAS fogging can be easily adapted to a variety of applications, including the elimination of pathogens from livestock farm air environment for disease prevention, as well as decontamination after disease outbreaks."

To better understand the implications of these regularly occurring environmental stressors for maternal and child health, this study examined seasonal variation in nutrition and health care access of pregnant women and infants in rural South Africa. Methods We analyzed data from the Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies and their Environment (VHEMBE) birth cohort study of 752 mother-infant pairs recruited at delivery from August 2012 to December 2013 in the Vhembe District of Limpopo Province, the northernmost region of South Africa. We used truncated Fourier series regression to assess seasonality of antenatal care (ANC) attendance, dietary intake, and birth size. We additionally regressed ANC attendance on daily rainfall values. Models included adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Results Maternal ANC attendance, dietary composition, and infant birth size exhibited significant seasonal variation in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Adequate frequency of ANC attendance during pregnancy (≥ 4 visits) was highest among women delivering during the gardening season and lowest during the lean (rainy) season. High rainfall during the third trimester was also negatively associated with adequate ANC attendance (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86). Carbohydrate intake declined during the harvest season and increased during the vegetable gardening and lean seasons, while fat intake followed the opposite trend. Infant birth weight, length, and head circumference z-scores peaked following the gardening season and were lowest after the harvest season. Maternal protein intake and ANC ≤ 12 weeks did not significantly vary by season or rainfall. Conclusions Seasonal patterns were apparent in ANC utilization, dietary intake, and fetal growth in rural South Africa. Interventions to promote maternal and child health in similar settings should consider seasonal factors."

https://openalex.org/W2975312977,"Background Addressing Citizen’s perspectives on homelessness is crucial for the design of effective and durable policy responses, and available research in Europe is not yet substantive. We aim to explore citizens’ opinions about homelessness and to explain the differences in attitudes within the general population of eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. Methods A nationally representative telephone survey of European citizens was conducted in 2017. Three domains were investigated: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about homelessness. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a generalized linear model for clustered and weighted samples was used to probe the associations between groups with opposing attitudes. Results Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (N = 5,295). Most respondents (57%) had poor knowledge about homelessness. Respondents who thought the government spent too much on homelessness, people who are homeless should be responsible for housing, people remain homeless by choice, or homelessness keeps capabilities/empowerment intact (regarding meals, family contact, and access to work) clustered together (negative attitudes, 30%). Respondents who were willing to pay taxes, welcomed a shelter, or acknowledged people who are homeless may lack some capabilities (i.e. agreed on discrimination in hiring) made another cluster (positive attitudes, 58%). Respondents living in semi-urban or urban areas (ORs 1.33 and 1.34) and those engaged in practices to support people who are homeless (ORs > 1.4; p<0.005) were more likely to report positive attitudes, whereas those from France and Poland (p<0.001) were less likely to report positive attitudes. Conclusion The majority of European citizens hold positive attitudes towards people who are homeless, however there remain significant differences between and within countries. Although it is clear that there is strong support for increased government action and more effective solutions for Europe’s growing homelessness crisis, there also remain public opinion barriers rooted in enduring negative perceptions."
https://openalex.org/W2975732349,"The use of alternative promoters for the cell type-specific expression of a given mRNA/protein is a common cell strategy. NEMO is a scaffold protein required for canonical NF-κB signaling. Transcription of the NEMO gene is primarily controlled by two promoters: one (promoter B) drives NEMO transcription in most cell types and the second (promoter D) is largely responsible for NEMO transcription in liver cells. Herein, we have used a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to disrupt a core sequence element of promoter B, and this genetic editing essentially eliminates expression of NEMO mRNA and protein in 293T human kidney cells. By cell subcloning, we have isolated targeted 293T cell lines that express no detectable NEMO protein, have defined genomic alterations at promoter B, and do not support activation of canonical NF-κB signaling in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor. Nevertheless, non-canonical NF-κB signaling is intact in these NEMO-deficient cells. Expression of ectopic wild-type NEMO, but not certain human NEMO disease mutants, in the edited cells restores downstream NF-κB signaling in response to tumor necrosis factor. Targeting of the promoter B element does not substantially reduce NEMO expression (from promoter D) in the human SNU-423 liver cancer cell line. Thus, we have created a strategy for selectively eliminating cell type-specific expression from an alternative promoter and have generated 293T cell lines with a functional knockout of NEMO. The implications of these findings for further studies and for therapeutic approaches to target canonical NF-κB signaling are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2977175549,"Attempts to assess behavioral responses of prey to predation risk are often confounded by depredation of prey. Moreover, the scale at which the response of prey is assessed has important implications for discovering how predation risk alters prey behavior. Herein, we assessed space use of wild Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in response to spatial and temporal variation in recreational hunting. We radio-marked pheasants and monitored space use at two spatial scales: short-term seasonal home range, and nightly resting locations. Additionally, we considered temporal variation in predation risk by monitoring space use prior to and during the pheasant hunting season. Although we found no change in nightly resting location, pheasants subjected to predation risk expanded their home range and shifted home range location even when invulnerable to predation. Home range formation was plastic, with home ranges expanding and contracting as risk fluctuated before and during the hunting season. Depredation reduced the measured response within the population, obscuring the potential importance of perceived predation risk in shaping prey communities, particularly when not measured at the appropriate scale. By assessing space use of a wild prey population at multiple scales, considering spatial and temporal variation in predation risk, we show that not only does predation risk affect space use, but that the effects at the population level may be challenging to assess when not measured at the appropriate ecological scale because of the direct effects of differential mortality on the same behaviors."

We aimed to assess the optimal threshold of adherence to lipid-lowering drugs (LLD) in predicting cardiovascular-related (CV) outcomes in patients with hypertension. Design Cohort study of new users of LLDs. Setting Comprehensive healthcare administrative databases of the province of Alberta (Canada) from 2008 to 2016. Participants Patients with hypertension, who were new users of LLDs. Patients who had the outcomes prior to the initiation of LLD were excluded. Main outcomes measures Hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/stroke, CV-related mortality and all-cause mortality. Statistical analysis Adherence to LLDs was assessed as the proportion of days covered (PDC) by any LLD, from drug initiation to censoring, outcome, or study end. Three methods were used to assess the threshold: Contal and O'Quigley method, minimum distance method, and Youden's J index. Cox regressions were used to assess the risk associated with each method-specific threshold and Akaike information criteria were used to retain the optimal threshold after adjustment. Results 52229 patients were included; 4.0% were hospitalized for ACS/stroke, 3.4% died, and 1.3% died from CV-related cause. In predicting ACS/stroke, CV-related and all-cause mortality, the optimal adherence threshold was 0.52 (range: 0.51–0.54), 0.79 (0.45–0.87), and 0.84 (0.79–0.89), respectively. These results were consistent among patients aged ≥ 65 years (n = 19804). However, the results varied among those aged < 65 years, where the incidence rates of outcomes were low. Conclusion In new-users of LLDs with hypertension, approximately 50% days covered by LLDs may be enough to prevent long-term occurrence of ACS, or stroke. However, a threshold near 0.80 may be needed to prevent or reduce the risk of all-cause or CV-related mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2976540866,"Background The duration of antidepressant use affects the treatment of depression. Using the National Health Insurance database, which covers almost the entire national population, we verified the factors associated with the inadequate short-term use of initially prescribed antidepressants and their effects on the relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes. Methods There were 752,190 patients included who had been newly prescribed antidepressants in 2012 with the diagnosis of depressive disorder. They were followed-up until December 31, 2015. They were classified as short-term and long-term antidepressant users depending on whether they used a specific initial antidepressant for at least four weeks. Sociodemographic, clinical, and medical utilization factors affecting the duration of antidepressant use were investigated. We also identified whether the duration of antidepressant use affected the risk of relapse and recurrence, which was defined by the restarting of antidepressants. Results Initial antidepressants were taken for less than 28 days by 458,057 (60.84%) patients. Tricyclic antidepressants were used as the initial antidepressant more frequently than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (64.5% versus 19.3%). The type of initial antidepressant, polypharmacy, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, type of insurance coverage, and type of medical institution visited were associated with short-term use. Short-term use marginally increased the risk of relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes (Hazard ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence intervals 1.048–1.075). Conclusions Short-term antidepressant use is widespread in Korea, and assessment in various aspects are necessary to set proper treatment plans."
https://openalex.org/W2974999341,"There have been limited studies regarding the association between glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) and restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP) in Korean adults.We used data of 23,189 adults from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2009-2015 with a complete data set including spirometry, serum creatinine, and anthropometric measurements. Spirometry data included the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). We defined GHF as the >90th percentile of age & sex adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and RSP was defined as an FVC <80%-predicted value and an FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.7.Participants with RSP showed higher blood pressure, fasting glucose, and triglyceride, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and central obesity, which resulted in a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) compared to those without RSP. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the odds for RSP were significantly increased with an increased number of MetS components. In addition, increased eGFR was associated with decreased FVC, showing an inverted J-shaped relationship in a multivariate generalized additive model analysis. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of GHF for RSP was 1.184 (1.026-1.368, P = 0.021), which was evident in groups without metabolic disorders.We concluded that GHF was associated with increased odds for RSP, particularly in groups without metabolic disorders. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our study results."
https://openalex.org/W2976738402,"Phytophthora palmivora is an oomycete that causes oil palm bud rot disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms of this disease, palm clones with contrasting responses (Ortet 34, resistant and Ortet 57, susceptible) were inoculated with P. palmivora, and RNAseq gene expression analysis was performed. The transcriptome was obtained by sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 technology during the asymptomatic phase (24, 72 and 120 hours postinfection, hpi). A simultaneous analysis of differentially expressed gene (DEG) profiles in palm and P. palmivora was carried out. Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) and gene network analysis revealed differences in the transcriptional profile of the two ortets, where a high specificity of the pathogen to colonize the susceptible ortet was found. The transcriptional analysis provided an overview of the genes involved in the recognition and signaling of this pathosystem, where different transcription factors, phytohormones, proteins associated with cell wall hardening and nitrogen metabolism contribute to the resistance of oil palm to P. palmivora. This research provides a description of the molecular response of oil palm to P. palmivora, thus becoming an important source of molecular markers for the study of genotypes resistant to bud rot disease."
https://openalex.org/W2975329344,"Inverse dynamics problems are usually solved in the analysis of human gait to obtain reaction forces and moments at the joints. However, these actions are not the actual forces and moments supported by the joint structure, because they do not consider the forces of the muscles acting across the joint. Therefore, to analyse bone-on bone forces it is necessary to estimate those muscle forces. Usually, this problem is addressed by means of optimization algorithms. One of the parameters required to solve this problem is the musculotendon geometry. These data are usually taken from cadavers or MRI data from several subjects, different from the analysed subject. Then, the model is scaled to the subject morphology. This procedure constitutes a source of error. The goals of this work were two. First, to perform a sensitivity analysis of the influence of muscle insertion locations on the muscle forces acting on the hip joint and on the hip joint bone-on-bone forces. Second, to compare the hip joint bone-on-bone forces during gait cycle obtained through muscle insertion locations taken from a musculoskeletal model template and a scaling procedure to those obtained from a subject-specific model using an MRI of the subject. The problem was solved using OpenSim. Results showed that anatomical variability should be analysed from two perspectives. One the one hand, throughout the gait cycle, in a global way. On the other hand, at a characteristic instant of the gait cycle. Variations of ±1 cm in the position of the attachment points of certain muscles caused variations of up to 14.21% in averaged deviation of the muscle forces and 58.96% in the peak force in the modified muscle and variations up to 57.23% in the averaged deviation of the muscle force and up to 117.23% in the peak force in the rest of muscles. Then, the influence of that variability on muscle activity patterns and hip bone-on-bone forces could be described more precisely. A biomechanical analysis of a subject-specific musculoskeletal model was carried out. Using MRI data, variations up to 5 cm in the location of the insertion points were introduced. These modifications showed significant differences between the baseline model and the customized model: within the range [-12%, 10%] for muscle forces and around 35% of body weight for hip bone-on-bone forces."
https://openalex.org/W2975730512,"We identified a mouse strain, HLB444, carrying an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation in a highly conserved C2H2 zinc-finger DNA binding motif of the transcriptional regulator KLF15 that exhibits resistance to diet-induced obesity. Characterization of the HLB444 mutant model on high-fat and chow diets revealed a number of phenotypic differences compared to wild-type controls. When fed a high fat diet, HLB444 had lower body fat, resistance to hepatosteatosis, lower circulating glucose and improved insulin sensitivity compared to C57BL/6J controls. Gut microbial profiles in HLB444 generated from 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples differed from controls under both chow and high fat diets. HLB444 shares similar phenotypic traits with engineered full- and adipose-specific Klf15 knockout strains; however, some phenotypic differences between this mutant and the other models suggest that the Klf15 mutation in HLB444 is a hypomorphic variant. The HLB444 model will inform further annotation of transcriptional functions of KLF15, especially with respect to the role of the first zinc-finger domain."
https://openalex.org/W2975005482,"The T-SPOT.TB can be read by an ELISPOT plate imager as an alternative to a labor-intensive and time-consuming manual reading, but its accuracy has not been sufficiently discussed to date.1,423 test results obtained from manual reading using a microscope and an ELISPOT plate imager were compared. The agreement of qualitative test results was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient. The relationship of spot counts was studied using Bland-Altman analysis.The overall percent agreement of the qualitative test results was 95.43% with a kappa coefficient of 0.91. Positive test results with the maximum net spot count of 8 and borderline test results showed relatively high discordance. The agreement of spot counts in panel A, panel B, and nil control was good, and variability did not increase with higher spot counts. On the basis of study findings, a novel strategy for interpreting the test results by an ELISPOT plate imager was proposed.To increase diagnostic accuracy, positive test results with the maximum net spot count of 8 and borderline test results should be manually confirmed. Our strategy could be a practical guide for laboratories to build their own strategies for interpreting the test results by an ELISPOT plate imager."
https://openalex.org/W2975566174,"Ookinetes, one of the motile and invasive forms of the malaria parasite, rely on gliding motility in order to establish an infection in the mosquito host. Here we characterize the protein PBANKA_0407300 which is conserved in the Plasmodium genus but lacks significant similarity to proteins of other eukaryotes. It is expressed in gametocytes and throughout the invasive mosquito stages of P. berghei, but is absent from asexual blood stages. Mutants lacking the protein developed morphologically normal ookinetes that were devoid of productive motility although some stretching movement could be detected. We therefore named the protein Ookinete Motility Deficient (OMD). Several key factors known to be involved in motility however were normally expressed and localized in the mutant. Importantly, the mutant failed to establish an infection in the mosquito which resulted in a total malaria transmission blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2976083608,"Background Commercial or industry funding is associated with outcomes that favour the study funder in published studies, across various areas of research. However, it is currently unclear whether there are differences between trials with and without industry involvement at the stage of trial registration. Objective To determine whether industry involvement (industry sponsorship, funding, or collaboration) is associated with trial characteristics at the time of trial registration. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all interventional studies registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in 2017 and classified them by industry involvement. We analysed whether there were differences in study characteristics (including type of control, sample size, study phase, randomisation, registration timing, and purpose of study) by industry involvement. Results Industry involvement was reported by 21% of the 1,433 included trials. Only 40% of trials with industry involvement used an active control compared to 58% of non-industry trials (OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.38 to 0.63, p < .001), and industry trials reported smaller sample sizes (Median(IQR)industry = 45(24–100), Median(IQR)non-industry = 70(35–160), Mean Difference = -153, 95% CI = -233 to -75, p < .001). Industry trials were more likely to be earlier phase trials (Χ2(df) = 71.46(4), p < .001). There was no difference in use of randomisation between industry (70%) and non-industry trials (73%) (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.67–1.20, p = .38). Eighty-three percent of industry trials compared to 70% of non-industry trials were prospectively registered (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.47–2.82, p < .001). Industry trials were more likely to assess treatment (85%), rather than prevention, education or diagnosis compared to non-industry trials (64%) (OR = 3.02, 95%CI = 2.17–4.32, p < .001). Conclusion The current study gives insight into differences in trial characteristics by industry involvement at registration stage. There was a reduced use of active controls in trials with industry involvement which has previously been proposed as a mechanism behind more favourable results. Non-industry funders and sponsors are crucial to ensure research addresses not only treatments, but also prevention, diagnosis and education questions."
https://openalex.org/W2976522882,"Podoplanin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed in certain types of tumors and induces platelet aggregation by binding to C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) on the platelet membrane. Activated platelets release granule components, which in turn, trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confer invasive capacity to the tumor cells. Therefore, blocking the podoplanin-CLEC-2 interaction by a small-molecule compound is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent cancer metastasis and invasion. To effectively identify such inhibitory compounds, we have developed a pull-down-based inhibitory compound screening system. An immunoglobulin Fc domain-CLEC-2 fusion protein was used as a bait to capture podoplanin derived from podoplanin-overexpressing HeLa cells in the presence and absence of the test compound. The protein complex was then pulled down using protein A beads. To shorten the turnaround time, increase throughput, and decrease the workload for the operators, centrifugal filter units were employed to separate free and bound podoplanin, instead of using customary aspiration-centrifugation washing cycles. Slot blotting was also utilized in lieu of gel electrophoresis and electrical transfer. Thus, the use of our pull down screening system could facilitate the effective selection of potential inhibitor compounds of the podoplanin-CLEC-2 interaction for cancer therapy. Importantly, our methodology is also applicable to targeting other protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2976652805,"The first genotyping data on measles virus (MeV) strains in Cameroon dates from 1994, while other studies were realized in 2001 and 2011 with the establishment of MeV virological surveillance. However, the genetic data of MeV strains circulating in Cameroon remains fragmented and concentrated in certain regions, hence the need for an update. The objective of this study was to have recent data on MeV genotypes circulating in Cameroon. Ninety throat swabs collected during recent measles outbreaks were analyzed by MeV genotyping RT-PCR using the nucleoprotein gene N. The resulting sequences were analyzed on the basis of 450 nucleotides with MEGA 7 software. Overall genome analysis was performed on 40/90 sequences. The strains were from all ten regions and all belonged to cluster 1 of genotype B3. The genotype B3 has been circulating in Cameroon for long periods of time; efforts must be made in immunization for its elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2975268556,"Purpose To investigate cerebral microstructural alterations in patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) and a cross-sectional study design. Methods Cerebral qMRI was performed in 85 patients in a median 10 years after OLT compared to 31 healthy controls. Patients were treated with different dosages of CNI or with a CNI-free immunosuppression (CNI-free: n = 19; CNI-low: n = 36; CNI-standard: n = 30). T2-, T2*- and T2’- relaxation times, as well as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in brain gray and white matter by using the regions of interest method. Results In comparison to controls, patients revealed significantly increased T2, T2*, T2’, ADC and reduced FA, predominantly in the frontal white matter, indicating microstructural brain alterations represented by increased free water (increased T2), reduced neuronal metabolism (increased T2’) and a lower degree of spatial organization of the nervous fibers (reduced FA). CNI-low and CNI-free patients showed more alterations than CNI-standard patients. Analysis of their history revealed impairment of kidney function while under standard CNI dose suggesting that these patients may be more vulnerable to toxic CNI side-effects. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the individual sensitivity to toxic side effects should be considered when choosing an appropriate immunosuppressive regimen in patients after liver transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2975456852,"Use of gas-liquid equilibrators to measure trace gases such as CO2, methane, and radon in water bodies is widespread. Such measurements are critical for understanding a variety of water quality issues such as acidification due to elevated CO2 or other processes related ecosystem metabolism and function. However, because gas-liquid equilibrators rely on generating sufficient surface area for gas exchange between liquid and gas phases, most traditional equilibrators pass water through small orifices or interstitial spaces that rapidly clog in highly productive or turbid waters, conditions that are common in estuaries, coastal bays, and riverine systems. Likewise, in cold temperatures, such equilibrators are subject to freezing. Both situations lead to failure and limit utility, especially for long term, continuous environmental monitoring. Here we describe and test a gas-liquid equilibrator that relies on a continuous falling film of water over a spherical surface to drive gas exchange. Our results demonstrate that this design is accurate in its ability to equilibrate fully to aqueous CO2 concentrations, is functional across a wide range of gas concentrations, and has a response time that is comparable with other equilibrator designs. Because this equilibrator uses free flowing, falling water to produce a surface for gas exchange, our field trials have shown it to be very resistant to clogging and freezing, and therefore well suited to long term deployment in highly productive waters like estuaries where CO2 concentrations fluctuate hourly, daily, and seasonally. When generated across a spherical surface, the falling film is not adversely affected by tilting off vertical, conditions that are common on a ship, small vessel, or buoy."
https://openalex.org/W2975312917,"Evaluating the absolute difference in pain intensity and the percentage difference in pain intensity could facilitate an understanding of pain reduction among cancer patients during repeated hospitalizations. Examinations of the absolute differences in pain intensity and the percentage differences in pain intensity according to the worst pain intensity and last evaluated pain intensity before discharge are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absolute and percentage difference in pain intensities among cancer patients with moderate or severe pain from their 1st to 18th hospitalizations from 2011–2013. A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted. Pain intensity was assessed using scales and was recorded in a nursing information system. The absolute and percentage difference in pain intensities were examined via the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and group differences in moderate or severe pain were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. For moderate pain patients, the mean absolute difference in pain intensity was 1.52, and the percentage difference in pain intensity was 29.0%; both these values were significant. More significant changes in the absolute and percentage difference in pain intensities were associated with severe pain patients. Both the average absolute difference in pain intensity (3.09) and the percentage difference in pain intensity (38.5%) in patients with severe pain were significantly higher than the average absolute difference in pain intensity (1.52) and the percentage difference in pain intensity (29.0%) in patients with moderate pain. Cancer patients with moderate and severe pain experienced pain reductions of approximately 30% and 40%, respectively. Early pain management intervention in patients with severe pain is necessary to achieve an obvious analgesic effect, and the formula of the percentage difference in pain intensity should be incorporated into the nursing information system to alert clinicians for early detection of the effectiveness of cancer pain management."
