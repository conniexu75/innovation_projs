https://openalex.org/W2083599885,"The atmospheric lifetimes of the fluorinated gases CF(4), C(2)F(6), c-C(4)F(8), (CF(3))(2)c-C(4)F(6), C(5)F(12), C(6)F(14), C(2)F(5)Cl, C(2)F(4)C(12), CF(3)Cl, and SF(6) are of concern because of the effects that these long-lived compounds acting as greenhouse gases can have on global climate. The possible atmospheric loss processes of these gases were assessed by determining the rate coefficients for the reactions of these gases with O((1)D), H, and OH and the absorption cross sections at 121.6 nanometers in the laboratory and using these data as input to a two-dimensional atmospheric model. The lifetimes of all the studied perfluoro compounds are >2000 years, and those of CF(3)Cl, CF(3)CF(2)Cl, and CF(2)ClCF(2)Cl are >300 years. If released into the atmosphere, these molecules will accumulate and their effects will persist for centuries or millennia."

https://openalex.org/W2006992640,"The ideas of Dimopoulos, Hall and Raby for explaining the array of masses of elementary particles are discussed. If their model (which is considered to be testable) holds up it could fill a substantial void left by the conceptual framework that currently holds all of theoretical physics together - the standard model."

In addition to the student body, permission was granted thirty-four other persons interested in our work to take part in our program-especially in Brittany and the Dordogne. Of the fifty conferences given, twenty were by the director and thirty by twenty-eight specialists. To the latter, the director desires to express his deep sense of appreciation. Sixty-three important prehistoric sites and thirty-five museums and special collections were examined. As a result of the twentyfive days of digging, collections were sent to seven contributing institutions. At the end of the season five students remained in the Old World for further study and field work."

And that made room for even more diversity than usual. Only the AGU could accommodate news of asteroid impacts and extinctions one-third of a billion years ago and a progress report on the first direct measurements of centimeter-scale ocean mixing, an ongoing study in the Atlantic."
