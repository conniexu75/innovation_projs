https://openalex.org/W2050757500,"Gallic acid (GA), a naturally abundant plant phenolic compound in vegetables and fruits, has been shown to have potent anti-oxidative and anti-obesity activity. However, the effects of GA on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of GA administration on nutritional hepatosteatosis model by a more “holistic view” approach, namely 1H NMR-based metabolomics, in order to prove efficacy and to obtain information that might lead to a better understanding of the mode of action of GA. Male C57BL/6 mice were placed for 16 weeks on either a normal chow diet, a high fat diet (HFD, 60%), or a high fat diet supplemented with GA (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, orally). Liver histopathology and serum biochemical examinations indicated that the daily administration of GA protects against hepatic steatosis, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and insulin resistance among the HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In addition, partial least squares discriminant analysis scores plots demonstrated that the cluster of HFD fed mice is clearly separated from the normal group mice plots, indicating that the metabolic characteristics of these two groups are distinctively different. Specifically, the GA-treated mice are located closer to the normal group of mice, indicating that the HFD-induced disturbances to the metabolic profile were partially reversed by GA treatment. Our results show that the hepatoprotective effect of GA occurs in part through a reversing of the HFD caused disturbances to a range of metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism (glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), amino acids metabolism, choline metabolism and gut-microbiota-associated metabolism. Taken together, this study suggested that a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach is a useful platform for natural product functional evaluation. The selected metabolites are potentially useful as preventive action biomarkers and could also be used to help our further understanding of the effect of GA in hepatosteatosis mice."
https://openalex.org/W2065159687,"Infrapatellar fat pad adipose stem cells (IPFP-ASCs) have been shown to harbor chondrogenic potential. When combined with 3D polymeric structures, the stem cells provide a source of stem cells to engineer 3D tissues for cartilage repair. In this study, we have shown human IPFP-ASCs seeded onto 3D printed chitosan scaffolds can undergo chondrogenesis using TGFβ3 and BMP6. By week 4, a pearlescent, cartilage-like matrix had formed that penetrated the top layers of the chitosan scaffold forming a ‘cap’ on the scaffold. Chondrocytic morphology showed typical cells encased in extracellular matrix which stained positively with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for collagen type II and cartilage proteoglycans, as well as collagen type I. Real time PCR analysis showed up-regulation of collagen type II, aggrecan and SOX9 genes when IPFP-ASCs were stimulated by TGFβ3 and BMP6. Thus, IPFP-ASCs can successfully undergo chondrogenesis using TGFβ3 and BMP6 and the cartilage-like tissue that forms on the surface of 3D-printed chitosan scaffold may prove useful as an osteochondral graft."
https://openalex.org/W2021415374,"Programmed death 1 (PD-1), an immunoinhibitory receptor, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), its ligand, together induce the “exhausted” status in antigen-specific lymphocytes and are thus involved in the immune evasion of tumor cells. In this study, canine PD-1 and PD-L1 were molecularly characterized, and their potential as therapeutic targets for canine tumors was discussed. The canine PD-1 and PD-L1 genes were conserved among canine breeds. Based on the sequence information obtained, the recombinant canine PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins were constructed; they were confirmed to bind each other. Antibovine PD-L1 monoclonal antibody effectively blocked the binding of recombinant PD-1 with PD-L1–expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. Canine melanoma, mastocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and other types of tumors examined expressed PD-L1, whereas some did not. Interestingly, anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment enhanced IFN-γ production from tumor-infiltrating cells. These results showed that the canine PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is also associated with T-cell exhaustion in canine tumors and that its blockade with antibody could be a new therapeutic strategy for canine tumors. Further investigations are needed to confirm the ability of anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate canine antitumor immunity in vivo, and its therapeutic potential has to be further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1966342900,"We examined whether classifications based on reading performance are relevant to identify cognitively homogeneous subgroups of dyslexic children. Each of the 71 dyslexic participants was selected to have a mixed reading profile, i.e. poor irregular word and pseudo-word reading performance (accuracy and speed). Despite their homogeneous reading profile, the participants were found to split into four distinct cognitive subgroups, characterized by a single phonological disorder, a single visual attention span disorder, a double deficit or none of these disorders. The two subgroups characterized by single and contrasted cognitive disorders were found to exhibit a very similar reading pattern but more contrasted spelling performance (quantitative analysis). A qualitative analysis of the error types produced in reading and spelling provided some cues about the participants' underlying cognitive deficit. The overall findings disqualify subtyping based on reading profiles as a classification method to identify cognitively homogeneous subgroups of dyslexic children. They rather show an opaque relationship between the cognitive underpinnings of developmental dyslexia and their behavioral manifestations in reading and spelling. Future neuroimaging and genetic studies should take this issue into account since synthesizing over cognitively heterogeneous children would entail potential pitfalls."
https://openalex.org/W2088793139,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has multiple important physiological functions, including regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth, autophagy, and synaptic plasticity. Activation of mTOR is necessary for the many beneficial effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), including dendritic translation and memory formation in the hippocampus. At present, however, the role of mTOR in BDNF's support of survival is not clear. We report that mTOR activation is necessary for BDNF-dependent survival of primary rat hippocampal neurons, as either mTOR inhibition by rapamycin or genetic manipulation of the downstream molecule p70S6K specifically blocked BDNF rescue. Surprisingly, however, BDNF did not promote neuron survival by up-regulating mTOR-dependent protein synthesis or through mTOR-dependent suppression of caspase-3 activation. Instead, activated mTOR was responsible for BDNF's suppression of autophagic flux. shRNA against the autophagic machinery Atg7 or Atg5 prolonged the survival of neurons co-treated with BDNF and rapamycin, suggesting that suppression of mTOR in BDNF-treated cells resulted in excessive autophagy. Finally, acting as a physiological analog of rapamycin, IL-1β impaired BDNF signaling by way of inhibiting mTOR activation as follows: the cytokine induced caspase-independent neuronal death and accelerated autophagic flux in BDNF-treated cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of BDNF neuroprotection; BDNF not only prevents apoptosis through inhibiting caspase activation but also promotes neuron survival through modulation of autophagy. This protection mechanism is vulnerable under chronic inflammation, which deregulates autophagy through impairing mTOR signaling. These results may be relevant to age-related changes observed in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2121715483,"Despite recent advances in field research on white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in several regions around the world, opportunistic capture and sighting records remain the primary source of information on this species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). Previous studies using limited datasets have suggested a precipitous decline in the abundance of white sharks from this region, but considerable uncertainty in these studies warrants additional investigation. This study builds upon previously published data combined with recent unpublished records and presents a synthesis of 649 confirmed white shark records from the NWA compiled over a 210-year period (1800-2010), resulting in the largest white shark dataset yet compiled from this region. These comprehensive records were used to update our understanding of their seasonal distribution, relative abundance trends, habitat use, and fisheries interactions. All life stages were present in continental shelf waters year-round, but median latitude of white shark occurrence varied seasonally. White sharks primarily occurred between Massachusetts and New Jersey during summer and off Florida during winter, with broad distribution along the coast during spring and fall. The majority of fishing gear interactions occurred with rod and reel, longline, and gillnet gears. Historic abundance trends from multiple sources support a significant decline in white shark abundance in the 1970s and 1980s, but there have been apparent increases in abundance since the 1990s when a variety of conservation measures were implemented. Though the white shark's inherent vulnerability to exploitation warrants continued protections, our results suggest a more optimistic outlook for the recovery of this iconic predator in the Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2056738334,"In the study of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), it remains a challenge to present visual flickers at flexible frequencies using monitor refresh rate. For example, in an SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI), it is difficult to present a large number of visual flickers simultaneously on a monitor. This study aims to explore whether or how a newly proposed frequency approximation approach changes signal characteristics of SSVEPs. At 10 Hz and 12 Hz, the SSVEPs elicited using two refresh rates (75 Hz and 120 Hz) were measured separately to represent the approximation and constant-period approaches. This study compared amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), phase, latency, scalp distribution, and frequency detection accuracy of SSVEPs elicited using the two approaches. To further prove the efficacy of the approximation approach, this study implemented an eight-target BCI using frequencies from 8–15 Hz. The SSVEPs elicited by the two approaches were found comparable with regard to all parameters except amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs at 12 Hz. The BCI obtained an averaged information transfer rate (ITR) of 95.0 bits/min across 10 subjects with a maximum ITR of 120 bits/min on two subjects, the highest ITR reported in the SSVEP-based BCIs. This study clearly showed that the frequency approximation approach can elicit robust SSVEPs at flexible frequencies using monitor refresh rate and thereby can largely facilitate various SSVEP-related studies in neural engineering and visual neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W1978579998,"Cellular copper homeostasis requires transmembrane transport and compartmental trafficking while maintaining the cell essentially free of uncomplexed Cu(2+/+). In bacteria, soluble cytoplasmic and periplasmic chaperones bind and deliver Cu(+) to target transporters or metalloenzymes. Transmembrane Cu(+)-ATPases couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the efflux of cytoplasmic Cu(+). Cytosolic Cu(+) chaperones (CopZ) interact with a structural platform in Cu(+)-ATPases (CopA) and deliver copper into the ion permeation path. CusF is a periplasmic Cu(+) chaperone that supplies Cu(+) to the CusCBA system for efflux to the extracellular milieu. In this report, using Escherichia coli CopA and CusF, direct Cu(+) transfer from the ATPase to the periplasmic chaperone was observed. This required the specific interaction of the Cu(+)-bound form of CopA with apo-CusF for subsequent metal transfer upon ATP hydrolysis. As expected, the reverse Cu(+) transfer from CusF to CopA was not observed. Mutation of CopA extracellular loops or the electropositive surface of CusF led to a decrease in Cu(+) transfer efficiency. On the other hand, mutation of Met and Glu residues proposed to be part of the metal exit site in the ATPase yielded enzymes with lower turnover rates, although Cu(+) transfer was minimally affected. These results show how soluble chaperones obtain Cu(+) from transmembrane transporters. Furthermore, by explaining the movement of Cu(+) from the cytoplasmic pool to the extracellular milieu, these data support a mechanism by which cytoplasmic Cu(+) can be precisely directed to periplasmic targets via specific transporter-chaperone interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2033356851,"Megaherbivorous dinosaurs were exceptionally diverse on the Late Cretaceous island continent of Laramidia, and a growing body of evidence suggests that this diversity was facilitated by dietary niche partitioning. We test this hypothesis using the fossil megaherbivore assemblage from the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta as a model. Comparative tooth morphology and wear, including the first use of quantitative dental microwear analysis in the context of Cretaceous palaeosynecology, are used to infer the mechanical properties of the foods these dinosaurs consumed. The phylliform teeth of ankylosaurs were poorly adapted for habitually processing high-fibre plant matter. Nevertheless, ankylosaur diets were likely more varied than traditionally assumed: the relatively large, bladed teeth of nodosaurids would have been better adapted to processing a tougher, more fibrous diet than the smaller, cusp-like teeth of ankylosaurids. Ankylosaur microwear is characterized by a preponderance of pits and scratches, akin to modern mixed feeders, but offers no support for interspecific dietary differences. The shearing tooth batteries of ceratopsids are much better adapted to high-fibre herbivory, attested by their scratch-dominated microwear signature. There is tentative microwear evidence to suggest differences in the feeding habits of centrosaurines and chasmosaurines, but statistical support is not significant. The tooth batteries of hadrosaurids were capable of both shearing and crushing functions, suggestive of a broad dietary range. Their microwear signal overlaps broadly with that of ankylosaurs, and suggests possible dietary differences between hadrosaurines and lambeosaurines. Tooth wear evidence further indicates that all forms considered here exhibited some degree of masticatory propaliny. Our findings reveal that tooth morphology and wear exhibit different, but complimentary, dietary signals that combine to support the hypothesis of dietary niche partitioning. The inferred mechanical and dietary patterns appear constant over the 1.5 Myr timespan of the Dinosaur Park Formation megaherbivore chronofauna, despite continual species turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2073822415,"Background Tryptase is a serin protease stored and released from mast cells (MCs) that plays a role in tumour angiogenesis. In this study we aimed to evaluate serum tryptase levels in colo-rectal cancer (CRC) patients before (STLBS) and after (STLAS) radical surgical resection. We also evaluated mast cell density positive to tryptase (MCDPT) and microvascular density (MVD) in primary tumour tissue. Methods A series of 61 patients with stage B and C CRC (according to the Astler and Coller staging system) were selected. Serum blood samples were collected from patients one day before and one day after surgery. Tryptase levels were measured using the UniCAP Tryptase Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Tumour sections were immunostained with a primary anti-tryptase antibody (clone AA1; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and an anti CD-34 antibody (QB-END 10; Bio-Optica Milan, Italy) by means of immunohistochemistry and then evaluated by image analysis methods. Results The mean ± s.d. STLBS and STLAS was 5.63±2.61 µg/L, and 3.39±1.47 µg/L respectively and a significant difference between mean levels was found: p = 0.000 by t-test. The mean ± s.d. of MCDPT and MVD was 8.13±3.28 and 29.16±7.39 respectively. A strong correlation between STLBS and MVD (r = 0.83, p = 0.000); STLBS and MCDPT (r = 0.60, p = 0.003); and MCDPT and MVD (r = 0.73; p = 0.001) was found. Conclusion Results demonstrated higher STLBS in CRC patients, indicating an involvement of MC tryptase in CRC angiogenesis. Data also indicated lower STLAS, suggesting the release of tryptase from tumour-infiltrating MCs. Serum tryptase levels may therefore play a role as a novel bio-marker predictive of response to radical surgery. In this context tryptase inhibitors such as Gabexate and Nafamostat Mesilate might be evaluated in adjuvant clinical trials as a new anti-angiogenic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2166876250,"In this study, we report that lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), a recently characterized adipokine/cytokine, is a novel regulator of brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation by modulating the adrenergic independent p38 MAPK-PGC-1α-UCP1 pathway. Global Lcn2 knock-out (Lcn2(-/-)) mice have defective BAT thermogenic activation caused by cold stimulation and decreased BAT activity under high fat diet-induced obesity. Nevertheless, Lcn2(-/-) mice maintain normal sympathetic nervous system activation as evidenced by normal catecholamine release and lipolytic activity in response to cold stimulation. Further studies showed that Lcn2 deficiency impairs peroxisomal and mitochondrial oxidation of lipids and attenuates cold-induced Pgc1a and Ucp1 expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in BAT. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that Lcn2 deficiency reduces the thermogenic activity of brown adipocytes. Lcn2(-/-) differentiated brown adipocytes have significantly decreased expression levels of brown fat markers, decreased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and decreased mitochondrial oxidation capacity. However, Lcn2(-/-) brown adipocytes have normal norepinephrine-stimulated p38 MAPK and hormone-sensitive lipase phosphorylation and Pgc1a and Ucp1 expression, suggesting an intact β-adrenergic signaling activation. More intriguingly, recombinant Lcn2 was able to significantly stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation in brown adipocytes. Activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, a downstream effector of PGC-1α, by thiazolidinedione administration fully reverses the BAT function of Lcn2(-/-) mice. Our findings provide evidence for the novel role Lcn2 plays in oxidative metabolism and BAT activation via an adrenergic independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2004857611,"This study uses event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of numeric conflict monitoring in math-anxious individuals, by analyzing whether math anxiety is related to abnormal processing in early conflict detection (as shown by the N450 component) and/or in a later, response-related stage of processing (as shown by the conflict sustained potential; Conflict-SP). Conflict adaptation effects were also studied by analyzing the effect of the previous trial’s congruence in current interference. To this end, 17 low math-anxious (LMA) and 17 high math-anxious (HMA) individuals were presented with a numerical Stroop task. Groups were extreme in math anxiety but did not differ in trait or state anxiety or in simple math ability. The interference effect of the current trial (incongruent-congruent) and the interference effect preceded by congruence and by incongruity were analyzed both for behavioral measures and for ERPs. A greater interference effect was found for response times in the HMA group than in the LMA one. Regarding ERPs, the LMA group showed a greater N450 component for the interference effect preceded by congruence than when preceded by incongruity, while the HMA group showed greater Conflict-SP amplitude for the interference effect preceded by congruence than when preceded by incongruity. Our study showed that the electrophysiological correlates of numeric interference in HMA individuals comprise the absence of a conflict adaptation effect in the first stage of conflict processing (N450) and an abnormal subsequent up-regulation of cognitive control in order to overcome the conflict (Conflict-SP). More concretely, our study shows that math anxiety is related to a reactive and compensatory recruitment of control resources that is implemented only when previously exposed to a stimuli presenting conflicting information."
https://openalex.org/W2002265852,"Plant chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) and chitinase-like (CTL) proteins have diverse functions including cell wall biosynthesis and disease resistance. We analyzed the expression of 34 chitinase and chitinase-like genes of flax (collectively referred to as LusCTLs), belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 19 (GH19). Analysis of the transcript expression patterns of LusCTLs in the stem and other tissues identified three transcripts (LusCTL19, LusCTL20, LusCTL21) that were highly enriched in developing bast fibers, which form cellulose-rich gelatinous-type cell walls. The same three genes had low relative expression in tissues with primary cell walls and in xylem, which forms a xylan type of secondary cell wall. Phylogenetic analysis of the LusCTLs identified a flax-specific sub-group that was not represented in any of other genomes queried. To provide further context for the gene expression analysis, we also conducted phylogenetic and expression analysis of the cellulose synthase (CESA) family genes of flax, and found that expression of secondary wall-type LusCESAs (LusCESA4, LusCESA7 and LusCESA8) was correlated with the expression of two LusCTLs (LusCTL1, LusCTL2) that were the most highly enriched in xylem. The expression of LusCTL19, LusCTL20, and LusCTL21 was not correlated with that of any CESA subgroup. These results defined a distinct type of CTLs that may have novel functions specific to the development of the gelatinous (G-type) cellulosic walls."
https://openalex.org/W2033620235,"Background The effects of vitamin D supplementation on mild hepatic dysfunction and glycemic control are unclear in children and adolescents with either type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hypothesis Vitamin D supplementation will improve hepatic dysfunction and glycemic control. Aim To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on alanine transaminase (ALT), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Subjects and Methods A retrospective study of 131 subjects with either T1D (n = 88∶46 females, 42 males), or T2D (n = 43∶26 females, 17 males) of ages 3–18 years between 2007–2013. All subjects had (1) a diagnosis of diabetes for >12 mo, (2) received vitamin D supplementation for the management of vitamin D deficiency (3) had baseline and subsequent simultaneous measurements of HbA1c, ALT, and 25(OH)D. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D concentration of <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Results At baseline, vitamin D deficiency occurred in 72.1% of patients with T2D and in 37.5% of T1D patients (p<0.001). Patients with T2D had significantly higher values for BMI SDS (p<0.001), alanine transaminase (ALT) (p = 0.001), but lower 25(OH)D (p<0.001), and no difference in HbA1c (p = 0.94), and total daily dose (TDD) of insulin per kg body weight (p = 0.48) as compared to T1D patients. After 3 months of vitamin D supplementation, there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D in both T2D (p = 0.015), and T1D patients (p<0.001); significant reduction in BMI SDS (p = 0.015) and ALT (p = 0.012) in T2D, but not in T1D. There was a clinically-significant decrease in HbA1c in T2D from 8.5±2.9% at baseline to 7.7±2.5 at 3 mo, but not in T1D, 8.5±1.2 to 8.53±1.1%. Conclusions Vitamin D supplementation in subjects with T2D was associated with statistically significant decreases in BMI SDS, ALT, and a clinically-significant decrease in HbA1c."
https://openalex.org/W2170395784,"There is much interest in understanding how anthropogenic food resources subsidise carnivore populations. Carcasses of hunter-shot ungulates are a potentially substantial food source for mammalian carnivores. The sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) is a large (≥ 150 kg) exotic ungulate that can be hunted throughout the year in south-eastern Australia, and hunters are not required to remove or bury carcasses. We investigated how wild dogs/dingoes and their hybrids (Canis lupus familiaris/dingo), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus) utilised sambar deer carcasses during the peak hunting seasons (i.e. winter and spring). We placed carcasses at 1-km intervals along each of six transects that extended 4-km into forest from farm boundaries. Visits to carcasses were monitored using camera traps, and the rate of change in edible biomass estimated at ∼ 14-day intervals. Wild dogs and foxes fed on 70% and 60% of 30 carcasses, respectively, but feral cats seldom (10%) fed on carcasses. Spatial and temporal patterns of visits to carcasses were consistent with the hypothesis that foxes avoid wild dogs. Wild dog activity peaked at carcasses 2 and 3 km from farms, a likely legacy of wild dog control, whereas fox activity peaked at carcasses 0 and 4 km from farms. Wild dog activity peaked at dawn and dusk, whereas nearly all fox activity occurred after dusk and before dawn. Neither wild dogs nor foxes remained at carcasses for long periods and the amount of feeding activity by either species was a less important predictor of the loss of edible biomass than season. Reasons for the low impacts of wild dogs and foxes on sambar deer carcass biomass include the spatially and temporally unpredictable distribution of carcasses in the landscape, the rapid rate of edible biomass decomposition in warm periods, low wild dog densities and the availability of alternative food resources."
https://openalex.org/W2048044998,"In the widely used mouse model of retinal degeneration, rd1, the loss of photoreceptors leads to rhythmic electrical activity of around 10–16 Hz in the remaining retinal network. Recent studies suggest that this oscillation is formed within the electrically coupled network of AII amacrine cells and ON-bipolar cells. A second mouse model, rd10, displays a delayed onset and slower progression of degeneration, making this mouse strain a better model for human retinitis pigmentosa. In rd10, oscillations occur at a frequency of 3–7 Hz, raising the question whether oscillations have the same origin in the two mouse models. As rd10 is increasingly being used as a model to develop experimental therapies, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous rhythmic activity. To study the properties of oscillations in rd10 retina we combined multi electrode recordings with pharmacological manipulation of the retinal network. Oscillations were abolished by blockers for ionotropic glutamate receptors and gap junctions. Frequency and amplitude of oscillations were modulated strongly by blockers of inhibitory receptors and to a lesser extent by blockers of HCN channels. In summary, although we found certain differences in the pharmacological modulation of rhythmic activity in rd10 compared to rd1, the overall pattern looked similar. This suggests that the generation of rhythmic activity may underlie similar mechanisms in rd1 and rd10 retina."
https://openalex.org/W2092320926,"Taxonomic investigation of spined loaches from Dalmatia and Herzegovina was conducted on specimens from 14 localities. The results of the detailed morphological investigations were combined with genetic data (based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes) in order to resolve the taxonomic status of each Cobitis population. Among the investigated features of external morphology, the appearance of spots on the caudal fin base turned out to have the greatest diagnostic value. Furthermore, the number of branched fin rays enabled the discrimination of several species. No morphometric character alone could ensure determination of any Cobitis species. Nevertheless, groups of populations that are more similar in their body shapes correspond to mitochondrial phylogenetic lineages. Based on molecular genetic markers, Dalmatian and Herzegovinian spined loaches form independent lineages inside the Adriatic phylogenetic group. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic reconstruction revealed six monophyletic lineages, corresponding to six species distributed in the investigated area. The population distributed in Mostarsko blato karstic field in Bosnia and Herzegovina is described as a new species based on a unique combination of morphological characters: a single triangular Canestrini scale; usually 51/2 branched anal fin rays, 61/2 branched dorsal fin rays, 14 branched caudal fin rays; no spots in the surface pigmentation layer on the caudal fin base; scales on the body very small."
https://openalex.org/W2144449254,"In hepatitis C virus infection, replication of the viral genome and virion assembly are linked to cellular metabolic processes. In particular, lipid droplets, which store principally triacylglycerides (TAGs) and cholesterol esters (CEs), have been implicated in production of infectious virus. Here, we examine the effect on productive infection of triacsin C and YIC-C8-434, which inhibit synthesis of TAGs and CEs by targeting long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, respectively. Our results present high resolution data on the acylglycerol and cholesterol ester species that were affected by the compounds. Moreover, triacsin C, which blocks both triglyceride and cholesterol ester synthesis, cleared most of the lipid droplets in cells. By contrast, YIC-C8-434, which only abrogates production of cholesterol esters, induced an increase in size of droplets. Although both compounds slightly reduced viral RNA synthesis, they significantly impaired assembly of infectious virions in infected cells. In the case of triacsin C, reduced stability of the viral core protein, which forms the virion nucleocapsid and is targeted to the surface of lipid droplets, correlated with lower virion assembly. In addition, the virus particles that were released from cells had reduced specific infectivity. YIC-C8-434 did not alter the association of core with lipid droplets but appeared to decrease production of infectious virus particles, suggesting a block in virion assembly. Thus, the compounds have antiviral properties, indicating that targeting synthesis of lipids stored in lipid droplets might be an option for therapeutic intervention in treating chronic hepatitis C virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050441648,"Fat infiltration within marrow cavity is one of multitudinous features of estrogen deficiency, which leads to a decline in bone formation functionality. The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it is derived from osteoblasts, which transdifferentiate into adipocytes that produce bone marrow fat. We examined the dose-dependent effect of 17β-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived osteoblasts to undergo osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. We found that 17β-estradiol significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity (P<0.05); calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn expression levels dose-dependently. By contrast, 17β-estradiol significantly decreased the number and size of lipid droplets, and Fabp4 and PPARγ expression levels during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation (P<0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers (Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea) and undifferentiated adipocyte markers (Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b) were also affected by 17β-estradiol during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. Western blotting and immunostaining further showed that canonical Wnt signaling can be activated by estrogen to exert its inhibitory effect of osteo-adipogenesis. This is the first study to demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of 17β-estradiol on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs likely via canonical Wnt signaling. In summary, our results indicate that osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation modulated by canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone metabolism may be a new explanation for the gradually increased bone marrow fat in estrogen-inefficient condition."
https://openalex.org/W2038605458,"Background Vaccine-induced human antibodies to surface components of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumonia are correlated with protection. Monoclonal antibodies to surface components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are also protective in animal models. We have characterized human antibodies that bind to the surface of live M. tuberculosis. Methods Plasma from humans with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (n = 23), active TB disease (n = 40), and uninfected controls (n = 9) were assayed by ELISA for reactivity to the live M. tuberculosis surface and to inactivated M. tuberculosis fractions (whole cell lysate, lipoarabinomannan, cell wall, and secreted proteins). Results When compared to uninfected controls, patients with active TB disease had higher antibody titers to the surface of live M. tuberculosis (Δ = 0.72 log10), whole cell lysate (Δ = 0.82 log10), and secreted proteins (Δ = 0.62 log10), though there was substantial overlap between the two groups. Individuals with active disease had higher relative IgG avidity (Δ = 1.4 to 2.6) to all inactivated fractions. Surprisingly, the relative IgG avidity to the live M. tuberculosis surface was lower in the active disease group than in uninfected controls (Δ = –1.53, p = 0.004). Patients with active disease had higher IgG than IgM titers for all inactivated fractions (ratios, 2.8 to 10.1), but equal IgG and IgM titers to the live M. tuberculosis surface (ratio, 1.1). Higher antibody titers to the M. tuberculosis surface were observed in active disease patients who were BCG-vaccinated (Δ = 0.55 log10, p = 0.008), foreign-born (Δ = 0.61 log10, p = 0.004), or HIV-seronegative (Δ = 0.60 log10, p = 0.04). Higher relative IgG avidity scores to the M. tuberculosis surface were also observed in active disease patients who were BCG-vaccinated (Δ = 1.12, p<0.001) and foreign-born (Δ = 0.87, p = 0.01). Conclusions/Significance Humans with active TB disease produce antibodies to the surface of M. tuberculosis with low avidity and with a low IgG/IgM ratio.

https://openalex.org/W2026660388,"For patients with chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations are life-threatening events causing acute respiratory distress that can even lead to hospitalization and death. Although a great deal of effort has been put into research of exacerbations and potential treatment options, the exact underlying mechanisms are yet to be deciphered and no therapy that effectively targets the excessive inflammation is available. In this study, we report that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) are key mediators of neutrophilic inflammation in influenza-induced exacerbations of chronic lung inflammation. Using a mouse model of disease, our data shows a role for IL-1β in mediating lung dysfunction, and in driving neutrophilic inflammation during the whole phase of viral infection. We further report a role for IL-17A as a mediator of IL-1β induced neutrophilia at early time points during influenza-induced exacerbations. Blocking of IL-17A or IL-1 resulted in a significant abrogation of neutrophil recruitment to the airways in the initial phase of infection or at the peak of viral replication, respectively. Therefore, IL-17A and IL-1β are potential targets for therapeutic treatment of viral exacerbations of chronic lung inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2082807091,"To identify patients at risk for progressive joint damage, there is a need for early diagnostic tools to detect molecular events leading to cartilage destruction. Isolation and characterization of distinct cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) fragments derived from cartilage and released into synovial fluid will allow discrimination between different pathological conditions and monitoring of disease progression. Early detection of disease and processes in the tissue as well as an understanding of the pathologic mechanisms will also open the way for novel treatment strategies. Disease-specific COMP fragments were isolated by affinity chromatography of synovial fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or acute trauma. Enriched COMP fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric identification and characterization. Using the enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Asp-N for the digestions, an extensive analysis of the enriched fragments could be accomplished. Twelve different neoepitopes were identified and characterized within the enriched COMP fragments. For one of the neoepitopes, Ser77, an inhibition ELISA was developed. This ELISA quantifies COMP fragments clearly distinguishable from total COMP. Furthermore, fragments containing the neoepitope Ser77 were released into the culture medium of cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor)-stimulated human cartilage explants. The identified neoepitopes provide a complement to the currently available commercial assays for cartilage markers. Through neoepitope assays, tools to pinpoint disease progression, evaluation methods for therapy, and means to elucidate disease mechanisms will be provided.

In progressive joint diseases, the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and proteoglycans leads to irreversible alterations in the properties of the collagen network. In addition, the imbalance in the turnover of matrix proteins often results in increased proteolysis of molecules bound to and exposed at the surface of collagen fibers such as fibromodulin, decorin, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (3Saxne T.

Many proteases have been shown to degrade COMP, but the specific cleavage sites within COMP as well as the newly formed N and C termini have so far not been described. In this work, we identified 12 novel COMP neoepitopes and hereby describe the newly formed N- and C-terminal ends. These neoepitopes were identified through affinity enrichments of knee joint synovial fluids from patients with acute trauma, OA, and RA followed by mass spectrometric identification and characterization of the enriched COMP fragments. By using an in vitro model of joint disease, we have successfully demonstrated the presence of the COMP neoepitope 3For neoepitopes, the superscript number before the residue indicates a new N-terminal end, and the superscript number following the residue indicates a new C-terminal end. Ser77 as a released fragment from cartilage explants. We have subsequently verified that the same cleavage occurs in vivo by showing the presence of neoepitope Ser77 in the synovial fluid from 16 different patients with acute knee pain. Furthermore, an inhibition ELISA was developed for the neoepitope Ser77 that specifically distinguished and quantified this neoepitope from total COMP. Ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), dithiothreitol (DTT), formic acid, iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synovial fluid was aspirated from knees of patients with acute knee pain with or without acute trauma (seeking care at the emergency room within the 1st week), established OA, and established RA (Table 1). The use of patient samples was approved by The Ethical Committee in Lund, Sweden (411/2005).

The procedure was approved by the Office of Research Affairs at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center and the Committee on Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The mouse monoclonal antibody (2D3) toward the N-terminal domain of COMP was described previously (24Geng H. Nandakumar K.S. Pramhed A. Aspberg A. Mattsson R. Holmdahl R.

The mouse monoclonal antibody toward the thrombospondin type III domain (TSP-III) was developed in house (26Heinegård, D., (February 7, 2012) U. S. Patent 8,110,663Google Scholar). The C-terminal antibody used in Western blots was a peptide antibody toward the last 15 amino acids in human COMP raised in goat (27Hesselstrand R. Kassner A. Heinegård D. Saxne T. COMP: a candidate molecule in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis with a potential as a disease marker.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2008; 67: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Neoepitope antibodies were raised using immunogenic peptides containing the 5-mer neoepitope cleavage site followed by three glycine residues and one cysteine coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). For antibody affinity purification, the peptide CDACGMQQS77 (internal cysteine was alkylated) was immobilized to SulfoLink coupling resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The column was equilibrated with HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) prior to incubation for 1 h at room temperature with crude neoepitope sera. The column was washed with 15 ml of HBS and 2 ml of HBS with 1 m NaCl before elution of antibodies using 3 m potassium thiocyanate. The eluate was immediately desalted on a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HBS. For affinity enrichments, mouse monoclonal antibodies toward the N-terminal domain (2D3) or toward the TSP-III domain were coupled to MiniLeak gel according to the manufacturer's protocol (KemEnTec, Denmark). Synovial fluid from a patient with acute trauma was diluted with 2 volumes of PBS I (20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.8% (w/v) SDS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Excess SDS was neutralized by addition of 1 volume of 4% Triton X-100 in PBS I and incubated overnight at room temperature. In small scale enrichment of synovial fluid without SDS, the same fragments were enriched (data not shown), and thus SDS was omitted. Synovial fluids from patients with OA and RA were incubated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide prior to centrifugation for 20 min at 1000 × g at room temperature. To diminish unspecific binding to the MiniLeak gel, the synovial fluid samples were first passed through a column containing MiniLeak gel without any bound antibody. The flow-through was then applied to the affinity column with the N-terminal antibody, and subsequently the flow-through from the N-terminal affinity column was applied to the affinity column with the TSP-III domain antibody. The columns were washed with HBS, HBS with 0.5 m NaCl, and finally HBS. Bound proteins were eluted using 0.1 m citrate, pH 3 and immediately neutralized with 1.5 m Tris, pH 8.8. Eluted fractions were precipitated with ethanol overnight at 4 °C and collected by centrifugation (13,200 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The pellets were reprecipitated in ethanol with 50 mm sodium acetate for 4 h at −20 °C and collected by centrifugation (13,200 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) prior to SDS-PAGE. The precipitate pellets were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) without reducing agent and separated on 4–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Triplicate bands from each eluate were digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Asp-N as described below. In screening synovial fluids, samples were diluted 10× with non-reducing sample buffer and separated by 4–16% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Thermo Scientific) at 100 V for 1 h in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 3% (w/v) BSA in T-TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Primary antibodies were diluted in T-TBS with 3% (w/v) BSA (monoclonal antibodies, 10,000× dilution; polyclonal antibodies, 1000× dilution) and incubated either for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. As secondary antibody either goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA); both were diluted 10,000× in T-TBS with 3% BSA. Immunoblots were visualized using SuperSignal® WestDura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) on a luminescence image analyzer (Fuji Film LAS-1000). After staining overnight with blue silver stain (29Candiano G. Bruschi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetti P.G. Blue silver: a very sensitive colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining for proteome analysis.Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), bands of interest were excised and reduced with 10 mm DTT at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature (dark). Bands were digested overnight at 37 °C with either 20 ng/μl trypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50 ng/μl chymotrypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3, or 40 ng/μl Asp-N in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8. Peptides were extracted consecutively with 1% TFA, twice with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA, and 100% acetonitrile. After drying, the extracted peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% TFA and purified on C18 stage tips (22Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Stop and go extraction tips for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, nanoelectrospray, and LC/MS sample pretreatment in proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Purified peptide samples were redissolved in 0.2% formic acid and analyzed on an Esquire HCT IonTrap (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) as described (30Önnerfjord P. Khabut A. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Heinegård D. Quantitative proteomic analysis of eight cartilaginous tissues reveals characteristic differences as well as similarities between subgroups.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18913-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Database searches were performed using Mascot (version 2.1) MS/MS Ions Search in the UniProtKB (2010_09) database. Mascot search parameters included carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and deamidation (Asn and Gln) and oxidation (Met) as variable modifications. Other Mascot search parameters were monoisotopic masses, ±0.4-Da peptide mass tolerance, ±0.4-Da fragment mass tolerance, maximum of three missed cleavages, minimum ion score of 20, and taxonomy of Homo sapiens. Database searches using semi-style cleavages were used to identify peptides containing a neoepitope end. The peptide ends not representing a tryptic, chymotryptic, or Asp-N cleavage are referred to as the neoepitopes. To remove false positive neoepitopes caused by unspecificity of the proteases used, recombinant COMP was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Asp-N. Only for chymotrypsin were three neoepitopes found in the control samples (data not shown), and these were removed from the resulting summary of neoepitopes. An inhibition ELISA was developed for the neoepitope Ser77 and was used to quantify synovial fluid samples from patients with RA, OA, and acute trauma. The peptide CDACGMQQS77 (internal cysteine was alkylated) was cross-linked to BSA using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Coating concentrations and buffers were optimized (data not shown), and binding plates were prepared by coating 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno plates, Maxisorp, Nunc Intermed Ltd., Copenhagen, Denmark) with 50 μl of BSA-cross-linked peptide (12.5 ng/ml in PBS II (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) overnight. Coated wells were washed with 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 and blocked with 120 μl of 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS II for 1 h. A protein fragment containing the N-terminal part of COMP (amino acids 20–77) and ending at neoepitope Ser77 was a generous gift provided by Dr. Tobias Gustavsson (The Novo Nordisk Foundation, Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark). The protein fragment, labeled NT-Ser77, was reduced and alkylated as described above prior to use. Standard NT-Ser77 (2 μg/ml to 15.6 ng/ml) and synovial fluids (diluted 40×) were diluted in a solution of 0.5% BSA, 0.8% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm EDTA in incubation buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 8 mm sodium phosphate, 1.5 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight in a Sterilin plate (Bibby Sterilin Ltd., UK). One volume of affinity-purified neoepitope Ser77 antibody (0.1 ng/ml) in 4% Triton X-100 in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 was added to the Sterilin plates. After 1-h preincubation, 50 μl of the mixture was added to the coated wells of the Nunc plate. The plate was incubated for 1 h prior to washing, and bound antibodies were detected by the addition of 50 μl of swine anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase (Dako A/S, Denmark) diluted 1:1000 in 2 mg/ml BSA, incubation buffer with 0.05% Tween 20. After 1-h incubation, the plates were washed, and 100 μl of substrate was added (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8 containing 0.5 m MgCl2). The absorbance of each sample and standard was measured at 405 nm in duplicate by a microplate reader (Expert96, AsysHitech, Austria). The Mikrowin 200 software program (AsysHitech) was used to plot the calibration curve and to calculate the amount of COMP neoepitope in the samples. Total COMP was measured in the same synovial fluid samples (diluted 40× or 80×) according to the manufacturer's protocol (AnaMar AB, Lund, Sweden). Full thickness human knee cartilage explants (3-mm diameter, ∼1.5 mm thick) were obtained using a dermal punch. Disks were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES buffer, 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (10 μg/ml, 5.5 μg/ml, and 5 ng/ml, respectively), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.4 mm proline, 20 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator prior to treatment. After 2 days of equilibration, groups of cartilage explants were cultured with an added cytokine mixture consisting of 100 ng/ml TNF-α, 50 ng/ml IL-6, and 250 ng/ml sIL-6R as described previously (31Sui Y.

Control explants were maintained in culture medium as above with no cytokines added. Medium changes were carried out every 3 days, and used medium was collected for analysis at each time point between day 3 and day 21 during the 21-day culture. Data from neoepitope Ser77 ELISA did not show a Gaussian distribution so all statistical tests used were non-parametric. Data are presented as median values with interquartile range. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using unpaired Mann-Whitney U test in GraphPad Prism Version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Using mouse monoclonal antibodies toward the N-terminal coiled coil domain and the thrombospondin type III domain, affinity enrichments of synovial fluids from patients with joint disease were performed. Mass spectrometric characterization of the enriched COMP fragments resulted in the identification of 12 novel neoepitopes (Table 2). Peptides ending with an amino acid other than those formed by the proteases used (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Asp-N) are referred to as neoepitopes. The ending amino acids of the neoepitopes are superscripted.TABLE 2COMP neoepitopes identified in synovial fluid from patients with AT, OA, and RAPeptide identified by MSSynovial fluidDigesting enzymeNeoepitope amino acidIon score (n)NTVMECDACGMQQS77↓VRATTrypsinSer7764 (1)LH↓91CAPGFCFPGVACIQTESGAROATrypsin91Cys33 (1)IQ↓105TESGARCGPCPAGFRACT105Thr41 (2)PN↓195SVCINTRGSFRACT195Ser32 (4)QVCTDINECETGQHNCVPNSVCINTRG202↓SFOATrypsinGly20222 (1)QCGPCQPGFVGDQASGCQRRAQ226↓RFRACTGln22648 (3)PE↓523NAEVTLTDFROATrypsin523Asn57 (1)IDVCPENAEVTLTDF531↓RAATTrypsinPhe53152 (1)VL↓555NQGREIVQTMNSRA, OAAsp-N555Asn43 (3)EIVQTMNSDPGLAVGY574↓TAOATrypsinTyr57438 (2)EIVQTMNSDPGLAVGYTAF577↓NGOATrypsinPhe57738 (2)HT↓658GDTESQVRLLWKRAAsp-N658Gly26 (1) Open table in a new tab In summary, two neoepitopes were identified in synovial fluid from a patient with acute trauma (Ser77 and Phe531), six were identified in synovial fluid from a patient with OA (91Cys, G202, 523Asn, 555Asn, Tyr574, and Phe577), and five were identified in synovial fluid from a patient with RA (Thr105, 195Ser, Gln226, 555Asn, and 658Gly). Six of the neoepitopes contain a new C-terminal end (Ser77, Gly202, Gln226, Phe531, Tyr574, and Phe577), and six contain a new N-terminal end (91Cys, 105Thr, 195Ser, 523Asn, 555Asn, and 658Gly). Furthermore, six of the neoepitopes (Ser77, 91Cys, 105Thr, 195Ser, Gly202, and Gln226) are located between the N-terminal and the thrombospondin type III domains, whereas the other six neoepitopes (523Asn, Phe531, 555Asn, Tyr574, Phe577, and 658Gly) are located within or in close proximity to the C-terminal globular domain.

https://openalex.org/W2027088029,"Accurate mitosis requires the chromosomal passenger protein complex (CPC) containing Aurora B kinase, borealin, INCENP, and survivin, which orchestrates chromosome dynamics. However, the chromatin factors that specify the CPC to the centromere remain elusive. Here we show that borealin interacts directly with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and that this interaction is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved PXVXL motif in the C-terminal borealin with the chromo shadow domain of HP1. This borealin-HP1 interaction recruits the CPC to the centromere and governs an activation of Aurora B kinase judged by phosphorylation of Ser-7 in CENP-A, a substrate of Aurora B. Consistently, modulation of the motif PXVXL leads to defects in CPC centromere targeting and aberrant Aurora B activity. On the other hand, the localization of the CPC in the midzone is independent of the borealin-HP1 interaction, demonstrating the spatial requirement of HP1 in CPC localization to the centromere. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized but direct link between HP1 and CPC localization in the centromere and illustrate the critical role of borealin-HP1 interaction in orchestrating an accurate cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2137613347,"Chronic Fatigue (CF) still remains unclear about its etiology, pathophysiology, nomenclature and diagnostic criteria in the medical community. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) adopts a unique diagnostic method, namely 'bian zheng lun zhi' or syndrome differentiation, to diagnose the CF with a set of syndrome factors, which can be regarded as the Multi-Label Learning (MLL) problem in the machine learning literature. To obtain an effective and reliable diagnostic tool, we use Conformal Predictor (CP), Random Forest (RF) and Problem Transformation method (PT) for the syndrome differentiation of CF.In this work, using PT method, CP-RF is extended to handle MLL problem. CP-RF applies RF to measure the confidence level (p-value) of each label being the true label, and then selects multiple labels whose p-values are larger than the pre-defined significance level as the region prediction. In this paper, we compare the proposed CP-RF with typical CP-NBC(Naïve Bayes Classifier), CP-KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) and ML-KNN on CF dataset, which consists of 736 cases. Specifically, 95 symptoms are used to identify CF, and four syndrome factors are employed in the syndrome differentiation, including 'spleen deficiency', 'heart deficiency', 'liver stagnation' and 'qi deficiency'.CP-RF demonstrates an outstanding performance beyond CP-NBC, CP-KNN and ML-KNN under the general metrics of subset accuracy, hamming loss, one-error, coverage, ranking loss and average precision. Furthermore, the performance of CP-RF remains steady at the large scale of confidence levels from 80% to 100%, which indicates its robustness to the threshold determination. In addition, the confidence evaluation provided by CP is valid and well-calibrated.CP-RF not only offers outstanding performance but also provides valid confidence evaluation for the CF syndrome differentiation. It would be well applicable to TCM practitioners and facilitate the utilities of objective, effective and reliable computer-based diagnosis tool."
https://openalex.org/W1963543877,"Identification of the deformation mechanisms and specific components underlying the mechanical function of biological tissues requires mechanical testing at multiple levels within the tissue hierarchical structure. Dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein (DTAF) is a fluorescent dye that is used to visualize microscale deformations of the extracellular matrix in soft collagenous tissues. However, the DTAF concentrations commonly employed in previous multiscale experiments (≥2000 µg/ml) may alter tissue mechanics. The objective of this study was to determine whether DTAF affects tendon fascicle mechanics and if a concentration threshold exists below which any observed effects are negligible. This information is valuable for guiding the continued use of this fluorescent dye in future experiments and for interpreting the results of previous work. Incremental strain testing demonstrated that high DTAF concentrations (≥100 µg/ml) increase the quasi-static modulus and yield strength of rat tail tendon fascicles while reducing their viscoelastic behavior. Subsequent multiscale testing and modeling suggests that these effects are due to a stiffening of the collagen fibrils and strengthening of the interfibrillar matrix. Despite these changes in tissue behavior, the fundamental deformation mechanisms underlying fascicle mechanics appear to remain intact, which suggests that conclusions from previous multiscale investigations of strain transfer are still valid. The effects of lower DTAF concentrations (≤10 µg/ml) on tendon mechanics were substantially smaller and potentially negligible; nevertheless, no concentration was found that did not at least slightly alter the tissue behavior. Therefore, future studies should either reduce DTAF concentrations as much as possible or use other dyes/techniques for measuring microscale deformations."
https://openalex.org/W1989206573,"Assessments of climate change and food security often do not consider changes to crop production as a function of altered pest pressures. Evaluation of potential changes may be difficult, in part, because management practices are routinely utilized in situ to minimize pest injury. If so, then such practices, should, in theory, also change with climate, although this has never been quantified. Chemical (pesticide) applications remain the primary means of managing pests in industrialized countries. While a wide range of climate variables can influence chemical use, minimum daily temperature (lowest 24 h recorded temperature in a given year) can be associated with the distribution and thermal survival of many agricultural pests in temperate regions. The current study quantifies average pesticide applications since 1999 for commercial soybean grown over a 2100 km North-South latitudinal transect for seven states that varied in minimum daily temperature (1999–2013) from −28.6°C (Minnesota) to −5.1°C (Louisiana). Although soybean yields (per hectare) did not vary by state, total pesticide applications (kg of active ingredient, ai, per hectare) increased from 4.3 to 6.5 over this temperature range. Significant correlations were observed between minimum daily temperatures and kg of ai for all pesticide classes. This suggested that minimum daily temperature could serve as a proxy for pesticide application. Longer term temperature data (1977–2013) indicated greater relative increases in minimum daily temperatures for northern relative to southern states. Using these longer-term trends to determine short-term projections of pesticide use (to 2023) showed a greater comparative increase in herbicide use for soybean in northern; but a greater increase in insecticide and fungicide use for southern states in a warmer climate. Overall, these data suggest that increases in pesticide application rates may be a means to maintain soybean production in response to rising minimum daily temperatures and potential increases in pest pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2028802640,"TRPM8, a nonselective cation channel activated by cold, voltage, and cooling compounds such as menthol, is the principal molecular detector of cold temperatures in primary sensory neurons of the somatosensory system. The N-terminal domain of TRPM8 consists of 693 amino acids, but little is known about its contribution to channel function. Here, we identified two distinct regions within the initial N terminus of TRPM8 that contribute differentially to channel activity and proper folding and assembly. Deletion or substitution of the first 40 residues yielded channels with augmented responses to cold and menthol. The thermal threshold of activation of these mutants was shifted 2 °C to higher temperatures, and the menthol dose-response curve was displaced to lower concentrations. Site-directed mutagenesis screening revealed that single point mutations at positions Ser-26 or Ser-27 by proline caused a comparable increase in the responses to cold and menthol. Electrophysiological analysis of the S27P mutant revealed that the enhanced sensitivity to agonists is related to a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, increasing the probability of channel openings at physiological membrane potentials. In addition, we found that the region encompassing positions 40-60 is a key element in the proper folding and assembly of TRPM8. Different deletions and mutations within this region rendered channels with an impaired function that are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results suggest a critical contribution of the initial region of the N-terminal domain of TRPM8 to thermal and chemical sensitivity and the proper biogenesis of this polymodal ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2064418342,"Patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) have elevated circulating levels of IgA1 with some O-glycans consisting of galactose (Gal)-deficient N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with or without N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc). We have analyzed O-glycosylation heterogeneity of naturally asialo-IgA1 (Ale) myeloma protein that mimics Gal-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) of patients with IgAN, except that IgA1 O-glycans of IgAN patients are frequently sialylated. Specifically, serum IgA1 of healthy controls has more α2,3-sialylated O-glycans (NeuAc attached to Gal) than α2,6-sialylated O-glycans (NeuAc attached to GalNAc). As IgA1-producing cells from IgAN patients have an increased activity of α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc), we hypothesize that such activity may promote premature sialylation of GalNAc and, thus, production of Gd-IgA1, as sialylation of GalNAc prevents subsequent Gal attachment. Distribution of NeuAc in IgA1 O-glycans may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAN. To better understand biological functions of NeuAc in IgA1, we established protocols for enzymatic sialylation leading to α2,3- or α2,6-sialylation of IgA1 O-glycans. Sialylation of Gal-deficient asialo-IgA1 (Ale) myeloma protein by an ST6GalNAc enzyme generated sialylated IgA1 that mimics the Gal-deficient IgA1 glycoforms in patients with IgAN, characterized by α2,6-sialylated Gal-deficient GalNAc. In contrast, sialylation of the same myeloma protein by an α2,3-sialyltransferase yielded IgA1 typical for healthy controls, characterized by α2,3-sialylated Gal. The GalNAc-specific lectin from Helix aspersa (HAA) is used to measure levels of Gd-IgA1. We assessed HAA binding to IgA1 sialylated at Gal or GalNAc. As expected, α2,6-sialylation of IgA1 markedly decreased reactivity with HAA. Notably, α2,3-sialylation also decreased reactivity with HAA. Neuraminidase treatment recovered the original HAA reactivity in both instances. These results suggest that binding of a GalNAc-specific lectin is modulated by sialylation of GalNAc as well as Gal in the clustered IgA1 O-glycans. Thus, enzymatic sialylation offers a useful model to test the role of NeuAc in reactivities of the clustered O-glycans with lectins."
https://openalex.org/W2081978819,"Purines and pyrimidines are complementary bases of the genetic code. The roles of purines and their derivatives in cellular signal transduction and energy metabolism are well-known. In contrast, the roles of pyrimidines and their derivatives in cellular function remain poorly understood. In this study, the roles of uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside, in liver metabolism are examined in mice. We report that short-term uridine administration in C57BL/6J mice increases liver protein glycosylation profiles, reduces phosphorylation level of insulin signaling proteins, and activates the HRI-eIF-2α-ATF4 heme-deficiency stress response pathway. Short-term uridine administration is also associated with reduced liver hemin level and reduced ability for insulin-stimulated blood glucose removal during an insulin tolerance test. Some of the short-term effects of exogenous uridine in C57BL/6J mice are conserved in transgenic UPase1-/- mice with long-term elevation of endogenous uridine level. UPase1-/- mice exhibit activation of the liver HRI-eIF-2α-ATF4 heme-deficiency stress response pathway. UPase1-/- mice also exhibit impaired ability for insulin-stimulated blood glucose removal. However, other short-term effects of exogenous uridine in C57BL/6J mice are not conserved in UPase1-/- mice. UPase1-/- mice exhibit normal phosphorylation level of liver insulin signaling proteins and increased liver hemin concentration compared to untreated control C57BL/6J mice. Contrasting short-term and long-term consequences of uridine on liver metabolism suggest that uridine exerts transient effects and elicits adaptive responses. Taken together, our data support potential roles of pyrimidines and their derivatives in the regulation of liver metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2043409184,"Ninjurin1 is involved in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, by mediating leukocyte extravasation, a process that depends on homotypic binding. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of Ninjurin1 during inflammation are largely undefined. We therefore examined the pro-migratory function of Ninjurin1 and its regulatory mechanisms in macrophages. Interestingly, Ninjurin1-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibited reduced membrane protrusion formation and dynamics, resulting in the impairment of cell motility. Furthermore, exogenous Ninjurin1 was distributed at the membrane of filopodial structures in Raw264.7 macrophage cells. In Raw264.7 cells, RNA interference of Ninjurin1 reduced the number of filopodial projections, whereas overexpression of Ninjurin1 facilitated their formation and thus promoted cell motility. Ninjurin1-induced filopodial protrusion formation required the activation of Rac1. In Raw264.7 cells penetrating an MBEC4 endothelial cell monolayer, Ninjurin1 was localized to the membrane of protrusions and promoted their formation, suggesting that Ninjurin1-induced protrusive activity contributed to transendothelial migration. Taking these data together, we conclude that Ninjurin1 enhances macrophage motility and consequent extravasation of immune cells through the regulation of protrusive membrane dynamics. We expect these findings to provide insight into the understanding of immune responses mediated by Ninjurin1."
https://openalex.org/W2051362158,"Background Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remains a major cause of mortality in the United Kingdom. Yet predictions of future CHD mortality are potentially problematic due to population ageing and increase in obesity and diabetes. Here we explore future projections of CHD mortality in England & Wales under two contrasting future trend assumptions. Methods In scenario A, we used the conventional counterfactual scenario that the last-observed CHD mortality rates from 2011 would persist unchanged to 2030. The future number of deaths was calculated by applying those rates to the 2012–2030 population estimates. In scenario B, we assumed that the recent falling trend in CHD mortality rates would continue. Using Lee-Carter and Bayesian Age Period Cohort (BAPC) models, we projected the linear trends up to 2030. We validate our methods using past data to predict mortality from 2002–2011. Then, we computed the error between observed and projected values. Results In scenario A, assuming that 2011 mortality rates stayed constant by 2030, the number of CHD deaths would increase 62% or approximately 39,600 additional deaths. In scenario B, assuming recent declines continued, the BAPC model (the model with lowest error) suggests the number of deaths will decrease by 56%, representing approximately 36,200 fewer deaths by 2030. Conclusions The decline in CHD mortality has been reasonably continuous since 1979, and there is little reason to believe it will soon halt. The commonly used assumption that mortality will remain constant from 2011 therefore appears slightly dubious. By contrast, using the BAPC model and assuming continuing mortality falls offers a more plausible prediction of future trends. Thus, despite population ageing, the number of CHD deaths might halve again between 2011 and 2030. This has implications for how the potential benefits of future cardiovascular strategies might best be calculated and presented."
https://openalex.org/W2085665501,"Recent data support a role for SHARP1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription repressor, in the regulation of malignant cell behavior in several human cancers. However, the expression and role of SHARP1 during the development of endometrial cancer (EC) remain unclear. Here we show that upregulation of SHARP1 suppressed tumor angiogenesis by decreasing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), inhibited cell viability and tumor growth in EC. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of SHARP1 was negatively correlated with tumor stage, histological grade, myometrial invasion, lymph node metastasis, blood vessel permeation in the myometrium and HIF-1α expression. Mechanistic studies showed that SHARP1 interacted with HIF-1α physically, and the protein level of HIF-1α and the mRNA level of its target genes (VEGFA, ANGPTL4 and CA9) were decreased by SHARP1 under hypoxia. Upregulation of SHARP1 in EC impeded hypoxia-induced angiogenesis by reducing VEGF secretion. Immunohistochemical analysis verified a correlation between decreased SHARP1 expression and increased microvessel density in EC tissues. Additionally, SHARP1 inhibited cell viability in EC cell lines. Overexpression of SHARP1 in vivo inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis, and decreased HIF-1α expression. In this study, we established SHARP1 as a novel tumor suppressor of EC and shed light on the mechanisms by how SHARP1 inhibited EC progression. Therefore, SHARP1 may be a valuable prognostic biomarker for EC progression and shows promise as a new potential target for antiangiogenic therapeutics in human EC."

These are the first structures of a functionally characterized metal-dependent hydrolase of this fold. Isatin hydrolase converts isatin to isatinate and belongs to a novel family of metalloenzymes that include the bacterial kynurenine formamidase. The product state, mimicked by bound thioisatinate, reveals a water molecule that bridges the thioisatinate to a proton wire in an adjacent water channel and thus allows the proton released by the reaction to escape only when the product is formed. The functional proton wire present in isatin hydrolase isoform b represents a unique catalytic feature common to all hydrolases is here trapped and visualized for the first time. The local molecular environment required to coordinate thioisatinate allows stronger and more confident identification of orthologous genes encoding isatin hydrolases within the prokaryotic kingdom.

Our aim was to investigate the inflammatory pathways elicited after intraluminal administration of poly I:C and determine acute and delayed consequences of this locally induced immune activation. Intraluminal poly I:C induced rapid mucosal immune activation in C57BL/6 mice involving IFNβ and the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, that may drive inflammation towards a Th1 profile. Intraluminal poly I:C also caused enteropathy and gut dysfunction in gliadin-sensitive NOD-DQ8 mice, and this was prolonged by concomitant oral administration of gliadin. Our results indicate that small intestine pathology can be induced in mice by intraluminal administration of poly I:C and that this is exacerbated by subsequent oral delivery of a relevant dietary antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2094385715,"In eukaryotes, there are three major RNA polymerases (Pol) in the nucleus, which are commonly described as transcribing non-overlapping subsets of genes. Structural studies have highlighted a conserved core shared among all three transcription systems. Initiation of human Pol III from TATA box-containing Pol II promoters under conditions with impaired Pol II transcription activity have been described previously. RNA polymerase III and Pol II were found to co-localize at the promoters of the c-myc gene and the RPPH1 sRNA in vivo. Here, I report that Pol III can, like Pol II, initiate transcription from most tested Pol II core promoters when assayed with crude human nuclear extracts (HSK, SNF, or Dignam). Both polymerases often initiate from the same transcription start site, and depend on a TATA box or AT-rich region but not the downstream promoter element (DPE) or the motif ten element (MTE). Moderate (∼2-fold) changes in the ratio of DNA template to nuclear extract were sufficient to change Pol II-mediated transcription to a mixture of Pol II- and Pol III-, or to a solely Pol III-dependent initiation of transcription from Pol II promoters. Polymerase specificity is thus not fixed but a variable that depends on the properties of the promoter and the transcription conditions. These findings provide functional evidence for a close similarity between the Pol II and Pol III transcription complexes, and additionally explain previous controversies in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2099000167,"The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), comprised of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclins T1 (CycT1) or T2 (CycT2), activates eukaryotic transcription elongation. In growing cells, P-TEFb exists in active and inactive forms. In the latter, it is incorporated into the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, which contains hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced proteins (HEXIM) 1 or 2, La-related protein 7 (LaRP7), methyl phosphate capping enzyme, and 7SK small nuclear RNA (7SK). HEXIM1 inhibits the kinase activity of CDK9 via interactions between 7SK, HEXIM1, and CycT1. LaRP7 and methyl phosphate capping enzyme interact with 7SK independently of HEXIM1 and P-TEFb. To analyze genetic interactions between HEXIM1 and/or LaRP7 and 7SK using a cell-based system, we established artificial heterologous RNA tethering assays in which reporter gene expression depended on interactions between selected regions of 7SK and its cognate binding partners fused to a strong activator. This system enabled us to map the HEXIM1- and LaRP7- binding regions of 7SK. Assays with various mutant 7SK plasmid targets revealed that the 5'U-Ubulge and central loop of stem-loop I or RNA motif 3 of 7SK are required for transactivation, suggesting that HEXIM1 and CycT1 form a combinatorial binding surface for 7SK. Moreover, a region in HEXIM1 C-terminal to its previously mapped RNA-binding motif was also required for interactions between HEXIM1 and 7SK. Finally, a tyrosine-to-alanine mutation in HEXIM1, which is critical for its inhibitory effect on CDK9, changed HEXIM1 into an activator. These cell-based assays elucidate this important aspect of transcription elongation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2073516844,"Because the nature of the main resource that limits bacterioplankton (e.g. organic carbon [C] or phosphorus [P]) has biogeochemical implications concerning organic C accumulation in freshwater ecosystems, empirical knowledge is needed concerning how bacteria respond to these two resources, available alone or together. We performed field experiments of resource manipulation (2×2 factorial design, with the addition of C, P, or both combined) in two Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems with contrasting trophic states (oligotrophy vs. eutrophy) and trophic natures (autotrophy vs. heterotrophy, measured as gross primary production:respiration ratio). Overall, the two resources synergistically co-limited bacterioplankton, i.e. the magnitude of the response of bacterial production and abundance to the two resources combined was higher than the additive response in both ecosystems. However, bacteria also responded positively to single P and C additions in the eutrophic ecosystem, but not to single C in the oligotrophic one, consistent with the value of the ratio between bacterial C demand and algal C supply. Accordingly, the trophic nature rather than the trophic state of the ecosystems proves to be a key feature determining the expected types of resource co-limitation of bacteria, as summarized in a proposed theoretical framework. The actual types of co-limitation shifted over time and partially deviated (a lesser degree of synergism) from the theoretical expectations, particularly in the eutrophic ecosystem. These deviations may be explained by extrinsic ecological forces to physiological limitations of bacteria, such as predation, whose role in our experiments is supported by the relationship between the dynamics of bacteria and bacterivores tested by SEMs (structural equation models). Our study, in line with the increasingly recognized role of freshwater ecosystems in the global C cycle, suggests that further attention should be focussed on the biotic interactions that modulate resource co-limitation of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2077006885,"Enzymatic activation of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) requires not only binding of a catalytic copper ion but also formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. Indeed, the disulfide bond is completely conserved among all species possessing SOD1; however, it remains obscure how disulfide formation controls the enzymatic activity of SOD1. Here, we show that disulfide formation is a primary event in the folding process of prokaryotic SOD1 (SodC) localized to the periplasmic space. Escherichia coli SodC was found to attain β-sheet structure upon formation of the disulfide bond, whereas disulfide-reduced SodC assumed little secondary structure even in the presence of copper and zinc ions. Moreover, reduction of the disulfide bond made SodC highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. We thus propose that the thiol-disulfide status in SodC controls the intracellular stability of this antioxidant enzyme and that the oxidizing environment of the periplasm is required for the enzymatic activation of SodC."
https://openalex.org/W2099461886,"We investigated the distribution of bioluminescent dinoflagellates in the Patagonian Shelf region using ""universal"" PCR primers for the dinoflagellate luciferase gene. Luciferase gene sequences and single cell PCR tests, in conjunction with taxonomic identification by microscopy, allowed us to identify and quantify bioluminescent dinoflagellates. We compared these data to coincidental discrete optical measurements of stimulable bioluminescence intensity. Molecular detection of the luciferase gene showed that bioluminescent dinoflagellates were widespread across the majority of the Patagonian Shelf region. Their presence was comparatively underestimated by optical bioluminescence measurements, whose magnitude was affected by interspecific differences in bioluminescence intensity and by the presence of other bioluminescent organisms. Molecular and microscopy data showed that the complex hydrography of the area played an important role in determining the distribution and composition of dinoflagellate populations. Dinoflagellates were absent south of the Falkland Islands where the cold, nutrient-rich, and well-mixed waters of the Falklands Current favoured diatoms instead. Diverse populations of dinoflagellates were present in the warmer, more stratified waters of the Patagonian Shelf and Falklands Current as it warmed northwards. Here, the dinoflagellate population composition could be related to distinct water masses. Our results provide new insight into the prevalence of bioluminescent dinoflagellates in Patagonian Shelf waters and demonstrate that a molecular approach to the detection of bioluminescent dinoflagellates in natural waters is a promising tool for ecological studies of these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2089450643,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were largely generated after myocardial ischemia, severely impaired the adhesion and survival of transplanted stem cells. In this study, we aimed to determine whether Exendin-4 pretreatment could improve the adhesion and therapeutic efficacy of transplanted adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) in ischemic myocardium. In vitro, H2O2 was used to provide ROS environments, in which ADSCs pretreated with Exendin-4 were incubated. ADSCs without pretreatment were used as control. Then, cell adhesion and viability were analyzed with time. Compared with control ADSCs, Exendin-4 treatment significantly increased the adhesion of ADSCs in ROS environment, while reduced intracellular ROS and cell injury as determined by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining live/Dead staining, lactate dehydrogenase-release assay and MTT assay. Western Blotting demonstrated that ROS significantly decreased the expression of adhesion-related integrins and integrin-related focal adhesion proteins, which were significantly reversed by Exendin-4 pretreatment and followed by decreases in caspase-3, indicating that Exendin-4 may facilitate cell survival through enhanced adhesion. In vivo, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by the left anterior descending artery ligation in SD rats. Autologous ADSCs with or without Exendin-4 pretreatment were injected into the border area of infarcted hearts, respectively. Multi-techniques were used to assess the beneficial effects after transplantation. Longitudinal bioluminescence imaging and histological staining revealed that Exendin-4 pretreatment enhanced the survival and differentiation of engrafted ADSCs in ischemic myocardium, accompanied with significant benefits in cardiac function, matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis compared with non-pretreated ADSCs 4 weeks post-transplantation. In conclusion, transplantation of Exendin-4 pretreated ADSCs significantly improved cardiac performance and can be an innovative approach in the clinical perspective."
https://openalex.org/W1982773426,"The biosynthesis of ether lipids and wax esters requires as precursors fatty alcohols, which are synthesized by fatty acyl reductases (FARs). The presence of ether glycerolipids as well as branched wax esters has been reported in several free-living ciliate protozoa. In the genome of Tetrahymena thermophila, the only ORF sharing similarities with FARs is fused to an acyltransferase-like domain, whereas, in most other organisms, FARs are monofunctional proteins of similar size and domain structure. Here, we used heterologous expression in plant and yeast to functionally characterize the activities catalyzed by this protozoan protein. Transient expression in tobacco epidermis of a truncated form fused to the green fluorescence protein followed by confocal microscopy analysis suggested peroxisomal localization. In vivo approaches conducted in yeast indicated that the N-terminal FAR-like domain produced both 16:0 and 18:0 fatty alcohols, whereas the C-terminal acyltransferase-like domain was able to rescue the lethal phenotype of the yeast double mutant gat1Δ gat2Δ. Using in vitro approaches, we further demonstrated that this domain is a dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase that uses preferentially 16:0-coenzyme A as an acyl donor. Finally, coexpression in yeast with the alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase from T. thermophila resulted the detection of various glycerolipids with an ether bond, indicating reconstitution of the ether lipid biosynthetic pathway. Together, these results demonstrate that this FAR-like protein is peroxisomal and bifunctional, providing both substrates required by alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase to initiate ether lipid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1998379414,"In the ciliary epithelium of the eye, the pigmented cells express the α1β1 isoform of Na,K-ATPase, whereas the non-pigmented cells express mainly the α2β3 isoform of Na,K-ATPase. In principle, a Na,K-ATPase inhibitor with selectivity for α2 could effectively reduce intraocular pressure with only minimal local and systemic toxicity. Such an inhibitor could be applied topically provided it was sufficiently permeable via the cornea. Previous experiments with recombinant human α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 isoforms showed that the classical cardiac glycoside, digoxin, is partially α2-selective and also that the trisdigitoxose moiety is responsible for isoform selectivity. This led to a prediction that modification of the third digitoxose might increase α2 selectivity. A series of perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin have been synthesized by periodate oxidation and reductive amination using a variety of R-NH2 substituents. Several derivatives show enhanced selectivity for α2 over α1, close to 8-fold in the best case. Effects of topically applied cardiac glycosides on intraocular pressure in rabbits have been assessed by their ability to either prevent or reverse acute intraocular pressure increases induced by 4-aminopyridine or a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor. Two relatively α2-selective digoxin derivatives efficiently normalize the ocular hypertension, by comparison with digoxin, digoxigenin, or ouabain. This observation is consistent with a major role of α2 in aqueous humor production and suggests that, potentially, α2-selective digoxin derivatives could be of interest as novel drugs for control of intraocular pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2002352505,"Listeria monocytogenes is the causative bacteria of listeriosis, which has a higher mortality rate than that of other causes of food poisoning. Listeria spp., of which L. monocytogenes is a member, have been isolated from food and manufacturing environments. Several methods have been published for identifying Listeria spp.; however, many of the methods cannot identify newly categorized Listeria spp. Additionally, they are often not suitable for the food industry, owing to their complexity, cost, or time consumption. Recently, high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA), which exploits DNA-sequence differences, has received attention as a simple and quick genomic typing method. In the present study, a new method for the simple, rapid, and low-cost identification of Listeria spp. has been presented using the genes rarA and ldh as targets for HRMA. DNA sequences of 9 Listeria species were first compared, and polymorphisms were identified for each species for primer design. Species specificity of each HRM curve pattern was estimated using type strains of all the species. Among the 9 species, 7 were identified by HRMA using rarA gene, including 3 new species. The remaining 2 species were identified by HRMA of ldh gene. The newly developed HRMA method was then used to assess Listeria isolates from the food industry, and the method efficiency was compared to that of identification by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The 2 methods were in coherence for 92.6% of the samples, demonstrating the high accuracy of HRMA. The time required for identifying Listeria spp. was substantially low, and the process was considerably simplified, providing a useful and precise method for processing multiple samples per day. Our newly developed method for identifying Listeria spp. is highly valuable; its use is not limited to the food industry, and it can be used for the isolates from the natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2086360835,"Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) plays multiple roles in bone, tooth, phosphate homeostasis, kidney, salivary gland, reproductive cycles, and the development of cancer. In vitro studies have indicated two different biological mechanisms: 1) as a matrix protein, DMP1 interacts with αvβ3 integrin and activates MAP kinase signaling; and 2) DMP1 serves as a transcription co-factor. In vivo studies have demonstrated its key role in osteocytes. This study attempted to determine whether DMP1 functions as a transcription co-factor and regulates osteoblast functions. For gene expression comparisons using adenovirus constructs, we targeted the expression of DMP1 either to the nucleus only by replacing the endogenous signal peptide with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence (referred to as (NLS)DMP1) or to the extracellular matrix as the WT type (referred to as (SP)DMP1) in MC3T3 osteoblasts. High levels of DMP1 in either form greatly increased osteogenic gene expression in an identical manner. However, the targeted (NLS)DMP1 transgene driven by a 3.6-kb rat Col 1α1 promoter in the nucleus of osteoblasts and osteocytes failed to rescue the phenotyope of Dmp1-null mice, whereas the (SP)DMP1 transgene rescued the rickets defect. These studies support the notion that DMP1 functions as an extracellular matrix protein, rather than as a transcription co-factor in vivo. We also show that DMP1 continues its expression in osteoblasts during postnatal development and that the deletion of Dmp1 leads to an increase in osteoblast proliferation. However, poor mineralization in the metaphysis indicates a critical role for DMP1 in both osteoblasts and osteocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2081172915,"Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is a necessary and causal factor of cervical cancer. Most women naturally clear HPV infections; however, the biological mechanisms related to HPV pathogenesis have not been clearly elucidated. Host genetic factors that specifically regulate immune response could play an important role. All HIV-positive women in the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS) with a HR-HPV infection and at least one follow-up biannual visit were included in the study. Cervicovaginal lavage samples were tested for HPV using type-specific HPV hybridization assays. Type-specific HPV clearance was defined as two consecutive HPV-negative tests after a positive test. DNA from participants was genotyped for 196,524 variants within 186 known immune related loci using the custom ImmunoChip microarray. To assess the influence of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with HR-HPV clearance, the Cox proportional hazards model with the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld approach was used, adjusting for CD4+ count, low risk HPV (LR-HPV) co-infection, and relevant confounders. Three analytical models were performed: race-specific (African Americans (n = 258), European Americans (n = 87), Hispanics (n = 55), race-adjusted combined analysis, and meta-analysis of pooled independent race-specific analyses. Women were followed for a median time of 1,617 days. Overall, three SNPs (rs1112085, rs11102637, and rs12030900) in the MAGI-3 gene and one SNP (rs8031627) in the SMAD3 gene were associated with HR-HPV clearance (p<10−6). A variant (rs1633038) in HLA-G were also significantly associated in African American. Results from this study support associations of immune-related genes, having potential biological mechanism, with differential cervical HR-HPV infection outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2031882024,"Fetal membranes are abundant, ethically acceptable and readily accessible sources of stem cells. In particular, the yolk sac is a source of cell lineages that do not express MHCs and are mainly free from immunological incompatibles when transferred to a recipient. Although data are available especially for hematopoietic stem cells in mice and human, whereas other cell types and species are dramatically underrepresented. Here we studied the nature and differentiation potential of yolk sac derived mesenchymal stem cells from a New World mouse, Necromys lasiurus. Explants from mid-gestation were cultured in DMEM-High glucose medium with 10% defined fetal bovine serum. The cells were characterized by standard methods including immunophenotyping by fluorescence and flow cytometry, growth and differentiation potential and tumorigenicity assays. The first adherent cells were observed after 7 days of cell culture and included small, elongated fibroblast-like cells (92.13%) and large, round epithelial-like cells with centrally located nuclei (6.5%). Only the fibroblast-like cells survived the first passages. They were positive to markers for mesenchymal stem cells (Stro-1, CD90, CD105, CD73) and pluripotency (Oct3/4, Nanog) as well as precursors of hematopoietic stem cells (CD117). In differentiation assays, they were classified as a multipotent lineage, because they differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages and, finally, they did not develop tumors. In conclusion, mesenchymal progenitor cells with multipotent differentiation potential and sufficient growth and proliferation abilities were able to be obtained from Necromys yolk sacs, therefore, we inferred that these cells may be promising for a wide range of applications in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2035294812,"Both predators and parasitoids can have significant effects on species' life history traits, such as longevity or clutch size. In the case of gall inducers, sporadically there is evidence to suggest that both vertebrate predation and insect parasitoid attack may shape the optimal gall size. While the effects of parasitoids have been studied in detail, the influence of vertebrate predation is less well-investigated. To better understand this aspect of gall size evolution, we studied vertebrate predation on galls of Diplolepis rosae on rose (Rosa canina) shrubs. We measured predation frequency, predation incidence, and predation rate in a large-scale observational field study, as well as an experimental field study. Our combined results suggest that, similarly to parasitoids, vertebrate predation makes a considerable contribution to mortality of gall inducer larvae. On the other hand, its influence on gall size is in direct contrast to the effect of parasitoids, as frequency of vertebrate predation increases with gall size. This suggests that the balance between predation and parasitoid attack shapes the optimal size of D. rosae galls."
https://openalex.org/W2038872140,"Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of progressive HIV infection and a key determinant of immunodeficiency in HIV-infected individuals. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the circulation has been implicated as a key factor in HIV infection-related systemic immune activation. We thus investigate the impact of LPS on systemic immune activation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques of Chinese origin.The animals were inoculated intravenously with SIVmac239. The levels of plasma viral load and host inflammatory cytokines in PBMC were measured by real-time RT-PCR. CD4/CD8 ratio and systemic immune activation markers were examined by flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs. White blood cell and neutrophil counts and C Reactive Protein levels were determined using biochemistry analyzer. The plasma levels of LPS were determined by Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (TAL) test.The animals inoculated with SIVmac239 became infected as evidenced by the increased plasma levels of SIV RNA and decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. LPS administration of SIV-infected animals induced a transient increase of plasma SIV RNA and immune activation, which was indicated by the elevated expression of the inflammatory cytokines and CD4+HLA-DR+ T cells in PBMCs.These data support the concept that LPS is a driving factor in systemic immune activation of HIV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2115234268,"Nuclear inclusion a (NIa) of turnip mosaic virus is a cytosolic protease that cleaves amyloid β (Aβ) when heterologously overexpressed. Lentivirus-mediated expression of NIa in the brains of APP(sw)/PS1 mice significantly reduces cerebral Aβ levels and plaque depositions, and improves behavioral deficits. Here, the effects of NIa and neprilysin (NEP), a well-known Aβ-cleaving protease, on oligomeric Aβ-induced cell death were evaluated. NIa cleaved monomeric and oligomeric Aβ at a similar rate, whereas NEP only cleaved monomeric Aβ. Oligomeric Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly ameliorated by NIa, but not by NEP. Endocytosed fluorescently-labeled Aβ localized to mitochondria, and this was significantly reduced by NIa, but not by NEP. These data suggest that NIa may exerts its protective roles by degrading Aβ and thus preventing mitochondrial deposition of Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2015394389,"Cervical cancers are ranked the second-most hazardous ailments among women worldwide. In the past two decades, microarray technologies have been applied to study genes involved in malignancy progress. However, in most of the published microarray studies, only a few genes were reported leaving rather a large amount of data unused. Also, RNA-Seq data has become more standard for transcriptome analysis and is widely applied in cancer studies. There is a growing demand for a tool to help the experimental researchers who are keen to explore cervical cancer gene therapy, but lack computer expertise to access and analyze the high throughput gene expression data.The dbCerEx database is designed to retrieve and process gene expression data from cervical cancer samples. It includes the genome wide expression profiles of cervical cancer samples, as well as a web utility to cluster genes with similar expression patterns. This feature will help researchers conduct further research to uncover novel gene functions.The dbCerEx database is freely available for non-commercial use at http://128.135.207.10/dbCerEx/, and will be updated and integrated with more features as needed."
