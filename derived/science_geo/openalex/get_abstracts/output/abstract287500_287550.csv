https://openalex.org/W2018456086,The crystal structure of metallic indium antimonide at atmospheric pressure and -197 degrees C is essentially identical with that of white tin at 26 degrees C.
https://openalex.org/W2081758291,
https://openalex.org/W2023225122,The transition of metallic indium antimonide into the superconducting state begins at 2.1 degrees K and is complete at about 1.6 degrees K. These data are close to those for white tin.

https://openalex.org/W2038980311,"The low-dose gamma irradiation of dilute aqueous pectin solutions after appropriate adjustment of pH with hydrochloric or certain other inorganic acids leads to the formation of thermoreversible gels. Maximum gel strength is attained only under optimum conditions of pH, concentration, temperature, radiation dose, and exposure time, and only in the absence of oxygen and a number of radiation protectants."
https://openalex.org/W1995876438,Aqueous suspensions of particulate organic and inorganic material were centrifuged in a 2-bromo-ethanol density gradient. The degree of separation with this new technique is superior to that achieved with sucrose density gradients.
