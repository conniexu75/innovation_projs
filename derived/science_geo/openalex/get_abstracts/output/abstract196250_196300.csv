However, two preparations, that of the elasmobranch ampullæ of Lorenzini described by Sand1 and by Hensel2 ; and that of mammalian peripheral nerve described by Bernhard and Granit3, show an anomalous transient response to temperature."

Similarly, in culture, the bloodstream trypanosomes lose their infective power and their typical shape and become transformed into the crithidial form."
https://openalex.org/W2065311862,"THE introduction of ‘Ethidium’ (I) in 1952 made available to veterinarians in Africa a drug with very high therapeutic activity against the two most important trypanosomes of cattle, Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax, and this drug is now widely used. There still seemed to be the need, however, for a drug which would confer a prolonged period of protection to dosed animals, and we have therefore, worked to this end. One particular series of drugs (II) showed, in mice, therapeutic activity of a very high order, and also a prophylactic action greater than that of any other drug available. Two of the most active of this series, ‘R.D. 2787’ and ‘R.D. 2801’, were sent to Africa for trials in cattle. ‘R.D. 2801’, which had appeared the better of the two in tests in mice, has shown considerable promise in tests in Tanganyika and in Nigeria, against both T. congolense and T. vivax. In one trial, for example, a single dose of 2 mgm./kgm. protected cattle for at least six months. Trials are still in progress, and full results of both these trials and of our laboratory findings will be published elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2078128976,"To my knowledge, the development of the innervation of the teeth has not yet been systematically investigated. There have been sporadic remarks ; for example, Holland1 writes : “As far as nerve tissue is concerned, it is believed that there is no direct connection or hookup with the parent sensory nerve ganglion until the tooth erupts and until root formation is nearly completed”. Different authors, for example, Powers2, in her studies of tooth innervation, has given illustrations of the rat-pulp for myelinated fibres but only from the molar teeth and illustrations of the periodontal nerve supply from the continuously growing incisor of the same species. In several animals (dog, calf, pig) I have found that in the earlier stages of the tooth development, for example, the period before the root begins to grow, there are in the pulp only unmyelinated (presumably vegetative) fibres. Later the myelinated sensory fibres appear. The pulp of the continuously growing incisor of the rat shows a similar situation. There are only unmyelinated fibres differing in size and branching. These are mainly in the neighbourhood of the vessels (see Fig. 1) and do not reach the odontoblastic layer."

https://openalex.org/W2042752815,"ELECTROPHORESIS of protein mixtures in agar gels has been described by Gordon et al. 1. It has been developed by Grabar and Williams and used in their immuno-electrophoretic method2. The latter, thanks to the specificity and sensitivity of immuno-chemical reactions, permits the detection of the presence even of the smallest amounts of components in a protein mixture and permits defining them by their electrophoretic mobilities. The agar gels can be dried and stained3, as in paper electrophoresis. However, the use of agar has one disadvantage : the samples are usually introduced in the gel, mixed with melted agar, thus being heated to 40°–45° C. Thus there is a constant danger of denaturing certain more sensitive protein components. A possible interaction of agar with some of the substances analysed cannot be excluded. Finally, it was of interest to find a gel from which the electrophoretically separated components could be extracted and estimated quantitatively."

https://openalex.org/W2013813034,DURING a study of 17-oxosteroid levels in blood plasma it was found that the amount of individual compounds available was frequently too small to permit determination and also identification by paper chromatography. After the determination of isolated 17-oxosteroids by Zimmermann reaction it is possible to recover these compounds as derivatives which can be used for characterizing the compounds measured.

https://openalex.org/W2079320159,"IN an earlier paper, we have shown that in human patients chlorpromazine impairs the hypothalamus and through it the anterior pituitary lobe1. This depressing effect balances itself in accordance with the push–pull principle so far as the following tropins are concerned: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone, since they produce secondary hormones. This is impossible, however, with regard to luteotropic hormone and somatotrophic hormone, as neither of them produces peripheral secondary hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2092215323,"THE biochemical differentiation1 between the vertebrates and the invertebrates rested upon the finding that phosphocreatine and phosphoarginine were characteristic of these two classes respectively. Recently, the discovery of phosphagens other than phosphoarginine in invertebrates has suggested some modification of this generalization; but there are no reports in the literature suggesting the presence of a phosphagen other than phosphocreatine in the vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2062747703,"WORK in our laboratories, inter alia, has been concerned for some years with the aberrant morphology1 and physiological responses2–4 of the peripheral capillary vascular system of patients with schizophrenia and other mental disturbances. More recently, we have been concerned with the effects of these responses of the minute vasculature on the oxygenation of the adjacent tissue cells. In brief, we have found that, under conditions of increased capillary pressure, lessened local blood-oxygen saturation and capillary corpuscular flow (often with intra-vascular erythrocytic agglutination), hydration, swelling, vacuolization, granularity and other degenerative changes reminiscent of cellular cloudy swelling occur progressively in the intervascular tissue substance5. These changes reverse themselves when the vascular conditions seemingly causing them also suffer a reversal. Although these changes have been observed from time to time in healthy subjects, they are much more characteristically seen, and for much longer periods of time, in psychiatric patients, and especially in psychotics. Also, these vascular and cellular responses seem to coincide in time with significant happenings in the mental state of the patients and the dynamic variations occurring in their state of consciousness (for example, a worsening of the pathophysiology takes place when hallucinations are experienced6 or when a myoclonic seizure7 occurs in an epileptic, while an improvement in these reactions coincides with recovery or subsidence of these events)."

https://openalex.org/W1991391985,"‘DISTILLERS dried solubles’ are commonly used in the United States as animal feed ingredients, particularly in rations for young stock. They contain considerable amounts of most of the B vitamins ; but in addition there is strong evidence of the presence of unknown growth factors1. It appears that part of the growth response which is shown when the product is added to practical rations complete in all known vitamins may be due to inorganic factors2 ; but it is evident that there is also some organic factor of biological significance3."

Nevertheless, an appreciable amount of each has been found in preparations of mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation from homogenates of various tissues, particularly liver1–4 and kidney5. The purpose of the present communication is to report on the association of sodium with another cellular component, the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1966616214,"EVIDENCE has been offered by one of us1 for the existence of properties correlated with sex compatibility in Escherichia coli. According to these data, sex-incompatible (F −) strains have a lower acid agglutination point and a far greater stability of broth-cultures as compared with F + strains of corresponding phenotype. These and other related properties of cell surface and the F + state are transmitted infectively from F + to F − strains at the same time. A search for an antigenic equivalent of such properties was but an obvious implication of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1987801646,"PREVIOUS experiments have shown that about 80 per cent mortality is to be expected when 60-day old mice are explosively decompressed, in a matter of 30 m.sec., from a pressure of 80 lb. per sq. in. above atmospheric. Since the positive phase of an air blast wave is characterized by a shock front followed by a rapid drop in pressure comparable to explosive decompression, it was thought of interest to investigate the lethal effect of this component of the blast wave. Accordingly, mice were subjected to 80 lb. per sq. in. over-pressure for varying durations of time and then explosively decompressed. No lethal effect was observed until the mice had been under pressure for times longer than 100 m.sec. At 1 second the mortality had only risen to about 12 per cent, as compared with the control data on 80 per cent mortality which was obtained when the mice were under pressure for a matter of 1 min. It is therefore concluded that the explosive decompression component of the blast wave has no lethal effect per se. Details of this work will be reported later."
https://openalex.org/W2007591496,RECENT studies have directed attention to the possible chemotherapeutic activity of 6-mercaptopurine. The compound has been synthesized1 and found to be a purine antagonist in Lactobacillus casei 2. It acts as a moderate inhibitor on sarcoma 1803 and on some types of carcinoma4. A preliminary X-ray investigation of the substance was undertaken in view of its biochemical importance.
https://openalex.org/W2028593248,"A RECENT observation has been made which may have an important bearing on current views regarding the etiology of atherosclerosis. It has been observed that alimentary lipæia, induced by a normal fat-containing meal (for example, a mixed grill), is inhibitory to the spontaneous in vitro fibrinolytic mechanism of blood which is active at pH 7.4 after dilution of the plasma1. The mean values in twenty normal subjects for the percentage of clot lysed in 24 hr. before, and 3½–4 hr. after, a fat-containing meal are as follow:"

Some express them in micrograms per unit weight of gland, some in micrograms per gland and some even in micrograms per kilogram of body-weight. Since, frequently, there is a difference between the weight of the left and of the right gland of each cat, it was thought desirable to determine whether the percentage of noradrenaline is the same in the two glands, and whether the total amine content is the same for both glands or whether the heavier gland contains more amine."
