https://openalex.org/W2578958622,"The origin and cellular complexity of eukaryotes represent a major enigma in biology. Current data support scenarios in which an archaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial (mitochondrial) endosymbiont merged together, resulting in the first eukaryotic cell. The host cell is related to Lokiarchaeota, an archaeal phylum with many eukaryotic features. The emergence of the structural complexity that characterizes eukaryotic cells remains unclear. Here we describe the ‘Asgard’ superphylum, a group of uncultivated archaea that, as well as Lokiarchaeota, includes Thor-, Odin- and Heimdallarchaeota. Asgard archaea affiliate with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and their genomes are enriched for proteins formerly considered specific to eukaryotes. Notably, thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains. Furthermore, we identify thorarchaeal proteins with similar features to eukaryotic coat proteins involved in vesicle biogenesis. Our results expand the known repertoire of ‘eukaryote-specific’ proteins in Archaea, indicating that the archaeal host cell already contained many key components that govern eukaryotic cellular complexity. This work describes the Asgard superphylum, an assemblage of diverse archaea that comprises Odinarchaeota, Heimdallarchaeota, Lokiarchaeota and Thorarchaeota, offering insights into the earliest days of eukaryotic cells and their complex features. Although the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic ancestors remains an enigma, it has become clear that the root of eukaryotes lies among a group of prokaryotes known as archaea. The recent identification of newly described archaea belonging to the Asgard superphylum, including Lokiarchaeota and Thorarchaeota, revealed a group of prokaryotes containing many proteins and genetic sequences that are otherwise found only in eukaryotes. Thijs Ettema and colleagues extend the search for eukaryotic roots by describing further additions to the Asgard superphylum: the Odinarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota. The new Asgard genomes encode homologues of several components of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machineries, suggesting that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes was well equipped to evolve the complex cellular features that are characteristic of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2572501381,"Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth's land surface, but store one-third of soil carbon. Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests. Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene. The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 × 1015 grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin. Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future reduction in precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2577161328,"As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their microenvironment and can activate autophagy, a catabolic process which provides nutrients during starvation. How tumours regulate autophagy in vivo and whether autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial. Here we demonstrate, using a well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model, that non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically restrained using autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion are genetically dependent on autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. Induction of autophagy is mediated by Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed tumour cells, whereas tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that dormant growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous growth when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts. We conclude that transformed cells engage surrounding normal cells as active and essential microenvironmental contributors to early tumour growth through nutrient-generating autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2578365017,"Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical role in many cell-signalling pathways but is often difficult to define or predict. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 α-helical oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT, one of the proteins with the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand, bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus sugar transporter SemiSWEET, another protein with low oligomeric stability, cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and stable interactions within a range of α-helical membrane proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2579217144,"We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects tumour initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the transition from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of inducible SOX2, which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers, we show that despite widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, certain oncogenic mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation factor eIF2A is essential for cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation at these upstream sites, differentially skewing translation and protein expression. Our findings unveil a role for the translation of 5' untranslated regions in cancer, and expose new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2578585563,"The antibody Fc region regulates antibody cytotoxic activities and serum half-life. In a therapeutic context, however, the cytotoxic effector function of an antibody is often not desirable and can create safety liabilities by activating native host immune defenses against cells expressing the receptor antigens. Several amino acid changes in the Fc region have been reported to silence or reduce the effector function of antibodies. These earlier studies focused primarily on the interaction of human antibodies with human Fc-γ receptors, and it remains largely unknown how such changes to Fc might translate to the context of a murine antibody. We demonstrate that the commonly used N297G (NG) and D265A, N297G (DANG) variants that are efficacious in attenuating effector function in primates retain potent complement activation capacity in mice, leading to safety liabilities in murine studies. In contrast, we found an L234A, L235A, P329G (LALA-PG) variant that eliminates complement binding and fixation as well as Fc-γ-dependent, antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxity in both murine IgG2a and human IgG1. These LALA-PG substitutions allow a more accurate translation of results generated with an effectorless antibody between mice and primates. Further, we show that both human and murine antibodies containing the LALA-PG variant have typical pharmacokinetics in rodents and retain thermostability, enabling efficient knobs-into-holes bispecific antibody production and a robust path to generating highly effector-attenuated bispecific antibodies for preclinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2560052408,"The human large intestine is populated by a high density of microorganisms, collectively termed the colonic microbiota, which has an important role in human health and nutrition. The survival of microbiota members from the dominant Gram-negative phylum Bacteroidetes depends on their ability to degrade dietary glycans that cannot be metabolized by the host. The genes encoding proteins involved in the degradation of specific glycans are organized into co-regulated polysaccharide utilization loci, with the archetypal locus sus (for starch utilisation system) encoding seven proteins, SusA-SusG. Glycan degradation mainly occurs intracellularly and depends on the import of oligosaccharides by an outer membrane protein complex composed of an extracellular SusD-like lipoprotein and an integral membrane SusC-like TonB-dependent transporter. The presence of the partner SusD-like lipoprotein is the major feature that distinguishes SusC-like proteins from previously characterized TonB-dependent transporters. Many sequenced gut Bacteroides spp. encode over 100 SusCD pairs, of which the majority have unknown functions and substrate specificities. The mechanism by which extracellular substrate binding by SusD proteins is coupled to outer membrane passage through their cognate SusC transporter is unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of two functionally distinct SusCD complexes purified from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and derive a general model for substrate translocation. The SusC transporters form homodimers, with each β-barrel protomer tightly capped by SusD. Ligands are bound at the SusC-SusD interface in a large solvent-excluded cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations and single-channel electrophysiology reveal a 'pedal bin' mechanism, in which SusD moves away from SusC in a hinge-like fashion in the absence of ligand to expose the substrate-binding site to the extracellular milieu. These data provide mechanistic insights into outer membrane nutrient import by members of the microbiota, an area of major importance for understanding human-microbiota symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2575376556,"The phospholipase PLA2G16 is required for the entry of picornaviruses, and in its absence, virus infection is prevented by a galectin-8-mediated process. Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues use a genome-wide haploid genetic screen to identify the host factors required for the replication of picornaviruses. They identify the small phospholipase PLA2G16 as being required for the cytoplasmic delivery of the viral genome. In a second screen to find mutants that restored virus susceptibility to PLA2G16-deficient cells, the authors identify galectin-8, a sensor previously implicated in the autophagic clearance of intracellular bacteria. The precise function of PLA2G16 remains unclear, but the authors suggest that it facilitates the displacement of the viral genome from galactin-8-positive vesicles. Picornaviruses are a leading cause of human and veterinary infections that result in various diseases, including polio and the common cold. As archetypical non-enveloped viruses, their biology has been extensively studied1. Although a range of different cell-surface receptors are bound by different picornaviruses2,3,4,5,6,7, it is unclear whether common host factors are needed for them to reach the cytoplasm. Using genome-wide haploid genetic screens, here we identify the lipid-modifying enzyme PLA2G16 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) as a picornavirus host factor that is required for a previously unknown event in the viral life cycle. We find that PLA2G16 functions early during infection, enabling virion-mediated genome delivery into the cytoplasm, but not in any virion-assigned step, such as cell binding, endosomal trafficking or pore formation. To resolve this paradox, we screened for suppressors of the ΔPLA2G16 phenotype and identified a mechanism previously implicated in the clearance of intracellular bacteria12. The sensor of this mechanism, galectin-8 (encoded by LGALS8), detects permeated endosomes and marks them for autophagic degradation, whereas PLA2G16 facilitates viral genome translocation and prevents clearance. This study uncovers two competing processes triggered by virus entry: activation of a pore-activated clearance pathway and recruitment of a phospholipase to enable genome release."
https://openalex.org/W2576246142,"Cellular metabolism dynamically regulates the epigenome via availability of the metabolite substrates of chromatin-modifying enzymes. The impact of diet on the metabolism-epigenome axis is poorly understood but could alter gene expression and influence metabolic health. ATP citrate-lyase produces acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and cytosol and regulates histone acetylation levels in many cell types. Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) results in suppression of ATP citrate-lyase levels in tissues such as adipose and liver, but the impact of diet on acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation in these tissues remains unknown. Here we examined the effects of HFD on levels of acyl-CoAs and histone acetylation in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT), liver, and pancreas. We report that mice consuming a HFD have reduced levels of acetyl-CoA and/or acetyl-CoA:CoA ratio in these tissues. In WAT and the pancreas, HFD also impacted the levels of histone acetylation; in particular, histone H3 lysine 23 acetylation was lower in HFD-fed mice. Genetic deletion of Acly in cultured adipocytes also suppressed acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation levels. In the liver, no significant effects on histone acetylation were observed with a HFD despite lower acetyl-CoA levels. Intriguingly, acetylation of several histone lysines correlated with the acetyl-CoA: (iso)butyryl-CoA ratio in liver. Butyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA interacted with the acetyltransferase P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) in liver lysates and inhibited its activity in vitro This study thus provides evidence that diet can impact tissue acyl-CoA and histone acetylation levels and that acetyl-CoA abundance correlates with acetylation of specific histone lysines in WAT but not in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2579394006,"In the Drosophila optic lobes, 800 retinotopically organized columns in the medulla act as functional units for processing visual information. The medulla contains over 80 types of neuron, which belong to two classes: uni-columnar neurons have a stoichiometry of one per column, while multi-columnar neurons contact multiple columns. Here we show that combinatorial inputs from temporal and spatial axes generate this neuronal diversity: all neuroblasts switch fates over time to produce different neurons; the neuroepithelium that generates neuroblasts is also subdivided into six compartments by the expression of specific factors. Uni-columnar neurons are produced in all spatial compartments independently of spatial input; they innervate the neuropil where they are generated. Multi-columnar neurons are generated in smaller numbers in restricted compartments and require spatial input; the majority of their cell bodies subsequently move to cover the entire medulla. The selective integration of spatial inputs by a fixed temporal neuroblast cascade thus acts as a powerful mechanism for generating neural diversity, regulating stoichiometry and the formation of retinotopy. Combinatorial inputs from temporal and spatial axes act together to promote medullary neural diversity in the optic lobes of Drosophila. Photoreceptor neurons in the 800 ommatidia of Drosophila's compound eye send visual information to 800 matching columns in the medulla, each of which contains more than 80 cell types generated during optic-lobe development. In this paper, Claude Desplan and colleagues distinguish two classes of medulla neurons. Uni-columnar neurons are specified through temporal sequences in the expression of regulatory genes, independently of spatial input, whereas multi-columnar neurons integrate the same temporal signals with spatial input specific to six compartments in the developing optic lobes. The findings extend the repertoire of combinatorial mechanisms generating neuronal diversity during brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2572202106,"Human motion models are finding an increasing number of novel applications in many different fields, such as building design, computer graphics and robot motion planning. The Social Force Model is one of the most popular alternatives to describe the motion of pedestrians. By resorting to a physical analogy, individuals are assimilated to point-wise particles subject to social forces which drive their dynamics. Such a model implicitly assumes that humans move isotropically. On the contrary, empirical evidence shows that people do have a preferred direction of motion, walking forward most of the time. Lateral motions are observed only in specific circumstances, such as when navigating in overcrowded environments or avoiding unexpected obstacles. In this paper, the Headed Social Force Model is introduced in order to improve the realism of the trajectories generated by the classical Social Force Model. The key feature of the proposed approach is the inclusion of the pedestrians’ heading into the dynamic model used to describe the motion of each individual. The force and torque representing the model inputs are computed as suitable functions of the force terms resulting from the traditional Social Force Model. Moreover, a new force contribution is introduced in order to model the behavior of people walking together as a single group. The proposed model features high versatility, being able to reproduce both the unicycle-like trajectories typical of people moving in open spaces and the point-wise motion patterns occurring in high density scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations show an increased regularity of the resulting trajectories and confirm a general improvement of the model realism."
https://openalex.org/W2578326567,"Language is a distinguishing characteristic of our species, and the course of its evolution is one of the hardest problems in science. It has long been generally considered that human speech requires a low larynx, and that the high larynx of nonhuman primates should preclude their producing the vowel systems universally found in human language. Examining the vocalizations through acoustic analyses, tongue anatomy, and modeling of acoustic potential, we found that baboons (Papio papio) produce sounds sharing the F1/F2 formant structure of the human [ɨ æ ɑ ɔ u] vowels, and that similarly with humans those vocalic qualities are organized as a system on two acoustic-anatomic axes. This confirms that hominoids can produce contrasting vowel qualities despite a high larynx. It suggests that spoken languages evolved from ancient articulatory skills already present in our last common ancestor with Cercopithecoidea, about 25 MYA."
https://openalex.org/W2576738465,"Analysis of exceptionally preserved fossils of the Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis leads to a proposed evolutionary relationship with Lophophorata, the group containing brachiopods and phoronids, on the basis of a newly described tentacular feeding apparatus. Hyoliths were shelly fossils that were common throughout the Palaeozoic. They look like drinking horns with a lid (the operculum), and even had two curved protruberances (called helens) that the drinking horn could stand on, making a tripod with the horn-shaped shell. Because hyoliths are so distinctive, their affinities are difficult to determine, although they are thought to belong to a group of invertebrates known as Lophotrochozoa—annelids, molluscs and lophophore-bearing animals such as brachiopods. Joseph Moysiuk et al. report that a cache of hyoliths from the famous Cambrian Burgess Shales of Canada has remarkable soft-tissue preservation, revealing that they are indeed lophophorates, probably akin to brachiopods, and perhaps taking in the tommotiids, another extinct and enigmatic group of what palaeontologists refer to as 'small shelly fossils'. Hyoliths are abundant and globally distributed ‘shelly’ fossils that appear early in the Cambrian period and can be found throughout the 280 million year span of Palaeozoic strata1,2. The ecological and evolutionary importance of this group has remained unresolved, largely because of their poorly constrained soft anatomy and idiosyncratic scleritome, which comprises an operculum, a conical shell and, in some taxa, a pair of lateral spines (helens)3,4,5. Since their first description over 175 years ago, hyoliths have most often been regarded as incertae sedis4,6, related to molluscs7,8 or assigned to their own phylum1,2. Here we examine over 1,500 specimens of the mid-Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerstätten. We reconstruct Haplophrentis as a semi-sessile, epibenthic suspension feeder that could use its helens to elevate its tubular body above the sea floor3,9,10,11,12. Exceptionally preserved soft tissues include an extendable, gullwing-shaped, tentacle-bearing organ surrounding a central mouth, which we interpret as a lophophore, and a U-shaped digestive tract ending in a dorsolateral anus. Together with opposing bilateral sclerites and a deep ventral visceral cavity, these features indicate an affinity with the lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids and tommotiids), substantially increasing the morphological disparity of this prominent group."

Specific inhibition of ACOX1 by 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid increased hepatic mitochondrial FAO via activation of the SIRT1-AMPK (adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase) pathway and proliferator activator receptor α and reduced hydrogen peroxide accumulation in high fat diet-fed rats, which significantly decreased hepatic lipid and ROS contents, reduced body weight gain, and decreased serum triglyceride and insulin levels.

https://openalex.org/W2576986365,"Upon T cell receptor stimulation, CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNAs. However, no data are available on whether human CD4+ T cell subsets release EVs containing different pattern of microRNAs. The present work aimed at filling this gap by assessing the microRNA content in EVs released upon in vitro T cell receptor stimulation of Th1, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Our results indicate that EVs released by Treg cells are significantly different compared with those released by the other subsets. In particular, miR-146a-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-21-5p are enriched, whereas miR-106a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-19a-3p are depleted in Treg-derived EVs. The in vitro identified EV-associated microRNA signature was increased in serum of autoimmune patients with psoriasis and returned to healthy levels upon effective treatment with etanercept, a biological drug targeting the TNF pathway and suppressing inflammation. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed an over-representation of genes relevant for T cell activation, such as CD40L, IRAK1, IRAK2, STAT1, and c-Myb in the list of validated targets of Treg-derived EV miRNAs. At functional level, Treg-derived (but not Th1/Th17-derived) EVs inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation and suppressed two relevant targets of miR-146a-5p: STAT1 and IRAK2. In conclusion, our work identified the miRNAs specifically released by different human CD4+ T cell subsets and started to unveil the potential use of their quantity in human serum to mark the pathological elicitation of these cells in vivo and their biological effect in cell to cell communication during the adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2574440838,"Many US biomedical PhD programs receive more applications for admissions than they can accept each year, necessitating a selective admissions process. Typical selection criteria include standardized test scores, undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, a resume and/or personal statement highlighting relevant research or professional experience, and feedback from interviews with training faculty. Admissions decisions are often founded on assumptions that these application components correlate with research success in graduate school, but these assumptions have not been rigorously tested. We sought to determine if any application components were predictive of student productivity measured by first-author student publications and time to degree completion. We collected productivity metrics for graduate students who entered the umbrella first-year biomedical PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2008–2010 and analyzed components of their admissions applications. We found no correlations of test scores, grades, amount of previous research experience, or faculty interview ratings with high or low productivity among those applicants who were admitted and chose to matriculate at UNC. In contrast, ratings from recommendation letter writers were significantly stronger for students who published multiple first-author papers in graduate school than for those who published no first-author papers during the same timeframe. We conclude that the most commonly used standardized test (the general GRE) is a particularly ineffective predictive tool, but that qualitative assessments by previous mentors are more likely to identify students who will succeed in biomedical graduate research. Based on these results, we conclude that admissions committees should avoid over-reliance on any single component of the application and de-emphasize metrics that are minimally predictive of student productivity. We recommend continual tracking of desired training outcomes combined with retrospective analysis of admissions practices to guide both application requirements and holistic application review."
https://openalex.org/W2575311495,"Pancreatic beta cell failure is the central event leading to diabetes. Beta cells share many phenotypic traits with neurons, and proper beta cell function relies on the activation of several neuron-like transcription programs. Regulation of gene expression by alternative splicing plays a pivotal role in brain, where it affects neuronal development, function, and disease. The role of alternative splicing in beta cells remains unclear, but recent data indicate that splicing alterations modulated by both inflammation and susceptibility genes for diabetes contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death. Here we used RNA sequencing to compare the expression of splicing-regulatory RNA-binding proteins in human islets, brain, and other human tissues, and we identified a cluster of splicing regulators that are expressed in both beta cells and brain. Four of them, namely Elavl4, Nova2, Rbox1, and Rbfox2, were selected for subsequent functional studies in insulin-producing rat INS-1E, human EndoC-βH1 cells, and in primary rat beta cells. Silencing of Elavl4 and Nova2 increased beta cell apoptosis, whereas silencing of Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 increased insulin content and secretion. Interestingly, Rbfox1 silencing modulates the splicing of the actin-remodeling protein gelsolin, increasing gelsolin expression and leading to faster glucose-induced actin depolymerization and increased insulin release. Taken together, these findings indicate that beta cells share common splicing regulators and programs with neurons.

Understanding how beta cells acquire neuron-like features has focused mainly on transcription, but it remains unclear whether beta cells and neurons share similar post-transcriptional regulation. Alternative splicing (AS) is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that allows cells to fine-tune their transcriptome and generate proteome diversity to gain functional specialization. By regulating splice site selection and inclusion of alternative exons into mature mRNAs, AS enables individual genes to produce multiple protein isoforms that often display different properties or functions (16Chen M. Manley J.L. Mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation: insights from molecular and genomics approaches.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). AS is particularly widespread in the brain, playing a central role in neuronal development, complexity, and physiology (17Zheng S. Black D.L.

Alternative splicing in the mammalian nervous system: recent insights into mechanisms and functional roles.Neuron. 2015; 87: 14-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Indeed, defects in splicing regulation are associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders (19Licatalosi D.D. Darnell R.B.

Beta cell failure is the central event leading to diabetes. Although the role of AS in the development of diabetes remains to be clarified, recent studies from our group indicate that AS alterations induced by both inflammation and disease susceptibility genes contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death (24Eizirik D.L.

Furthermore, we found that the “neuron-specific” splicing factor Nova1 is expressed in beta cells (24Eizirik D.L. Sammeth M. Bouckenooghe T. Bottu G. Sisino G. Igoillo-Esteve M. Ortis F. Santin I.

Nova1 is a master regulator of alternative splicing in pancreatic beta cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 11818-11830Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the expression of splicing-regulatory RBPs in pancreatic islets, brain, and other human tissues and detected a group of splicing regulators that are preferentially expressed in human islets and brain. We next focused on four of them, namely Elavl4 (also known as HuD), Nova2, Rbfox1, and Rbfox2. We confirmed their expression in pancreatic beta cells and identified their roles in beta cell function and survival. The findings obtained suggest that beta cells and neurons share common splicing programs and indicate that defects in splicing regulation of common brain-beta cells RBPs may contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death. We used a previous RNA sequencing dataset of human islets (24Eizirik D.L. Sammeth M. Bouckenooghe T. Bottu G. Sisino G. Igoillo-Esteve M. Ortis F. Santin I. Colli M.L. Barthson J. Bouwens L.

Marselli L. et al.The human pancreatic islet transcriptome: expression of candidate genes for type 1 diabetes and the impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8e1002552Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and the Illumina BodyMap 2.0 (GEO: GSE30611) to compare the expression of 118 splicing-regulatory RBPs between human islets and 16 other tissues. Some brain-expressed RBPs clustered together with the five human islet preparations evaluated, and we identified a group of RBPs that are relatively highly expressed in both human islets and brain (Fig. 1A, yellow square). This includes members of the ELAVL, RBFOX, and NOVA families of splicing-regulatory RBPs that have been reported previously to regulate key splicing programs in brain (18Raj B. Blencowe B.J. Alternative splicing in the mammalian nervous system: recent insights into mechanisms and functional roles.Neuron. 2015; 87: 14-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 19Licatalosi D.D. Darnell R.B. Splicing regulation in neurologic disease.Neuron. 2006; 52: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expression of ELAVL4, NOVA2, RBFOX1, and RBFOX2 was confirmed in human islets and in the human insulin-producing EndoC-βH1 cell line by real time qPCR (Fig. 1, B–E). Of note, NOVA2, RBFOX1, and RBFOX2, but not ELAVL4, were also well expressed in adipose tissue. To understand the reasons for the similar RBPs gene expression pattern observed between human islets and brain, we assessed whether their expression was under the control of the transcriptional repressor REST. Gene expression of RBPs in rat INS-1E cells was analyzed after infection with an adenovirus encoding REST (Fig. 2A). REST overexpression down-regulated the expression of Snap25 (Fig. 2B), a known target of REST, but it did not modify the expression of Elavl4, Nova2, or Rbfox2, suggesting that these genes are not targets of REST in beta cells (Fig. 2, C, D, and F). REST overexpression down-regulated the expression of Rbfox1 (Fig. 2E), but the finding that Rbfox1 is expressed in other non-neuronal tissues (Fig. 1D) argues against a direct transcriptional regulation by REST. Compensatory cross-regulation between RBP paralogs was observed for Elavl4 and Nova2. Elavl4 knockdown (KD) by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased the levels of paralog Elavl1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar observations were made for Nova1 expression under Nova2 KD (Fig. 3, C and D). However, no compensatory cross-regulation between Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 was observed (Fig. 3, E–H).FIGURE 2Expression of neuron-enriched RBPs after REST overexpression in INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells were infected with adenovirus overexpressing Renilla luciferase (AdLuc) or REST (AdREST) for 24 h at m.o.i. of 10 or left untreated (NT, non-treated).

Elavl4 KD increased apoptosis under basal conditions but protected against cytokine-induced apoptosis in the three different cell models studied (Fig. 4, C, G, and I). Elavl4 KD affected neither glucose-stimulated insulin secretion nor insulin content (data not shown). Modulation of beta cell death following Elavl4 KD was secondary to activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, as indicated by changes in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and -9 measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4, A, D, and E). To identify the mechanisms underlying Elavl4 KD-induced apoptosis, we assessed the expression of several apoptotic regulators of the Bcl-2 family, as well as markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress, but no changes were detected (data not shown). Nova2 was silenced in INS-1E, EndoC-βH1, and FACS-purified primary rat beta cells (Fig. 5, A, F, and H). Nova2 KD increased INS-1E cell apoptosis under basal conditions and sensitized these cells to cytokine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). This was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-9 and -3, indicating that cell death is secondary to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (Fig. 5, C–E). Nova2 KD also increased apoptosis in FACS-purified primary rat beta cells and EndoC-βH1 cells (Fig. 5, G and I). Nova2 KD neither affected glucose-stimulated insulin release nor insulin content in INS-1E cells (data not shown). Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 were independently silenced in INS1-E cells (Figs. 6, A and B, and 7A). Rbfox1 silencing did not affect basal or cytokine-induced apoptosis (data not shown) but induced a significant increase in insulin release after glucose or glucose plus forskolin stimulation (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, there was a dose-response relation between the induced Rbfox1 knockdown by the different siRNAs and the observed increase in insulin secretion. A similar phenotype was observed following Rbfox2 KD (Fig. 7B). In addition, increased KATP-channel independent insulin release was observed in Rbfox1 KD cells following stimulation with KCl (Fig. 6E). Moreover, insulin cellular content was significantly increased following Rbfox1 and Rbfox2 silencing (Figs. 6F and 7C). Insulin mRNA expression was significantly increased following Rbfox1 KD by siFOX1#2 (the siRNA inducing more marked Rbfox1 inhibition) but not following KD with the less effective siFOX1#1 (Fig. 6G). To determine whether the observed increase in insulin secretion was secondary to increased glucose metabolism and ATP generation or due to augmented exocytosis, we measured glucose oxidation and mitochondrial function, and we analyzed calcium currents through patch clamp. No differences in glucose oxidation were observed between control and Rbfox1 KD cells (Fig. 6H). In line with this, there were no differences in mitochondrial function parameters such as glucose-induced respiration, ATP-linked respiration (response to oligomycin), and maximal respiration (response to FCCP following oligomycin), as evaluated by oxygen consumption rate measurements (Fig. 6I). Calcium currents were evoked by depolarizing the cell membrane from a resting potential of −70 mV to voltages ranging from −50 to +50 mV, and the data obtained were analyzed for charge (Q). Rbfox1 KD cells showed a tendency to increase charge (Fig. 6, J and K). These findings suggest that mild electrophysiological alterations may underlie Rbfox1 KD, but its contribution to the observed phenotype is unclear.FIGURE 7Rbfox2 knockdown increases insulin secretion and content. INS-1E cells were transfected with siCTR or siFOX2#1 siRNA for 48 h.

Mele A. Yan Q. Sun S. Farny N. Zhang Z. Xue C. Herre M. Silver P.A. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Darnell R.B. Zhang C. HITS-CLIP and integrative modeling define the Rbfox splicing-regulatory network linked to brain development and autism.Cell. Rep. 2014; 6: 1139-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Pathway enrichment analysis using IPA (Ingenuity Systems) and DAVID (david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) software showed that Rbfox-regulated transcripts in brain are enriched in pathways that can affect insulin secretion in beta cells, including cytoskeleton organization, vesicle-mediated transport, and calcium signaling. Three AS events regulated by Rbfox proteins in brain were selected for evaluation in beta cells (Fig. 8). Using two independent siRNAs, we confirmed Rbfox1-dependent splicing modulation for the actin-remodeling protein gelsolin (Gsn) and the voltage-gated calcium channel 1C (Cacna1c) (Fig. 8, A and C). Splicing modulation of the insulin receptor (Insr), however, was observed only with one siRNA (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, Rbfox1 KD reduced the inclusion of a frameshift cassette exon in Gsn, reducing the expression of an isoform predicted to be a target for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Fig. 8A). Gelsolin is a calcium-activated actin-severing protein that plays a positive role in insulin secretion. Gelsolin mediates glucose-dependent actin cytoskeleton depolymerization and interacts with the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4, facilitating the trafficking, docking, and fusion of insulin granules (29Tomas A. Yermen B. Min L. Pessin J.E. Halban P.A. Regulation of pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion by actin cytoskeleton remodelling: role of gelsolin and cooperation with the MAPK signalling pathway.J.

Gelsolin associates with the N terminus of syntaxin 4 to regulate insulin granule exocytosis.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of gelsolin in the observed increase in insulin release following Rbfox1 KD, we knocked down in parallel both Rbfox1 and gelsolin in INS-1E cells (Fig. 9). The observed alternative splicing shift following Rbfox1 KD was associated with an increase in gelsolin mRNA expression (Fig. 9B), probably secondary to the decrease in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-targeted isoform observed in Fig. 8A. Knockdown of gelsolin was associated with increased Rbfox1 expression (Fig. 9A), indicating a cross-regulation between both genes. Double KD of Rbfox1 and gelsolin prevented the increase in insulin secretion detected after Rbfox1 KD alone (Fig. 9C), indicating that the observed phenotype is probably secondary to alterations in cytoskeleton remodeling. To study whether Rbfox1 KD indeed affects cytoskeleton organization, we evaluated the dynamics of depolymerization of actin filaments following stimulation with glucose using confocal and fluorescence microscopy. Rbfox1 KD did not induce major differences in actin cytoskeleton organization in cells maintained at 0 mm glucose (Fig. 10A, left panel), but Rbfox1 KD cells showed less actin stress fibers (F-actin) after stimulation with 17 mm glucose when compared with control cells (Fig. 10A, right panel). Actin depolymerization was quantified by calculating the ratio between filamentous and globular actin (F/G-actin). Rbfox1-KD cells displayed a faster glucose-induced actin depolymerization when compared with control cells (Fig. 10, B and C). These differences were more pronounced with siFOX1#2, the siRNA inducing higher levels of Rbfox1 KD and a more extreme phenotype, and were prevented by gelsolin silencing (Fig. 10, A–C). These findings indicate that the observed increase in insulin secretion following Rbfox KD is secondary to increased gelsolin expression and consequent enhanced actin depolymerization. Beta cells and neurons share many similarities in gene transcription, but whether both cell types present similar AS regulation remains an open question. We presently show that some neuron-enriched splicing regulators are also expressed in pancreatic beta cells where they play a major role in regulating beta cell survival and function. Our data analysis identified a cluster of RBPs that are expressed in both brain and in human islets. This cluster includes members of the Elavl, Nova, and Rbfox families, which have been implicated in neuronal physiology and disease (28Weyn-Vanhentenryck S.M. Mele A. Yan Q. Sun S. Farny N. Zhang Z.

Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) is a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein that regulates transcription and translation. YBX1 specifically interacts with DNA and RNA and regulates many DNA- and mRNA-dependent processes, including DNA transcription, replication, repair, environmental stress, chromatin remodeling, pre-mRNA splicing, etc. (2Eliseeva I.A.

High expression of YBX1 is frequently detected in various cancers, including melanoma, osteosarcoma, and prostate, breast, squamous cell, lung, ovarian, thyroid, and colon cancer (3Kohno K. Izumi H.

In contrast, we recently discovered that, in response to IL-1β but not IGF1 treatment, YBX1 can be phosphorylated on Ser-165 (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K.

In this study, we have identified distinct Ser-176 phosphorylation upon treatment with IL-1β. We further prove that Ser-176 phosphorylation of YBX1 is critical for NF-κB activation and its tumor-promoting ability. Ser-176 and the previously reported Ser-165 differentially regulate the expression of different subgroups of NF-κB target genes, offering a potential mechanism underlying the finely tuned YBX1-mediated NF-κB activation in colon cancer. insulin-like growth factor posttranslational modification quantitative PCR ingenuity pathway analysis immunofluorescence casein kinase I epithelial-mesenchymal transition control. NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (12Oeckinghaus A. Ghosh S. The NF-κB family of transcription factors and its regulation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1a000034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Constitutively active NF-κB has been found in multiple types of cancer (13Lu T. Stark G.R. Cytokine overexpression and constitutive NF-κB in cancer.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Prasad S. Ravindran J. Aggarwal B.B. NF-κB and cancer: how intimate is this relationship.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2010; 336: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). There are five proteins in the mammalian NF-κB family: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100. All proteins in the NF-κB family share a Rel homology domain in their N terminus, which results in their classification as NF-κB/Rel proteins. The Rel homology domain is essential for dimerization as well as for binding to cognate DNA elements. The prototypic NF-κB is the heterodimer of p65 and p50. NF-κB activity is primarily regulated by interaction with IκB proteins. In most cells, NF-κB is present as a latent and inactive IκB-bound complex in the cytoplasm (15Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Activation of DNA-binding activity in an apparently cytoplasmic precursor of the NF-κB transcription factor.Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). When a cell receives an extracellular signal such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, radiation, etc., IκB is degraded, and NF-κB rapidly enters the nucleus and activates target gene expression (16Hayden M.S. West A.P. Ghosh S. NF-κB and the immune response.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6758-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Constitutive NF-κB has been found in many different types of cancer (13Lu T. Stark G.R. Cytokine overexpression and constitutive NF-κB in cancer.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making NF-κB one of the most popular therapeutic targets in cancer. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified phosphorylation of the novel Ser-176 site on YBX1 upon treatment with IL-1β. We showed that overexpression of the S176A-YBX1 (S176A) mutant led to decreased NF-κB binding ability and reduced cell growth and tumorigenic ability compared with the effect of WT-YBX1 overexpression. We also demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Ser-176 and a site reported previously by our lab, Ser-165 (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), lead to the regulation of quite distinct groups of NF-κB target genes. Therefore, we propose that phosphorylation of Ser-176 on YBX1 is an essential and novel discovery. The functions of phosphorylated Ser-176 or Ser-165 are not interchangeable and replaceable. This study could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling the YBX1:NF-κB axis by blocking phosphorylation of either Ser-176 or Ser-165 or both in colon cancer. Previously, YBX1 was shown to be phosphorylated on Ser-102 in response to IGF1 in breast cancer cells (9Sutherland B.W. Kucab J. Wu J. Lee C. Cheang M.C. Yorida E. Turbin D. Dedhar S. Nelson C. Pollak M. Leighton Grimes H. Miller K. Badve S. Huntsman D. Blake-Gilks C. et al.Akt phosphorylates the Y-box binding protein 1 at Ser102 located in the cold shock domain and affects the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4281-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Wu J. Lee C. Yokom D. Jiang H. Cheang M.C. Yorida E. Turbin D. Berquin I.M. Mertens P.R. Iftner T. Gilks C.B. Dunn S.E. Disruption of the Y-box binding protein-1 results in suppression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4872-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and, more recently by us, on Ser-165 upon IL-1β treatment (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether any additional serine sites could be phosphorylated by IL-1β stimulation, we conducted further mass spectrometry analysis in greater detail. Interestingly, we identified a novel site of phosphorylation on YBX1, Ser-176, in addition to Ser-165. As shown in Fig. 1, a mass shift of 80 Da was identified on Ser-176 of the FLAG-tagged YBX1 protein purified by FLAG pulldown from IL-1β-treated 293 (Fig. 1A) and HT29 cells (Fig. 1B), indicating the existence of a strong phosphorylation modification signal on Ser-176. To determine whether Ser-176 phosphorylation plays an essential role in the activation of NF-κB, we successfully expressed the S176A mutant at a level comparable with WT-YBX1 in 293 cells. Meanwhile, a previously generated shYBX1 293 stable cell line was also included for comparison (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). NF-κB-specific luciferase assay was carried out for the cells described above. As shown in Fig. 2B, upon IL-1β stimulation, NF-κB was greatly induced in control 293 cells. Overexpression of WT-YBX1 dramatically enhanced NF-κB activation, whereas expression of the S176A mutant had considerably weaker NF-κB-activating ability compared with WT-YBX1. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-176 is critical for complete activation of NF-κB by YBX1. Posttranslational modification (PTM) of transcription factors may lead to a different gene expression pattern (17Zheng Y. McFarland B.C. Drygin D. Yu H. Bellis S.L. Kim H. Bredel M. Benveniste E.N. Targeting protein kinase CK2 suppresses pro-survival signaling pathways and growth of glioblastoma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19: 6484-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility further, we conducted an Illumina microarray analysis with control 293 cells and WT-YBX1 and S176A overexpression cells. Compared with WT-YBX1 cells (Fig. 3A), about 35% of NF-κB target genes were down-regulated by at least 2-fold in cells expressing S176A mutant protein. About 64% of the genes were not significantly affected, whereas very few genes (∼1%) were up-regulated by at least 2-fold. A representative list of NF-κB target genes that were down-regulated by the S176A mutant is shown in Fig. 3B. These genes can be significantly up-regulated by the overexpression of WT-YBX1 (WT/Ctrl ≥ 2-fold), but their inductions were dramatically reduced by S176A mutant overexpression (S176A/WT ≤ 0.5). Importantly, among these genes are cytokines, chemokines, and signaling components that are involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, such as IL-17C, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog 1, lung carcinoma-derived (MYCL1). Several genes, such as IRF5 and MYCL1, were further confirmed with qPCR analysis in both 293 cells (Fig. 3C, top panels) and HT29 cells (Fig. 3C, bottom panels), showing great reduction in gene expression in the S176A mutant compared with the WT-YBX1 sample under both IL-1β-treated or untreated conditions. Collectively, these data confirm that phosphorylation of YBX1 at Ser-176 is critical for the activation of a subset of NF-κB-inducible genes. Previously, we reported that Ser-165 of YBX1 can be phosphorylated upon stimulation by IL-1β (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We wondered whether both Ser-176 and Ser-165 are phosphorylated to a similar extent or whether one is more dominant than the other after IL-1β treatment. FLAG-tagged WT-YBX1, the S176A single mutant, or the S176A/S165A double mutant were overexpressed at similar levels in 293 cells (Fig. 4A). A co-immunoprecipitation experiment was further conducted using anti-FLAG beads, followed by Western blotting analysis with anti-general phosphorylated serine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, upon treatment with IL-1β, FLAG-WT-YBX1 was significantly phosphorylated (Fig. 4B, top panel), whereas the FLAG-S176A mutant exhibited a dramatically reduced phosphorylation ability compared with FLAG-WT-YBX1 protein. Furthermore, the FLAG-S176A/S165A double mutant displayed an even weaker phosphorylation ability than the FLAG-S176A single mutant, suggesting that Ser-176 is a more pronounced phosphorylation site than Ser-165. The intensity of phosphorylation was further quantified and is shown in Fig. 4B, bottom panel. Because we showed that both Ser-176 and Ser-165 can be phosphorylated upon IL-1β treatment, we wondered whether these two sites could contribute collaboratively or differentially to the NF-κB target gene regulation. A parallel Illumina array experiment for S165A was carried out along with the S176A sample. The data suggest that the expression of ∼33% (185 genes) of NF-κB target genes was reduced by 2-fold or more by S165A mutation (S165A/WT ≤ 0.5) and ∼35% (197 genes) by S176A mutation (S176A/WT ≤ 0.5) (Figs. 3A and 5A, top panel) compared with WT-YBX1. Among the 197 genes that were down-regulated by S176A, 82 genes were solely regulated by S176A but not by S165A (S176A/WT ≤ 0.5, S165A/WT > 0.5); in other words, their gene expression is S176A-dependent (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). On the other hand, among the 185 genes that were down-regulated by S165A, 70 genes were solely regulated by S165A (S165A/WT ≤ 0.5, S176A/YBX1 > 0.5) but not by S176A (Fig. 5A, bottom panel); that is, they are S165A-dependent. Beyond the uniqueness of their gene regulation pattern, both S176A and S165A share the regulation of a common pool of genes (115 genes) (176A/YBX1 ≤ 0.5, S165A/WT ≤ 0.5), indicating that they not only differentially regulate distinct subgroups of genes but also function in a collaborative manner. This interesting phenomenon suggests the sophisticated but elegant gene regulation capacity by the important oncogene YBX1. Representative genes that are commonly shared by S176A and S165A (Fig. 5B, top panel) or solely by S176A (Fig. 5C) or S165A (Fig. 5D) are shown in Fig. 5. For instance, IRF5 (Fig. 5B) is regulated by either S176A or S165A. This gene is considered to be a novel regulator of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) expression in cancer (18Garaud S. Willard-Gallo K. IRF5: a rheostat for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte trafficking in breast cancer?.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2015; 93: 425-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In contrast, MYCL1 (Fig. 5C) is solely regulated by S176A. MYCL1 is a member of the MYC gene family, which is well known for its oncogenic potential or correlation with poor prognosis in cancer (19Ryan S.L. Schwalbe E.C. Cole M. Lu Y. Lusher M.E. Megahed H. O'Toole K. Nicholson S.L. Bognar L. Garami M. Hauser P. Korshunov A. Pfister S.M. Williamson D. Taylor R.E. et al.MYC family amplification and clinical risk-factors interact to predict an extremely poor prognosis in childhood medulloblastoma.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 123: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For S165A-regulated genes, oncostatin-M (OSM) is a very good example. This gene encodes a member of the leukemia inhibitory factor/OSM family of proteins. OSM protein is a secreted cytokine that may regulate the production of other cytokines, including IL6, G-CSF, and GM-CSF in endothelial cells. The OSM receptor is suggested to be a novel therapeutic target in cancer (20Caffarel M.M. Coleman N. Oncostatin M receptor is a novel therapeutic target in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.J. Pathol. 2014; 232: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A full list of each group of genes is provided in supplemental Tables S1–S3. To identify the signature networks of each subgroup of genes, we further conducted an ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). It is extremely interesting that we observed that each group of genes is associated with quite distinct network functions. For instance, the commonly regulated genes by both S176A and S165A are predominantly associated with network functions of “protein degradation, synthesis, and cellular function and maintenance” (Fig. 5B, bottom panel) and “cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, and connective tissue development and function” (supplemental Table S4 and Fig. S1). Although S176A solely regulated genes are associated with network functions of “cancer, dermatological diseases and conditions, and gastroenterological diseases” (Fig. 5C, bottom panel) and “cancer, hematological diseases, and hereditary disorders” (supplemental Table S5 and Fig. S2). In great contrast, S165A solely regulated genes are mainly involved in the network functions of “cell morphology, cell death and survival, and reproductive system development and function” (Fig. 5D, bottom panel) and “cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, nervous system development and function, and developmental disorders” (supplemental Table S6 and Fig. S3). Strikingly, NF-κB is one of the most pivotal nodes in each of the key networks (Fig. 5, B–D, bottom panels). Importantly, YBX1 also shows up in two of these networks (Fig. 5, C and D, bottom panels), suggesting an intimate yet sophisticated connection between YBX1 and NF-κB. In short, the above evidence inarguably supports the important and distinct role of differential gene regulation by phosphorylation of Ser-176 and Ser-165 of the YBX1 protein. Because NF-κB is well known to be involved in the expression of factors that can promote cancer cell proliferation, we decided to examine the effects of the S176A mutant on NF-κB activity, cell proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth in HT29 colon cancer cells. We established stable HT29 cell lines either with the overexpression of WT-YBX1 or with S176A (Fig. 6A, top panel). By carrying out NF-κB-specific luciferase reporter assays, we further confirmed that overexpression of WT-YBX1 could activate NF-κB, as we observed previously (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). Furthermore, we proved that the S176A overexpression cells had lower NF-κB luciferase activity compared with the WT-YBX1 overexpression cells, confirming that S176A plays an important role in regulating NF-κB activity. Additionally, we determined the effect of S176A on cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 6B, top panel, overexpression of WT-YBX1 promoted cell growth compared with HT29 control cells, whereas overexpression of S176A showed a significantly reduced cell proliferation ability compared with WT-YBX1 overexpression cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-176 of YBX1 is important for its cell proliferation ability. To test the effect of Ser-176 on anchorage-independent growth, a soft agar assay was performed with the cells described above. As shown in Fig. 6B, center panel, overexpression of WT-YBX1 enhanced colony sizes compared with HT29 control cells, whereas overexpression of S176A showed a much reduced colony-forming ability compared with WT-YBX1. Together, these data suggest that Ser-176 phosphorylation of YBX1 is very important for promoting anchorage-independent growth. To achieve a cleaner effect of the S176A mutant, we used the shYBX1 (3′-UTR) construct to knock down the endogenous YBX1 in either HT29 or HCT116 colon cancer cells and then reconstituted these cells with similar levels of WT-YBX1 or S176A protein (Fig. 6, C and D, top panels). Cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays were carried out. The data suggested that stable cell lines of shYBX1 (3′-UTR) infected with S176A virus, hereafter referred to as S176A put-back cells, behaved more like the shYBX1 (3′-UTR) cells, showing a slower cell growth rate and weaker colony formation ability in both HT29- and HCT116-derived cells (Fig. 6, C and D). In contrast, stable cell lines of shYBX1 (3′-UTR) infected with WT-YBX1 virus, hereafter referred to as WT-YBX1 put-back cells, showed similar properties as the parental HT29 (Fig. 6C) or HCT116 cells (Fig. 6D). Together, the above data confirm that Ser-176 is an important site to promote colon cancer progression. As IκBα degradation is an important step in the activation of NF-κB by cytokines such as IL-1β, we wondered whether the decreased NF-κB-activating ability by S176A is due to its effect on the process of IκBα degradation. Both 293- or HT29-derived cells with WT-YBX1 or S176A overexpression were treated with IL-1β for different times (Fig. 7, A and B). The degradation of IκBα was further determined by Western blotting analysis. The data indicated no significant difference in IκBα degradation among different cell lines, confirming that phosphorylation of Ser-176 had no obvious effect on IκBα degradation. We then tested whether phosphorylation of Ser-176 of YBX1 affected NF-κB DNA binding ability. A κB-specific EMSA was carried out in 293 and HT29 cells with the overexpression of WT-YBX1 or S176A mutant (Fig. 7C). Previously, we and others have verified that prototypical NF-κB (p65/p50 heterodimer) DNA binding ability could be dramatically induced after treatment with IL-1β (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Oeckinghaus A. Ghosh S. The NF-κB family of transcription factors and its regulation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1a000034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 13Lu T. Stark G.R. Cytokine overexpression and constitutive NF-κB in cancer.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that overexpression of WT-YBX1 further enhanced IL-1β-induced κB binding activity, whereas S176A mutation had a much lower NF-κB DNA binding ability compared with the WT-YBX1 overexpression cells. These data suggest that Ser-176 phosphorylation is necessary for YBX1 to modulate NF-κB DNA binding activity. We also wondered whether IL-1β induces the binding of YBX1 to NF-κB. To examine this possibility, 293 cells or HT29 cells co-expressed with FLAG-p65 (the subunit of NF-κB) (1Prabhu L. Mundade R. Wang B. Wei H. Hartley A.V. Martin M. McElyea K. Temm C.J. Sandusky G. Liu Y. Lu T. Critical role of phosphorylation of serine 165 of YBX1 on the activation of NF-κB in colon cancer.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 29396-29412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Myc-WT-YBX1 (Fig. 7D) were established and used as the experimental models. Upon treatment with IL-1β for 1 h, we observed increased binding of Myc-WT-YBX1 to FLAG-p65, suggesting that IL-1β may induce the binding of YBX1 to NF-κB, leading to YBX1-enhanced NF-κB activation. YBX1 nuclear shuttling has been associated with increased tumor promoter activity. We therefore examined whether phosphorylation at Ser-176 is important for nuclear translocation of YBX1. We carried out an immunofluorescence (IF) experiment with a specific monoclonal antibody for FLAG-tagged YBX1 in our FLAG-WT-YBX1 and FLAG-S176A overexpression 293 or HT29 cells. As shown in Fig. 8, upon treatment with IL-1β, FLAG-WT-YBX1 was localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas the FLAG-S176A mutant exhibited a different pattern by localizing only to the cytoplasm (Fig. 8). These data suggest that Ser-176 phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear translocation of YBX1. Activation of NF-κB is associated with the release of many different cytokines from cells. Therefore, we decided to examine the effects of the S176A mutant on cytokine secretion profiles. Conditioned medium was collected from HT29 cells with either WT-YBX1 or S176A mutant overexpression. A cytokine ELISA array was further carried out in triplicate to determine the secretion of different cytokines and growth factors. As shown in Fig. 9, most factors showed reduced secretion in the S176A mutant line compared with the WT-YBX1 sample, whereas there was an overall increase in cytokine expression in the WT-YBX1 line compared with the control. Specifically, secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, VEGF, TNFα, and PDGF was reduced in the S176A mutant compared with the WT-YBX1 sample. Importantly, thes"
https://openalex.org/W2579151423,"Women with diabetes have a worse survival after breast cancer diagnosis compared to women without diabetes. This may be due to a different etiological profile, leading to the development of more aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Our aim was to investigate whether insulin and non-insulin treated women with diabetes develop specific clinicopathological breast cancer subtypes compared to women without diabetes.This cross-sectional study included randomly selected patients with invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 2000-2010. Stratified by age at breast cancer diagnosis (≤50 and >50 years), women with diabetes were 2:1 frequency-matched on year of birth and age at breast cancer diagnosis (both in 10-year categories) to women without diabetes, to select ~300 patients with tumor tissue available. Tumor MicroArrays were stained by immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER, PR), HER2, Ki67, CK5/6, CK14, and p63. A pathologist scored all stains and revised morphology and grade. Associations between diabetes/insulin treatment and clinicopathological subtypes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Morphology and grade were not significantly different between women with diabetes (n = 211) and women without diabetes (n = 101), irrespective of menopausal status. Premenopausal women with diabetes tended to have more often PR-negative (OR = 2.44(95%CI:1.07-5.55)), HER2-negative (OR = 2.84(95%CI:1.11-7.22)), and basal-like (OR = 3.14(95%CI:1.03-9.60) tumors than the women without diabetes, with non-significantly increased frequencies of ER-negative (OR = 2.48(95%CI:0.95-6.45)) and triple negative (OR = 2.60(95%CI:0.88-7.67) tumors. After adjustment for age and BMI, the associations remained similar in size but less significant. We observed no evidence for associations of clinicopathological subtypes with diabetes in postmenopausal women, or with insulin treatment in general.We found no compelling evidence that women with diabetes, treated with or without insulin, develop different breast cancer subtypes than women without diabetes. However, premenopausal women with diabetes tended to develop breast tumors that do not express hormonal receptors, which are typically associated with poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2573522659,"Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is characterized by an extensive genetic heterogeneity, implicating 27 genes, which account for 50 to 70% of cases. Here 86 Belgian probands with possible adRP underwent genetic testing to unravel the molecular basis and to assess the contribution of the genes underlying their condition.Mutation detection methods evolved over the past ten years, including mutation specific methods (APEX chip analysis), linkage analysis, gene panel analysis (Sanger sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing), high-resolution copy number screening (customized microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization). Identified variants were classified following American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommendations.Molecular genetic screening revealed mutations in 48/86 cases (56%). In total, 17 novel pathogenic mutations were identified: four missense mutations in RHO, five frameshift mutations in RP1, six mutations in genes encoding spliceosome components (SNRNP200, PRPF8, and PRPF31), one frameshift mutation in PRPH2, and one frameshift mutation in TOPORS. The proportion of RHO mutations in our cohort (14%) is higher than reported in a French adRP population (10.3%), but lower than reported elsewhere (16.5-30%). The prevalence of RP1 mutations (10.5%) is comparable to other populations (3.5%-10%). The mutation frequency in genes encoding splicing factors is unexpectedly high (altogether 19.8%), with PRPF31 the second most prevalent mutated gene (10.5%). PRPH2 mutations were found in 4.7% of the Belgian cohort. Two families (2.3%) have the recurrent NR2E3 mutation p.(Gly56Arg). The prevalence of the recurrent PROM1 mutation p.(Arg373Cys) was higher than anticipated (3.5%).Overall, we identified mutations in 48 of 86 Belgian adRP cases (56%), with the highest prevalence in RHO (14%), RP1 (10.5%) and PRPF31 (10.5%). Finally, we expanded the molecular spectrum of PRPH2, PRPF8, RHO, RP1, SNRNP200, and TOPORS-associated adRP by the identification of 17 novel mutations."

However, the local relation between cartilage in terms of thickness distribution and biochemical composition and the local contact pressure during walking has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between cartilage thickness, proteoglycan and collagen concentration in the knee joint and knee loading in terms of contact forces and pressure during walking. 3D gait analysis and MRI (3D-FSE, T1ρ relaxation time and T2 relaxation time sequence) of fifteen healthy subjects were acquired. Experimental gait data was processed using musculoskeletal modeling to calculate the contact forces, impulses and pressure distribution in the tibiofemoral joint. Correlates to local cartilage thickness and mean T1ρ and T2 relaxation times of the weight-bearing area of the femoral condyles were examined. Local thickness was significantly correlated with local pressure: medial thickness was correlated with medial condyle contact pressure and contact force, and lateral condyle thickness was correlated with lateral condyle contact pressure and contact force during stance. Furthermore, average T1ρ and T2 relaxation time correlated significantly with the peak contact forces and impulses. Increased T1ρ relaxation time correlated with increased shear loading, decreased T1ρ and T2 relaxation time correlated with increased compressive forces and pressures. Thicker cartilage was correlated with higher condylar loading during walking, suggesting that cartilage thickness is increased in those areas experiencing higher loading during a cyclic activity such as gait. Furthermore, the proteoglycan and collagen concentration and orientation derived from T1ρ and T2 relaxation measures were related to loading."

In this study, P. polymyxa WLY78 is labelled with gfp gene. The GFP-labelled P. polymyxa WLY78 is used to inoculate wheat, maize and cucumber seedlings grown in the gnotobiotic system and in soil, respectively. Observation by confocal laser scanning microscope reveals that the GFP-labeled bacterial cells are mainly located on the root surface and epidermis of wheat, and only a few cells are present within cortical cells. In maize and cucumber seedlings, bacterial cells were colonized in epidermal and cortical cells, intercellular spaces and vascular system of root, stem and leaf tissue interiors besides on root surfaces. Higher densities of the bacterial cells in roots, stems and leaves indicated that P. polymyxa WLY78 cells could migrate from roots to stems and leaves of maize and cucumber. This study will provide insight into interaction between P. polymyxa WLY78 and host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2574698511,"On polar coasts, seasonal sea-ice duration strongly influences shallow marine environments by affecting environmental conditions, such as light, sedimentation, and physical disturbance. Sea-ice dynamics are changing in response to climate, but there is limited understanding of how this might affect shallow marine environments and benthos. Here we present a unique set of physical and biological data from a single region of Antarctic coast, and use it to gain insights into factors shaping polar benthic communities. At sites encompassing a gradient of sea-ice duration, we measured temporal and spatial variation in light and sedimentation and hard-substrate communities at different depths and substrate orientations. Biological trends were highly correlated with sea-ice duration, and appear to be driven by opposing gradients in light and sedimentation. As sea-ice duration decreased, there was increased light and reduced sedimentation, and concurrent shifts in community structure from invertebrate to algal dominance. Trends were strongest on shallower, horizontal surfaces, which are most exposed to light and sedimentation. Depth and substrate orientation appear to mediate exposure of benthos to these factors, thereby tempering effects of sea-ice and increasing biological heterogeneity. However, while light and sedimentation both varied spatially with sea-ice, their dynamics differed temporally. Light was sensitive to the site-specific date of sea-ice breakout, whereas sedimentation fluctuated at a regional scale coincident with the summer phytoplankton bloom. Sea-ice duration is clearly the overarching force structuring these shallow Antarctic benthic communities, but direct effects are imposed via light and sedimentation, and mediated by habitat characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2571924900,"Quality control mechanisms intervene appropriately when defective translation events occur, in order to preserve the integrity of protein synthesis. Rescue of ribosomes translating on messenger RNAs that lack stop codons is one of the co-translational quality control pathways. In many bacteria, ArfA recognizes stalled ribosomes and recruits the release factor RF2, which catalyses the termination of protein synthesis. Although an induced-fit mechanism of nonstop mRNA surveillance mediated by ArfA and RF2 has been reported, the molecular interaction between ArfA and RF2 in the ribosome that is responsible for the mechanism is unknown. Here we report an electron cryo-microscopy structure of ArfA and RF2 in complex with the 70S ribosome bound to a nonstop mRNA. The structure, which is consistent with our kinetic and biochemical data, reveals the molecular interactions that enable ArfA to specifically recruit RF2, not RF1, into the ribosome and to enable RF2 to release the truncated protein product in this co-translational quality control pathway. The positively charged C-terminal domain of ArfA anchors in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. Furthermore, binding of ArfA and RF2 induces conformational changes in the ribosomal decoding centre that are similar to those seen in other protein-involved decoding processes. Specific interactions between residues in the N-terminal domain of ArfA and RF2 help RF2 to adopt a catalytically competent conformation for peptide release. Our findings provide a framework for understanding recognition of the translational state of the ribosome by new proteins, and expand our knowledge of the decoding potential of the ribosome."

Here, we investigate the enhancement of TRPA1 function caused by inflammatory mediators, which is thought to be important in lung conditions such as asthma and COPD. Protein kinase A is an important kinase acting downstream of inflammatory mediators to cause sensitization of TRPA1. By using site-directed mutagenesis, patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging we identify four amino acid residues, S86, S317, S428, and S972, as the principal targets of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and sensitization of TRPA1."

It is a promising target for novel drug development for the treatment of a number of pathological states. A novel peptide producing a significant potentiating effect on allyl isothiocyanate- and diclofenac-induced currents of TRPA1 was isolated from the venom of sea anemone Metridium senile. It is a 35-amino acid peptide cross-linked by two disulfide bridges named τ-AnmTX Ms 9a-1 (short name Ms 9a-1) according to a structure similar to other sea anemone peptides belonging to structural group 9a. The structures of the two genes encoding the different precursor proteins of Ms 9a-1 were determined. Peptide Ms 9a-1 acted as a positive modulator of TRPA1 in vitro but did not cause pain or thermal hyperalgesia when injected into the hind paw of mice. Intravenous injection of Ms 9a-1 (0.3 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in the nociceptive and inflammatory response to allyl isothiocyanate (the agonist of TRPA1) and reversed CFA (Complete Freund's Adjuvant)-induced inflammation and thermal hyperalgesia. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that Ms 9a-1 potentiates the response of TRPA1 to endogenous agonists followed by persistent functional loss of TRPA1-expressing neurons. We can conclude that TRPA1 potentiating may be useful as a therapeutic approach as Ms 9a-1 produces significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice models of pain.

https://openalex.org/W2576035380,"The “hub and spoke model” of semantic representation suggests that the multimodal features of objects are drawn together by an anterior temporal lobe (ATL) “hub”, while modality-specific “spokes” capture perceptual/action features. However, relatively little is known about how these components are recruited through time to support object identification. We used magnetoencephalography to measure neural oscillations within left ATL, lateral fusiform cortex (FC) and central sulcus (CS) during word-picture matching at different levels of specificity (employing superordinate vs. specific labels) for different categories (manmade vs. animal). This allowed us to determine (i) when each site was sensitive to semantic category and (ii) whether this was modulated by task demands. In ATL, there were two phases of response: from around 100 ms post-stimulus there were phasic bursts of low gamma activity resulting in reductions in oscillatory power, relative to a baseline period, that were modulated by both category and specificity; this was followed by more sustained power decreases across frequency bands from 250 ms onwards. In the spokes, initial power increases were not stronger for specific identification, while later power decreases were stronger for specific-level identification in FC for animals and in CS for manmade objects (from around 150 ms and 200 ms, respectively). These data are inconsistent with a temporal sequence in which early sensory-motor activity is followed by later retrieval in ATL. Instead, knowledge emerges from the rapid recruitment of both hub and spokes, with early specificity and category effects in the ATL hub. The balance between these components depends on semantic category and task, with visual cortex playing a greater role in the fine-grained identification of animals and motor cortex contributing to the identification of tools."
https://openalex.org/W2578221118,"Obese patients with chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) have an increased risk of developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The C-C chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) has a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells to WAT and liver, thereby promoting the inflammatory component of the disease. Herein, we examined whether intervention with propagermanium, an inhibitor of CCR2, would attenuate tissue inflammation and NASH development.Male C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) for 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks to characterize the development of early disease symptoms of NASH, i.e. insulin resistance and WAT inflammation (by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and histology, respectively) and to define the optimal time point for intervention. In a separate study, mice were pretreated with HFD followed by propagermanium treatment (0.05% w/w) after 6 weeks (early intervention) or 12 weeks (late intervention). NASH was analyzed after 24 weeks of diet feeding.Insulin resistance in WAT developed after 6 weeks of HFD, which was paralleled by modest WAT inflammation. Insulin resistance and inflammation in WAT intensified after 12 weeks of HFD, and preceded NASH development. The subsequent CCR2 intervention experiment showed that early, but not late, propagermanium treatment attenuated insulin resistance. Only the early treatment significantly decreased Mcp-1 and CD11c gene expression in WAT, indicating reduced WAT inflammation. Histopathological analysis of liver demonstrated that propagermanium treatment decreased macrovesicular steatosis and tended to reduce lobular inflammation, with more pronounced effects in the early intervention group. Propagermanium improved the ratio between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages, quantified by CD11c and Arginase-1 gene expression in both intervention groups.Overall, early propagermanium administration was more effective to improve insulin resistance, WAT inflammation and NASH compared to late intervention. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions for NASH directed at the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway should be initiated early."

The effects of HCO3− addition under zinc-sufficient (+Zn) and zinc-deficient (−Zn) conditions on the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of seedlings of two Moraceae species (Broussonetia papyrifera and Morus alba) and two Brassicaceae species (Orychophragmus violaceus and Brassica napus) were investigated. These four species were hydroponically grown in nutrient solution with 0 mM Zn (−Zn) or 0.02 mM Zn (+Zn) and 0 mM or 10 mM HCO3−. The photosynthetic response to HCO3− treatment, Zn deficiency, or both varied according to plant species. Of the four species, Broussonetia papyrifera showed the best adaptability to Zn deficiency for both the 0 mM and 10 mM HCO3− treatments due to its strong growth and minimal inhibition of photosynthesis and photosystem II (PS II). Brassica napus was sensitive to Zn deficiency, HCO3− treatment, or both as evidenced by the considerable inhibition of photosynthesis and high PS II activity. The results indicated different responses of various plant species to Zn deficiency and excess HCO3−. Broussonetia papyrifera was shown to have potential as a pioneer species in karst regions."

Users of these units are, however, often frustrated by the limited options for controlling camera functions, the generation of large numbers of images, and the lack of flexibility to suit different research environments and questions. We describe the development of a user-customisable open source camera trap platform named ‘WiseEye’, designed to provide flexible camera trap technology for wildlife researchers. The novel platform is based on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and compatible peripherals that allow the user to control its functions and performance. We introduce the concept of confirmatory sensing, in which the Passive Infrared triggering is confirmed through other modalities (i.e. radar, pixel change) to reduce the occurrence of false positives images. This concept, together with user-definable metadata, aided identification of spurious images and greatly reduced post-collection processing time. When tested against a commercial camera trap, WiseEye was found to reduce the incidence of false positive images and false negatives across a range of test conditions. WiseEye represents a step-change in camera trap functionality, greatly increasing the value of this technology for wildlife research and conservation management."

So, the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhea (GAPPD) by WHO and UNICEF includes measles vaccination as preventive measure in children. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of measles vaccination on Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and diarrhea in children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.We analyzed data from the most recent rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the selected countries. We included children age 12-59 months in the analysis. We used multivariable binary logistic regression to examine the effect of measles vaccination on ARI and diarrhea in children. We also estimated Vaccination Effectiveness (VE).More than 60 percent of the children age 12-59 months were given measles vaccine before the survey in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India and Pakistan. Children who were given the measles vaccine were less likely to suffer from ARI than unvaccinated children in India and Pakistan. Children who were given the measles vaccine had a lower risk of diarrhea than those who did not receive it in all the selected countries except Ethiopia. Measles vaccination was associated with reduction in ARI cases by 15-30 percent in India and Pakistan, and diarrhea cases by 12-22 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.The receipt of the measles vaccine was associated with decrease in ARI and diarrhea in children. The immunization program must ensure that each child gets the recommended doses of measles vaccine at the appropriate age.

https://openalex.org/W2578123384,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants, young children, and the elderly. The G glycoprotein plays a role in host cell attachment and also modulates the host immune response, thereby inducing disease pathogenesis. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; 5H6 and 3A5) against G protein core fragment (Gcf), which consisted of amino acid residues 131 to 230 from RSV A2 G protein. Epitope mapping study revealed that 5H6 specifically binds to the G/164-176 peptide that includes conserved sequences shared by both RSV A and B subtypes, and 3A5 binds to the G/190-204 peptide. Studies with mutant Gcf proteins in which cysteine residues were substituted with alanine revealed that 5H6 requires four cysteines for binding and 3A5 binds to Gcf variants with alanine substitutions better than wild-type. To determine if these mAbs reduce pulmonary viral infection, BALB/c mice were administered mAb and subsequently challenged with RSV. On day 4 post-infection, lung viral titers were reduced by up to 93% with the 5H6 injection and 90% with the 3A5 injection, indicating that prophylactic injection of these mAbs contributes to RSV clearance in vivo. Importantly, 5H6 injection reduced vaccine-enhanced diseases. Overall, our results suggest that this novel anti-G mAb could be used as a prophylactic regimen against RSV diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2579858377,"The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of different dietary fruit pomaces in reducing lipid oxidation in the meat of turkeys fed diets with a high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Over a period of 4 weeks before slaughter, turkeys were fed diets with the addition of 5% dried apple, blackcurrant, strawberry and seedless strawberry pomaces (groups AP, BP, SP and SSP, respectively) and 2.5% linseed oil. Pomaces differed in the content (from 5.5 in AP to 43.1 mg/g in SSP) and composition of polyphenols Proanthocyanidins were the main polyphenolic fraction in all pomaces, AP contained flavone glycosides and dihydrochalcones, BP contained anthocyanins, and SP and SSP-ellagitannins. The n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in all diets was comparable and lower than 2:1. In comparison with groups C and AP, the percentage of n-3 PUFAs in the total fatty acid pool of white meat from the breast muscles of turkeys in groups BP, SP and SSP was significantly higher, proportionally to the higher content of α-linolenic acid in berry pomaces. The fatty acid profile of dark meat from thigh muscles, including the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, was similar and lower than 3:1 in all groups. Vitamin A levels in raw breast muscles were higher in group AP than in groups C and BP (P<0.05). The addition of fruit pomaces to turkey diets lowered vitamin E concentrations (P = 0.001) in raw breast muscles relative to group C. Diets supplemented with fruit pomaces significantly lowered the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in raw, frozen and cooked meat. Our results indicate that the dietary application of dried fruit pomaces increases the oxidative stability of meat from turkeys fed linseed oil, and strawberry pomace exerted the most desirable effects due to its highest polyphenol content and antioxidant potential."
https://openalex.org/W4241089530,"Objectives The effects on health related outcomes of a newly-developed rehabilitation program, called ‘supported Fast Track multi-trauma rehabilitation service’ (Fast Track), were evaluated in comparison with conventional trauma rehabilitation service (Care as Usual). Methods Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized controlled study. Between 2009 and 2012, 132 adult multi-trauma patients were included: 65 Fast Track and 67 Care as Usual patients with an Injury Severity Score ≥16, complex multiple injuries in several extremities or complex pelvic and/or acetabulum fractures. The Fast Track program involved: integrated coordination between trauma surgeon and rehabilitation physician, shorter stay in hospital with faster transfer to a specialized trauma rehabilitation unit, earlier start of multidisciplinary treatment and ‘non-weight bearing’ mobilization. Primary outcomes were functional status (FIM) and quality of life (SF-36) measured through questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-trauma. Outcomes were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects regression model. Results The FIM scores significantly increased between 0 and 3 months (p<0.001) for both groups showing that they had improved overall, and continued to improve between 3 and 6 months for Fast Track (p = 0.04) and between 3 and 9 months for Care as Usual (p = 0.03). SF-36 scores significantly improved in both groups between 3 and 6 months (Fast Track, p<0.001; Care as Usual, p = 0.01). At 12 months, SF-36 scores were still below (self-reported) baseline measurements of patient health prior to the accident. However, the FIM and SF-36 scores differed little between the groups at any of the measured time points. Conclusion Both Fast Track and Care as Usual rehabilitation programs were effective in that multi-trauma patients improved their functional status and quality of life. A faster (maximum) recovery in functional status was observed for Fast Track at 6 months compared to 9 months for Care as Usual. At twelve months follow-up no differential effects between treatment conditions were found. Trial Registration ISRCTN68246661"
https://openalex.org/W2572335422,"Nutrition during the perinatal period programs body growth. Growth hormone (GH) secretion from the pituitary regulates body growth and is controlled by Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We observed that dietary restriction during the early postnatal period (i.e. lactation) in mice influences postnatal growth by permanently altering the development of the somatotropic axis in the pituitary gland. This alteration may be due to a lack of GHRH signaling during this critical developmental period. Indeed, underfed pups showed decreased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plasma levels, which are associated with lower innervation of the median eminence by GHRH axons at 10 days of age relative to normally fed pups. IGF-I preferentially stimulated axon elongation of GHRH neurons in in vitro arcuate explant cultures from 7 day-old normally fed pups. This IGF-I stimulating effect was selective since other arcuate neurons visualized concomitantly by neurofilament labeling, or AgRP immunochemistry, did not significantly respond to IGF-I stimulation. Moreover, GHRH neurons in explants from age-matched underfed pups lost the capacity to respond to IGF-I stimulation. Molecular analyses indicated that nutritional restriction was associated with impaired activation of AKT. These results highlight a role for IGF-I in axon elongation that appears to be cell selective and participates in the complex cellular mechanisms that link underfeeding during the early postnatal period with programming of the growth trajectory."

Changes in mechanical properties have been proposed as a risk factor in the development of deep tissue injury and may be useful as a diagnostic tool for early detection. MRE allows for the estimation of mechanical properties of soft tissue through analysis of shear wave data. The shear waves originate from vibrations induced by an external actuator placed on the tissue surface. In this study a combined Magnetic Resonance (MR) compatible indentation and MR Elastography (MRE) setup is presented to study mechanical properties associated with deep tissue injury in rats. The proposed setup allows for MRE investigations combined with damage-inducing large strain indentation of the Tibialis Anterior muscle in the rat hind leg inside a small animal MR scanner. An alginate cast allowed proper fixation of the animal leg with anatomical perfect fit, provided boundary condition information for FEA and provided good susceptibility matching. MR Elastography data could be recorded for the Tibialis Anterior muscle prior to, during, and after indentation. A decaying shear wave with an average amplitude of approximately 2 μm propagated in the whole muscle. MRE elastograms representing local tissue shear storage modulus Gd showed significant increased mean values due to damage-inducing indentation (from 4.2 ± 0.1 kPa before to 5.1 ± 0.6 kPa after, p<0.05). The proposed setup enables controlled deformation under MRI-guidance, monitoring of the wound development by MRI, and quantification of tissue mechanical properties by MRE. We expect that improved knowledge of changes in soft tissue mechanical properties due to deep tissue injury, will provide new insights in the etiology of deep tissue injuries, skeletal muscle damage and other related muscle pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2573159766,"Vaccines against pertussis have been available for more than 60 years. Nonetheless, this highly contagious disease is reemerging even in countries with high vaccination coverage. Genetic changes of Bordetella pertussis over time have been suggested to contribute to the resurgence of pertussis, as these changes may favor escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Nonetheless, studies on the effects of these bacterial changes on the immune response are limited. Here, we characterize innate immune recognition and activation by a collection of genetically diverse B. pertussis strains isolated from Dutch pertussis patients before and after the introduction of the pertussis vaccines. For this purpose, we used HEK-Blue cells transfected with human pattern recognition receptors TLR2, TLR4, NOD2 and NOD1 as a high throughput system for screening innate immune recognition of more than 90 bacterial strains. Physiologically relevant human monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDC), purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors were also used. Findings indicate that, in addition to inducing TLR2 and TLR4 signaling, all B. pertussis strains activate the NOD-like receptor NOD2 but not NOD1. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in TLR2 and NOD2, but not TLR4, activation by strains circulating after the introduction of pertussis vaccines. When using moDC, we observed that the recently circulating strains induced increased activation of these cells with a dominant IL-10 production. In addition, we observed an increased expression of surface markers including the regulatory molecule PD-L1. Expression of PD-L1 was decreased upon blocking TLR2. These in vitro findings suggest that emerging B. pertussis strains have evolved to dampen the vaccine-induced inflammatory response, which would benefit survival and transmission of this pathogen. Understanding how this disease has resurged in a highly vaccinated population is crucial for the design of improved vaccines against pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W2574260263,"Because a biomass gasification station includes various hazard factors, hazard assessment is needed and significant. In this article, the cloud model (CM) is employed to improve set pair analysis (SPA), and a novel hazard assessment method for a biomass gasification station is proposed based on the cloud model-set pair analysis (CM-SPA). In this method, cloud weight is proposed to be the weight of index. In contrast to the index weight of other methods, cloud weight is shown by cloud descriptors; hence, the randomness and fuzziness of cloud weight will make it effective to reflect the linguistic variables of experts. Then, the cloud connection degree (CCD) is proposed to replace the connection degree (CD); the calculation algorithm of CCD is also worked out. By utilizing the CCD, the hazard assessment results are shown by some normal clouds, and the normal clouds are reflected by cloud descriptors; meanwhile, the hazard grade is confirmed by analyzing the cloud descriptors. After that, two biomass gasification stations undergo hazard assessment via CM-SPA and AHP based SPA, respectively. The comparison of assessment results illustrates that the CM-SPA is suitable and effective for the hazard assessment of a biomass gasification station and that CM-SPA will make the assessment results more reasonable and scientific."
https://openalex.org/W2578768736,"In climate change research, future scenarios of greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions generated by integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used in climate models (CMs) and earth system models to analyze future interactions and feedback between human activities and climate. However, the spatial resolutions of IAMs and CMs differ. IAMs usually disaggregate the world into 10-30 aggregated regions, whereas CMs require a grid-based spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling emissions data from IAMs into a finer scale is necessary to input the emissions into CMs. In this study, we examined whether differences in downscaling methods significantly affect climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. We tested two downscaling methods using the same regionally aggregated sulfur emissions scenario obtained from the Asian-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model. The downscaled emissions were fed into the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC). One of the methods assumed a strong convergence of national emissions intensity (e.g., emissions per gross domestic product), while the other was based on inertia (i.e., the base-year remained unchanged). The emissions intensities in the downscaled spatial emissions generated from the two methods markedly differed, whereas the emissions densities (emissions per area) were similar. We investigated whether the climate change projections of temperature and precipitation would significantly differ between the two methods by applying a field significance test, and found little evidence of a significant difference between the two methods. Moreover, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the climate simulations based on these two downscaling methods."
https://openalex.org/W2573172952,"Most ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products are processed by tailoring enzymes to create complex natural products that are still recognizably peptide-based. However, some tailoring enzymes dismantle the peptide en route to synthesis of small molecules. A small molecule natural product of as yet unknown structure, mycofactocin, is thought to be synthesized in this way via the mft gene cluster found in many strains of mycobacteria. This cluster harbors at least six genes, which appear to be conserved across species. We have previously shown that one enzyme from this cluster, MftC, catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal Tyr of the substrate peptide MftA in a reaction that requires the MftB protein. Herein we show that mftE encodes a creatininase homolog that catalyzes cleavage of the oxidatively decarboxylated MftA peptide to liberate its final two residues, including the C-terminal decarboxylated Tyr (VY*). Unlike MftC, which requires MftB for function, MftE catalyzes the cleavage reaction in the absence of MftB. The identification of this novel metabolite, VY*, supports the notion that the mft cluster is involved in generating a small molecule from the MftA peptide. The ability to produce VY* from MftA by in vitro reconstitution of the activities of MftB, MftC, and MftE sets the stage for identification of the novel metabolite that results from the proteins encoded by the mft cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2575489469,"Genetic predisposition increases the risk of familial breast cancer. Recent studies indicate that genetic predisposition for familial breast cancer can be ethnic-specific. However, current knowledge of genetic predisposition for the disease is predominantly derived from Western populations. Using this existing information as the sole reference to judge the predisposition in non-Western populations is not adequate and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Efforts are required to collect genetic predisposition from non-Western populations. The Egyptian population has high genetic variations in reflecting its divergent ethnic origins, and incident rate of familial breast cancer in Egypt is also higher than the rate in many other populations. Using whole exome sequencing, we investigated genetic predisposition in five Egyptian familial breast cancer families. No pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2 and other classical breast cancer-predisposition genes were present in these five families. Comparison of the genetic variants with those in Caucasian familial breast cancer showed that variants in the Egyptian families were more variable and heterogeneous than the variants in Caucasian families. Multiple damaging variants in genes of different functional categories were identified either in a single family or shared between families. Our study demonstrates that genetic predisposition in Egyptian breast cancer families may differ from those in other disease populations, and supports a comprehensive screening of local disease families to determine the genetic predisposition in Egyptian familial breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2576305547,"NME1 (nonmetastatic expressed 1) gene, which encodes nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) A [also known as nonmetastatic clone 23 (NM23)-H1 in humans and NM23-M1 in mice], is a suppressor of metastasis, but several lines of evidence—mostly from plants—also implicate it in the regulation of the oxidative stress response. Here, our aim was to investigate the physiologic relevance of NDPK A with respect to the oxidative stress response in mammals and to study its molecular basis. NME1-knockout mice died sooner, suffered greater hepatocyte injury, and had lower superoxide dismutase activity than did wild-type (WT) mice in response to paraquat-induced acute oxidative stress. Deletion of NME1 reduced total NDPK activity and exacerbated activation of the stress-related MAPK, JNK, in the liver in response to paraquat. In a mouse transformed hepatocyte cell line and in primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes, MAPK activation in response to H2O2 and UVB, respectively, was dampened by expression of NM23-M1/NM23-H1, dependent on its NDPK catalytic activity. Furthermore, excess or depletion of NM23-M1/NM23-H1 NDPK activity did not affect the intracellular bulk concentration of nucleoside di- and triphosphates. NME1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts grew poorly in culture, were more sensitive to stress than WT fibroblasts, and did not immortalize, which suggested that they senesce earlier than do WT fibroblasts. Collectively, these results indicate that the NDPK activity of NM23-M1/NM23-H1 protects cells from acute oxidative stress by inhibiting activation of JNK in mammal models. —Peuchant, E., Bats, M.-L., Moranvillier, I., Lepoivre, M., Guitton, J., Wendum, D., Lacombe, M.-L., Moreau-Gaudry, F., Boissan, M., Dabernat, S.

https://openalex.org/W2579485419,"Background Juvenile violent offending is a serious worldwide public health issue. Objective The study examined whether the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) can be used to predict violent reoffending in Chinese male juvenile offenders, and to determine which risk/protective domains (items) are associated with violent recidivism. Methods A total of 246 male juvenile offenders were recruited. SAVRY domains were scored by trained raters based on file review and interviews with participants and their legal guardians. Information on further arrests, charges, or convictions for violent offences were collected from police records over a five year follow-up. Results Over the course of the five year follow-up periods, 63 (25.6%) juvenile offenders were re-arrested for a further violent reoffence. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses showed Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.60 to 0.68 for the SAVRY total, risk and protective score domains. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that 7 of the 30 SAVRY items were significantly associated with reoffending; explaining 36.2% of the variance. Backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed the independently predictive items were items 2 (‘history of non-violent offending’), 17 (‘negative attitudes’), 18 (‘risk-taking/impulsivity’), and 20 (‘anger management problems’). Together these four items explained 25.0% of the variance in reoffending. Conclusions The results suggested that the SAVRY can be meaningfully used to inform the development and evaluation of effective violence risk assessment and management approaches for male juvenile offenders detained in a Youth Detention Center in Hunan province, China."
https://openalex.org/W2572265702,The Single Variable Exchange algorithm is based on a simple idea; any model that can be simulated can be estimated by producing draws from the posterior distribution. We build on this simple idea by framing the Exchange algorithm as a mixture of Metropolis transition kernels and propose strategies that automatically select the more efficient transition kernels. In this manner we achieve significant improvements in convergence rate and autocorrelation of the Markov chain without relying on more than being able to simulate from the model. Our focus will be on statistical models in the Exponential Family and use two simple models from educational measurement to illustrate the contribution.
https://openalex.org/W2573816491,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mediates immune tolerance, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) negatively regulates the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway. We determined previously that platelet-activating factor (PAF) protects mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock, but its detailed mechanism of action was unknown. We performed survival experiments in IDO+/+ and IDO−/− mice using an LPS-induced endotoxemia model and rated organ injury (neutrophil infiltration and liver function). Using ELISA and Western blotting, we also investigated the mechanism of PAF-mediated endotoxin tolerance during endotoxemia. PAF-mediated endotoxin tolerance was dependent on IDO in vivo and in vitro and was not observed in IDO−/− mice. JAK/STAT signaling, crucial for SOCS3 expression, was also impaired in the absence of IDO. In an IDO- and STAT-dependent manner, PAF mediated a decrease in IL-12 and a dramatic increase in IL-10 and reduced mouse mortality. In addition, PAF attenuated LPS-mediated neutrophil infiltration into the lungs and interactions between neutrophil-like (THP-1) and endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). These results indicate that PAF-mediated endotoxin tolerance is initiated via IDO- and JAK/STAT-dependent expression of SOCS3. Our study has revealed a novel tolerogenic mechanism of IDO action and an important association between IDO and SOCS3 with respect to endotoxin tolerance."

However, changes to the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 in 2012 resulted in Australian indigenous hunters becoming potentially liable to prosecution for using traditional practices to slaughter marine turtles. To provide indigenous hunters with an alternative scientifically tested method to hunt, we developed and tested a humane method as an option to use in indigenous communities. Between 2012 and 2015, a device was developed, tested on 11 carcasses to determine effectiveness and repeatability, used on 5 anaesthetised animals independently diagnosed as candidates for euthanasia, and ultimately used on 2 healthy, conscious animals as part of normal indigenous community subsistence harvesting under observation before being left with the communities for use. Feedback was sought from the communities on the suitability and potential adoption of the device. The device effectively ablated the hind brain and severed the spinal cord when deployed in 81% (9/11) of the tested carcasses, with death in 100% (5/5) of turtles, on average, within 78 seconds of deployment on anaesthetised turtles and death in 100% (2/2) of turtles, on average, within 144 seconds when deployed on healthy turtles within community. Failure to ablate the hindbrain and sever the spinal cord in the cadaver cases was due to incorrect deployment of the device. This device showed promise as an alternative euthanasia method available to indigenous communities of the Torres Straits. Further work is required to encourage acceptance by hunters."
https://openalex.org/W2575715999,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plays an essential role in proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The Rb/E2F and TSC/mTOR pathways contribute to the proliferation of VSMCs, but its exact roles in PDGF-induced proliferation are unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the roles of Rb/E2F and TSC/mTOR pathways in PDGF-induced proliferation in VSMCs. We found that PDGF stimulates the activity of E2F and mTOR pathways, and knockdown of either Rb or TSC2 increases PDGF-induced proliferation in VSMCs. More interestingly, we revealed that enhancing both E2F and mTOR activity leads to synergistic inhibition of PDGF-induced proliferation in VSMCs. We further identified that the synergistic inhibition effect is caused by the induced oxidative stress. Summarily, these data suggest the important regulations of Rb/E2F and TSC/mTOR pathways in PDGF-induced proliferation in VSMCs, and also present a promising way to limit deregulated proliferation by PDGF induction in VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2575107914,"Habitat productivity may affect the stability of consumer-resource systems, through both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. We hypothesize that coevolving consumer-resource systems show more stable dynamics at intermediate resource availability, while very low-level resource supply cannot support sufficiently large populations of resource and consumer species to avoid stochastic extinction, and extremely resource-rich environments may promote escalatory arms-race-like coevolution that can cause strong fluctuations in species abundance and even extinction of one or both trophic levels. We tested these ideas by carrying out an experimental evolution study with a model bacterium-phage system (Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its phage SBW25Φ2). Consistent with our hypothesis, this system was most stable at intermediate resource supply (fewer extinction events and smaller magnitude of population fluctuation). In our experiment, the rate of coevolution between bacterial resistance and phage infectivity was correlated with the magnitude of population fluctuation, which may explain the different in stability between levels of resource supply. Crucially, our results are consistent with a suggestion that, among the two major modes of antagonistic coevolution, arms race is more likely than fluctuation selection dynamics to cause extinction events in consumer-resource systems. This study suggests an important role of environment-dependent coevolutionary dynamics for the stability of consumer-resource species systems, therefore highlights the importance to consider contemporaneous evolutionary dynamics when studying the stability of ecosystems, particularly those under environmental changes."

This sensorless model requires a measurement of the stator currents and voltages, and the rotor speed is predicted accurately without any mechanical measurement of the rotor speed. A model of an electric vehicle undergoing acceleration was built, and the sensorless prediction of the simulation rotor speed was determined to be robust even in the presence of fluctuating motor parameters and significant sensor errors. Studies were conducted for varying pulse width modulator resolutions, and the sensorless model was accurate for all resolutions of sinusoidal voltage functions."
