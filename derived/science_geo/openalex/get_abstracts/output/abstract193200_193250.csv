 ribonuclease, particularly the N and C terminal sequences and the nature of cross-linkages in RNase. In it, Anfinsen, Redfield,
 Choate, Page, and Carroll described the gross structure and indicated that the fine structure should soon be apparent."

These advantages have been applied lately by a number of investigators3,4 to studies dealing with the effect of viral infection upon the neoplastic process and with the adaptation of virus to the ascitic cells5. These investigations have all been carried out in the peritoneal cavity of the mouse. An in vitro technique which may prove feasible for similar studies, particularly host-cell virus studies in neoplastic cells cultivated apart from the animal, was recently developed in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2088005086,"IT was observed in 19471 that the thyroid gland of the mouse specifically accumulates intravenously injected uranin (sodium-fluoresceinate) ; large concentrations of sodium are known to be present in the thyroid colloid. Similarly, we observed the appearance of uranin upon intravenous injection of its 5 per cent solution in high amounts in the hypophysis of mice, particularly in the posterior lobe of this gland2."
