https://openalex.org/W3158340479,"Neural recordings using invasive devices in humans can elucidate the circuits underlying brain disorders, but have so far been limited to short recordings from externalized brain leads in a hospital setting or from implanted sensing devices that provide only intermittent, brief streaming of time series data. Here, we report the use of an implantable two-way neural interface for wireless, multichannel streaming of field potentials in five individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) for up to 15 months after implantation. Bilateral four-channel motor cortex and basal ganglia field potentials streamed at home for over 2,600 h were paired with behavioral data from wearable monitors for the neural decoding of states of inadequate or excessive movement. We validated individual-specific neurophysiological biomarkers during normal daily activities and used those patterns for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS). This technological approach may be widely applicable to brain disorders treatable by invasive neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W3159442514,"Abstract Alternative splicing (AS) is pervasive in mammalian genomes, yet cross-species comparisons have been largely restricted to adult tissues and the functionality of most AS events remains unclear. We assessed AS patterns across pre- and postnatal development of seven organs in six mammals and a bird. Our analyses revealed that developmentally dynamic AS events, which are especially prevalent in the brain, are substantially more conserved than nondynamic ones. Cassette exons with increasing inclusion frequencies during development show the strongest signals of conserved and regulated AS. Newly emerged cassette exons are typically incorporated late in testis development, but those retained during evolution are predominantly brain specific. Our work suggests that an intricate interplay of programs controlling gene expression levels and AS is fundamental to organ development, especially for the brain and heart. In these regulatory networks, AS affords substantial functional diversification of genes through the generation of tissue- and time-specific isoforms from broadly expressed genes."

AUC is characterized by several recurrent targetable genomic alterations2-5. This study ( NCT02546661 , BISCAY) combined durvalumab with relevant targeted therapies in biomarker-selected chemotherapy-refractory AUC populations including: (1) fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors in tumors with FGFR DNA alterations (FGFRm); (2) pharmacological inhibitor of the enzyme poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) in tumors with and without DNA homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRRm); and (3) TORC1/2 inhibitors in tumors with DNA alteration to the mTOR/PI3K pathway3-5.This trial adopted a new, biomarker-driven, multiarm adaptive design. Safety, efficacy and relevant biomarkers were evaluated. Overall, 391 patients were screened of whom 135 were allocated to one of six study arms. Response rates (RRs) ranged 9-36% across the study arms, which did not meet efficacy criteria for further development. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were similar in the combination arms and durvalumab monotherapy arm. Biomarker analysis showed a correlation between circulating plasma-based DNA (ctDNA) and tissue for FGFRm. Sequential circulating tumor DNA analysis showed that changes to FGFRm correlated with clinical outcome. Our data support the clinical activity of FGFR inhibition and durvalumab monotherapy but do not show increased activity for any of the combinations. These findings question the targeted/immune therapy approach in AUC."
https://openalex.org/W3157834930,"Despite initial responses1–3, most melanoma patients develop resistance4 to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). To understand the evolution of resistance, we studied 37 tumor samples over 9 years from a patient with metastatic melanoma with complete clinical response to ICB followed by delayed recurrence and death. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-evolution of seven lineages with multiple convergent, but independent resistance-associated alterations. All recurrent tumors emerged from a lineage characterized by loss of chromosome 15q, with post-treatment clones acquiring additional genomic driver events. Deconvolution of bulk RNA sequencing and highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) revealed differences in immune composition among different lineages. Imaging revealed a vasculogenic mimicry phenotype in NGFRhi tumor cells with high PD-L1 expression in close proximity to immune cells. Rapid autopsy demonstrated two distinct NGFR spatial patterns with high polarity and proximity to immune cells in subcutaneous tumors versus a diffuse spatial pattern in lung tumors, suggesting different roles of this neural-crest-like program in different tumor microenvironments. Broadly, this study establishes a high-resolution map of the evolutionary dynamics of resistance to ICB, characterizes a de-differentiated neural-crest tumor population in melanoma immunotherapy resistance and describes site-specific differences in tumor–immune interactions via longitudinal analysis of a patient with melanoma with an unusual clinical course. Genetic and protein expression analyses of serially collected tumor biopsies from a patient with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors provide insights into tumor microenvironment changes that occur during treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3157081302,"Assessing individuals’ knowledge and preventive behaviors towards the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for the related public health surveillance strategies. Although some of the studies were conducted in Bangladesh, none of these studies considered the geographical distribution of knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Therefore, the present nationwide cross-sectional study with 10,067 samples for the first-time aims to assess the knowledge gap by presenting the geographical distribution of the COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors across all administrative districts of Bangladesh. The measures included socio-demographics and questions about knowledge and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. In addition, GIS-based mapping identified district-wise distribution of the outcomes. Results indicated that the overall mean score of knowledge related to COVID-19 was 14.363 ± 3.073, whereas 16.95 ± 2.89 was for preventive behaviors. Participants’ being male, being divorced or widowed, consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, living in villages, and having no formal education reported lower performing preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Those participants with higher knowledge scores reported higher preventive COVID-19 behaviors (β = 0.053, p &lt;0.001). However, the model predicted only 13.2% of the variation in preventive COVID-19 behaviors while the overall model being significant. The findings suggest that the Bangladeshi government should initiate appropriate far-reaching program of health education focusing on knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19 at a community level. After all, the strategies to combat COVID-19 will require individuals’ involvement to control and prevent the disease outbreak, for which education is essential."
https://openalex.org/W3158207568,"Direct cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes presents an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore cardiac function following injury. Cardiac reprogramming was initially achieved through overexpression of the transcription factors Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5; later, Hand2 and Akt1 were found to further enhance this process1-5. Yet, staunch epigenetic barriers severely limit the ability of these cocktails to reprogramme adult fibroblasts6,7. We undertook a screen of mammalian gene regulatory factors to discover novel regulators of cardiac reprogramming in adult fibroblasts and identified the histone reader PHF7 as the most potent activating factor8. Mechanistically, PHF7 localizes to cardiac super enhancers in fibroblasts, and through cooperation with the SWI/SNF complex, it increases chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding at these sites. Furthermore, PHF7 recruits cardiac transcription factors to activate a positive transcriptional autoregulatory circuit in reprogramming. Importantly, PHF7 achieves efficient reprogramming in the absence of Gata4. Here, we highlight the underexplored necessity of cardiac epigenetic readers, such as PHF7, in harnessing chromatin remodelling and transcriptional complexes to overcome critical barriers to direct cardiac reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W3157230943,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) is a bacterium associated with many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and has shown a high prevalence in Parkinson's disease (PD). As HP-associated GI dysfunction could affect L-dopa (levodopa) absorption, HP eradication might improve the clinical response and decrease motor fluctuations.A prospective cohort study was conducted on the clinical symptoms of PD patients with motor fluctuations. The 13C-urea breath test was used to diagnose a current HP infection. All patients with HP infection received a 2-week regimen of triple therapy. The changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score, L-dopa onset time, wearing-off symptoms, mean daily on-off time, GI symptom scores, and quality of life score were measured at baseline and at a 6-week follow-up.A total of 163 PD patients were assessed, of whom 40 were enrolled. Fifty-five percent of the enrolled patients (22/40) had a current HP infection, whereas HP eradication was identified in 17 of 22 (77.3%) patients who received eradication therapy. Patients with HP eradication showed a significant decrease in daily 'off' time (4.0 vs. 4.7 h, p = 0.040) and an increase in daily 'on' time (11.8 vs. 10.9 h, p = 0.009). Total wearing-off score (4.4 vs. 6.0, p = 0.001) and the GI symptom score (8.1 vs. 12.8, p = 0.007) were significantly improved. There was no significant improvement in L-dopa onset time, UPDRS motor score, or quality of life score.HP eradication leads to significant clinical improvement in the symptoms of PD. Eradication of HP not only increases the total daily 'on' time but also decreases wearing-off symptoms and improves GI symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3157423966,"The 2020's update of marine alien species list from Turkey yielded a total of 539 species belonging to 18 taxonomic groups, 404 of which have become established in the region and 135 species are casual. A total of 185 new alien species have been added to the list since the previous update of 2011. The present compilation includes reports of an ascidian species (Rhodosoma turcicum) new to the marine fauna of Turkey and range extensions of six species. Among the established species, 105 species have invasive characters at least in one zoogeographic region, comprising 19% of all alien species. Mollusca ranked first in terms of the number of species (123 species), followed by Foraminifera (91 species), Pisces (80 species) and Arthropoda (79 species). The number of alien species found in seas surrounding Turkey ranged from 28 (Black Sea) to 413 (Levantine Sea). The vectoral importance of the Suez Canal diminishes when moving from south to north, accounting for 72% of species introductions in the Levantine Sea vs. only 11% of species introductions in the Black Sea. Most alien species on the coasts of Turkey were originated from the Red Sea (58%), due to the proximity of the country to the Suez Canal. Shipping activities transported 39% of alien species, mainly from the Indo-Pacific area (20%) and the Atlantic Ocean (10%). Misidentified species (such as Pterois volitans, Trachurus declivis, etc.) and species those classified as questionable or cryptogenic were omitted from the list based on new data gathered in the last decade and expert judgements. The documented impacts of invasive species on socio-economy, biodiversity and human health in the last decade as well as the legislation and management backgrounds against alien species in Turkey are presented."

https://openalex.org/W3159081741,"Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2) is a key member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, while YES Proto-Oncogene 1 (YES1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (nRTK) and annexin A2 (ANXA2) belongs to the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family annexins. Here, we show that EphA2, YES1, and ANXA2 form a signal axis, in which YES1 activated by EphA2 phosphorylates ANXA2 at Tyr24 site, leading to ANXA2 activation and increased ANXA2 nuclear distribution in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Overexpression (OE) of YES1 increases, while knockdown (KD) of YES1 or ANXA2 decreases GC cell invasion and migration in vitro and tumor growth in mouse models. Reexpression of wildtype (WT) rather than mutant ANXA2 (Tyr24F) in ANXA2 knockdown (ANXA2-KD) GC cells restores YES1-induced cell invasion and migration, while neither WT nor mutant ANXA2 (Tyr24F) can restore cell invasion and migration in YES1-KD GC cells. In addition, the activation of EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 pathway is correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, our results establish EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 axis as a novel pathway that drives GC invasion and metastasis, targeting this pathway would be an efficient way for the treatment of GC."
https://openalex.org/W3157179436,"Porous materials have been widely used in the field of noise control. The non-acoustical parameters involved in the sound absorption model have an important effect on the sound absorption performance of porous materials. How to identify these non-acoustical parameters efficiently and accurately is an active research area and many researchers have devoted contributions on it. In this study, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to identify the non-acoustical parameters of the jute fiber felt. Firstly, the sound absorption model used to predict the sound absorption coefficient of the porous materials is introduced. Secondly, the model of non-acoustical parameter identification of porous materials is established. Then the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced and the feasibility of the algorithm applied to the parameter identification of porous materials is investigated. Finally, based on the sound absorption coefficient measured by the impedance tube the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to identify the non-acoustical parameters involved in the sound absorption model of the jute fiber felt, and the identification performance and the computational performance of the algorithm are discussed. Research results show that compared with other identification methods the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm has higher identification accuracy and is more suitable for the identification of non-acoustical parameters of the porous materials. The sound absorption coefficient curve predicted by the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm has good consistency with the experimental curve. In the aspect of computer running time, compared with the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm, the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm takes shorter running time. When the population size is larger, modified particle swarm optimization algorithm has more advantages in the running speed. In addition, this study demonstrates that the jute fiber felt is a good acoustical green fibrous material which has excellent sound absorbing performance in a wide frequency range and the peak value of its sound absorption coefficient can reach 0.8."
https://openalex.org/W3157553092,"A COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus, and effective vaccines are going to be available in the near future. It is urgent to estimate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and their value to individuals, in order to develop an effective public vaccination strategy. Based on a survey of 1,188 randomly selected respondents in China, we analyzed Chinese consumers’ willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and their willingness to pay for it. We find that 79.41% of the respondents are willing to get vaccinated in China, and the average amount that they’re willing to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine shot is 130.45 yuan . However, though the elderly are at higher risk of infection and the disease could be fatal for them, they are less willing to get the vaccine and not willing to pay as much for the shot. Subsidies and health communication concerning COVID-19 vaccines should be provided in order to expand vaccination coverage."
https://openalex.org/W3159342170,"Most empirical studies examining the export competitiveness of a country in a target market are undertaken by focusing on supply, only analysing the group of competing countries. In addition, if the target market to be analysed is extensive, like the European Union, it is generally analysed as a whole. This study presents an evaluation of the tomato export competitiveness, from a differentiated demand perspective, analysing its main customers markets in the context of European Union. The methodological framework is implemented through Constant Market Share to analyze variations in exports, allowing the portion attributable to competitiveness and segregation into general or specific competitiveness to be quantified. The Constant Market Share was adapted to focus on the differentiated demand so as to observe the influence of the worldwide crisis (2007/08) on the European tomato market. This study allows the analysis of profile changes into the competitor exporting economies. As a contribution to the methodology, this study presents a new graphical way of representing the results of Constant Market Share methodology by means of export competitiveness maps in the European tomato market for the group for each main competitor in each European client market. According to our results, Spain and Belgium are candidate countries to be competitive in the main European markets."
https://openalex.org/W3157248315,"Abstract Activation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway modulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth arrest, motility, and embryogenesis. An expression screen for long noncoding RNAs indicated that TGFβ induced mir-100-let-7a-2-mir-125b-1 cluster host gene ( MIR100HG ) expression in diverse cancer types, thus confirming an earlier demonstration of TGFβ-mediated transcriptional induction of MIR100HG in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MIR100HG depletion attenuated TGFβ signaling, expression of TGFβ-target genes, and TGFβ-mediated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, MIR100HG silencing inhibited both normal and cancer cell motility and enhanced the cytotoxicity of cytostatic drugs. MIR100HG overexpression had an inverse impact on TGFβ signaling responses. Screening for downstream effectors of MIR100HG identified the ligand TGFβ1. MIR100HG and TGFB1 mRNA formed ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RNA-binding protein HuR, promoting TGFβ1 cytokine secretion. In addition, TGFβ regulated let-7a-2–3p , miR-125b-5p , and miR-125b-1–3p expression, all encoded by MIR100HG intron-3. Certain intron-3 miRNAs may be involved in TGFβ/SMAD-mediated responses ( let-7a-2–3p ) and others ( miR-100 , miR-125b ) in resistance to cytotoxic drugs mediated by MIR100HG . In support of a model whereby TGFβ induces MIR100HG , which then enhances TGFβ1 secretion, analysis of human carcinomas showed that MIR100HG expression correlated with expression of TGFB1 and its downstream extracellular target TGFBI . Thus, MIR100HG controls the magnitude of TGFβ signaling via TGFβ1 autoinduction and secretion in carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W3158161932,"Esophageal cancer is a complex malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In Eastern Asia including China, about 90% of all incident cases have esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mounting evidence elucidates that aberrant expression of various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) contributes to ESCC progression, but it remains unclear how small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in ESCC development. We systemically screened clinically relevant snoRNAs in ESCC via integrative analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and validation in ESCC tissues. We found that snoRNA SNORD12B was one of the most evidently upregulated snoRNAs in ESCC specimens and its high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients. SNORD12B profoundly promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating its oncogene nature. In particular, SNORD12B could interact with PP-1α, one of the three catalytic subunits of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1, which is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates AKT to suppress its activation. Interestingly, high levels of SNORD12B in ESCC cells could break interactions between 14-3-3ζ and PP-1α, abolish the retention of PP-1α in the cytosol by 14-3-3ζ and relocate PP-1α from the cytosol to the nucleus. This led to sequestered PP-1α in the nucleus, enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the cytosol, activated AKT-mTOR-4EBP1 signaling, and, thus, ESCC progression. These insights would improve our understanding of how snoRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis and highlight the potential of snoRNAs as future therapeutic targets against cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3157156207,"The study aimed to highlight the profitability and production function analysis of Penaeus monodon and Litopenaeus vannamei in intensified shrimp farms in Gujarat (India). Two hundred and twenty (220) shrimp farm households were used to identify (principal component and cluster analyses) 8 clusters of management practices that reflected various scales of production intensity ranging from 0-2999 kg/ha/crop to 9000kg/ha/crop and above for both the species. The Cobb-Douglas production function, which relates production output to several independent input variables, was used to determine productivity. The budgeting analysis for both the species showed that more intensively managed farms performed more than the less intensive farm. Empirical results show feed as most significant input for Penaeus monodon and Litopenaeus vannamei seed and labor that affected production. Average net returns/ha/year for Penaeus monodon was $16313.13 and for Litopenaeus vannamei $41640.99. Aquaculture exhibited decreasing returns to scale for both the species and estimates on resource use efficiency revealed that in Penaeus monodon the resources were economically utilized and in case of Litopenaeus vannamei the output was likely to increase if more of seed and less of labor would have been used. The major constraint for the shrimp farmers was diseases which can be mitigated by optimum stocking densities and proper feed management."
https://openalex.org/W3159597442,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major pathogen implicated in nosocomial infections. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae isolates are a public health concern. We aim to characterize the type of β-lactamases and the associated resistance mechanisms in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from blood cultures in a Portuguese hospital, as well as to determine the circulating clones. Twenty-two cefotaxime/ceftazidime-resistant (CTX/CAZR) K. pneumoniae isolates were included in the study. Identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS and the antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk-diffusion. The screening test for ESBL-production was performed and ESBL-producer isolates were further characterized. The presence of different beta-lactamase genes (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, blaCMY-2, blaDHA-1, blaFOX, blaMOX, and blaACC) was analyzed by PCR/sequencing in ESBL-producer isolates, as well as the presence of other resistance genes (aac(6')-Ib-cr, tetA/B, dfrA, qnrA/B/S, sul1/2/3) or integron-related genes (int1/2/3). Multilocus-sequence-typing (MLST) was performed for selected isolates. ESBL activity was detected in 12 of the 22 CTX/CAZR K. pneumoniae isolates and 11 of them carried the blaCTX-M-15 gene (together with blaTEM), and the remaining isolate carried the blaSHV-106 gene. All the blaCTX-M-15 harboring isolates also contained a blaSHV gene (blaSHV-1, blaSHV-11 or blaSHV-27 variants). Both blaSHV-27 and blaSHV-106 genes correspond to ESBL-variants. Two of the CTX-M-15 producing isolates carried a carbapenemase gene (blaKPC2/3 and blaOXA-48) and showed imipenem resistance. The majority of the ESBL-producing isolates carried the int1 gene, as well as sulphonamide-resistance genes (sul2 and/or sul3); the tetA gene was detected in all eight tetracycline-resistant isolates. Three different genetic lineages were found in selected isolates: ST348 (one CTX-M-15/TEM/SHV-27/KPC-2/3-producer isolate), ST11 (two CTX-M-15/TEM/SHV-1- and CTX-M-15-TEM-SHV-11-OXA-48-producer isolates) and ST15 (one SHV-106/TEM-producer isolate). ESBL enzymes of CTX-M-15 or SHV-type are detected among blood K. pneumoniae isolates, in some cases in association with carbapenemases of KPC or OXA-48 type."
https://openalex.org/W3158161412,"B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders exhibit a diverse spectrum of diagnostic entities with heterogeneous behaviour. Multiple efforts have focused on the determination of the genomic drivers of B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In the meantime, the aggregation of diverse tumors in pan-cancer genomic studies has become a useful tool to detect new driver genes, while enabling the comparison of mutational patterns across tumors. Here we present an integrated analysis of 354 B-cell lymphoid disorders. 112 recurrently mutated genes were discovered, of which KMT2D , CREBBP , IGLL5 and BCL2 were the most frequent, and 31 genes were putative new drivers. Mutations in CREBBP , TNFRSF14 and KMT2D predominated in follicular lymphoma, whereas those in BTG2 , HTA-A and PIM1 were more frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Additionally, we discovered 31 significantly mutated protein networks, reinforcing the role of genes such as CREBBP , EEF1A1 , STAT6 , GNA13 and TP53 , but also pointing towards a myriad of infrequent players in lymphomagenesis. Finally, we report aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors associated with novel noncoding mutations ( DTX1 and S1PR2 ), and new recurrent copy number aberrations affecting immune check-point regulators ( CD83 , PVR ) and B-cell specific genes ( TNFRSF13C ). Our analysis expands the number of mutational drivers of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, and identifies several differential somatic events between disease subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W3157841933,"Streptococcus suis , particularly S . suis serotype 2 (SS2), is an important zoonotic pathogen causing meningitis in humans worldwide. Although the proper classification of the causative and pathogenic serotype is salutary for the clinical diagnosis, cross-reactions leading to the indistinguishability of serotypes by the current serotyping methods are significant limitations. In the present study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis of extracted peptides was developed to improve the classification of serotype of S . suis . The peptide mass fingerprint (PMFs) database of S . suis was generated from the whole-cell peptides of 32 reference strains of S . suis isolates obtained from pigs. Thirty-two human S . suis isolates from clinical cases in Thailand were used to validate this alternative serotyping method in direct comparison to the multiplex (m)PCR approach. All reference strains, representing 32 serotypes of S . suis , exhibited their individual PMFs patterns, thus allowing differentiation from one another. Highly pathogenic SS2 and SS14 were clearly differentiated from the otherwise serologically closely related SS1/2 and SS1, respectively. The developed MALDI-TOF-MS serotyping method correctly classified the serotype in 68.8% (22/32) of the same serotype isolates generated from the PMFs database; while the validity for the clinical human isolates was 62.5% (20/32). The agreement between the MALDI-TOF-MS and mPCR serotyping was moderate with a Kappa score of 0.522, considering that mPCR could correctly serotype up to 75%. The present study demonstrated that PMFs from the developed MALDI-TOF-MS-based method could successfully discriminate the previously indistinguishable highly pathogenic SS2 and SS14 from SS1/2 and SS1, respectively. Moreover, this serotyping method distinguished pathogenic SS6, and so is an alternative approach of choice to rapidly and reliably serotype clinically pathogenic S . suis isolates."
https://openalex.org/W3157141801,"Background Adolescents face socio-structural, personal and programmatic barriers to HIV prevention services, highlighting the importance of understanding knowledge and acceptability as essential aspects to promote their broader access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We analyzed the acceptability of PrEP among adolescent men who have sex with men (MSM), travestis and transgender women (TGW). Methods A qualitative investigation was conducted as part of the formative research of the PrEP15-19 study, an ongoing demonstration study that analyzes the effectiveness of daily PrEP among adolescent MSM, travestis and TGW aged 15–19 in three Brazilian cities. A total of 37 semi-structured interviews and 6 focus groups were conducted. Building from thematic analysis focusing on participants’ sexual encounters, perceptions about PrEP efficacy, and vulnerability contexts, we analyzed prospective acceptability of PrEP. Findings Knowledge about PrEP was incipient and characterized by adolescents’ frequent doubts about its prescription and efficacy. The ‘ideal’ use of PrEP appeared together with consistent condom use, especially in casual sex. PrEP use was also mentioned as depending on increased learning about prevention management over time. Main barriers to PrEP use included the incorporation of a daily medication into participants’ routine and its impact on their social lives, especially related to stigma. Concerns over short- and long-term side effects were also reported as barriers to PrEP use. TGW and travestis contrasted using PrEP with the precarity of their life conditions, and some expressed a critical vision about PrEP by associating it with pharmaceuticalization and trans necropolitics. Conclusions Participants’ low knowledge and acceptability of PrEP are circumscribed by a rigid perception of condom as the ideal prevention method and the context of their sexual relations. Prospective acceptability highlights that the successful uptake of PrEP depends on overcoming barriers of access to health services and confronting transphobia and homophobia as part of care."
https://openalex.org/W3158928590,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of ocular infections, often resulting in devastating vision loss. Despite the significant morbidity associated with these infections, little is yet known regarding the specific strain types that may have a predilection for ocular tissues nor the set of virulence factors that drive its pathogenicity in this specific biological niche. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can provide valuable insight in this regard by providing a prospective, comprehensive assessment of the strain types and virulence factors driving disease among specific subsets of clinical isolates. As such, a set of 163-member S. aureus ocular clinical strains were sequenced and assessed for both common strain types (multilocus sequence type (MLST), spa, agr) associated with ocular infections as well as the presence/absence of 235 known virulence factors in a high throughput manner. This ocular strain set was then directly compared to a fully sequenced 116-member non-ocular S. aureus strain set curated from NCBI in order to identify key differences between ocular and non-ocular S. aureus isolates. The most common sequence types found among ocular S. aureus isolates were ST5, ST8 and ST30, generally reflecting circulating non-ocular pathogenic S. aureus strains. However, importantly, ocular isolates were found to be significantly enriched for a set of enterotoxins, suggesting a potential role for this class of virulence factors in promoting ocular disease. Further genomic analysis revealed that these enterotoxins are located on mobile pathogenicity islands, thus horizontal gene transfer may promote the acquisition of enterotoxins, potentially amplifying S. aureus virulence in ocular tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3159035275,"In recent years, with rapid urbanization, the underlying urban surface has changed dramatically. Various urban eco-environmental problems have emerged globally, among which the urban heat island effect has become one of the most obvious urban eco-environmental problems. In this study, Nanjing, China, was chosen as the study area. Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing image data collected in Nanjing from 2014 to 2018, land surface temperatures were retrieved, the spatiotemporal variation track and characteristics of the thermal environment pattern were systematically depicted, and the driving factors of these variations were revealed. The results show that over the past five years, the spatial pattern of the heat field in Nanjing changed from a scattered distribution in the periphery of the city to a centralized distribution in the centre of the city, and the heat island intensity increased annually. Changes in administrative divisions, changes in the layout of the transportation trunk lines, transfer of industrial centres, and ecological construction projects are important driving factors for the evolution of the land surface thermal environment patterns of these regions. These research results will provide scientific and technological support for similar cities with typical heat island effects elsewhere in the world to formulate urban development plan, and to improve the urban ecological environment."
https://openalex.org/W3158770230,"Home birth is very common in the Peruvian Amazon. In rural areas of the Loreto region, home to indigenous populations such as the Kukama-Kukamiria, birth takes place at home constantly. This study aims to understand the preference for home births as well as childbirth and newborn care practices among Kukama-Kukamiria women in rural Loreto. Following a case study approach, sixty semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with recent mothers who experienced childbirth within one year prior to the interview, female relatives of recent mothers who had a role in childbirth, male relatives of recent mothers, community health workers, and traditional healers. We found that for women from these communities, home birth is a courageous act and an intimate (i.e. members of the community and relatives participate in it) and inexpensive practice in comparison with institutional birth. These preferences are also linked to experiences of mistreatment at health facilities, lack of cultural adaptation of birthing services, and access barriers to them. Preparations for home births included handwashing and cleaning delivery surfaces. After birth, waiting for the godparent to arrive to cut the cord can delay drying of the newborn. Discarding of colostrum, lack of skin-to-skin contact as well as a range of responses regarding immediate breastfeeding and immediate drying of the baby were also found. These findings were used to tailor the educational content of the Mamas del Rio program, where community health workers are trained to identify pregnancy early, perform home visits to pregnant women and newborns, and promote essential newborn care practices in case institutional birth is not desired or feasible. We make recommendations to improve Peru's cultural adaptation of birthing services."
https://openalex.org/W3157052939,"The uniquely hollow structure of microtubules (MTs) confers characteristic mechanical and biological properties. Although most regulatory processes take place at the outer surface, molecular events inside MTs, such as α-tubulin acetylation, also play a critical role. However, how regulatory proteins reach the site of action remains obscure. To assess luminal accessibility, we first identified luminally positioned residues of β-tubulin that can be fused to a protein of interest. We then developed a chemically inducible technique with which cytosolic proteins can be rapidly trapped at the lumen of intact MTs in cells. A luminal trapping assay revealed that soluble proteins of moderate size can enter the lumen via diffusion through openings at the MT ends and sides. Additionally, proteins forming a complex with tubulins can be incorporated to the lumen through the plus ends. Our approach may not only illuminate this understudied territory, but may also help understand its roles in MT-mediated functions."
https://openalex.org/W3157594646,"Organs from donors after controlled circulatory death (DCD III) exhibit a higher risk for graft dysfunction due to an initial period of warm ischemia. This procurement condition can also affect the yield of beta cells in islet isolates from donor pancreases, and hence their use for transplantation. The present study uses data collected and generated by our Beta Cell Bank to compare the number of beta cells in isolates from DCD III (n = 141) with that from donors after brain death (DBD, n = 609), before and after culture, and examines the influence of donor and procurement variables. Beta cell number per DCD III-organ was significantly lower (58 x 10 6 versus 84 x 10 6 beta cells per DBD-organ; p &lt; 0.001) but their purity (24% insulin positive cells) and insulin content (17 μg / 10 6 beta cells in DCD III-organs versus 19 μg / 10 6 beta cells in DBD-organs) were similar. Beta cell number correlated negatively with duration of acirculatory warm ischemia time above 10 min; for shorter acirculatory warm ischemia time, DCD III-organs did not exhibit a lower beta cell yield (74 x 10 6 beta cells). Use of Institut Georges Lopez-1 cold preservation solution instead of University of Wisconsin solution or histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate also protected against the loss in beta cell yield from DCD III-organs (86 x 10 6 for IGL-1 versus 54 x 10 6 and 65 x 10 6 beta cells respectively, p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis indicates that both limitation of acirculatory warm ischemia time and use of IGL-1 prevent the reduced beta cell yield in islet cell isolates from DCD III-organs."
https://openalex.org/W3159068051,"Abstract Ovarian cancer (OvCA) remains one of the most devastating malignancies, but treatment options are still limited. We report that amphiregulin (AREG) can serve as an effective and safe pharmacological target in a syngeneic murine model. AREG is highly abundant in abdominal fluids of patients with advanced OvCa. In immunocompetent animals, depletion or overexpression of AREG respectively prolonged or shortened animal survival. A new antibody we generated in AREG-knockout mice recognized murine AREG and reproducibly prolonged animal survival in the syngeneic model. The underlying mechanism likely involves binding of wildtype p53 to AREG ’s promoter and autocrine activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a step blocked by the antibody. Accordingly, depletion of p53 downregulated AREG secretion and conferred tolerance, whereas blocking an adaptive process involving CXCL1, which transactivates EGFR, might increase therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with these observations, analysis of OvCa patients revealed that high AREG correlates with poor prognosis of patients expressing wildtype TP53 . In conclusion, clinical tests of the novel antibody are warranted; high AREG, normal TP53 , and reduced CXCL1 activity might identify patients with OvCa who may derive therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3159632175,"Background Quality of care in family planning traditionally focuses on promoting awareness of the broad array of contraceptive options rather than on the quality of interpersonal communication offered by family planning (FP) providers. There is a growing emphasis on person-centered contraceptive counselling, care that is respectful and focuses on meeting the reproductive needs of a couple, rather than fertility regulation. Despite the increasing global focus on person-centered care, little is known about the quality of FP care provided in low- and middle- income countries like India. This study involves the development and psychometric testing of a Quality of Family Planning Counselling (QFPC) measure, and assessment of its associations with contraceptives selected by clients subsequently. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from N = 237 women following their FP counselling in 120 public health facilities (District Hospitals and Community Health Centers) sampled across the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. The study captured QFPC, contraceptives selected by clients post-counselling, as well as client and provider characteristics. Based on formative research and using Principal Component Analysis, we developed a 13-item measure of quality of FP counselling. We used adjusted regression models to assess the association between QFPC and contraceptive selected post-counselling. Results The QFPC measure demonstrated good internal reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.80) as well as criterion validity, as indicated by client reports of high QFPC being significantly more likely for clients with trained versus untrained counsellors. We found that each point increase in QFPC, including increasing quality of counselling, is associated with higher odds of clients selecting an intrauterine device (IUD) (aRR:1.03; 95% CI:1.01–1.05) and sterilization (aRR:1.06; 95% CI:1.03–1.08), compared to no method selected. Conclusions High-quality FP counselling is associated with clients subsequently selecting more effective contraceptives, including IUD and sterilization, in India. High-quality counselling is also more likely among FP-trained providers, highlighting the need for focused training and monitoring of quality care. Trial registration CTRI/2015/09/006219.

https://openalex.org/W3157193700,"Resolvin D1, a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator produced from docosahexaenoic acid by 15- and 5-lipoxygenase, exerts anti-inflammatory effects driving to the resolution of inflammation. The present study aimed to elucidate its role in small intestinal damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Indomethacin was administered orally to C57BL/6J male mice, which were sacrificed 24 h later to collect small intestine specimens. Before administration of indomethacin, mice were subjected to intraperitoneal treatment with resolvin D1 or oral administration of baicalein, a 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Small intestinal damage induced by indomethacin was attenuated by pretreatment with resolvin D1. Furthermore, resolvin D1 reduced the gene expression levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and CXCL1/keratinocyte chemoattractant. Conversely, the inhibition of 15-lipoxygenase activity by baicalein increased the expression of genes coding for these inflammatory cytokines and chemokine, leading to exacerbated small intestinal damage, and reduced the concentration of resolvin D1 in the small intestinal tissue. Exogenous treatment with resolvin D1 negated the deleterious effect of baicalein. 15-lipoxygenase was mainly expressed in the epithelium and inflammatory cells of the small intestine, and its gene and protein expression was not affected by the administration of indomethacin. Inhibition of the resolvin D1 receptor, lipoxin A4 receptor /formyl peptide receptor 2, by its specific inhibitors Boc-1 and WRW4 aggravated indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage. Collectively, these results indicate that resolvin D1 produced by 15-lipoxygenase contributes to mucoprotection against NSAID-induced small intestinal damage through its anti-inflammatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W3157948503,"The most common infections among renal transplant patients are urinary tract infections (UTI). Our main objective in this study is to determine the incidence of UTIs in patients who have undergone renal transplantation in our hospital, to identify the causative microbiological agents, risk factors and determine the effects of UTI on short-term graft survival.Urinary tract infections, which developed within the first year of renal transplantation, were investigated. Patients were compared regarding demographic, clinical, laboratory characteristics and graft survival.102 patients were included in our study. Fifty-three patients (53%) were male and 49 (48%) were female. Sixty-seven urinary tract infection attacks in 21 patients (20.5%) were recorded. Age (p = 0.004; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.032-1.184), longer indwelling urinary catheter stay time (p = 0.039; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.013-1.661) and urologic complications (p = 0.006; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.001-0.320) were found as risk factors for UTI development in the first year of transplantation. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. Of these bacteria, 63.2% were found to be extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) positive. Multidrug resistant microorganisms (MDROs) were more frequent in male patients (32 episodes in males vs. 14 episodes in females, p = <0.001). UTI had no negative impact on short-term graft survival.Our study results represent the high incidence of UTI with MDROs in KT recipients. Infection control methods should be applied even more vigorously especially in male transplant patients since a higher incidence of UTI caused by resistant microorganisms was reported in male patients."
https://openalex.org/W3158260604,"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the current reference standard for the quantitative assessment of ventricular function. Fast Strain-ENCoded (fSENC)-CMR imaging allows for the assessment of myocardial deformation within a single heartbeat. The aim of this pilot study was to identify obstructive coronary artery disease (oCAD) with fSENC-CMR in patients presenting with new onset of chest pain.In 108 patients presenting with acute chest pain, we performed fSENC-CMR after initial clinical assessment in the emergency department. The final clinical diagnosis, for which cardiology-trained physicians used clinical information, serial high-sensitive Troponin T (hscTnT) values and-if necessary-further diagnostic tests, served as the standard of truth. oCAD was defined as flow-limiting CAD as confirmed by coronary angiography with typical angina or hscTnT dynamics. Diagnoses were divided into three groups: 0: non-cardiac, 1: oCAD, 2: cardiac, non-oCAD. The visual analysis of fSENC bull´s eye maps (blinded to final diagnosis) resulted in a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 87%, as well as a negative predictive value of 96% for identification of oCAD. Both, global circumferential strain (GCS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) accurately identified oCAD (area under the curve/AUC: GCS 0.867; GLS 0.874; p<0.0001 for both), outperforming ECG, hscTnT dynamics and EF. Furthermore, the fSENC analysis on a segmental basis revealed that the number of segments with impaired strain was significantly associated with the patient´s final diagnosis (p<0.05 for all comparisons).In patients with acute chest pain, myocardial strain imaging with fSENC-CMR may serve as a fast and accurate diagnostic tool for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W3157888949,"Background Community-based, mobile HIV counselling and testing (HCT) and screening for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may improve early diagnosis and referral for care in underserved populations. We evaluated HCT/NCD data and described population characteristics of those visiting a mobile clinic in high HIV disease burden settings in Cape Town, South Africa, between 2008 and 2016. Methods Trained counsellors registered patients ≥12 years old at a mobile clinic, which offered HCT and blood pressure, diabetes (glucose testing) and obesity (body mass index) screening. A nurse referred patients who required HIV treatment or NCD care. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated correlates of new HIV diagnoses adjusting for gender, age and year. Results Overall, 43,938 individuals (50% male; 29% &lt;25 years; median age = 31 years) tested for HIV at the mobile clinic, where 27% of patients (66% of males, 34% of females) reported being debut HIV testers. Males not previously tested for HIV had higher rates of HIV positivity (11%) than females (7%). Over half (55%, n = 1,343) of those previously diagnosed HIV-positive had not initiated ART. More than one-quarter (26%) of patients screened positive for hypertension (males 28%, females 24%, p&lt;0.001). Females were more likely overweight (25% vs 20%) or obese (43% vs 9%) and presented with more diabetes symptoms than males (8% vs 4%). Females (3%) reported more symptoms of STIs than males (1%). Reporting symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (aOR = 3.45, 95% CI = 2.84, 4.20), diabetes symptoms (aOR = 1.61, 95% 1.35, 1.92), and TB symptoms (aOR = 4.40, 95% CI = 3.85, 5.01) were associated with higher odds of a new HIV diagnosis after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Findings demonstrate that mobile clinics providing integrated HCT and NCD screening may offer the opportunity of early diagnosis and referral for care for those who delay screening, including men living with HIV not previously tested."
https://openalex.org/W3158543894,"Recent changes in the medical paradigm highlight the importance of patient-centered communication. However, because of the lack of awareness of dental clinics and competency of medical personnel, the quality of medical services in terms of the communication between doctors and patients has not improved. This study analyzed the impact of health communication and medical service quality, service value, and patient satisfaction on the intention to revisit dental clinics. The study participants were outpatients treated at 10 dental clinics in Seoul. The research data were collected using a questionnaire during visits to these dental clinics from December 1 to December 30, 2016. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed (60 copies to each clinics) and 570 valid questionnaires were used for the analysis. The influence of the factors was determined using structural equation modeling. The factors influencing service value were reliability (β = 0.364, p < 0.001), expertise (β = 0.319, p < 0.001), communication by doctors (β = 0.224, p < 0.001), and tangibility (β = 0.136, p < 0.05). In addition, the factors influencing patient satisfaction were reliability (β = 0.258, p < 0.001), tangibility (β = 0.192, p < 0.001), communication by doctors (β = 0.163, p < 0.001), and expertise (β = 0.122, p < 0.01). Further, service value (β = 0.438, p < 0.001) raised patient satisfaction, which was found to influence the intention to revisit dental clinics (β = 0.383, p < 0.001). Providing accurate medical services to inpatients based on smooth communication between doctors and patients improves patient satisfaction. In addition, doctors can build long-term relations with patients by increasing patients' intention to revisit through patient-oriented communication."
https://openalex.org/W3159754081,"Fish form schools because of many possible reasons. However, the hydrodynamic mechanism whereby the energy efficiency of fish schools is improved still remains unclear. There are limited examples of fish models based on actual swimming movements using simulation, and the movements in existing models are simple. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the swimming behavior of Biwa salmon ( Oncorhynchus sp., a salmonid fish) using image analyses and formulated its swimming motion. Moreover, computational fluid dynamics analysis was carried out using the formulated swimming motion to determine the fluid force acting on the fish body model with real fish swimming motion. The swimming efficiency of the fish model under parallel swimming was obtained from the calculated surrounding fluid force and compared for different neighboring distances. The flow field around the fish model was also examined. The swimming efficiency of two fish models swimming parallelly was improved by approximately 10% when they were separated by a distance of 0.4L, where L is the total length of the model. In addition, the flow field behind the fish body was examined under both inphase and antiphase conditions and at inter-individual distances of 0.8L and 1.2L. The apparent flow speed in the distance range of 0.5–2.0L from the midpoint of the snouts of the two individuals was lower than the swimming speed. The pressure distribution on the fish model showed an elevated pressure at the caudal fin. Interestingly, we obtained an isopleth map similar to that of a caudal peduncle. To avoid a negative thrust, the aft part of the body must be thin, as shown in the isopleth map obtained in this study."

We investigate the role of corporate governance in improving the firms’ credit rating using a sample of Jordanian listed firms. We split firms into four categories according to WVB credit rating. We use both the binary logistic regression (LR) and the ordinal logistic regression (OLR) to model credit ratings in Jordanian environment. The empirical results show that the control variables are strong determinants of credit ratings. When we evaluate the relationship between the governance variables and credit ratings, we found interesting results. The board stockholders and board expertise are moderately significant. The board independence and role duality are weakly significant, while board size is insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W3157718206,"Increase in travel time, beyond a critical point, to emergency care may lead to a residential disparity in the outcome of patients with acute conditions. However, few studies have evaluated the evidence of travel time benchmarks in view of the association between travel time and outcome. Thus, this study aimed to establish the optimal hospital access time (OHAT) for emergency care in South Korea. We used nationwide healthcare claims data collected by the National Health Insurance System database of South Korea. Claims data of 445,548 patients who had visited emergency centers between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2014 were analyzed. Travel time, by vehicle from the residence of the patient, to the emergency center was calculated. Thirteen emergency care-sensitive conditions (ECSCs) were selected by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The 30-day mortality after discharge was set as the outcome measure of emergency care. A change-point analysis was performed to identify the threshold where the mortality of ECSCs changed significantly. The differences in risk-adjusted mortality between patients living outside of OHAT and those living inside OHAT were evaluated. Five ECSCs showed a significant threshold where the mortality changed according to their OHAT. These were intracranial injury, acute myocardial infarction, other acute ischemic heart disease, fracture of the femur, and sepsis. The calculated OHAT were 71-80 min, 31-40 min, 70-80 min, 41-50 min, and 61-70 min, respectively. Those who lived outside the OHAT had higher risks of death, even after adjustment (adjusted OR: 1.04-7.21; 95% CI: 1.03-26.34). In conclusion, the OHAT for emergency care with no significant increase in mortality is in the 31-80 min range. Optimal travel time to hospital should be established by optimal time for outcomes, and not by geographic time, to resolve the disparities in geographical accessibility to emergency care."
https://openalex.org/W3159735137,"Sucking insects require a surface of plants on which the legs and the eggs of insects will adhere and to which insect mouthparts will access. The primary plant protection against insects is their surface property, which hinders the attachment of the insect's legs and eggs. The epicuticular waxes chemistry influences the fine structure of the cuticular surface. In current study, an attempt was made to investigate the variation of chemical compounds in epicuticular waxes of four cotton species that classify them resistant or susceptible i.e., Gossypium abroreum, G. hirsutum, G. arboreum wax deficient mutant (GaWM3) and G. harknessi which were evaluated for their interaction with whitefly and CLCuV transmission. Gossypium hirsutum an insect and CLCuV susceptible cotton variety, was found to have four compounds namely Trichloroacetic acid, hexadecylester, P-xylenolpthalein, 2-cyclopentene-1-ol, 1-phenyl-and Phenol, 2,5-bis [1,1- dimethyl] which could interact with chitin of whitefly while only two compounds in Gossypium arboreum an insect and CLCuV resistant cotton variety could interact with chitin of whitefly. Similarly, GaWM3 and Gossypium harkasnessi were found to have only a single compound. Number of whiteflies found on leaves of G. hirsutum was much higher as compared to other cotton species. Keeping this fact in mind a wax biosynthetic gene CER3, from Arabidopsis thaliana was transformed into G. hirsutum and the plants were evaluated for their resistance against whitefly and CLCuV transmission. In microscopic analysis transgenic plants clearly showed higher amounts of leaf waxes as compared to non-transgenics. The least whitefly population and CLCuV titer of <10,000 units was found in transgenic plants compared to non-transgenic cotton where it was ≈4.5X106 units that confirmed the role of wax in insect interaction and ultimately to CLCuV transmission. This study provides novel insight on wax related compounds involved in cotton-whitefly interaction, which potentially can help in developing more efficient control strategies for this destructive pest."
https://openalex.org/W3159811539,"Globally, many biomes are being impacted by significant shifts in total annual rainfall as well as increasing variability of rainfall within and among years. Such changes can have potentially large impacts on plant productivity and growth, but remain largely unknown, particularly for much of the Southern Hemisphere. We investigate how growth of the widespread conifer, Callitris columellaris varied with inter-annual variation in the amount, intensity and frequency of rainfall events over the last century and between semi-arid (&lt;500 mm mean annual rainfall) and tropical (&gt;800 mm mean annual rainfall) biomes in Australia. We used linear and polynomial regression models to investigate the strength and shape of the relationships between growth (ring width) and rainfall. At semi-arid sites, growth was strongly and linearly related to rainfall amount, regardless of differences in the seasonality and intensity of rainfall. The linear shape of the relationship indicates that predicted future declines in mean rainfall will have proportional negative impacts on long-term tree growth in semi-arid biomes. In contrast, growth in the tropics showed a weak and asymmetrical (‘concave-down’) response to rainfall amount, where growth was less responsive to changes in rainfall amount at the higher end of the rainfall range (&gt;1250 mm annual rainfall) than at the lower end (&lt;1000 mm annual rainfall). The asymmetric relationship indicates that long-term growth rates of Callitris in the tropics are more sensitive to increased inter-annual variability of rainfall than to changes in the mean amount of rainfall. Our findings are consistent with observations that the responses of vegetation to changes in the mean or variability of rainfall differ between mesic and semi-arid biomes. These results highlight how contrasting growth responses of a widespread species across a hydroclimatic gradient can inform understanding of potential sensitivity of different biomes to climatic variability and change."
https://openalex.org/W3157571263,"In this work a shared pressure-controlled ventilation device for two patients is considered. By the use of different valves incorporated to the circuit, the device enables the restriction of possible cross contamination and the individualization of tidal volumes, driving pressures, and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP. Possible interactions in the expiratory dynamics of different pairs of patients are evaluated in terms of the characteristic exhalatory times. These characteristic times can not be easily established using simple linear lumped element models. For this purpose, a 1D model using the Hydraulic and Mechanical libraries in Matlab Simulink was developed. In this sense, experiments accompany this study to validate the model and characterize the different valves of the circuit. Our results show that connecting two patients in parallel to a ventilator always resulted in delays of time during the exhalation. The size of this effect depends on different parameters associated with the patients, the circuit and the ventilator. The dynamics of the exhalation of both patients is determined by the ratios between patients exhalatory resistances, compliances, driving pressures and PEEPs. Adverse effects on exhalations became less noticeable when respiratory parameters of both patients were similar, flow resistances of valves added to the circuit were negligible, and when the ventilator exhalatory valve resistance was also negligible. The asymmetries of driving pressures, compliances or resistances exacerbated the possibility of auto-PEEP and the increase in relaxation times became greater in one patient than in the other. In contrast, exhalatory dynamics were less sensitive to the ratio of PEEP imposed to the patients."
https://openalex.org/W3159655066,"Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered promising biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy of diseases. However, usefulness of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for hereditary gastrointestinal diseases have not been confirmed yet. We explored circulating miRNAs specific for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as a representative hereditary gastrointestinal disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) indicated that plasma miR-143-3p, miR-183-5p, and miR-885-5p were candidate biomarkers for five FAP patients compared to three healthy donors due to moderate copy number and significant difference. MiR-16-5p was considered as an internal control due to minimum difference in expression across FAP patients and healthy donors. Validation studies by real-time PCR showed that mean ratios of maximum expression and minimum expression were 2.2 for miR-143-3p/miR-16-5p, 3.4 for miR-143-3p/miR-103a-3p, 5.1 for miR-183-5p/miR-16-5p, and 4.9 for miR-885-5p/miR-16-5p by using the samples collected at different time points of eight FAP patients. MiR-143-3p/16-5p was further assessed using specimens from 16 FAP patients and 7 healthy donors. MiR-143-3p was upregulated in FAP patients compared to healthy donors ( P = 0.04), but not significantly influenced by clinicopathological features. However, miR-143-3p expression in colonic tumors was rare for upregulation, although there was a significant difference by existence of desmoid tumors. MiR-143-3p transfection significantly inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation compared to control microRNA transfection. Our data suggested regulation of miR-143-3p expression differed by samples (plasma or colonic tumors) in most FAP patients. Upregulation of plasma miR-143-3p expression may be helpful for diagnosis of FAP, although suppressive effect on tumorigenesis seemed insufficient in FAP patients."
https://openalex.org/W3159967084,"Background Soft tissue tension is treated as a crucial factor influencing the post-THA dislocation. The femoral offset is regarded as one of the major parameters responsible for the stabilization of the prosthesis. It is unclear which soft tissue is mostly affected by the offset changes. Methods A finite element model of the hip was created. The model comprised muscles, bones, a stem, the acetabular component and a liner. The muscles were modelled as a Hill-type musculo-tendon nonlinear springs. Nonlinear analyses of the hip flexion and internal rotation were performed for the two values of the femoral stem offset. Results We observed that the quadratus femoris and gluteus medius produce the largest resisting moment opposing the external load excreted by the surgeon during the intraoperative hip dislocation test. Conclusions An increased femoral offset increases the stretching of the quadratus femoris muscle significantly and provides the growth of its initial passive force. This muscle serves as a stiff band, providing stabilisation of the hip prosthesis, measured during the simulated intraoperative test."
https://openalex.org/W3157190970,"When two different images are presented separately to each eye, one experiences smooth transitions between them-a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Previous studies have shown that exposure to signals from other senses can enhance the access of stimulation-congruent images to conscious perception. However, despite our ability to infer perceptual consequences from bodily movements, evidence that action can have an analogous influence on visual awareness is scarce and mainly limited to hand movements. Here, we investigated whether one's direction of locomotion affects perceptual access to optic flow patterns during binocular rivalry. Participants walked forwards and backwards on a treadmill while viewing highly-realistic visualisations of self-motion in a virtual environment. We hypothesised that visualisations congruent with walking direction would predominate in visual awareness over incongruent ones, and that this effect would increase with the precision of one's active proprioception. These predictions were not confirmed: optic flow consistent with forward locomotion was prioritised in visual awareness independently of walking direction and proprioceptive abilities. Our findings suggest the limited role of kinaesthetic-proprioceptive information in disambiguating visually perceived direction of self-motion and indicate that vision might be tuned to the (expanding) optic flow patterns prevalent in everyday life."

Factors associated with TP were retrospectively investigated using multivariate logistic regression model.The incidence of right ventricular (RV) infarction was significantly higher in the TP group (19.6%) than in the non-TP group (7.5%) (p = 0.024), but the incidence of in-hospital death was similar between the 2 groups (4.3% vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000). Long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which were defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR) and readmission for heart failure, were not different between the 2 groups (p = 0.100).

In the present series of studies (total N = 1,102), we aimed to answer this question by examining whether the self (e.g., creating a stable self-image), social (e.g., connecting with others) and directive (e.g., guiding future behavior) functions of regular memories (Study 1, Study 2) and relationship memories (Study 2, Study 3) were related to intimacy and satisfaction in the current relationship. We further investigated these links when relationship memories were shared with the romantic partner (Study 3). Results showed no association between the self-reported uses of memory for regular events and relationship quality. In contrast, the social function served by the relationship events was positively associated, and the directive function was negatively associated with intimacy and relationship satisfaction. When the memories were to be shared with the partner, only social function was related, positively, to the relationship satisfaction. Findings were discussed in terms of the importance of considering the self-reported reasons for recalling an event and understanding of the contextual factors in remembering."

However, the execution time increases because of the bundle of complex computations for calculating complicated edit distances. The computational costs for finding which steps or edit distances are over k-mismatches cannot be significant in the generalized edit distance metric. Therefore, we can reduce the execution time by determining steps over k-mismatches and then skipping them. The diagonal step calculations using the pruning register skips unnecessary distance calculations over k-mismatches. The overhead of control statements and reordered memory accesses can be amortized by skipping multiple steps. Even though the proposed skipping method requires additional overhead, the proposed scheme's practical embodiments show that the execution time of string matching is reduced significantly when k is small."
https://openalex.org/W3159914626,"The system efficiency of pumping units in the middle and late stages of oil recovery is characterized by several factors, complex data and poor regulation. Further, the main control factors that affect system efficiency in different blocks vary greatly; therefore, it is necessary to obtain the block characteristics to effectively improve system efficiency. The k-means algorithm is simple and efficient, but it assumes that all factors have the same amount of influence on the output value. This cannot reflect the obvious difference in the influence of several factors in the block on the efficiency. Moreover, the algorithm is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centre point, so each calculation result that reflects the efficiency characteristics of the block system cannot be unified. To solve the aforementioned problems affecting the k-means algorithm, the correlation coefficient of all the factors was first calculated, followed by extracting the system efficiency of the positive and negative indicators of standardization. Next, the moisture value was calculated to obtain the weight of each factor used as a coefficient to calculate the Euclidean distance. Finally, the initial centre point selection of the k-means algorithm problem was solved by combining the dbscan and weighted k-means algorithm. Taking an oil production block in the Daqing Oilfield as the research object, the k-means and improved algorithm are used to analyse the main control factors influencing mechanical production efficiency. The clustering results of the two algorithms have the characteristics of overlapping blocks, but the improved algorithm’s clustering findings are as follows: this block features motor utilization, pump efficiency and daily fluid production, which are positively correlated with system efficiency. Further, low-efficiency wells are characterized by the fact that the pump diameter, power consumption, water content, daily fluid production, oil pressure and casing pressure are significantly lower than the block average; high-efficiency wells are characterized by pump depths lower than the block average. For this block, it is possible to reduce the depth of the lower pump and increase the water-injection effect to increase the output under conditions of meeting the submergence degree, which can effectively improve the system efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3157029792,"In paleopathology, morphological and molecular evidence for infection by mycobacteria of the M . tuberculosis complex (MTC) is frequently associated with early death. In the present report, we describe a multidisciplinary study of a well-preserved mummy from Napoleonic times with a long-standing tuberculous infection by M . tuberculosis senso stricto who died at the age of 88 years of focal and non-MTB related bronchopneumonia. The well-preserved natural mummy of the Royal Bavarian General, Count Heinrich LII Reuss-Köstritz (1763–1851 CE), was extensively investigated by macro- and histomorphology, whole body CT scans and organ radiography, various molecular tissue analyses, including stable isotope analysis and molecular genetic tests. We identified signs for a long-standing, but terminally inactive pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous destruction of the second lumbar vertebral body, and a large tuberculous abscess in the right (retroperitoneal) psoas region (a cold abscess). This cold abscess harboured an active tuberculous infection as evidenced by histological and molecular tests. Radiological and histological analysis further revealed extensive arteriosclerosis with (non-obliterating) coronary and significant carotid arteriosclerosis, healthy bone tissue without evidence of age-related osteopenia, evidence for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and mild osteoarthrosis of few joints. This suggests excellent living conditions correlating well with his diet indicated by stable isotope results and literary evidence. Despite the clear evidence of a tuberculous cold abscess with bacterioscopic and molecular proof for a persisting MTC infection of a human-type M . tuberculosis strain, we can exclude the chronic MTC infection as cause of death. The detection of MTC in historic individuals should therefore be interpreted with great caution and include further data, such as their nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W3157290406,"Two typical brominated flame retardants (BFRs), namely, tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), were persistent organic pollutants widely detected in various environmental media. This study aimed to successfully synthesize micro-nano-structured magnetite particles (MNMPs) with surface modification by citric acid molecules. The synthesized composites served as an adsorbent for extracting TBBPA and HBCD from environmental water samples followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The obtained MNMPs were characterized in terms of crystal structure, morphology, size distribution, hydrophobic and hydrophilic performance and magnetism. The results indicated that the MNMPs exhibited high surface area, good dispersibility, and strong magnetic responsiveness for separation. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized, including sample pH, amount of sorbents, extraction time and desorption conditions. Under the optimum conditions, the recovery was 83.5 and 107.1%, limit of detection was 0.13 and 0.35μg/mL (S/N = 3), and limit of quantification was 0.37 and 0.59 μg/mL (S/N = 10) for TBBPA and HBCD respectively. The relative standard deviations obtained using the proposed method were less than 8.7%, indicating that the MNMP magnetic solid-phase extraction method had advantages of simplicity, good sensitivity and high efficiency for the extraction of the two BFRs from environmental water."
https://openalex.org/W3157991060,"Time-to-event analysis is a common occurrence in political science. In recent years, there has been an increased usage of machine learning methods in quantitative political science research. This article advocates for the implementation of machine learning duration models to assist in a sound model selection process. We provide a brief tutorial introduction to the random survival forest (RSF) algorithm and contrast it to a popular predecessor, the Cox proportional hazards model, with emphasis on methodological utility for political science researchers. We implement both methods for simulated time-to-event data and the Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) to assist researchers in evaluating the merits of machine learning duration models. We provide evidence of significantly higher survival probabilities for peace agreements with 3rd party mediated design and implementation. We also detect increased survival probabilities for peace agreements that incorporate territorial power-sharing and avoid multiple rebel party signatories. Further, the RSF, a previously under-used method for analyzing political science time-to event data, provides a novel approach for ranking of peace agreement criteria importance in predicting peace agreement duration. Our findings demonstrate a scenario exhibiting the interpretability and performance of RSF for political science time-to-event data. These findings justify the robust interpretability and competitive performance of the random survival forest algorithm in numerous circumstances, in addition to promoting a diverse, holistic model-selection process for time-to-event political science data."
https://openalex.org/W3159918893,"Working equids play an essential role in supporting livelihoods, providing resilience and income security to people around the world, yet their welfare is often poor. Consequently, animal welfare focussed NGOs employ a range of initiatives aimed at improving standards of working equid welfare. However, there is debate surrounding the efficacy of welfare initiatives utilised and long term monitoring and evaluation of initiatives is rarely undertaken. This study compares equid welfare and the social transmission of welfare information across Mexican communities that had previously received differing intervention histories (veterinary treatment plus educational initiatives, veterinary treatment only and control communities) in order to assess their efficacy. Indicators of equid welfare were assessed using the Equid Assessment Research and Scoping tool and included body condition score, skin alterations, lameness, general health status and reaction to observer approach. Owners were interviewed about their involvement in previous welfare initiatives, beliefs regarding equid emotions and pain, and the social transmission of welfare knowledge, including whether they ask advice about their equid or discuss its health with others and whether there is a specific individual that they consider to be 'good with equids' in their community. In total 266 owners were interviewed from 25 communities across three states. Better welfare (specifically body condition and skin alteration scores) was seen in communities where a history of combined free veterinary treatment and educational initiatives had taken place compared to those that had only received veterinary treatment or control communities. The social transfer of welfare knowledge was also higher in these communities, suggesting that the discussion and transfer of equid welfare advice within communities can act as a mechanism to disseminate good welfare practices more widely. Our results suggest that using a combined approach may enhance the success of welfare initiatives, a finding that may impact future NGO programming."
