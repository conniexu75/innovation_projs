While there has been an explosion of mobile device applications (apps) promoting healthful behaviors, including physical activity and sedentary patterns, surprisingly few have been based explicitly on strategies drawn from behavioral theory and evidence.


Objective 
This study provided an initial 8-week evaluation of three different customized physical activity-sedentary behavior apps drawn from conceptually distinct motivational frames in comparison with a commercially available control app.


Study Design and Methods 
Ninety-five underactive adults ages 45 years and older with no prior smartphone experience were randomized to use an analytically framed app, a socially framed app, an affectively framed app, or a diet-tracker control app. Daily physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured using the smartphone’s built-in accelerometer and daily self-report measures.


Results 
Mixed-effects models indicated that, over the 8-week period, the social app users showed significantly greater overall increases in weekly accelerometry-derived moderate to vigorous physical activity relative to the other three arms (P values for between-arm differences = .04-.005; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.05, CI = 0.44,1.67; Social vs. Affect app: d = 0.89, CI = 0.27,1.51; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 0.89, CI = 0.27,1.51), while more variable responses were observed among users of the other two motivationally framed apps. Social app users also had significantly lower overall amounts of accelerometry-derived sedentary behavior relative to the other three arms (P values for between-arm differences = .02-.001; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.10,CI = 0.48,1.72; Social vs. Affect app: d = 0.94, CI = 0.32,1.56; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 1.24, CI = 0.59,1.89). Additionally, Social and Affect app users reported lower overall sitting time compared to the other two arms (P values for between-arm differences < .001; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.59,CI = 0.92, 2.25; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 1.89,CI = 1.17, 2.61; Affect vs. Control app: d = 1.19,CI = 0.56, 1.81; Affect vs. Analytic app: d = 1.41,CI = 0.74, 2.07).


Conclusion 
The results provide initial support for the use of a smartphone-delivered social frame in the early induction of both physical activity and sedentary behavior changes. The information obtained also sets the stage for further investigation of subgroups that might particularly benefit from different motivationally framed apps in these two key health promotion areas.

https://openalex.org/W2210678500,"Wavelet methods are widely used to decompose fMRI, EEG, or MEG signals into time series representing neurophysiological activity in fixed frequency bands. Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each essential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of network diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen has a greater impact on the estimated values of network diagnostics than the type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity of these methods in estimating values of network diagnostics drawn from graph theory. They furthermore demonstrate the importance of reporting the choices utilized in neuroimaging studies and support the utility of exploring wavelet parameters to maximize classification accuracy in the development of biomarkers of psychiatric disease and neurological disorders."

Using an adapted version of a previously constructed cigarette smoke constituent sampling device, we collected the hydrophilic fraction of e-cigarette vapour and exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to the mixture of compounds present in the vapour of 4 different single-use e-cigarettes, 6 different liquid vapours produced by the same refillable e-cigarette, and one e-cigarette with an exchangeable liquid cartridge. After incubation of cells with various concentrations and for various periods of time we analysed cell death induction, proliferation rates, the occurrence of intra-cellular reactive oxygen species, cell morphology, and we also measured e-cigarette heating coil temperatures. Overall, conventional cigarette smoke extract showed the most severe impact on endothelial cells. However, some e-cigarette vapour extracts showed high cytotoxicity, inhibition of cell proliferation, and alterations in cell morphology, which were comparable to conventional high-nicotine cigarettes. The vapours generated from different liquids using the same e-cigarette show substantial differences, pointing to the liquids as an important source for toxicity. E-cigarette vapour-mediated induction of oxidative stress was significant in one out of the 11 analysed vapours. There is a high variability in the acute cytotoxicity of e-cigarette vapours depending on the liquid and on the e-cigarettes used. Some products showed toxic effects close to a conventional high-nicotine cigarette. Liquid nicotine, menthol content, and the formation of acute intracellular reactive oxygen species do not seem to be the central elements in e-cigarette vapour toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2462200035,"More than twenty years following the end of the 1990-1991 Gulf War it is estimated that approximately 300,000 veterans of this conflict suffer from an unexplained chronic, multi-system disorder known as Gulf War Illness (GWI). The etiology of GWI may be exposure to chemical toxins, but it remains only partially defined, and its case definition is based only on symptoms. Objective criteria for the diagnosis of GWI are urgently needed for diagnosis and therapeutic research.This study was designed to determine if blood biomarkers could provide objective criteria to assist diagnosis of GWI.A surveillance study of 85 Gulf War Veteran volunteers identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Minnesota Gulf War registry was performed. All subjects were deployed to the Gulf War. Fifty seven subjects had GWI defined by CDC criteria, and 28 did not have symptomatic criteria for a diagnosis of GWI. Statistical analyses were performed on peripheral blood counts and assays of 61 plasma proteins using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare biomarker distributions and stepwise logistic regression to formulate a diagnostic model.Lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts were higher in GWI subjects. Six serum proteins associated with inflammation were significantly different in GWI subjects. A diagnostic model of three biomarkers-lymphocytes, monocytes, and C reactive protein-had a predicted probability of 90% (CI 76-90%) for diagnosing GWI when the probability of having GWI was above 70%.The results of the current study indicate that inflammation is a component of the pathobiology of GWI. Analysis of the data resulted in a model utilizing three readily measurable biomarkers that appears to significantly augment the symptom-based case definition of GWI. These new observations are highly relevant to the diagnosis of GWI, and to therapeutic trials."
https://openalex.org/W2461364696,"Gnrh is the major neuropeptide regulator of vertebrate reproduction, triggering a cascade of events in the pituitary-gonadal axis that result in reproductive competence. Previous research in mice and humans has demonstrated that Gnrh/GNRH null mutations result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility. The goal of this study was to eliminate gnrh3 (the hypophysiotropic Gnrh form) function in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to determine how ontogeny and reproductive performance are affected, as well as factors downstream of Gnrh3 along the reproductive axis. Using the TALEN technology, we developed a gnrh3-/- zebrafish line that harbors a 62 bp deletion in the gnrh3 gene. Our gnrh3-/- zebrafish line represents the first targeted and heritable mutation of a Gnrh isoform in any organism. Using immunohistochemistry, we verified that gnrh3-/- fish do not possess Gnrh3 peptide in any regions of the brain. However, other than changes in mRNA levels of pituitary gonadotropin genes (fshb, lhb, and cga) during early development, which are corrected by adulthood, there were no changes in ontogeny and reproduction in gnrh3-/- fish. The gnrh3-/- zebrafish are fertile, displaying normal gametogenesis and reproductive performance in males and females. Together with our previous results that Gnrh3 cell ablation causes infertility, these results indicate that a compensatory mechanism is being activated, which is probably primed early on upon Gnrh3 neuron differentiation and possibly confined to Gnrh3 neurons. Potential compensation factors and sensitive windows of time for compensation during development and puberty should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2473468364,"Current FDA-approved l-asparaginases also possess significant l-glutaminase activity, which correlates with many of the toxic side effects of these drugs. Therefore, l-asparaginases with reduced l-glutaminase activity are predicted to be safer. We exploited our recently described structures of the Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase (ErA) to inform the design of mutants with diminished ability to hydrolyze l-glutamine. Structural analysis of these variants provides insight into the molecular basis for the increased l-asparagine specificity. A primary role is attributed to the E63Q mutation that acts to hinder the correct positioning of l-glutamine but not l-asparagine. The substitution of Ser-254 with either an asparagine or a glutamine increases the l-asparagine specificity but only when combined with the E63Q mutation. The A31I mutation reduces the substrate Km value; this is a key property to allow the required therapeutic l-asparagine depletion. Significantly, an ultra-low l-glutaminase ErA variant maintained its cell killing ability.

Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli (EcA) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ErA) for treatment of select blood cancers. These enzyme drugs function by depleting Asn from the blood, thereby affecting certain blood cancers that are dependent on exogenous Asn. Sensitivity to l-asparaginase has been attributed to a reduced ability of those cancers to synthesize this amino acid de novo (1Horowitz B. Madras B.K. Meister A. Old L.J. Boyes E.A. Stockert E. Asparagine synthetase activity of mouse leukemias.Science. 1968; 160: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the concentration of Asn in human blood is ∼50 μm (2Ollenschläger G.

Patients treated with l-asparaginase often confront two types of adverse effects. The first is due to an immune response against the bacterial enzymes. To decrease the immunogenicity, the current standard of care in the United States employs a PEGylated version of EcA (3Narta U.K. Kanwar S.S. Azmi W.

If immunogenicity still arises, ErA is used as second line treatment (5Salzer W.L. Asselin B.L. Plourde P.V. Corn T. Hunger S.P. Development of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2014; 1329: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The second source of adverse effects of l-asparaginase treatment relates to the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze the amino acid l-glutamine (Glu). That is, in addition to catalyzing the hydrolysis of Asn (l-asparaginase activity), both EcA and ErA also catalyze the hydrolysis of Gln to l-glutamate (Glu) and ammonia (l-glutaminase activity). l-Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood with a concentration range of 400–650 μm (2Ollenschläger G.

The l-glutaminase activity of these bacterial l-asparaginases is significant, ∼2% of the EcA activity and as high as 10% for ErA (3Narta U.K. Kanwar S.S. Azmi W.

Of note, the l-glutaminase activity of the clinically used l-asparaginases has been implicated in many of the side effects of this treatment, which include immunosuppression (2Ollenschläger G.

Many of the side effects are believed to be due to the disruption of protein synthesis induced by the l-glutaminase activity of l-asparaginase drugs (2Ollenschläger G. Roth E. Linkesch W. Jansen S.

To eliminate the toxic side effects related to Gln depletion, enzymes that have retained their l-asparaginase activity but have reduced l-glutaminase activity would be beneficial. To this goal, Derst et al. (13Derst C. Henseling J. Röhm K.H. Engineering the substrate specificity of Escherichia coli asparaginase. II. Selective reduction of glutaminase activity by amino acid replacements at position 248.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) exploited crystal structures of the E. coli enzyme to design mutants with reduced l-glutaminase activity. These authors reported that the substitution of Asn-248 by alanine resulted in an enzyme with ∼300-fold reduced efficiency in the l-glutaminase reaction (13Derst C. Henseling J. Röhm K.H. Engineering the substrate specificity of Escherichia coli asparaginase. II. Selective reduction of glutaminase activity by amino acid replacements at position 248.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, this same mutant was also 22-fold less efficient in the l-asparaginase reaction, and most significantly, the parameter most important for Asn depletion, the Km value, was increased >6-fold (13Derst C. Henseling J. Röhm K.H. Engineering the substrate specificity of Escherichia coli asparaginase. II. Selective reduction of glutaminase activity by amino acid replacements at position 248.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas this variant had the desired reduction in l-glutaminase activity, a penalty was paid in its l-asparaginase activity. ErA wild-type enzyme (ErA-WT) is characterized by a high turnover rate and a relatively low Km value for both Asn and Gln. The goal of the work presented here is to identify a mutant of ErA that maintains its low Km l-asparaginase activity concomitant with reduced l-glutaminase activity. ErA was chosen over EcA for the enzyme engineering effort for two reasons: (i) ErA has a much higher intrinsic l-glutaminase activity, so it would benefit more from a reduction in this property, and (ii) ErA is a much faster l-asparaginase, which is the property important for cell killing. We recently reported the crystal structures of ErA in complex with the products of the reactions, Asp and Glu (14Nguyen H.A. Su Y. Lavie A. Structural Insight into Substrate Selectivity of Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These structures revealed the molecular basis for Asn, a superior substrate over Gln for this enzyme, allowed us to predict regions that may act to control substrate selectivity. Four candidate sites that may influence the l-glutaminase/l-asparaginase ratio were identified. Of the initial 18 single and double mutants generated at these positions, the single mutant E63Q (referred to as ErA-E63Q) and the double mutant A31I/E63Q (ErA-DM1) had the best combined properties, retaining 60–90% of the wild-type l-asparaginase efficiency alongside a remarkable 95% reduction in the l-glutaminase activity. An additional double mutant, E63Q/S254N (ErA-DM2), had a >99% reduction in its l-glutaminase activity, but this was coupled with a ∼4-fold increase in the Asn Km value. To understand the molecular reasons for the increased preference for Asn versus Gln of our mutants, we solved the crystal structures of both double mutants and of the E63Q single mutant in complex with Asp. The ErA-E63Q Asp complex structure provides a structural basis for the pivotal role played by the E63Q mutation in increasing the enzyme's Asn selectivity. The structures of ErA-DM1 and ErA-DM2 in complex with Asp showcase the importance of these additional sites for substrate discrimination. Moreover, the structural analysis suggested additional variants that combine aspects from ErA-DM1 and ErA-DM2. One of these variants, the ErA-A31I/E63Q/S254Q triple mutant (ErA-TM2), proved to possess even superior discrimination between Asn and Gln. Most importantly, we could demonstrate that the ultra-low l-glutaminase property of ErA-TM2 does not hamper its ability to kill human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in culture relative to ErA-WT. Together, the ErA mutants presented here hold potential for development as replacements for the current Food and Drug Administration-approved l-asparaginase enzymes as they are predicted to maintain their cancer killing properties due to their high l-asparaginase activity but at the same time have reduced side effects due to their much-diminished l-glutaminase activity. We seek ErA variants with reduced activity toward Gln but retained high activity toward Asn. Due to their role in catalysis, residues present in consensus motifs among the l-asparaginase/l-glutaminase superfamily (highlighted red in the multiple sequence alignment in Fig. 1, including 12TGGT15, 93HGTDT97, Ser-62, and Lys-168, were excluded from consideration for mutation. Instead, our strategy was to seek non-conserved residues that surround the active site and that do not necessarily interact with the substrate. Based on a multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1) and the analysis of the crystal structure of ErA in complex with the products Asp and Glu (14Nguyen H.A. Su Y. Lavie A. Structural Insight into Substrate Selectivity of Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we identified Ala-31, Glu-63, Pro-123, and Ser-254 as four potential candidate sites for mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Interestingly, of these four residues only Glu-63 makes a direct interaction with the substrate.FIGURE 2.Location of residues selected for mutagenesis.

All distances are in angstroms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Site 1, Ala-31, is part of the flexible N-terminal loop that closes and becomes ordered in the presence of ligand at the active site. When ordered, Ala-31 is located at the entrance of the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 2A). Although not interacting directly with the preferred substrate Asn, it is at a 4.1 Å distance to the Cα atom of the amino acid substrate. In the crystal structure of ErA in complex with the reaction product Glu (PDB ID 5HW0), which we used as a reference for the binding of the substrate Gln, we noticed that the extra methylene group present in this substrate (compared with Asn) twists in the direction of Ala-31. Therefore, to sterically repel the extra Gln methylene group we replaced the small alanine side chain with a bulkier side chain. Based on modeling studies, the side chains as present in valine, isoleucine, leucine, and methionine seemed the most appropriate. Additionally, as shown in the sequence alignment (Fig. 1), Ala-31 is replaced by a valine or serine in the case of the E. coli and H. pylori l-asparaginases, respectively. Compared with ErA, these enzymes have been reported to have negligible l-glutaminase activity (15Parmentier J.H. Maggi M. Tarasco E. Scotti C. Avramis V.I. Mittelman S.D. Glutaminase activity determines cytotoxicity of l-asparaginases on most leukemia cell lines.Leuk. Res. 2015; 39: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Cappelletti D. Chiarelli L.R. Pasquetto M.V. Stivala S. Valentini G. Scotti C. Helicobacter pylori l-asparaginase: a promising chemotherapeutic agent.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For this reason, we also investigated mutating Ala-31 into either serine or threonine (the latter isosteric with valine but retaining the hydroxyl group of serine). Site 2 for mutagenesis comprised Glu-63, a residue that directly interacts with the α-amino group of the amino acid substrate (Fig. 2B). Our structures of ErA in complex with Asp and Glu showed that to accommodate the larger Glu, the substrate shifts (by 0.6 Å) in the direction of Glu-63 relative to the binding position adopted by the smaller Asp (14Nguyen H.A. Su Y. Lavie A. Structural Insight into Substrate Selectivity of Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To make this required repositioning by Gln less favorable, we opted to replace the non-conserved residue Glu-63 with the isosteric glutamine. Both the glutamate and glutamine side chains contain an oxygen atom that can act as an H-bond acceptor to the α-amino group of either Asn or Gln. However, we predicted that the amide nitrogen atom (H-bond donor) present in the glutamine side chain (contrasted with a second oxygen atom in glutamate) may be less favorable for accommodating Gln. This choice of mutation was reinforced by the fact that the counterpart of Glu-63 in the low l-glutaminase H. pylori and E. coli l-asparaginases is indeed a glutamine. In addition to the E63Q mutant we also created the E63L mutation based on the recent study of the E. coli enzyme conducted by Chan et al. (17Chan W.K. Lorenzi P.L. Anishkin A. Purwaha P. Rogers D.M.

The third candidate site for mutagenesis was Pro-123. This site was chosen because in two l-asparaginase homologues reported to have low l-glutaminase activity (16Cappelletti D. Chiarelli L.R. Pasquetto M.V. Stivala S. Valentini G. Scotti C. Helicobacter pylori l-asparaginase: a promising chemotherapeutic agent.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Med. 1977; 155: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this residue is either a serine (in Wolinella succinogenes) or asparagine (in H. pylori; Fig. 1). Based on the location of Pro-123, we predicted that this residue may play an indirect role in increasing the preference for Asn over Gln. To test this prediction, we prepared the ErA-P123S and P123N mutants. Residue Ser-254, site 4 for modification, is located at the entrance of the substrate binding pocket and originates from an adjacent protomer (Fig. 2A). Therefore, as rationalized above for Ala-31, we postulated that replacing this serine with a residue with a larger side chain would constrict the pocket, resulting in preferential exclusion of Gln. The multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1) revealed the counterparts of this residue in the E. coli (low l-glutaminase activity) and guinea pig (no l-glutaminase activity) enzymes are asparagine and proline, respectively. We, therefore, created the mutants S254N and S254P to probe the effect of this site on Gln/Asn preference. The location of the residues at these four sites and their relationship to other conserved active site residues, as observed in the ErA Asp and Glu complex structures (ErA-WT·Asp and ErA-WT-Glu, respectively), is shown in Fig. 2B. In addition to ErA-WT, we initially expressed and purified the 18 ErA mutants listed in Table 1. We employed colorimetric enzyme-coupled assays to quantitate the l-asparaginase and l-glutaminase activities of the enzymes using 10 mm Gln and 2 mm Asn as substrates for the l-glutaminase and l-asparaginase assays, respectively. 17 of the 18 mutants had the desired reduction in l-glutaminase activity (Table 1). However, for the majority of mutants, this decrease coincides with a drastic decline in the l-asparaginase activity. Using the criteria of (i) ≥60% retained l-asparaginase activity (relative to ErA-WT) and (ii) ≤5% l-glutaminase:l-asparaginase ratio, we selected four mutants for further study (Table 1).TABLE 1l-Glutaminase (GLNase) and l-asparaginase (ASNase) activity of ErA WT and mutant enzymesEnzymeGLNase vs ErA-WTASNase vs ErA-WTGLNase/ASNase within same proteinaObserved l-glutaminase rate measured with 10 mm Gln and 5 nm enzyme; observed l-asparaginase rate measured with 2 mm Asn and 0.5 nm enzyme.ErA-WT10010014ErA-A31V728113ErA-A31S12411016ErA-A31T18289ErA-A31N3331ErA-A31M7263ErA-A31I658512ErA-A31L6124ErA-E63L0120ErA-E63QbMutants that were selected for determination of kcat and Km parameters.31905ErA-P123S2311ErA-P123N126ErA-S254N344012ErA-S254PbMutants that were selected for determination of kcat and Km parameters.01200ErA-A31T/E63Q8157ErA-A31I/E63QbMutants that were selected for determination of kcat and Km parameters.22605ErA-S254N/E63QbMutants that were selected for determination of kcat and Km parameters.0820ErA-S254N/A31T9187ErA-S254N/A31I222512a Observed l-glutaminase rate measured with 10 mm Gln and 5 nm enzyme; observed l-asparaginase rate measured with 2 mm Asn and 0.5 nm enzyme.b Mutants that were selected for determination of kcat and Km parameters. Open table in a new tab From the initial screen, the single mutant ErA-S245P appeared to have the most desired properties. The l-glutaminase activity was below the detection sensitivity at the assay conditions, whereas the l-asparaginase activity was 120% relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). Further kinetic characterization of the mutant's l-asparaginase activity confirmed the high turnover rate with Asn. However, disappointedly, it also revealed a 24-fold increase (relative to ErA-WT) in the Km value for Asn (Table 2). Because clinical use of l-asparaginase requires complete depletion of Asn from the blood, the Km of the enzyme must be in the low micromolar range to be effective. Hence, although the goal of largely eliminating the l-glutaminase activity was achieved, an unacceptable increase in the Km value of Asn for the l-asparaginase reaction eliminated the ErA-S245P mutant from the list of potential drug candidates.TABLE 2l-Asparaginase kinetic parameters for ErA wild type and select mutantsEnzymekcatkmkcat/kmkobs at 50 μmkobs at 20 μmspecific activitya1 IU of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme used to produce 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 37 °C.s−1μms−1μm−1s−1s−1IU/mgErA-WT207.5 ± 3.647.5 ± 3.54.37105.350.7353.2 ± 6.1ErA-E63Q186.8 ± 1.750.7 ± 2.03.6892.246.3317.8 ± 2.9ErA-A31I/E63Q (DM1)123.0 ± 1.836.9 ± 2.23.3369.738.8209.1 ± 3.1ErA-E63Q/S254N (DM2)169.8 ± 1.5185.3 ± 5.50.9236.318.9288.8 ± 2.6ErA-S254P250.0 ± 2.81154.2 ± 25.50.2210.54.5425.4 ± 4.8ErA-E63Q/S254Q (DM3)147.3 ± 1.0179.1 ± 5.60.8230.814.2250.4 ± 1.7ErA-A31I/E63Q/S254N (TM1)109.7 ± 0.8124.2 ± 4.30.8929.216.4186.4 ± 1.4ErA-A31I/E63Q/S254Q (TM2)261.2 ± 2.895.0 ± 3.52.7589.140.8443.5 ± 4.8EcA-WT44.4 ± 0.315.0 ± 0.52.9641.328.376.3 ± 0.5a 1 IU of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme used to produce 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab Further inspection of the properties of the mutants from the initial screen (Table 1) suggested that the next three most promising variants are the E63Q (ErA-E63Q) single mutant and the A31I/E63Q (ErA-DM1) and E63Q/S254N (ErA-DM2) double mutants. Detailed kinetic characterization of the l-asparaginase activity of the mutants revealed that the critical Km value for the substrate Asn is comparable with that of ErA-WT (Table 2). In fact, ErA-DM1 acquired an even lower Asn Km than that of ErA-WT (37 versus 48 μm). In contrast, ErA-DM2 variant exhibited a 4-fold increase in Asn Km. Together with near wild-type kcat (range 60–90% of ErA-WT), these mutants fulfill the criteria required to achieve efficient depletion of Asn from the blood. We next determined the precise kinetic parameters for the undesired l-glutaminase activity. This work established that the reduced l-glutaminase activity of these mutants is due to a reduced kcat (3–9-fold lower) and much increased Km (8–44-fold higher) compared with ErA-WT (Table 3). In terms of efficiency, as indicated by the kcat/Km parameter, the l-glutaminase efficiency of the mutants was reduced by ∼20–400-fold. Likewise, at the physiological blood concentration of 0.5 mm, the observed l-glutaminase rate was reduced by 95–99% relative to ErA-WT. This analysis demonstrates that these three mutants largely fulfill our design criteria of being severely impaired in their l-glutaminase activity but with near ErA-WT l-asparaginase activity.TABLE 3l-Glutaminase kinetic parameters for ErA wild type and select mutantsEnzymekcatKmkcat/Kmkobs at 1 mmkobs at 0.5 mmSpecific activitya1 IU of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme used to produce 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 37 °C.s−1mms−1mm−1s−1s−1IU/mgErA-WT26.84 ± 0.260.36 ± 0.0274.5619.2215.8745.68 ± 0.44ErA-E63Q8.33 ± 0.163.86 ± 0.233.682.160.7414.17 ± 0.27ErA-A31I/E63Q (DM1)6.01 ± 0.132.73 ± 0.203.332.200.8310.22 ± 0.22ErA-E63Q/S254N (DM2)2.93 ± 0.0315.80 ± 0.300.190.180.114.98 ± 0.05ErA-E63Q/S254Q (DM3)7.17 ± 0.6484.04 ± 12.150.090.190.0212.17 ± 1.19ErA-A31I/E63Q/S254N (TM1)5.60 ± 0.2028.20 ± 2.300.190.330.119.51 ± 0.34ErA-A31I/E63Q/S254Q (TM2)1.84 ± 0.1147.46 ± 6.950.04N.D.0.013.12 ± 0.02EcA-WT0.89 ± 0.011.38 ± 0.090.640.360.221.53 ± 0.02a 1 IU of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme used to produce 1 μmol of product in 1 min at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab Although structural considerations were incorporated into the design of the mutants discussed above, we still sought to verify the mechanism for the increased Asn selectivity. Toward this goal we crystallized the ErA-E63Q, ErA-DM1, and ErA-DM2 enzyme variants and soaked the crystals with either Asp or Glu (the products of the l-asparaginase and l-glutaminase reaction, respectively). High resolution diffraction data were collected on both Asp- and Glu-soaked crystals. For the Asp-soaked crystals (see Table 4 for data collection and refinement statistics), inspection of the electron density at the enzymes' active site unambiguously showed the presence of the ligand (supplemental Fig. S1). However, despite several attempts under different soak conditions (e.g. increasing soak time, increasing Glu concentration), we failed to observe electron density for the soaked Glu. Instead, the active site of the Glu-soaked crystals had an electron density for HEPES buffer, which is a component of the crystallization solution. A molecule of HEPES was previously observed bound at the active site of apo ErA-WT, which was crystallized using the same conditions (14Nguyen H.A. Su Y. Lavie A.

The population was phenotyped for FHB and associated traits in spray inoculated experiments in El Batán (Mexico), spawn inoculated experiments in Ås (Norway) and point inoculated experiments in Nanjing (China), with two field trials at each location. Genotyping was performed with the Illumina iSelect 90K SNP wheat chip, along with a few SSR and STS markers. A major QTL for FHB after spray and spawn inoculation was detected on 2DLc, explaining 15–22% of the phenotypic variation in different experiments. This QTL remained significant after correction for days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH), while another QTL for FHB detected at the Vrn-A1 locus on 5AL almost disappeared after correction for DH and PH. Minor QTL were detected on chromosomes 2AS, 2DL, 4AL, 4DS and 5DL. In point inoculated experiments, QTL on 2DS, 3AS, 4AL and 5AL were identified in single environments. The mechanism of resistance of Soru#1 to FHB was mainly of Type I for resistance to initial infection, conditioned by the major QTL on 2DLc and minor ones that often coincided with QTL for DH, PH and anther extrusion (AE). This indicates that phenological and morphological traits and flowering biology play important roles in resistance/escape of FHB. SNPs tightly linked to resistance QTL, particularly 2DLc, could be utilized in breeding programs to facilitate the transfer and selection of those QTL."
https://openalex.org/W2462174714,"Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is essential for the clearance of endocytosed cholesteryl ester and triglyceride-rich chylomicron remnants. Humans and mice with defective or absent LAL activity accumulate large amounts of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in multiple tissues. Although chylomicrons also contain retinyl esters (REs), a role of LAL in the clearance of endocytosed REs has not been reported. In this study, we found that murine LAL exhibits RE hydrolase activity. Pharmacological inhibition of LAL in the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2, incubated with chylomicrons, led to increased accumulation of REs in endosomal/lysosomal fractions. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of LAL in murine liver largely reduced in vitro acid RE hydrolase activity. Interestingly, LAL-deficient mice exhibited increased RE content in the duodenum and jejunum but decreased RE content in the liver. Furthermore, LAL-deficient mice challenged with RE gavage exhibited largely reduced post-prandial circulating RE content, indicating that LAL is required for efficient nutritional vitamin A availability. In summary, our results indicate that LAL is the major acid RE hydrolase and required for functional retinoid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2469826780,"This study investigated the effects of matrix on the behaviors of 3D-cultured cells of two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU145. Two biologically-derived matrices, Matrigel and Cultrex BME, and one synthetic matrix, the Alvetex scaffold, were used to culture the cells. The cell proliferation rate, cellular response to anti-cancer drugs, and expression levels of proteins associated with drug sensitivity/resistance were examined and compared amongst the 3D-cultured cells on the three matrices and 2D-cultured cells. The cellular responses upon treatment with two common anti-cancer drugs, Docetaxel and Rapamycin, were examined. The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and β-III tubulin in DU145 cells and p53 in LNCaP cells were examined. The results showed that the proliferation rates of cells cultured on the three matrices varied, especially between the synthetic matrix and the biologically-derived matrices. The drug responses and the expressions of drug sensitivity-associated proteins differed between cells on various matrices as well. Among the 3D cultures on the three matrices, increased expression of β-III tubulin in DU145 cells was correlated with increased resistance to Docetaxel, and decreased expression of EGFR in DU145 cells was correlated with increased sensitivity to Rapamycin. Increased expression of a p53 dimer in 3D-cultured LNCaP cells was correlated with increased resistance to Docetaxel. Collectively, the results showed that the matrix of 3D cell culture models strongly influences cellular behaviors, which highlights the imperative need to achieve standardization of 3D cell culture technology in order to be used in drug screening and cell biology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2469676492,"The adoption rate of winter cover crops (WCCs) as an effective conservation management practice to help reduce agricultural nutrient loads in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) is increasing. However, the WCC potential for water quality improvement has not been fully realized at the watershed scale. This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term impact of WCCs on hydrology and NO3-N loads in two adjacent watersheds and to identify key management factors that affect the effectiveness of WCCs using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and statistical methods. Simulation results indicated that WCCs are effective for reducing NO3-N loads and their performance varied based on planting date, species, soil characteristics, and crop rotations. Early-planted WCCs outperformed late-planted WCCs on the reduction of NO3-N loads and early-planted rye (RE) reduced NO3-N loads by ~49.3% compared to the baseline (no WCC). The WCCs were more effective in a watershed dominated by well-drained soils with increased reductions in NO3-N fluxes of ~2.5 kg N·ha-1 delivered to streams and ~10.1 kg N·ha-1 leached into groundwater compared to poorly-drained soils. Well-drained agricultural lands had higher transport of NO3-N in the soil profile and groundwater due to increased N leaching. Poorly-drained agricultural lands had lower NO3-N due to extensive drainage ditches and anaerobic soil conditions promoting denitrification. The performance of WCCs varied by crop rotations (i.e., continuous corn and corn-soybean), with increased N uptake following soybean crops due to the increased soil mineral N availability by mineralization of soybean residue compared to corn residue. The WCCs can reduce N leaching where baseline NO3-N loads are high in well-drained soils and/or when residual and mineralized N availability is high due to the cropping practices. The findings suggested that WCC implementation plans should be established in watersheds according to local edaphic and agronomic characteristics for reducing N leaching."

Together with another structure-selective endonuclease, SLX4-SLX1, MUS81-EME1 defines one of two major Holliday junction resolution pathways in human cells (51Wyatt H.D. Sarbajna S. Matos J.

SLX4 provides a scaffold for multiple factors, and its C terminus binds the catalytic SLX1 to form an SLX4-SLX1 complex. SLX4-SLX1 further associates with MUS81-EME1, forming a stable holoenzyme termed SLX4com (51Wyatt H.D. Sarbajna S. Matos J. West S.C.

The role of MUS81-EME1 in Holliday junction resolution and DNA interstrand cross-link repair requires its interaction with SLX4 in human cells (51Wyatt H.D. Sarbajna S. Matos J. West S.C.

Identification and characterization of MUS81 point mutations that abolish interaction with the SLX4 scaffold protein.DNA Repair. 2014; 24: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, human SLX4com, comprising SLX4, SLX1, MUS81, and EME1, was reported to be a target of HIV-1 Vpr (54Laguette N. Brégnard C. Hue P. Basbous J. Yatim A. Larroque M. Kirchhoff F. Constantinou A. Sobhian B. Benkirane M. Premature activation of the SLX4 complex by Vpr promotes G2/M arrest and escape from innate immune sensing.Cell. 2014; 156: 134-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In particular, Vpr was shown to directly bind SLX4 and was postulated to untimely activate the SLX4com via the CRL4-DCAF1 complex. These interactions were proposed to lead to aberrant DNA cleavage and cell cycle arrest (54Laguette N. Brégnard C. Hue P. Basbous J. Yatim A. Larroque M. Kirchhoff F. Constantinou A. Sobhian B.

Premature activation of the SLX4 complex by Vpr promotes G2/M arrest and escape from innate immune sensing.Cell. 2014; 156: 134-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, MUS81 was reported to be down-regulated by Vpr, which was further confirmed by another two groups (55Berger G. Lawrence M. Hué S. Neil S.J. G2/M cell cycle arrest correlates with primate lentiviral Vpr interaction with the SLX4 complex.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 56DePaula-Silva A.B. Cassiday P.A. Chumley J. Bosque A. Monteiro-Filho C.M. Mahon C.S. Cone K.R. Krogan N. Elde N.C. Planelles V. Determinants for degradation of SAMHD1, Mus81 and induction of G2 arrest in HIV-1 Vpr and SIVagm Vpr.Virology. 2015; 477: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms of MUS81 down-regulation and its relation to Vpr-induced G2 arrest are not clear. In the work described here, we report Vpr-mediated down-regulation of both MUS81 and its partners EME1 and EME2. Vpr executes this task by hijacking host CUL4-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and targeting MUS81-EME1 and MUS81-EME2 for degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner, which could be inhibited by MG132. Multiple Vpr proteins, from either HIV-1 or SIV isolated from chimpanzee, down-regulate MUS81 and EME1, suggesting that it is a conserved function of Vpr. Strikingly, we further show that MUS81-EME1 down-regulation does not require SLX4-SLX1. We also find that Vpr mutants defective for G2 arrest are still capable of down-regulating MUS81-EME1, suggesting that G2 arrest is not correlated with MUS81-EME1 down-regulation. To confirm previous reports of Vpr-induced down-regulation of MUS81, we co-transfected MUS81 and HIV-1 NL4-3 Vpr plasmids into HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of MUS81 was dramatically decreased in a Vpr dose-dependent manner. Because MUS81 forms a complex with its cofactor EME1 (or EME2), we wondered whether EME1 influences the stability of MUS81. We therefore co-transfected EME1 with MUS81 (Fig. 1B). The level of MUS81 increased in accordance with the amount of EME1-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). When Vpr was present, the level of MUS81 also increased with EME1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8); however, the level of MUS81 was always lower in the presence of Vpr. These results suggest that MUS81 is down-regulated by Vpr irrespective of its quaternary state. We also interrogated whether endogenous MUS81 could be down-regulated by Vpr. When Vpr alone was transfected into HEK293T cells, endogenous MUS81 indeed decreased with increasing amounts of Vpr (Fig. 1C). Because Vpr and Vpx are closely related and have evolved from a common ancestor, we investigated whether Vpx could also down-regulate MUS81 (Fig. 1D). The level of MUS81 was not affected by co-transfection of Vpx (VpxSIVmac) from SIV that infects the macaque monkey. The level of human SAMHD1, a known target of VpxSIVmac, however, was significantly lower with increasing amounts of VpxSIVmac. Together, these results suggest that MUS81 is down-regulated by VprHIV-1 NL4-3 but not by VpxSIVmac. To further investigate Vpr-dependent down-regulation of MUS81, chase assays were carried out with an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis, cycloheximide. In the presence of cycloheximide, the intensity of the band corresponding to MUS81 decreased significantly over an 8-h period (Fig. 1E). Importantly, the same band disappeared more rapidly in the presence of Vpr. Vpr also decreased after cycloheximide treatment. Together, these results suggest that Vpr enhances down-regulation of MUS81. MUS81 associates with EME1 or EME2 and functions as a DNA structure-selective endonuclease in mammalian cells. Therefore, we asked whether EME1 and EME2 are also down-regulated in a Vpr-dependent manner, along with MUS81. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with MUS81, EME1 (or EME2), and VprHIV-1 NL4-3-expressing plasmids, and protein levels were interrogated 48 h after transfection. In agreement with previous results, MUS81 decreased in a Vpr dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both EME1 and EME2 were down-regulated by VprHIV-1 NL4-3. Endogenous MUS81, EME1, and EME2 were also down-regulated by the Vpr (Fig. 2C). Because EME1 and EME2 behaved similarly in response to VprHIV-1 NL4-3 co-expression, the remainder of our studies focused on MUS81-EME1. To explore whether Vpr proteins from other strains also function in both MUS81 and EME1 down-regulation, we examined the cellular levels of MUS81 and EME1 after co-transfection with Vpr from viruses isolated from diverse species, including chimpanzee SIV PTT and PTS (Fig. 2D), and HIV-1 group M, N, and O (Fig. 2E). Vpr from all these strains efficiently down-regulated both MUS81 and EME1. Sequence analysis of these Vpr proteins suggests a conserved N-terminal and central region (Fig. 2F). The C-terminal region of these Vpr proteins, however, is variable. This may imply that the C-terminal part is not important for MUS81-EME1 down-regulation. To determine whether MUS81-EME1 down-regulation is mediated via a ubiquitin/proteasome-related pathway, we treated MUS81-EME1/Vpr co-transfected cell cultures with MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome. We used VprHIV-1 NL4-3 for this experiment and the remainder of our studies. MG132 effectively restored MUS81 and EME1 levels (Fig. 3A). This suggests Vpr-dependent down-regulation of MUS81-EME1 requires the proteasome. The level of Vpr increased with MG132 treatment. This is consistent with the previous observation that Vpr is also degraded by the proteasome (28Le Rouzic E. Morel M. Ayinde D. Belaïdouni N. Letienne J. Transy C. Margottin-Goguet F. Assembly with the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ubiquitin ligase protects HIV-1 Vpr from proteasomal degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of the proteasome-dependent pathway, we co-expressed ubiquitin with MUS81, EME1, and Vpr. As shown in Fig. 3B, ubiquitin expression resulted in a strong poly-ubiquitination signal in whole cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3C), to pull down FLAG-tagged MUS81, revealed stronger poly-ubiquitination signals (lane 2) in the presence of Vpr. Taken together, these results suggest that Vpr induces down-regulation of MUS81-EME1 via ubiquitination and a proteasome-dependent pathway. Vpr usurps the CRL4-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase to down-regulate its host cellular targets via the ubiquitination"

We used next-generation sequencing to identify chloroplast genome regions that differentiate the origin of white oaks from the three continents; Asia, Europe, and North America. By using the chloroplast genome of Asian Q. mongolica as a reference, we identified 861 variant sites (672 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); 189 insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism) from representative species of three continents (Q. mongolica from Asia; Q. petraea and Q. robur from Europe; Q. alba from North America), and we identified additional chloroplast polymorphisms in pools of 20 individuals each from Q. mongolica (789 variant sites) and Q. robur (346 variant sites). Genome sequences were screened for indels to develop markers that identify continental origin of oak species, and that can be easily evaluated using a variety of detection methods. We identified five indels and one SNP that reliably identify continent-of-origin, based on evaluations of up to 1078 individuals representing 13 white oak species and three continents. Due to the size of length polymorphisms revealed, this marker set can be visualized using capillary electrophoresis or high resolution gel (acrylamide or agarose) electrophoresis. With these markers, we provide the wood trading market with an instrument to comply with the U.S. and European laws that require timber companies to avoid the trade of illegally harvested timber."
https://openalex.org/W2464611179,"Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who receive renal replacement therapy (RRT) have very high mortality rate. During RRT, there are markedly loss of macro- and micronutrients which may cause malnutrition and result in impaired renal recovery and patient survival. We aimed to examine the predictive role of macro- and micronutrients on survival and renal outcomes in critically ill patients undergoing continuous RRT (CRRT). This prospective observational study enrolled critically ill patients requiring CRRT at Intensive Care Unit of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from November 2012 until November 2013. The serum, urine, and effluent fluid were serially collected on the first three days to calculate protein metabolism including dietary protein intake (DPI), nitrogen balance, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). Serum zinc, selenium, and copper were measured for micronutrients analysis on the first three days of CRRT. Survivor was defined as being alive on day 28 after initiation of CRRT.Dialysis status on day 28 was also determined. Of the 70 critically ill patients requiring CRRT, 27 patients (37.5%) survived on day 28. The DPI and serum albumin of survivors were significantly higher than non-survivors (0.8± 0.2 vs 0.5 ±0.3g/kg/day, p = 0.001, and 3.2±0.5 vs 2.9±0.5 g/dL, p = 0.03, respectively) while other markers were comparable. The DPI alone predicted patient survival with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69. A combined clinical model predicted survival with AUC of 0.78. When adjusted for differences in albumin level, clinical severity score (APACHEII and SOFA score), and serum creatinine at initiation of CRRT, DPI still independently predicted survival (odds ratio 4.62, p = 0.009). The serum levels of micronutrients in both groups were comparable and unaltered following CRRT. Regarding renal outcome, patients in the dialysis independent group had higher serum albumin levels than the dialysis dependent group, p = 0.01. In conclusion, in critically ill patients requiring CRRT, DPI is a good predictor of patient survival while serum albumin is a good prognosticator of renal outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2467297508,"In the present study we examined the brain of fetal, newborn, and adult pigs raised for meat production. The fresh and formalin-fixed weights of the brain have been recorded and used, together with body weight, to calculate the Encephalization Quotient (EQ). The weight of the cerebellum has been used to calculate the Cerebellar Quotient (CQ). The results have been discussed together with analogue data obtained in other terrestrial Cetartiodactyla (including the domestic bovine, sheep, goat, and camel), domesticated Carnivora, Proboscidata, and Primates. Our study, based on a relatively large experimental series, corrects former observations present in the literature based on smaller samples, and emphasizes that the domestic pig has a small brain relative to its body size (EQ = 0.38 for adults), possibly due to factors linked to the necessity of meat production and improved body weight. Comparison with other terrestrial Cetartiodactyla indicates a similar trend for all domesticated species."
https://openalex.org/W2465915302,"Background West Nile virus emerged as an important human pathogen in North America and continues to pose a risk to public health. It can cause a highly variable range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness. Neuroinvasive disease due to West Nile virus can lead to long-term neurological deficits and psychological impairment. However, these deficits have not been well described. The objective of this study was to characterize the neuropsychological manifestations of West Nile virus infection with a focus on neuroinvasive status and time since infection. Methods Patients from Ontario Canada with a diagnosis of neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) and non-neuroinvasive disease who had participated in a cohort study were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory were collected, as well as demographics and medical history. Cognitive functioning was assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Results Data from 49 individuals (32 with West Nile fever and 17 with West Nile neuroinvasive disease) were included in the present cross-sectional analysis. Patterns of neuropsychological impairment were comparable across participants with both neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive West Nile virus infection on all cognitive measures. Neuropsychiatric impairment was also observed more frequently at two to four years post-infection compared to earlier stages of illness. Conclusions Our data provide objective evidence for cognitive difficulties among patients who were infected with West Nile virus; these deficits appear to manifest regardless of severity of West Nile virus infection (West Nile fever vs. West Nile neuroinvasive disease), and are more prevalent with increasing illness duration (2–4 years vs. 1 month). Data from this study will help inform patients and healthcare providers about the expected course of recovery, as well as the need to implement effective treatment strategies that include neuropsychological interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2466211579,"Background In most epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOC), epigenetic changes are evident, and overexpression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) represents an important manifestation. In this study, we wanted to evaluate the effects of the novel HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat, both alone and in combination with carboplatin, on ovarian cancer cell lines and in a murine bioluminescent orthotopic surgical xenograft model for EOC. Methods The effects of panobinostat, both alone and in combination with carboplatin, on proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines, were evaluated using colony and WST-1 assays, Hoechst staining and flow cytometry analysis. In addition, mechanisms were characterised by western blotting and phosphoflow analysis. Immuno-deficient mice were engrafted orthotopically with SKOV-3luc+ cells and serial bioluminescence imaging monitored the effects of treatment with panobinostat and/or carboplatin and/or surgery. Survival parameters were also measured. Results Panobinostat treatment reduced cell growth and diminished cell viability, as shown by the induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. We observed increased levels of cleaved PARP and caspase-3, downregulation of cdc2 protein kinase, acetylation of H2B and higher pH2AX expression. The combined administration of carboplatin and panobinostat synergistically increased the anti-tumour effects compared to panobinostat or carboplatin treatment alone. In our novel ovarian cancer model, the mice showed significantly higher rates of survival when treated with panobinostat, carboplatin or a combination of both, compared to the controls. Panobinostat was as efficient as carboplatin regarding prolongation of survival. No significant additional effect on survival was observed when surgery was combined with carboplatin/panobinostat treatment. Conclusions Panobinostat demonstrates effective in vitro growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells. The efficacy of panobinostat and carboplatin was equal in the orthotopic EOC model used. We conclude that panobinostat is a promising therapeutic alternative that needs to be further assessed for the treatment of EOC."
https://openalex.org/W2467386786,"Soft tissue fibrosis at the joint induced by inflammation is the pathological basis of frozen shoulder. In the present study, we utilized a lentiviral approach to silence the Smad4 gene in an in vitro fibrosis model of fibroblasts and an in vivo frozen shoulder model. We observed the change in the fibrosis process and the biological indicators of frozen shoulder. The in vitro fibrosis models (Rat myoblasts L6, Rat synovial cell RSC-364 and Rat chondrocytes RCs) were established using TGF-β1 induction, and the effect of Smad4 gene silencing on fibrosis was analyzed. The method of Kanno A was employed to establish a rat model of frozen shoulder, and Smad4 in the relevant part was knocked down with the lentiviral approach. We then examined the abduction and rotation angles and the length of synovial intima and measured the inflammatory factors in effusion and the fibrotic markers of tissues. We found that Smad4 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and expression of fibrotic markers in L6, RSC-364 and RCs cells induced by TGF-β1. MMP activity measurements showed that Smad4 knockdown significantly reversed the decrease in MMP activity in these three cell lines that were induced by TGF-β1. Furthermore, using lentivirus in the rat frozen shoulder model, we found that Smad4 silencing attenuated the inflammatory response and fibrosis. It significantly inhibited the increase of the Vimentin, α-SMA, collagen I and III, Lama1 and Timp1 proteins in synovial tissue as well as the inflammatory factors of TNF-a, IL-1α/β, IL-6 and IL-10 in effusion. MMP acidity assays revealed that Smad4 silencing inhibited MMP activity in the synovial, cartilage and ligament tissues in the model animals. The assessment of the phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the nuclei isolated from the synovial tissues showed that Smad4 silencing significantly inhibited the phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 proteins. Moreover, Smad4-shRNA lentivirus inhibited the decrease in both the abduction and rotation angles caused by immobilization as well as the decrease in the length of the synovial intima. Based on shoulder movement data, Smad4 knockdown can increase the rotation limitation caused by immobilization. In summary, Smad4 silencing can suppress chronic inflammation and fibrosis in joint tissues by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad pathway and can play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of joint stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W2475185756,"We report the differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells solely induced by direct current (DC) pulses stimulation. Neural stem and progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain are promising candidates for the development of therapeutic neuroregeneration strategies. The differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells depends on various in vivo environmental factors, such as nerve growth factor and endogenous EF. In this study, we demonstrated that the morphologic and phenotypic changes of mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (mNPCs) could be induced solely by exposure to square-wave DC pulses (magnitude 300 mV/mm at frequency of 100-Hz). The DC pulse stimulation was conducted for 48 h, and the morphologic changes of mNPCs were monitored continuously. The length of primary processes and the amount of branching significantly increased after stimulation by DC pulses for 48 h. After DC pulse treatment, the mNPCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes simultaneously in stem cell maintenance medium. Our results suggest that simple DC pulse treatment could control the fate of NPCs. With further studies, DC pulses may be applied to manipulate NPC differentiation and may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies that employ NPCs to treat nervous system disorders."

Here we search for the factors that can potentially trigger gender differences in tuning to faces. By using a set of Face-n-Food images slightly bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we examine: (i) whether face resemblance is linked to gender specific face impression, and, if so, whether this association is perceiver gender specific; and (ii) whether images most resembling a face are also most likable for female and male perceivers. First, in a spontaneous recognition task, participants were shown a set of Face-n-Food images in a predetermined order from the least to most resembling a face. Then in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task, participants judged whether each face appeared for them (i) either female or male (Exp. 1); or (ii) either likable or unlikable (Exp. 2). Remarkably, face resemblance is closely connected to gender specific impressions: images more resembling a face elicit also more female-face responses. This link is not perceiver gender specific as it occurs for both females and males. Moreover, face resemblance is positively linked to face likability, but this holds true only for female perceivers. The findings shed light on gender specificity in tuning to faces, and help to clarify abnormalities of the social brain in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders."

Fruit diameter, weight, yield, and centesimal composition, ascorbic acid, reductive sugars, total soluble solids, pH and fiber content were determined. Total phenolics (1293 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g) and total anthocyanins (1045 mg/100 g) contents were higher in the peel, with the major anthocyanin identified using HPLC-DAD-MS/MS as cyanidin 3-glucoside. Higher values for DPPH antiradical scavenging activity (47.52 μMol trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity/g) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP, 0.19 mM ferreous sulfate/g) were also observed in the peel fraction. All extracts tested showed the ability to inhibit oxidation in the β-carotene/linoleic acid system. This study highlights the potential of Malay apple fruit as a good source of antioxidant compounds with potential benefits to human health."
https://openalex.org/W2461819187,"Clostridium difficile is responsible for a wide spectrum of infection from asymptomatic carriage to severe, relapsing colitis. Since 2003, C. difficile infections have increased with a higher morbidity and mortality due to the emergence of epidemic and hypervirulent C. difficile strains such as those of the epidemic lineage 027/BI/NAP1. To decipher the hypervirulence and epidemicity of 027 strains, we analyzed gene expression profiles of the R20291 027 strain using a monoxenic mouse model during the first 38h of infection. A total of 741 genes were differentially expressed during the course of infection. They are mainly distributed in functional categories involved in host adaptation. Several genes of PTS and ABC transporters were significantly regulated during the infection, underlying the ability of strain R20291 to adapt its metabolism according to nutrient availability in the digestive tract. In this animal model, despite the early sporulation process, sporulation efficiency seems to indicate that growth of R20291 vegetative cells versus spores were favored during infection. The bacterial mechanisms associated to adaptability and flexibility within the gut environment, in addition to the virulence factor expression and antibiotic resistance, should contribute to the epidemicity and hypervirulence of the C. difficile 027 strains."
https://openalex.org/W2461966460,"An effective transformation protocol for Dunaliella, a β-carotene producer, was developed using the synergistic mechanism of D-glucose and Acetosyringone on three different Agrobacterium strains (EHA105, GV3101 and LBA4404). In the present study, we investigated the pre-induction of Agrobacterium strains harboring pMDC45 binary vector in TAP media at varying concentrations of D-glucose (5 mM, 10 mM, and 15mM) and 100 μM of Acetosyringone for co-cultivation. Induction of Agrobacterium strains with 10 mM D-glucose and 100 μM Acetosyringone showed higher rates of efficiency compared to other treatments. The presence of GFP and HPT transgenes as a measure of transformation efficiency from the transgenic lines were determined using fluorescent microscopy, PCR, and southern blot analyzes. Highest transformation rate was obtained with the Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 (181 ± 3.78 cfu per 106 cells) followed by GV3101 (128 ± 5.29 cfu per 106 cells) and EHA105 (61 ± 5.03 cfu per 106 cells). However, the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 exhibited more efficient single copy transgene (HPT) transfer into the genome of D. salina than LBA4404. Therefore, future studies dealing with genetic modifications in D. salina can utilize GV3101 as an optimal Agrobacterium strain for gene transfer."

In T4P-based systems, the CheA kinase often contains numerous potential sites of phosphorylation, but the signaling mechanisms of these systems are unknown. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Pil-Chp system regulates T4P-mediated twitching motility and cAMP levels, both of which play roles in pathogenesis. The Pil-Chp histidine kinase (ChpA) has eight “Xpt” domains; six are canonical histidine-containing phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains and two have a threonine (Tpt) or serine (Spt) in place of the histidine. Additionally, there are two stand-alone receiver domains (PilG and PilH) and a ChpA C-terminal receiver domain (ChpArec). Here, we demonstrate that the ChpA Xpts are functionally divided into three categories as follows: (i) those phosphorylated with ATP (Hpt4–6); (ii) those reversibly phosphorylated by ChpArec (Hpt2–6), and (iii) those with no detectable phosphorylation (Hpt1, Spt, and Tpt). There was rapid phosphotransfer from Hpt2–6 to ChpArec and from Hpt3 to PilH, whereas transfer to PilG was slower. ChpArec also had a rapid rate of autodephosphorylation. The biochemical results together with in vivo cAMP and twitching phenotypes of key ChpA phosphorylation site point mutants supported a scheme whereby ChpArec functions both as a phosphate sink and a phosphotransfer element linking Hpt4–6 to Hpt2–3. Hpt2 and Hpt3 are likely the dominant sources of phosphoryl groups for PilG and PilH, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2462972790,"The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay is a basic hemostatic assay based on the time it takes for clots to form in plasma samples after the addition of calcium chloride. It is used to screen for various coagulation disorders. Several previous reports have suggested that magnesium (Mg) might contribute to coagulation reactions by binding to specific coagulation proteins. We investigated the effects of Mg on the APTT. In healthy controls, the APTT was significantly prolonged in proportion to the increase in the concentration of magnesium chloride in the range from 2.1 to 16.7 mmol/L. Among eight samples from patients with various disorders that exhibited prolonged APTT, two samples demonstrated shorter APTT when Mg was added, both of which were from patients that were positive for lupus anticoagulant. When we examined 206 clinical APTT samples, we found that Mg shortened the APTT of two samples. These two samples were also from lupus anticoagulant-positive patients (p-value: <0.003). Our findings regarding the unique effects of exogenous Mg on the APTT of lupus anticoagulant-positive patients might shed light on the role of Mg in APTT assays and lead to the development of a novel screening method for lupus anticoagulant."
https://openalex.org/W2465003012,"This study investigates three domains of public stigma (perceived negative reactions, perceived discrimination, and dangerousness) against older adults with depression. The sample comprised of older adults registered with primary care clinics (n = 1,291) and primary health care professionals (n = 469) from São Paulo and Manaus, Brazil. Participants read a vignette describing a 70-year-old individual (Mary or John) with a depressive disorder and answered questions measuring stigma. The prevalence of the three stigma domains was between 30.2 and 37.6% among older participants from São Paulo and between 27.6 and 35.4% among older participants from Manaus. Older adults from both cities reported similar prevalence of perceived stigma. Key factors associated with stigmatizing beliefs among older participants were reporting depressive symptoms, having physical limitations, and identifying the case of the vignette as a case of mental disorder. Among health professionals, the prevalence of the three stigma domains was between 19.8 and 34.8% in São Paulo and 30.2 and 44.6% in Manaus. The key factor associated with stigma among primary health care professionals was city, with consistently higher risk in Manaus than in São Paulo. Findings confirm that public stigma against older adults in Brazil is common. It is important to educate the public and primary health care providers in Brazil on stigma related to mental illness in order to reduce barriers to adequate mental health treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2466333630,"The adult honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) mushroom bodies (MBs, a higher center in the insect brain) comprise four subtypes of intrinsic neurons: the class-I large-, middle-, and small-type Kenyon cells (lKCs, mKCs, and sKCs, respectively), and class-II KCs. Analysis of the differentiation of KC subtypes during metamorphosis is important for the better understanding of the roles of KC subtypes related to the honeybee behaviors. In the present study, aiming at identifying marker genes for KC subtypes, we used a cDNA microarray to comprehensively search for genes expressed in an MB-preferential manner in the honeybee brain. Among the 18 genes identified, we further analyzed three genes whose expression was enriched in the MBs: phospholipase C epsilon (PLCe), synaptotagmin 14 (Syt14), and discs large homolog 5 (dlg5). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that expression of PLCe, Syt14, and dlg5 was more enriched in the MBs than in the other brain regions by approximately 31-, 6.8-, and 5.6-fold, respectively. In situ hybridization revealed that expression of both Syt14 and dlg5 was enriched in the lKCs but not in the mKCs and sKCs, whereas expression of PLCe was similar in all KC subtypes (the entire MBs) in the honeybee brain, suggesting that Syt14 and dlg5, and PLCe are available as marker genes for the lKCs, and all KC subtypes, respectively. In situ hybridization revealed that expression of PLCe is already detectable in the class-II KCs at the larval fifth instar feeding stage, indicating that PLCe expression is a characteristic common to the larval and adult MBs. In contrast, expression of both Syt14 and dlg5 became detectable at the day three pupa, indicating that Syt14 and dlg5 expressions are characteristic to the late pupal and adult MBs and the lKC specific molecular characteristics are established during the late pupal stages."
https://openalex.org/W2465931384,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with cardiovascular complications induced by atherosclerosis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is often raised in states of inflammation, including diabetes, and regulates inflammatory processes. In myeloid cells, a key cell type in atherosclerosis, PGE2 acts predominately through its Prostaglandin E Receptor 4 (EP4; Ptger4) to modulate inflammation. The effect of PGE2-mediated EP4 signaling specifically in myeloid cells on atherosclerosis in the presence and absence of diabetes is unknown. Because diabetes promotes atherosclerosis through increased arterial myeloid cell accumulation, we generated a myeloid cell-targeted EP4-deficient mouse model (EP4M-/-) of T1DM-accelerated atherogenesis to investigate the relationship between myeloid cell EP4, inflammatory phenotypes of myeloid cells, and atherogenesis. Diabetic mice exhibited elevated plasma PGE metabolite levels and elevated Ptger4 mRNA in macrophages, as compared with non-diabetic littermates. PGE2 increased Il6, Il1b, Il23 and Ccr7 mRNA while reducing Tnfa mRNA through EP4 in isolated myeloid cells. Consistently, the stimulatory effect of diabetes on peritoneal macrophage Il6 was mediated by PGE2-EP4, while PGE2-EP4 suppressed the effect of diabetes on Tnfa in these cells. In addition, diabetes exerted effects independent of myeloid cell EP4, including a reduction in macrophage Ccr7 levels and increased early atherogenesis characterized by relative lesional macrophage accumulation. These studies suggest that this mouse model of T1DM is associated with increased myeloid cell PGE2-EP4 signaling, which is required for the stimulatory effect of diabetes on IL-6, markedly blunts the effect of diabetes on TNF-α and does not modulate diabetes-accelerated atherogenesis."

The aim of this study was to estimate the hospitalization risk associated with this variant in Influenza Like Illness (ILI) patients during the H1N1 pandemic influenza.A case-control genetic association study was performed, using nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs collected during the H1N1 pandemic influenza. Laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection was performed by RT-PCR, the IFITM3 rs12252 was genotyped by RFLP and tested for association with hospitalization. Conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate the confounder-adjusted odds ratio of hospitalization associated with IFITM3 rs12252.We selected 312 ILI cases and 624 matched non-hospitalized controls. Within ILI Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive patients, no statistical significant association was found between the variant and the hospitalization risk (Adjusted OR: 0.73 (95%CI: 0.33-1.50)). Regarding ILI Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 negative patients, CT/CC genotype carriers had a higher risk of being hospitalized than patients with TT genotype (Adjusted OR: 2.54 (95%CI: 1.54-4.19)).The IFITM3 rs12252 variant was associated with respiratory infection hospitalization but not specifically in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09."
https://openalex.org/W2468876754,"This study deals with addictive acts that exhibit a stable pattern not intervening with the normal routine of daily life. Nevertheless, in the long term such behaviour may result in health damage. Alcohol consumption is an example of such addictive habit. The aim is to describe the process of addiction as a dynamical system in the way this is done in the natural and technological sciences. The dynamics of the addictive behaviour is described by a mathematical model consisting of two coupled difference equations. They determine the change in time of two state variables, craving and self-control. The model equations contain terms that represent external forces such as societal rules, peer influences and cues. The latter are formulated as events that are Poisson distributed in time. With the model it is shown how a person can get addicted when changing lifestyle. Although craving is the dominant variable in the process of addiction, the moment of getting dependent is clearly marked by a switch in a variable that fits the definition of addiction vulnerability in the literature. Furthermore, the way chance affects a therapeutic addiction intervention is analysed by carrying out a Monte Carlo simulation. Essential in the dynamical model is a nonlinear component which determines the configuration of the two stable states of the system: being dependent or not dependent. Under identical external conditions both may be stable (hysteresis). With the dynamical systems approach possible switches between the two states are explored (repeated relapses)."
https://openalex.org/W2471902757,"Aspartate aminotransferase from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgAspAT) is a PLP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the production of L-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate from L-glutamate and oxaloacetate in L-lysine biosynthesis. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of CgAspAT and compare it with those of other aspartate aminotransferases (AspATs) from the aminotransferase class I, we determined the crystal structure of CgAspAT. CgAspAT functions as a dimer, and the CgAspAT monomer consists of two domains, the core domain and the auxiliary domain. The PLP cofactor is found to be bound to CgAspAT and stabilized through unique residues. In our current structure, a citrate molecule is bound at the active site of one molecule and mimics binding of the glutamate substrate. The residues involved in binding of the PLP cofactor and the glutamate substrate were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, compared with other AspATs from aminotransferase subgroup Ia and Ib, CgAspAT exhibited unique binding sites for both cofactor and substrate; moreover, it was found to have unusual structural features in the auxiliary domain. Based on these structural differences, we propose that CgAspAT does not belong to either subgroup Ia or Ib, and can be categorized into a subgroup Ic. The phylogenetic tree and RMSD analysis also indicates that CgAspAT is located in an independent AspAT subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2469605557,"Background The transmitral E wave and the peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion (e`) both decrease with age, but the mechanisms underlying these age-related changes are incompletely understood. This study investigated the possible contributions of blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular end-diastolic length (LVEDL) to age-related reductions in E and e`. Methods The study group were 82 healthy adult subjects <55 years of age who were not obese or hypertensive. Transmitral flow and mitral annular motion were recorded using pulsed-wave Doppler. LVEDL was measured from the mitral annular plane to the apical endocardium. Results Age was positively correlated with diastolic BP and septal wall thickness (SWT), inversely correlated with LVEDL (β = -0.25) after adjustment for sex and body surface area, but was not related to left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Age was also inversely correlated with E (r = -0.36), septal e`(r = -0.53) and lateral e`(r = -0.53). On multivariable analysis, E was inversely correlated with diastolic BP and LVEDD, septal e`was inversely correlated with diastolic BP and positively correlated with SWT and LVEDL, after adjusting for body mass index, whilst lateral e`was inversely correlated with diastolic BP and positively correlated with LVEDL. Conclusion The above findings are consistent with higher BP being a contributor to age-related reductions in both E and e`and shortening of LVEDL with age being a contributor to the age-related reduction in e`. An implication of these findings is that slowing of myocyte relaxation is unlikely to be the sole, and may not be the main, mechanism underlying age-related decreases in E and e`."

A total of 31 patients who showed the typical signs of DRS type 3, including abduction and adduction deficit, globe retraction, narrowing of fissure on adduction and upshoot and/or downshoot, were included. The abducens nerve and any other extraocular muscle abnormalities discovered by MRI were noted.DRS was unilateral in 26 patients (84%) and bilateral in 5 patients (16%). Two out of 5 bilateral patients had DRS type 3 in the right eye and DRS type 1 in the left eye. Of the 34 affected orbits with DRS type 3 in 31 patients, the abducens nerve was absent or hypoplastic in 31 eyes (91%) and present in 3 eyes (9%). Patients with a present abducens nerve showed more limitation in adduction compared to patients with an absent abducens nerve (P = 0.030).The abducens nerve is absent or hypoplastic in 91% of DRS type 3. Patients with a present abducens nerve showed more prominent limitation of adduction. As DRS type 3 partly share the same pathophysiology with type 1 and 2 DRS, the classification of DRS may have to be revised according to MRI findings."
https://openalex.org/W2474031570,"This paper proposes a pseudo-haptic feedback method conveying simulated soft surface stiffness information through a visual interface. The method exploits a combination of two feedback techniques, namely visual feedback of soft surface deformation and control of the indenter avatar speed, to convey stiffness information of a simulated surface of a soft object in virtual environments. The proposed method was effective in distinguishing different sizes of virtual hard nodules integrated into the simulated soft bodies. To further improve the interactive experience, the approach was extended creating a multi-point pseudo-haptic feedback system. A comparison with regards to (a) nodule detection sensitivity and (b) elapsed time as performance indicators in hard nodule detection experiments to a tablet computer incorporating vibration feedback was conducted. The multi-point pseudo-haptic interaction is shown to be more time-efficient than the single-point pseudo-haptic interaction. It is noted that multi-point pseudo-haptic feedback performs similarly well when compared to a vibration-based feedback method based on both performance measures elapsed time and nodule detection sensitivity. This proves that the proposed method can be used to convey detailed haptic information for virtual environmental tasks, even subtle ones, using either a computer mouse or a pressure sensitive device as an input device. This pseudo-haptic feedback method provides an opportunity for low-cost simulation of objects with soft surfaces and hard inclusions, as, for example, occurring in ever more realistic video games with increasing emphasis on interaction with the physical environment and minimally invasive surgery in the form of soft tissue organs with embedded cancer nodules. Hence, the method can be used in many low-budget applications where haptic sensation is required, such as surgeon training or video games, either using desktop computers or portable devices, showing reasonably high fidelity in conveying stiffness perception to the user."
https://openalex.org/W2466144410,"Periodontitis, a chronic inflammation driven by dysbiotic subgingival bacterial flora, is linked on clinical levels to the development of a number of systemic diseases and to the development of oral and gastric tract tumors. A key pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis, secretes gingipains, cysteine proteases implicated as the main factors in the development of periodontitis. Here we hypothesize that gingipains may be linked to systemic pathologies through the deregulation of kallikrein-like proteinase (KLK) family members. KLKs are implicated in cancer development and are clinically utilized as tumor progression markers. In tissues, KLK activity is strictly controlled by a limited number of tissue-specific inhibitors, including SPINK6, an inhibitor of these proteases in skin and oral epithelium. Here we identify gingipains as the only P. gingivalis proteases responsible for SPINK6 degradation. We further show that gingipains, even at low nanomolar concentrations, cleaved SPINK6 in concentration- and time-dependent manner. The proteolysis was accompanied by loss of inhibition against KLK13. We also mapped the cleavage by Arg-specific gingipains to the reactive site loop of the SPINK6 inhibitor. Moreover, we identified a significant fraction of SPINK6-sensitive proteases in healthy saliva and confirmed the ability of gingipains to inactivate SPINK6 under ex vivo conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the double-edge action of gingipains, which, in addition, can activate KLKs because of gingipain K-mediated proteolytic processing of the zymogenic proform of KLK13. Altogether, the results indicate the potential of P. gingivalis to disrupt the control system of KLKs, providing a possible mechanistic link between periodontal disease and tumor development."

Catalytic removal of the pro-peptide is required for the protease to become active. In this study, we have generated three different mutants of papain (I86F, I86L and I86A) by replacing the residue I86 in its pro-peptide region, which blocks the specificity determining S2-subsite of the catalytic cleft of the protease in its zymogen form with a view to investigate the effect of mutation on the catalytic activity of the protease. Steady-state enzyme kinetic analyses of the corresponding mutant proteases with specific peptide substrates show significant alteration of substrate specificity—I86F and I86L have 2.7 and 29.1 times higher kcat/Km values compared to the wild-type against substrates having Phe and Leu at P2 position, respectively, while I86A shows lower catalytic activity against majority of the substrates tested. Far-UV CD scan and molecular mass analyses of the mature form of the mutant proteases reveal similar CD spectra and intact masses to that of the wild-type. Crystal structures of zymogens of I86F and I86L mutants suggest that subtle reorganization of active site residues, including water, upon binding of the pro-peptide may allow the enzyme to achieve discriminatory substrate selectivity and catalytic efficiency. However, accurate and reliable predictions on alteration of substrate specificity require atomic resolution structure of the catalytic domain after zymogen activation, which remains a challenging task. In this study we demonstrate that through single amino acid substitution in pro-peptide, it is possible to modify the substrate specificity of papain and hence the pro-peptide of a protease can also be a useful target for altering its catalytic activity/specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2463799175,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) serves as a powerful tool for exploring matrilineal phylogeographic ancestry, as well as for analyzing highly degraded samples, because of its polymorphic nature and high copy numbers per cell. The recent advent of complete mitochondrial genome sequencing has led to improved techniques for phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA, and many multiplex genotyping methods have been developed for the hierarchical analysis of phylogenetically important mutations. However, few high-resolution multiplex genotyping systems for analyzing East-Asian mtDNA can be applied to extremely degraded samples. Here, we present a multiplex system for analyzing mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs), which relies on a novel amplified product-length polymorphisms (APLP) method that uses inosine-flapped primers and is specifically designed for the detailed haplogrouping of extremely degraded East-Asian mtDNAs. We used fourteen 6-plex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and subsequent electrophoresis to examine 81 haplogroup-defining SNPs and 3 insertion/deletion sites, and we were able to securely assign the studied mtDNAs to relevant haplogroups. Our system requires only 1×10-13 g (100 fg) of crude DNA to obtain a full profile. Owing to its small amplicon size (<110 bp), this new APLP system was successfully applied to extremely degraded samples for which direct sequencing of hypervariable segments using mini-primer sets was unsuccessful, and proved to be more robust than conventional APLP analysis. Thus, our new APLP system is effective for retrieving reliable data from extremely degraded East-Asian mtDNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2471021658,"The aim of this study was to identify environmental or genetic risk factors that are associated with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in children in Greece.A case-control study was performed in 133 children (44 cases and 89 controls) aged between 0-14 years, who were hospitalized in a children's hospital in Athens. Demographics and possible risk factors were collected by the use of a structured questionnaire. To investigate the association of mannose binding lectin (MBL) with IMD, a frequency analysis of the haplotypes of the MBL2 gene and quantitative measurement of MBL serum protein levels were performed using Nanogen NanoChipR 400 technology and immuno-enzyme techniques, respectively.The multivariate analysis revealed that changes in a child's life setting (relocation or vacation, OR = 7.16), paternal smoking (OR = 4.51), upper respiratory tract infection within the previous month (OR = 3.04) and the density of people in the house/100m2 (OR = 3.16), were independent risk factors associated with IMD. Overall 18.8% of patients had a MBL2 genotype with low functionality compared to 10.1% of healthy controls, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.189).Prevention strategies aimed at reducing parental smoking and other risk factors identified in this study could decrease the risk of IMD among children in Greece."
https://openalex.org/W2287126979,"Patients of the National Institute of Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology in Luxembourg who underwent coronary angiography were surveyed for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and overweight/obesity between 2008/9 and 2013/4. For each cardiovascular risk factor (CVRFs), we analysed the associations between the quality of the patients' communication with the medical practitioner and their adherence declared to preventive behaviours.1,289 completed a self-administered questionnaire on communication with the medical practitioner (P'Com-5 items scale; Cronbach 0.87). 61.8% stopped smoking, 57.9% reduced or stopped their consumption of salt, 71.9% of fat, and 62.8% of sugar, and whereas 65% increased their consumption of fruit and vegetables and 19.8% increased their physical activity. Around 37% reported having made changes following their doctor's advice. 90% were followed by a cardiologist and 95.9% by an attending physician.No link was observed between declaration of physical activity, smoking, fats, and quality of communication. Significant associations: for increased consumption of fruit and vegetables was linked with the quality of doctor-patient communication when patients were overweight (OR = 1.081), obese (OR = 1.130), hypercholesterolemic (OR = 1.102), hypertensive (OR = 1.084) or diabetic (OR = 1.103). Reduction in salt intake was linked only to patients with hypertension (OR = 1.102), whereas reduction or cessation of sugar consumption was linked to overweight (OR = 1.093), and more so obese, (OR = 1.106), hypercholesterolemics (OR = 1.103) and diabetics (OR = 1.173).Good doctor-patient communication was related to nutrition, particularly increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Accurate perception of CVRFs by both patients and medical practitioners is essential for CV protection. The aim of instructing patients is to encourage them to make informed decisions about how to change their lifestyle. In routinely, P'Com-5 scale can collect data to assess the improvement of the professional skills. It can be used in medical training to enhance the quality of the therapeutic communication, especially for nutritional coaching, and to evaluate its efficacy in reducing CVRFs."
https://openalex.org/W2466974562,"Ample evidence attests that social intention, elicited through gestures explicitly signaling a request of communicative intention, affects the patterning of hand movement kinematics. The current study goes beyond the effect of social intention and addresses whether the same action of reaching to grasp an object for placing it in an end target position within or without a monitoring attendee’s peripersonal space, can be moulded by pure social factors in general, and by social facilitation in particular. A motion tracking system (Optotrak Certus) was used to record motor acts. We carefully avoided the usage of communicative intention by keeping constant both the visual information and the positional uncertainty of the end target position, while we systematically varied the social status of the attendee (a high, or a low social status) in separated blocks. Only thirty acts performed in the presence of a different social status attendee, revealed a significant change of kinematic parameterization of hand movement, independently of the attendee's distance. The amplitude of peak velocity reached by the hand during the reach-to-grasp and the lift-to-place phase of the movement was larger in the high rather than in the low social status condition. By contrast, the deceleration time of the reach-to-grasp phase and the maximum grasp aperture was smaller in the high rather than in the low social status condition. These results indicated that the hand movement was faster but less carefully shaped in presence of a high, but not of a low social status attendee. This kinematic patterning suggests that being monitored by a high rather than a low social status attendee might lead participants to experience evaluation apprehension that informs the control of motor execution. Motor execution would rely more on feedforward motor control in the presence of a high social status human attendee, vs. feedback motor control, in the presence of a low social status attendee."
https://openalex.org/W2463246912,"The quantity of wildlife extracted from the Amazon has increased in the past decades as a consequence of an increase in human population density and income growth. To evaluate the spatial distribution of studies on subsistence and/or commercial hunting conducted in the Brazilian Amazon, we selected eight mid-sized and large-bodied aquatic vertebrate species with a history of human exploitation in the region. We used a combination of searches in the gray and scientific literature from the past 24 years to provide an updated distributional map of studies on the target species. We calculated the distances between the study sites and the locations of the research institutes/universities that the first and last authors of the same study were affiliated to. For the period of 1990 to 2014, we found 105 studies on the subsistence and/or commercial hunting of aquatic vertebrates in the Brazilian Amazon in 271 locations that involved 43 institutions (37 Brazilian and 6 international). The spatial distribution of the studies across the Brazilian Amazon varied, but over 80% took place in the northeast and central Amazon, encompassing three States of the Legal Brazilian Amazon (Amazonas, 51.42%; Pará, 19.05%; and Amapá, 16.19%). Over half of the research study sites (52.91%) were within 500 km of the research institute/university of the first or last authors. Some research institutes/universities did not have any inter-institutional collaborations, while others collaborated with eight or more institutes. Some research institutes/universities conducted many studies, had an extensive collaboration network, and contributed greatly to the network of studies on Amazonian aquatic vertebrates. Our research contributes to the knowledge of studies on the subsistence and/or commercial hunting of the most exploited aquatic vertebrates of the Brazilian Amazon, illustrates the impact that collaboration networks have on research, and highlights potential areas for improvement and the generation of new collaborations."
https://openalex.org/W2473108111,"The Hengduan Mountains are the core of the Sino-Himalayan Floristic Region. Rosa soulieana Crép. is an important wild rose species that is widely distributed in the Hengduan Mountains. To provide better future utilization of this wild rose, and also to add some possible proof of the effect of geomorphological and ecological characteristics of the Hengduan Mountains on the current spatial distribution and genetic diversity of local species, the genetic diversity and genetic structure of 556 individuals from 37 populations of R. soulieana were studied using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). R. soulieana showed a moderately high level of genetic diversity and a high level of genetic differentiation at the species level. The total percentage of polymorphic loci, total heterozygosity (Ht), Shannon index (I), and heterozygosity value within populations (Hs) were 97.8%, 0.253, 0.339, and 0.139, respectively. More than half of the total genetic variation (54.0%) occurred within populations, and the overall gene differentiation coefficient (Gst) was 0.451. The genetic differentiation among populations was positively and significantly correlated with geographic distance. The neighbor-joining cluster and the Bayesian analysis divided all the populations and individuals into 3 groups, and did not support the morphology based intraspecific varieties. The results confirmed that the ancient R. soulieana of the third group survived in northwestern Yunnan and Yalongjiang valley and then moved upnorth along the valley. The spatial distribution of the other two groups was the result of allopatric divergence due to long period of adaptation to the different climatic conditions of its distribution at either side of the Yalongjiang River."
https://openalex.org/W2473383294,"Beta-thalassaemia is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders worldwide. The disease's high incidence, which is observed in the broader Mediterranean area has led to the establishment of molecular diagnostics' assays to prevent affected births. Therefore, the development of a reliable, cost-effective and rapid scanning method for β globin gene point mutations, easily adapted to a routine laboratory, is absolutely essential. Here, we describe, for the first time, the development of a High-Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) approach, suitable for scanning the particularly heterogeneous beta globin gene mutations present in the Greek population, and thus adaptable to the Mediterranean and other areas where these mutations have been identified. Within this context, β globin gene regions containing mutations frequently identified in the Greek population were divided in ten overlapping amplicons. Our reactions' setup allowed for the simultaneous amplification of multiple primer sets and partial multiplexing, thereby resulting in significant reduction of the experimental time. DNA samples from β-thalassaemia patients/carriers with defined genotypes were tested. Distinct genotypes displayed distinguishable melting curves, enabling accurate detection of mutations. The described HRMA can be adapted to a high-throughput level. It represents a rapid, simple, cost-effective, reliable, highly feasible and sensitive method for β-thalassaemia gene scanning."
https://openalex.org/W2468746490,"Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases playing essential roles during apoptosis. Seven caspases identified in Drosophila were Dronc, Dredd, Strica, Dcp-1, Decay, Drice and Damm. Among them, Strica is an insect-specific caspase containing a long serine- and threonine- rich prodomain, of which function is not yet well studied. Here we identified a homolog of strica from Aedes albopictus, named as Aacasps16. Aacasps16 encoded a protein containing a putative serine- and threonine-rich prodomain and a well conserved caspase catalytic domain. AaCASPS16 shared high identity with dipteran insects Strica homologs. Alignment showed that the closest relative of AaCASPS16 was Aedes aegypti AeCASPS16. The expression profiles of Aacasps16 during developmental and adult stages were analyzed. Purified recombinant AaCASPS16 exhibited the highest caspase activity to WEHD, which is the substrate preferred by human caspase-9. AaCASPS16 induced apoptosis when over-expressed in C6/36 cells. AaCASPS16 was processed during apoptosis induced by actinomycin D and ultraviolet irradiation treatment, whereas partial silencing of Aacasps16 reduced actinomycin D- and ultraviolet irradiation-triggered apoptosis in C6/36 cells. Taken together, our study identified AaCASPS16 as a novel apoptotic caspase in Aedes albopictus."
https://openalex.org/W2468481863,"Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) belongs to solute carrier 38 (SLC38) family of transporters, which is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and mediates transport of small, neutral amino acids, exemplified by alanine(Ala, A). Yet structural data on SNAT2, including the relevance of intrinsic cysteine residues on structure and function, is scarce, in spite of its essential roles in many tissues. To better define the potential of intrinsic cysteines to form disulfide bonds in SNAT2, mutagenesis experiments and thiol-specific chemical modifications by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide (mPEG-Mal, MW 5000) were performed, with or without the reducing regent dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment. Seven single mutant transporters with various cysteine (Cys, C) to alanine (Ala, A) substitutions, and a C245,279A double mutant were introduced to SNAT2 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C-terminus. The results showed that the cells expressing C245A or C279A were labeled by one equivalent of mPEG-Mal in the presence of DTT, while wild-type or all the other single Cys to Ala mutants were modified by two equivalents of mPEG-Mal. Furthermore, the molecular weight of C245,279A was not changed in the presence or absence of DTT treatment. The results suggest a disulfide bond between Cys245 and Cys279 in SNAT2 which has no effect on cell surface trafficking, as well as transporter function. The proposed disulfide bond may be important to delineate proximity in the extracellular domain of SNAT2 and related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2469067585,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of distance and optic flow structure on visual information and body sway coupling in children and young adults. Thirty children (from 4 to 12 years of age) and 10 young adults stood upright inside of a moving room oscillating at 0.2 Hz, at 0.25 and 1.5 m from the front wall, and under three optical flow conditions (global, central, and peripheral). Effect of distance and optic flow structure on the coupling of visual information and body sway is age-dependent, with 4-year-olds being more affected at 0.25 m distance than older children and adults are. No such difference was observed at 1.5 m from the front wall. Moreover, 4-year-olds' sway was larger and displayed higher variability. These results suggest that despite being able to accommodate change resulting from varying optic flow conditions, young children have difficulty in dodging stronger visual stimuli. Lastly, difference in sway performance may be due to immature inter-modality sensory reweighting."
https://openalex.org/W2462294424,"Chronic lung disease is the leading cause of death in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is often treated with bronchodilators. It is not known whether long-term tiotropium bromide treatment may have a positive impact on lung function.This retrospective cohort study estimated annual lung function decline utilizing longitudinal data for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).A total of 160 adult patients with CF were analyzed. The subjects treated for 24 months with tiotropium bromide had a significantly slower decline of mean annual change of FEV1 (treated: -0.3±4.0%; control: -2.3±5.0%; p = 0.0130). In patients with FEV1 ≥70% predicted, long-term tiotropium bromide treatment was associated with greater improvements in annual lung function decline (FEV1 ≥70% predicted: treated: +0.5±4.7%; control: -4.0±6.3%; p = 0.0132; FEV1 50-69% predicted: treated: -0.5±4.4%; control: -0.8±3.8%; p = 0.7142; FEV1 ≤49% predicted: treated: -0.6±3.4%; control: -2.4±4.8%; p = 0.0898).This study suggests that long-term tiotropium bromide treatment may be associated with reduced annual decline of FEV1 in patients with CF, particularly in adults with a mild degree of severity."
https://openalex.org/W2471795159,"There are two components to the review of animal based protocols in Canada: review for the merit of the study itself, and review of the ethical acceptability of the work. Despite the perceived importance for the quality assurance these reviews provide; there are few studies of the peer-based merit review system for animal-based protocols for research and education. Institutional animal care committees (ACC)s generally rely on the external peer review of scientific merit for animal-based research. In contrast, peer review for animal based teaching/training is dependent on the review of pedagogical merit carried out by the ACC itself or another committee within the institution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the views of ACC members about current practices and policies as well as alternate policies for the review of animal based teaching/training. We conducted a national web-based survey of ACC members with both quantitative and qualitative response options. Responses from 167 ACC members indicated broad concerns about administrative burden despite strong support for both the current and alternate policies. Participants' comments focused mostly on the merit review process (54%) relative to the efficiency (21%), impact (13%), and other (12%) aspects of evaluation. Approximately half (49%) of the comments were classified into emergent themes that focused on some type of burden: burden from additional pedagogical merit review (16%), a limited need for the review (12%), and a lack of resources (expertise 11%; people/money 10%). Participants indicated that the current system for pedagogical merit review is effective (60%); but most also indicated that there was at least some challenge (86%) with the current peer review process. There was broad support for additional guidance on the justification, criteria, types of animal use, and objectives of pedagogical merit review. Participants also supported the ethical review and application of the Three Rs in the review process. A clear priority from participants in the survey was updating guidance to better facilitate the merit review process of animal-based protocols for education. Balancing the need for improved guidance with the reality of limited resources at local institutions will be essential to do this successfully; a familiar dilemma to both scientists and policy makers alike."
