https://openalex.org/W2016628253,"Inhibitory interneurons often generate synchronous activity as an emergent property of their interconnections. To determine the role of electrical synapses in such activity, we constructed mice expressing histochemical reporters in place of the gap junction protein Cx36. Localization of the reporter with somatostatin and parvalbumin suggested that Cx36 was expressed largely by interneurons. Electrical synapses were common among cortical interneurons in controls but were nearly absent in knockouts. A metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist excited LTS interneurons, generating rhythmic inhibitory potentials in surrounding neurons of both wild-type and knockout animals. However, the synchrony of these rhythms was weaker and more spatially restricted in the knockout. We conclude that electrical synapses containing Cx36 are critical for the generation of widespread, synchronous inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2081620736,"We report a type of synaptic modulation that involves retrograde signaling from postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. Activation of mGluR subtype 1 (mGluR1) expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) reduced neurotransmitter release from excitatory climbing fibers. This required activation of G proteins but not Ca2+ elevation in postsynaptic PCs. This effect was occluded by a cannabinoid agonist and totally abolished by cannabinoid antagonists. Depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients in PCs also caused cannabinoid receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition. Thus, endocannabinoid production in PCs can be initiated by two distinct stimuli. Activation of mGluR1 by repetitive stimulation of parallel fibers, the other excitatory input to PCs, caused transient cannabinoid receptor-mediated depression of climbing fiber input. Our data highlight a signaling mechanism whereby activation of postsynaptic mGluR retrogradely influences presynaptic functions via endocannabinoid system."
https://openalex.org/W2130661432,"Endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers released by neurons to modulate the strength of their synaptic inputs. Endocannabinoids are thought to mediate the suppression of GABA release that follows depolarization of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron-termed ""depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition"" (DSI). Here, we report that DSI is absent in mice which lack cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1). Pharmacological and kinetic evidence suggests that CB1 activation inhibits presynaptic Ca2+ channels through direct G protein inhibition. Paired recordings show that endocannabinoids selectively inhibit a subclass of synapses distinguished by their fast kinetics and large unitary conductance. Furthermore, cannabinoid-sensitive inputs are unusual among central nervous system synapses in that they use N- but not P/Q-type Ca2+ channels for neurotransmitter release. These results indicate that endocannabinoids are highly selective, rapid modulators of hippocampal inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1983710612,"Neural processing occurs in parallel in distant cortical areas even for simple perceptual tasks. Associated cognitive binding is believed to occur through the interareal synchronization of rhythmic activity in the gamma (30-80 Hz) range. Such oscillations arise as an emergent property of the neuronal network and require conventional chemical neurotransmission. To test the potential role of gap junction-mediated electrical signaling in this network property, we generated mice lacking connexin 36, the major neuronal connexin. Here we show that the loss of this protein disrupts gamma frequency network oscillations in vitro but leaves high frequency (150 Hz) rhythms, which may involve gap junctions between principal cells (Schmitz et al., 2001), unaffected. Thus, specific connexins differentially deployed throughout cortical networks are likely to regulate different functional aspects of neuronal information processing in the mature brain."
https://openalex.org/W2105293460,"Salt and heat stresses, which are often combined in nature, induce complementing defense mechanisms. Organisms adapt to high external salinity by accumulating small organic compounds known as osmolytes, which equilibrate cellular osmotic pressure. Osmolytes can also act as “chemical chaperones” by increasing the stability of native proteins and assisting refolding of unfolded polypeptides. Adaptation to heat stress depends on the expression of heat-shock proteins, many of which are molecular chaperones, that prevent protein aggregation, disassemble protein aggregates, and assist protein refolding. We show here that Escherichia coli cells preadapted to high salinity contain increased levels of glycine betaine that prevent protein aggregation under thermal stress. After heat shock, the aggregated proteins, which escaped protection, were disaggregated in salt-adapted cells as efficiently as in low salt. Here we address the effects of four common osmolytes on chaperone activityin vitro. Systematic dose responses of glycine betaine, glycerol, proline, and trehalose revealed a regulatory effect on the folding activities of individual and combinations of chaperones GroEL, DnaK, and ClpB. With the exception of trehalose, low physiological concentrations of proline, glycerol, and especially glycine betaine activated the molecular chaperones, likely by assisting local folding in chaperone-bound polypeptides and stabilizing the native end product of the reaction. High osmolyte concentrations, especially trehalose, strongly inhibited DnaK-dependent chaperone networks, such as DnaK+GroEL and DnaK+ClpB, likely because high viscosity affects dynamic interactions between chaperones and folding substrates and stabilizes protein aggregates. Thus, during combined salt and heat stresses, cells can specifically control protein stability and chaperone-mediated disaggregation and refolding by modulating the intracellular levels of different osmolytes.

In vitro, osmolytes such as glycine betaine (subsequently referred to as betaine), proline, trehalose, and glycerol may also protect native proteins from heat denaturation and favor the formation of native protein oligomers (2da Costa M.S.

The nature and cellular concentrations of osmolytes depend on the organism, osmolyte availability in the medium, and the type, severity, and duration of the osmotic stress. Hence, betaine is a universal compatible solute in various prokaryotes including Escherichia coli, animals, algae, and salt-tolerant plants (2da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). It is a most effective osmoprotectant in many bacteria (13Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which allows growth in hyperosmotic minimal medium (4Caldas T.

Dis. 1985; 152: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When free betaine or proline is available, each may accumulate in the cell up to 0.7 and 0.4m, respectively (15Dinnbier U.

In the absence of other osmolytes, salt-stressed E. coli cells may also accumulate molar concentrations of glycerol and up to 0.4 m trehalose (19Sanno Y. Wilson T.H. Lin E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Richey D.P. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 784-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Heller K.B. Lin E.C. Wilson T.H. J.

Heat Stress—The massive production of heat-shock proteins (HSPs)1 during various types of stresses, especially heat shock, provides various mechanisms that protect and recover stress-damaged proteins in the cell (23Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). InE. coli, proteins IbpA/B (small HSPs), GroEL (HSP60), DnaK (HSP70), and ClpB (HSP100) (eukaryotic chaperones in parentheses) are major components of a sophisticated network of “holding” and “folding” chaperones that cooperate in preventing protein aggregation during heat stress and promoting protein disaggregation and refolding after the stress (24Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 25Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Hence, small HSP-bound denatured polypeptides can be sequentially refolded by the DnaK and then by the GroEL chaperones (26Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Similarly, stable protein aggregates can be efficiently resolubilized and refolded by the sequential action of ClpB and DnaK (27Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol.

Although combined heat and salt stresses are frequent in nature, little is known about how osmolytes control protein stability and chaperone-mediated protein refolding in the cell. Trehalose accumulation in yeast suppresses protein aggregation during heat shock but also interferes with chaperone-assisted protein refolding in vivo and in vitro (31Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Osmolytes promote the in vitro refolding by GroEL of a mutant enzyme, which cannot be refolded either with the chaperone or osmolytes alone (11Voziyan P.A. Fisher M.T. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This indicates that in addition to their activity as chemical chaperones that directly controls protein stability, osmolytes may also indirectly regulate protein homeostasis in the cell by controlling the activity of molecular chaperones. Here we show that adaptation of E. coli cells to a mild salt stress inhibits protein aggregation during heat stress but does not interfere with protein disaggregation after heat stress. In vitro, dose-response analysis shows qualitative and quantitative differences between osmolytes regulating protein folding by specific activation or inhibition of complex chaperone networks. Chaperones were purified according to previously published procedures: DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE were purified as described in Ref. 32Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J.

Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, l-proline, d(+)trehalose, and betaine were obtained from Sigma, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from pig heart was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Chaperone concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay, with bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein concentrations were expressed in protomers. E. coli cells (DH5α) were grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, and 0.17 m NaCl) supplemented with additional NaCl to the indicated concentrations. AtA 600 = 1.2, cells were heat-shocked at 47 °C for up to 15 min in the presence of 50 µg/ml streptomycin to inhibit growth and protein synthesis. Recovery was then carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed and frozen in liquid N2. The method for the isolation of a cellular fraction enriched with de novo heat-aggregated proteins was based on a modified protocol of Tomoyasu et al. (35Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Biol. 2001; 40: 397-413Google Scholar). Frozen bacterial pellets from 1.5-ml aliquots were lysed in 1 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 3 min and then sonicated (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics disrupter W-385). Aggregated proteins were separated from the insoluble cell membranes and debris by two washes with 200 µl of 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Nonidet P-40-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of guanidine-HCl (6 m). Protein content was measured by the Bio-Rad Bradford reagent. Results in Fig. 1are the average of four experiments. Aggregated proteins were expressed as a fraction (percentage) of total proteins in the cell. 1H NMR spectra were acquired at the 1H proton frequency of 600.13 MHz on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance DMX spectrometer (The Wolfson Center for Applied Structural Biology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel). The carrier frequency was set to a signal-free area of the spectrum, and the spectrum was referenced to the residual water signal at 4.75 ppm at 300 K. The relative concentrations of betaine and trehalose in the samples were estimated using reference samples of pure compound under identical acquisition conditions. The normalized relative peak intensity of the ammonium methyl peaks of betaine and the methine protons at position 4 on the glucopyranosyl and glucopyranoside moieties of trehalose was compared. The comparison between the samples was done in the same manner. Integrating and normalizing the aforementioned peaks determined the relative amounts of betaine and trehalose. 0.5 µm MDH was denatured at 44 °C in folding buffer containing increasing concentrations of osmolytes. The extent of protection (P) was expressed as a percentage using the following formula:P = 100 − ((V a/V o) × 100), where V o and V a are the inactivation rates without and with osmolytes, respectively. Several forms of denatured MDH were used. 1) MDH unfolded by urea for osmolyte-mediated refolding was used: 50 µm MDH was chemically denatured in 5m urea and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 35 min at 37 °C. Refolding without chaperones was initiated at 37 °C on a 100-fold dilution into the refolding buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgAc2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and increasing concentrations of osmolytes. 2) Heat-denatured MDH prebound to chaperones was used: 0.5 µm MDH was denatured at 47 °C for 30 min in folding buffer containing 3 mmphosphoenol pyruvate and chaperones (3.5 µm GroEL, 6 µm GroES, or 3.5 µm DnaK, 0.7 µm DnaJ, and 0.35 µm GrpE). Osmolytes and 20 µg/ml pyruvate kinase were added at 25 °C, and refolding was initiated with 3 mm ATP. 3) Aggregated MDH was used: 0.7 µm MDH was heat-inactivated and aggregated at 47 °C in the absence of chaperone as described in Ref. 27Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar. Disaggregation and refolding were initiated at 25 °C in the presence of added chaperones (1 µm DnaK, 0.2 µm DnaJ, 0.1 µm GrpE, and 0.5 µm ClpB), 20 µg/ml pyruvate kinase and osmolytes, and 3 mm ATP. The MDH activity was measured as described in Ref. 36Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. The viscosity of solutions containing different concentrations of osmolytes was determined at 25 °C, 30 °C, 37 °C, and 44 °C using a capillary viscometer (Cannon-Manning semi-micro viscometer). Results were expressed in time units (minutes) needed for 1 ml of solution to flow-through the capillary (AU). Time units are proportional to viscosity units. We examined the effect of increasing concentrations of salt in rich growth medium (LB medium) on protein aggregation and disaggregation in E. coli cells during and after heat stress. Protein aggregates were measured using a modified protocol by Tomoyasu et al. (35Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Biol. 2001; 40: 397-413Google Scholar). Less than 3% of the total proteins were found to be insoluble aggregates in cells grown at 30 °C in standard LB medium containing 0.17 m NaCl. This aggregated fraction was dramatically increased to 13% during a 15-min treatment at 47 °C (Fig. 1 a). Noticeably, as the NaCl concentration increased, the heat-induced protein aggregation in salt-adapted cells decreased (Fig. 1 a, inset). Hence, osmolyte accumulation in the salt-adapted cells correlates with increasingly effective protection of labile proteins against thermal denaturation and aggregation. Understanding the nature and composition of the osmolytes that accumulate in salt-adapted E. coli cells is essential to understanding the mechanism by which osmotic stress controls protein stability and refolding during heat shock. NMR spectroscopy revealed that betaine is the main osmolyte present in E. coli cells grown in standard LB medium containing 0.17 m NaCl. Trehalose was also present, albeit at concentrations 4–5 times lower than that of betaine (Fig. 1 b). We found that in cells grown in LB medium with 0.5 m NaCl, the betaine concentration was 4 times higher, whereas the trehalose concentration was only 1.2 times higher than that in cells grown in 0.17 m NaCl (Fig.1 b). To address the thermoprotective nature of various osmolytes, the activity of a model protein, mitochondrial MDH, was examined in vitro under mild heat-denaturing conditions in the presence of betaine and other representative categories of osmolytes: proline (amino acids), trehalose (sugars), and glycerol (polyols). Physiological concentrations of all osmolytes examined significantly stabilized the native MDH at 44 °C: Without osmolytes, native MDH was irreversibly inactivated at a rate of 6.3%/min. This rate of thermal inactivation was halved in the presence of 0.2 m betaine, 0.26m trehalose, 0.44 m proline, and 0.48m glycerol (Fig. 2). Noticeably, 1 m trehalose, 1.5 m betaine, 2m proline, or 2 m glycerol fully protected native MDH over a 40-min period at 44 °C (Fig. 2). The insoluble protein aggregates that formed in the cell during heat shock became rapidly resolubilized within 5 min of recovery at 30 °C, regardless of the salt concentration in the growth medium (Fig. 1 a). This suggests that, unlike the case of trehalose-enriched trehalase mutants from yeast (31Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), the thermoprotective betaine that accumulates inE. coli (Fig. 1 b) does not interfere with protein disaggregation after stress. We therefore addressed the specific effects of various osmolytes on the activity of simple and complex chaperone networks, using in vitro refolding assays. When heat-denatured MDH was prebound to GroEL and then supplemented after the stress with ATP, LS, and increasing concentrations of osmolytes, specific effects were observed. Physiological concentrations of up to 1 m proline or trehalose did not affect chaperone-mediated refolding of MDH. Betaine and glycerol activated LS chaperone by 30–40% (Fig. 3), but high, nonphysiological concentrations of betaine or proline inhibited the reaction. Interestingly, a significant refolding was also observed without GroES in the presence of specific osmolytes. Whereas betaine did not affect this ATP- and GroEL-dependent but GroES-independent activity, refolding rates with 0.56 mtrehalose, 1.2 m proline, or 3.8 m glycerol were 8, 6, and 12 times faster, respectively, than the refolding rates without osmolytes (Fig. 3). Whereas the mechanism by which osmolytes can functionally substitute for GroES remains to be elucidated, this clearly demonstrates that different osmolytes have different effects on chaperonin activity. This is in contrast with the protection mechanism, which appears similar for all the osmolytes tested. Similar specific activatory and inhibitory effects by the different osmolytes were also observed in the case of the DnaK+DnaJ+GrpE (KJE) chaperone system. Low concentrations of trehalose readily inhibited the refolding rates of KJE-bound heat-denatured MDH, whereas betaine, proline, and glycerol activated the chaperone by 30–50% (Fig.4a). Optimal rates were observed with 0.6 m betaine, 1 m proline, and 1.5 m glycerol. Higher, nonphysiological concentrations of either osmolyte inhibited this chaperone. We tested the effect of osmolytes on more complex networks of molecular chaperones. The refolding activity of KJE-bound MDH can be activated by supplemented GroELS, which alleviates KJE from slow and inefficient folding of late MDH-folding intermediates (37Ben-Zvi A. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the presence of increasing osmolyte concentrations, this KJE+LS bichaperone network was, as in the case of KJE alone, activated by low concentrations of betaine, proline, and glycerol, but not trehalose. Noticeably, betaine was the most effective activator of KJE+LS-mediated refolding (Fig.4 b), as in the case of LS alone (Fig. 3) High osmolyte concentrations, in a range that was significantly lower than that for the individual KJE or LS chaperone systems (Figs. 3 and 4 a), inhibited this complex reaction. Another bichaperone network composed of ClpB and KJE has the ability to disaggregate and refold stable protein aggregates (27Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The disaggregation activity of ClpB+KJE was more sensitive to low trehalose than KJE alone. Low proline and glycerol concentrations did not activate, and inhibition occurred at concentrations 2–3-fold lower than those in the case of KJE alone (Fig. 4, a andc). The finding that more complex chaperone networks are inhibited, whereas individual chaperones are not, suggests that the shuttling of folding intermediates between chaperones is particularly sensitive to nonphysiologically high concentrations of osmolytes. Remarkably, contrary to the other osmolytes, physiological concentrations of betaine strongly activated the ClpB+KJE system. Hence, disaggregation was activated 2.5-fold by 0.5 mbetaine, whereas as little as 70 mm trehalose inhibited this reaction by 50% (Fig. 4 c). This suggests that, by a mechanism yet to be elucidated, betaine can specifically activate protein disaggregation by ClpB and KJE chaperones, and trehalose can specifically inhibit protein disaggregation by ClpB and KJE chaperones. One possible mechanism by which osmolytes can activate chaperone-mediated refolding is by promoting the local correct refolding of segments within the chaperone-bound polypeptides (37Ben-Zvi A. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This possibility was addressed by measuring the ability of various osmolytes to promote the correct refolding of urea-unfolded MDH. After dilution in a chaperoneless solution, urea-unfolded MDH was not reactivated at 37 °C. However, when urea-unfolded MDH was diluted in the presence of betaine, glycerol, proline, or trehalose, it was efficiently reactivated at rates and yields that generally increased with concentration, with the exception of betaine, which inhibited refolding at concentrations above 3m (Fig. 5). Yields were highest with glycerol (70%) > proline (40%) > trehalose (28%) > betaine (19%) (Fig.5 b, inset), implying that the nature of the osmolyte controls the partitioning and commitment of the unfolded species to the proper refolding or improper misfolding pathways. Osmolytes all have high viscosity indexes. We therefore addressed the possible contribution of viscosity to osmolyte-mediated thermal protection, promotion of refolding, and regulation of molecular chaperone activity. The viscosity of refolding solutions containing increasing osmolyte concentrations was measured at various temperatures: 25 °C (Fig.6a), 30 °C, 37 °C, and 44 °C (data not shown). Hence, at 25 °C, 0.9 mtrehalose was 5.4 times more viscous than equimolar proline, glycerol, or betaine (Fig. 6 a). When the rates of KJE-, KJE+LS-, and ClpB+KJE-mediated refolding were expressed as a function of viscosity, the general patterns of activation and inhibition were preserved, although some differences among osmolytes became less pronounced (Fig.6, b−d). In addition, no direct correlation was found between osmolyte viscosity and the ability of the osmolyte to promote correct refolding of urea-unfolded MDH (Fig. 6 e). In contrast, when expressed as function of viscosity, differences in the protective nature of osmolytes were strongly reduced (Fig.6 f), indicating that viscosity is a major component in the mechanism of osmolyte-induced thermoprotection. Cellular accumulation of osmolytes has been involved in the adaptation of organisms to salt, desiccation, and osmotic stresses in general (2da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, accumulation of heat-shock proteins, especially molecular chaperones, has been involved in the adaptation to thermal stress (23Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). Although heat and salt stresses often occur concomitantly in nature, a possible cross-talk between the two defense mechanisms has not been addressed in detail. Here we investigated the effect of osmolyte accumulation on the aggregation and disaggregation of proteins in E. coli cells and in vitro. We found that preadaptation of E. coli cells to increasingly high concentrations of salt in the medium decreased the tendency of soluble proteins to form insoluble aggregates during heat shock. NMR analysis revealed that betaine was the major osmolyte that accumulated in E. coli cells grown in rich medium (standard LB medium containing 0.17 m NaCl), and the amounts of betaine strongly increased in salt-adapted cells. Intracellular betaine can originate from the medium or be synthesized from choline. Both betaine and choline are common components of rich media (1Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Although trehalose is also present in the medium, it is mostly degraded in the periplasm as a carbon source. Only the trehalose that is endogenously synthesized can have an osmoprotective function (1Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In addition, betaine uptake is strongly preferred by the cell over trehalose synthesis (18Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These findings reinforce our observation that betaine is the main osmolyte that accumulates in the E. coli cells grown in rich medium during salt stress. The correlation between thermal protection and osmolyte accumulation in whole cells was confirmed in vitro. Physiological concentrations (<1 m) of betaine, trehalose, proline, or glycerol all fully protected MDH from thermal denaturation at 44 °C. The possible mechanism by which osmolytes may protect native proteins implies the existence of a thermodynamic force, the “osmophobic effect,” which makes the interaction between osmolytes and peptide backbone unfavorable (38Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The exclusion of osmolytes from protein cores, hydration shells, and crevasses on the protein surface increase protein solvation, leading to stabilization and protection of native proteins (39Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 40Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9857-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Vapor pressure osmometry showed that betaine is significantly more excluded from bovine serum albumin than proline, which in turn is excluded more than trehalose and glycerol (41Courtenay E.S. Capp M.W. Anderson C.F. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4455-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that betaine and trehalose protect native MDH equally well and that both are more effective protectants than glycerol and proline. This indicates that osmolyte exclusion and osmolyte protection do not necessarily correlate. In contrast, in the case of all four osmolytes tested here, we found a good correlation between protection and osmolyte viscosity. This suggests that protection results primarily from the slowing down by the viscous solution of heat-induced movements in labile proteins that would otherwise lead to denaturation and aggregation. Protection of proteins during heat shock by trehalose in yeast cells correlates with inhibition of HSP104-mediated protein disaggregation (31Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, this is not a general feature of osmolytes because we observed efficient protein disaggregation, likely by the ClpB+KJE chaperones (25Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 27Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), despite a significant accumulation of betaine in salt-adapted E. coli cells (Fig. 1). Consequently, we addressed the specific effects of betaine, proline, glycerol, and trehalose on the protein disaggregation activity of the ClpB+KJE chaperone network in vitro, as compared with the protein refolding activity of individual and combined chaperones KJE, LS, and KJE+LS. With the exception of trehalose, which inhibited KJE-dependent reactions at all concentrations, physiological concentrations (up to 1 m) of betaine, proline, and glycerol activated KJE and LS chaperones. Noticeably, betaine was a potent activator of protein disaggregation by ClpB+KJE. The mechanism for such activation may involve 1) promotion of spontaneous local refolding within the chaperone-bound polypeptides, 2) stabilization of the end product, 3) stabilization of chaperone structure, and 4) specific activation of the chaperones. As expected from “chemical chaperones,” all the osmolytes tested but betaine efficiently promoted the correct refolding of urea-unfolded MDHin vitro. However, completely unfolded polypeptides are unlikely to form in the cell, especially during thermal stress, because partially unfolded proteins are highly unstable species that readily seek alternative stable structures by association with chaperones (42Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or by aggregation (43Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 210-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The osmolyte concentrations that optimally refolded urea-MDH were nonphysiologically high. Moreover, the same trehalose concentrations that strongly inhibited KJE promoted refolding of urea-unfolded MDH, suggesting that the two effects are not connected. Conversely, the same betaine concentrations that strongly activated ClpB+KJE did not promote refolding. Nevertheless, a minor contribution to local refolding by low concentrations of specific osmolytes still remains possible. Protection by osmolytes occurs at the same low physiological concentrations that also activate chaperones. By preventing inactivation of the end product of the folding reaction, osmolyte protection could produce a net activation of the chaperone reactions. Moreover, osmolytes may stabilize the molecular chaperones themselves. However, the fact that low physiological concentrations of betaine strongly activate chaperone-mediated disaggregation under conditions where glycerol, proline, and trehalose strongly inhibit chaperone-mediated disaggregation suggests that betaine has a specific activatory interaction with ClpB and/or DnaK, whose mechanism is under investigation. Nonphysiologically high concentrations of glycerol, proline, and betaine inhibited chaperone activity. Noticeably, trehalose was a very potent inhibitor of all the reactions that depended on KJE, especially protein disaggregation, even at physiological concentrations. Inhibition may result from increased viscosity, which can limit dynamic interactions between chaperones, co-chaperones, and folding substrates. This is suggested by the observation that the sensitivity to high concentration osmolytes increases with the complexity of the chaperone network. The simplest system with co-chaperone GroES, chaperone GroEL, and a prebound MDH was the least inhibited by high osmolyte concentrations. In contrast, multichaperone networks such as KJE+LS or ClpB+KJE were inhibited by physiological concentrations of osmolytes. High osmolyte concentrations may also stabilize protein aggregates, like native proteins, resulting in the inhibition of chaperone unfolding activity. Low physiological concentrations of trehalose strongly inhibited chaperone-mediated disaggregation under conditions where other osmolytes activated the reaction. It is therefore possible that trehalose can specifically interact with ClpB or DnaK. The mechanisms by which trehalose specifically inhibits chaperone-mediated disaggregation and betaine specifically activates chaperone-mediated disaggregation remain to be elucidated. However, it is significant that protein disaggregation was very efficient in salt-adapted E. coli cells, which accumulated high levels of betaine but not of trehalose. This suggests that an organism grown in hyperosmotic nutrient-rich media can optimally protect its native proteins from heat damage and, at the same time, keep its network of molecular chaperones optimally active. However, under poor and unfavorable growth conditions and under prolonged and acute heat and osmotic stresses, trehalose accumulation may be a better option because it is also a powerful protecting agent of membranes (44Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Thus, the timing of heat stress in relation to osmotic stress and the availability of osmolytes from the medium both determine the cellular composition and concentration of osmolytes in salt-adapted cells and hence the extent of thermal damage in proteins and the efficiency of protein recovery after heat stress. In addition to osmolyte accumulation, osmotic stress increases the confinement and crowding of the cellular macromolecules (16Cayley S. Lewis B.A. Guttman H.J. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 281-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 45Ellis, R. J. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7,R531R533.Google Scholar). Crowding enhances interactions between proteins in general and between unstable folding intermediates in particular and thus favors protein aggregation (45Ellis, R. J. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7,R531R533.Google Scholar, 46van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 47Martin J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, increased protein-protein interactions may equally favor binding of unstable folding intermediates to molecular chaperones and their stabilization as soluble refolding-competent species (46van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 47Martin J. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and may favor stabilization of native proteins. Thus, increased molecular crowding, by low concentration of osmolytes, may increase the overall stability of cellular proteins and encourage proper protein refolding, whereas under extreme stress conditions, crowding may favor protein aggregation (45Ellis, R. J. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7,R531R533.Google Scholar). In conclusion, complex interactions between specific chemical the molecular chaperones can potentiate the ability of cells to control protein stability, protein aggregation, disaggregation, and refolding during and after combined osmotic and heat stresses.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) found that the lipoamino acidN-arachidonylglycine (NAGly)1 causes hot plate analgesia in mice, indicating its possible biological relevance in mammals. NAGly was first synthesized (5Sheskin T. Hanus L. Slager J. Vogel Z. Mechoulam R. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) as a structural analog of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (6Devane W.A. Haus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4690) Google Scholar), and it was found to lack affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. We hypothesized that NAGly may be produced by mammalian tissues because it is composed of the naturally occurring compounds glycine and arachidonic acid. Herein we show that at least three arachidonyl amino acids are natural constituents in mammalian brain: NAGly, N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid (NAGABA), and N-arachidonylalanine (NAAla). One member of this group, NAGly, is characterized in detail here. It is synthesized in situ in rat brain tissue from the precursors arachidonic acid and glycine, and it is hydrolyzed by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). NAGly is widely distributed among mammalian tissues, implying multiple functions. One possible physiological function of NAGly is pain suppression, indicated by its marked suppression of formalin-induced pain behavior in rats, confirming a previous report of analgesic activity in mice (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The procedure comprised a liquid-liquid extraction modified from that described by Folch et al. (7Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a series of solid-phase separations. Fresh bovine brain and rat organs were homogenized in the methanol fraction of 20 volumes of 2:1 chloroform:methanol and centrifuged for 15 min at 31,000 ×g at 4 °C. Chloroform was then added to the supernatant. NaCl (0.2 volume, 0.73%) was mixed with the crude homogenate, and the solution was allowed to separate overnight at 4 °C or centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min. The upper phase was discarded and the interphase washed twice. The lower phase was then applied to diethylaminopropyl silica-based solid-phase extraction columns (DEA, Varian, Harbor City, CA) without prior column conditioning. The columns were washed with chloroform, methanol, 0.1% ammonium acetate in methanol and eluted with 0.5% ammonium acetate in methanol. Water (1.2 volumes) was added to the eluent, and the solution was loaded onto preconditioned Empore C18 particle loaded membrane cartridges (3M, St. Paul, MN). The cartridges were washed with water, 60% methanol and eluted with 65% methanol. Samples were evaporated in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Halbrook, NY) and reconstituted prior to analysis.N-[ 2Synthesized by R. E. Zipkin and R. Sivakumar. H8]Arachidonylglycine2was used as an internal standard in the tissue distribution study. One set of experiments for structural elucidation of NAGly in bovine brain extract was conducted with HP1100 series LC/Agilent Ion Trap. Samples were chromatographed on a 50-mm Zorbax Eclipse C18 column (2.1 mm internal diameter, 0.4 ml/min, 40 °C) with a linear gradient from 0% 10 mmammonium acetate to 95% acetonitrile for the first 3 min, maintained at 95% for 2 min, and then back to 0% in 0.5 min. The Ion Trap was set to electrospray positive ion mode, monitoring for daughter ions produced from m/z 362.3 (MH+ ion of NAGly) at the retention time of NAGly standard. Exact mass determination and structural information of NAGly, NAGABA, and NAAla in bovine brain extract were accomplished with a quadrupole-time-of-flight LC/MS/MS. Brain extract was chromatographed on a C18 column (2 × 20 mm), and the eluent was analyzed by Pulsar (qq-TOF instrument, Applied Biosystems-MDS Sciex) for mass measurements of MH+and product ions. The instrument was operated at a resolution of 9,000 (full width at half height at m/z800). Mass measurements were the averages of at least 10 consecutive scans. For the production of methyl esters, a solution of diazomethane in ether was prepared from Diazald (Aldrich) using the apparatus and conditions described in the literature (8Ngan F. Toofan M. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1991; 29: 8-10Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was added in excess to an ether solution of the sample to be methylated and kept at room temperature for 1 h. One drop of glacial acetic acid was then added to consume excess diazomethane. The product was then purified by silica gel tlc and its identity confirmed by LC/MS as described. Analysis of NAGly levels was conducted with a Hewlett Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 series LC/MS. Samples were chromatographed on a 100-mm Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 reversed phase HPLC (4.6-mm internal diameter, 1 ml/min) column with isocratic 85% methanol containing 1 mm ammonium acetate and 0.05% acetic acid. MS conditions were established using direct flow injection analysis of syntheticN-arachidonylglycine: APCI positive mode, fragmentor 80 V; vaporizer 500 °C; drying gas 150 °C; drying gas flow 7 liters/min; nebulizer 0.69 bar, corona 7 μA. For quantitation, the area under the peak at the appropriate retention time andm/z was obtained. The amount of compound was then extrapolated from a calibration curve and corrected based on extraction efficiency. 1, 10, or 100 μm [2H8]arachidonic acid (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and 2 mm[2H5]glycine (ICON, Mt. Marion, NY) (approximate free concentration in brain) was incubated in a rat P2 membrane preparation (2.5 volumes brain weight, 407 ± 46 μg of protein/tube, 0.5 ml 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Buffer, boiled membrane, and non-incubated conditions were also tested.N-[2H8]Arachidonylglycine2was used as a batch internal standard to track extraction efficiency alongside the experimental conditions. Following incubation, the preparation was extracted via the procedure described above. Samples were analyzed via LC/MS. In some instances, samples were evaporated and reconstituted prior to analysis. The effects of NAGly and two homologues, palmitoylglycine and linolenoylglycine, on the enzymatic hydrolysis of [14C]anandamide (9 μm, 5.5mCi/mmol) 3Synthesized by T. Bisogno and V. Di Marzo. by membranes from cultured cells were studied as described previously (Refs. 9Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Luccia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V.

N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 cell membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of compounds (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 30 min, 37 °C) (9Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Luccia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The mixture was then extracted with 2 volumes of 2:1 chloroform:methanol, and the aqueous phase was measured for [14C]ethanolamine by scintillation counting. To calculate the Lineweaver-Burk profile of FAAH inhibition by NAGly, the effect of 10 μm NAGly on the hydrolysis of increasing concentrations of [14C]anandamide to [14C]ethanolamine was also studied. To assess its enzymatic stability, NAGly (200 μg/ml) was incubated with rat brain whole homogenates (2 mg protein/ml, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 37 °C, 30 min). Following incubation, the homogenates were extracted with 3 volumes of 2:1 chloroform:methanol, and the organic phase was lyophilized and analyzed by tlc carried out on analytical silica plates (Merck) developed with chloroform/methanol/ammonia (95:5:1 by volume). The formation of arachidonic acid from NAGly was visualized as a band withR F = 0.4 (where R F is relative migration) after exposure to iodine vapors. Control incubations were carried out with boiled rat brain homogenates or with homogenates incubated with [14C]anandamide. The effect of NAGly on the uptake of anandamide by RBL-2H3 cells was studied with a modification of the method described previously (10Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), analogous to the protocol described in Hillard et al. (11Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) except for the use of a higher concentration (3.6 μm) of [14C]anandamide. Residual [14C]anandamide (measured by scintillation counting) in the incubation media after extraction with 2:1 chloroform:methanol was used as a measure of the anandamide taken up by cells. The effect of NAGly on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the human VR1 vanilloid receptor was determined using Fluo-3, a selective intracellular fluorescent probe for Ca2+. One day prior to experiments, cells cultured as described in Smart et al. (12Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Jerman J.C. Nasir S. Gray J. Muir A.I. Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) were transferred into six-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and grown in the culture medium mentioned above. On the day of the experiment, cells (50–60,000/well) were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-3 methyl ester for 2 h at 25 °C (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO containing 0.04% Pluronic. After the loading, cells were washed with Tyrode (pH 7.4) and trypsinized to be suspended in the cuvette of the fluorescence detector (PerkinElmer LS50B) under continuous stirring. Cell fluorescence was measured (λex = 488 nm, λem = 540 nm) before and after the addition of NAGly at various concentrations. The effect was compared with that observed with 4 μm ionomycin. The rat formalin test (13Debuisson D. Dennis S.G. Pain. 1977; 4: 161-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar) was used as a behavior measure of pain. Rats were acclimatized to human handling and the testing chamber for at least 2 days prior to testing. Rats received injections of formalin (dissolved in mono- and dibasic phosphate saline, pH 7.4) in the left hind paw with vehicle (Me2SO) or drug in a 90:10 ratio (100 μl, 4.5% formalin, subcutaneously, intraplantar), and the time spent licking and lifting the injected paw over the subsequent 60 min period was recorded at 5-min intervals. The summed scores of phase 1 (0–10 min) and phase 2 (10–60 min) for each group was analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's post hoc comparison test (BMDP, Los Angeles, CA). The identification of NAGly in the bovine brain extract was accomplished by a variety of LC/MS and LC/MS/MS approaches. Ion trap mass spectrometric analysis of the brain extract revealed that the column retention time and fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion 362.3 is identical to that of the synthetic NAGly standard, showing prominent daughter ions at m/z 287.2 and 269.2 (Fig. 1, a and b). Quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry yielded a mass estimate of 362.2687, which is −0.8 ppm of the expected mass of NAGly MH+ (362.2690) with an elemental composition of C22H36NO3 for the MH+ion. The loss of the amino acid moiety and water produced the fragmentsm/z 287 and 269. Further losses of lipid moieties produced m/z 245 and 203 (TableI, top). The exact mass measurements of the MH+ and product ions greatly enhanced the confidence level of structural assignments, leading to reconstruction of the molecule NAGly as the material in the brain extract (Fig. 1 cand Table I, top). In addition to the identification of the compound in its native form, we performed chemical methylation on the brain extract and the synthetic standard with diazomethane. LC-MS analysis of the treated standard and the extract revealed coeluting peaks at the expected mass of NAGly-methyl ester MH+(m/z 376.3, Fig. 1 d). The results indicate that both the synthetic standard and the material in the brain extract underwent the same reaction and were converted to NAGly-methyl ester. Hence, the constituent we isolated from bovine brain has the elemental composition and the structural components that constitute NAGly and exhibits the same chemical properties as synthetic NAGly, thus indicating that NAGly is a naturally occurring molecule in the brain.Table IMass measurement of MH + and the product ions and structural assignments from bovine brain extract conducted with Quadrupole-TOF LC/MS/MSCommon fragments1-aMass measurements and errors (ppm) of at least 10 consecutive scan averages.Proposed formulaeCommentsm/z (ppm)PutativeN-arachidonyl glycine 362.2687 (−0.8)C22H36NO3MH+ 287.2368 (−0.5)C20H31OMH+ − C2H5NO2 (Gly) 269.2266 (0.8)C20H29MH+ − C2H5NO2 (Gly) − H2O 245.2273 (3.8)C18H29MH+ − C4H7NO3 203.1788 (−3.1)C15H23MH+ − C7H13NO3Putative N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid 390.3012 (2.4)C24H40NO3MH+ 287.2382 (4.4)C20H31OMH+ − C4H9NO2 (GABA) 269.2279 (5.7)C20H29MH+ − C4H9NO2 (GABA) − H2O 245.2269 (2.1)C18H29MH+ − C6H11NO3 203.1795 (0.4)C15H23MH+ − C9H17NO3PutativeN-arachidonylalanine 376.2856 (2.6)C23H38NO3MH+ 287.2369 (−0.2)C20H31OMH+ − C3H7NO2 (Ala) 269.2238 (−9.6)C20H29MH+ − C3H7NO2 (Ala) − H2O 245.21-bDue to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed.C18H29MH+− C5H9NO3 203.11-bDue to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed.C15H23MH+− C8H15NO31-a Mass measurements and errors (ppm) of at least 10 consecutive scan averages.1-b Due to low signal level, exact mass measurements were not performed. Open table in a new tab The identification of endogenous NAGly led us to postulate the existence of other arachidonyl amino acids in mammalian brain. Using the extraction procedure described above, we found that at least two other such molecules are present in the bovine brain. Quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to aid structural elucidation. Exact masses were determined to within 2.6 ppm of the parent MH+ ions, accompanied by a spectrum of product ions reflecting successive losses of the amino acid, water, and lipid moieties in a manner similar to that observed for NAGly, leading to a reconstruction of the structures of two additional arachidonyl amino acids in bovine brain extract, N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid and N-arachidonylalanine (Table I, middle and bottom parts). The presence of NAGly, NAGABA, and NAAla in the brain necessitates pathway(s) for their biosynthesis and degradation. We focused on NAGly for the characterization. To address the question of biosynthesis, we used rat brain P2 membranes and deuterated precursors (arachidonic acid and glycine) to detect a direct coupling pathway and to facilitate detection by mass spectrometry. Deuterated NAGly was not detected when buffer or boiled membranes were incubated with the precursors or when membranes were incubated without the precursors (Fig. 2). However, when fresh rat brain membranes were incubated with [2H8]arachidonic acid and [2H5]glycine in Tris-HCl buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, deuterated NAGly was produced (Fig. 2 andinset). This was detectable at masses corresponding to the molecular ions ranging from [2H8]NAGly to [2H12]NAGly (the varying degree of incorporation of deuterium expected because of proton exchange with the aqueous buffer and the tissue). Maximal responses were observed at the molecular ion of [2H10]- and [2H9]NAGly. The presence of deuterated NAGly following incubation indicates biosynthesis of NAGly from arachidonic acid and glycine via an enzymatic process. To address the question of degradation of NAGly, we tested its affinity for the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, which acts upon substrates of similar structure such as anandamide and oleamide (14Deutsch D.G. Chin S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 15Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). When coincubated with [14C]anandamide, NAGly potently and competitively inhibited its hydrolysis by N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 cell membranes/preparations that contain FAAH (IC50 7.0 and 4.1 μm; Fig. 3). The inhibition was competitive according to Lineweaver-Burk analysis. Ten μm NAGly decreased the K m of the enzyme (from 13 ± 1 to 9 ± 1 μm) without decreasing its Vmax (from 2.2 ± 0.7 to 2.1 ± 0.5nmol/min/mg protein). The rank potency of inhibition obtained with NAGly and the two analogues (palmitoylglycine and linolenoylglycine) are identical to those observed with anandamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and linolenoylethanolamide, thus strengthening the hypothesis that NAGly is acting on FAAH. When NAGly was incubated with rat crude membrane homogenate, it was readily hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid. By densitometry scanning of tlc plates, it was estimated that after 30 min at 37 °C, about 15% of NAGly had been hydrolyzed (data not shown). The results suggest that one likely mechanism of inactivation of NAGly in mammalian tissues is through enzymatic degradation by FAAH. We also investigated whether NAGly could be recognized by the membrane transporter that facilitates anandamide uptake by cells (16Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). NAGly, up to a 50 μm concentration, failed to inhibit the transport of [14C]anandamide into RBL-2H3 cells, which contain active anandamide transporters. This latter finding suggests that if NAGly is transported into cells, it does so through a mechanism distinct from the anandamide transporters. The similarity between the structures of NAGly and anandamide and their common mode of degradation led us to wonder whether they share other molecular targets. The lack of affinity of NAGly for cannabinoid receptors has been mentioned above. However, because anandamide also acts as a full agonist at the rat and human vanilloid VR1 receptors (12Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Jerman J.C. Nasir S. Gray J. Muir A.I. Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Hogestatt E.D. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), we tested the action of NAGly at the human VR1 receptor. NAGly was inactive (<5% at 10 μm) in inducing VR1-mediated Ca2+ influx in VR1-overexpressing human embryonic kidney cells. Although we initially isolated NAGly from the brain, subsequent studies revealed varying levels in different tissues in the rat (Fig.4). The important role of arachidonic acid-derived products (e.g. prostanoids, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes) in inflammation and pain, together with the relatively high levels of NAGly in the skin, spinal cord, and brain, suggested that NAGly may serve as a modulator of pain and inflammation. The above observations on NAGly along with a previous report (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) of its antinociceptive actions led us to study the effects of NAGly on pain behavior using the formalin test. Rats received intraplantar injections of formalin in the hind paw, and pain behavior consisting of lifting and licking of the injected paw was observed. Formalin injection elicited a robust two-phase pain response, consisting of a brief first phase (acute pain), a transient remittance of pain behavior, and a prolonged second phase (tonic pain, Fig.5, inset). Neither glycine nor arachidonic acid (275 nmol) suppressed pain when coinjected with formalin, and NAGly had no effect on the first phase of the formalin response. However, in the second phase, 275 nmol of NAGly markedly suppressed the pain response elicited by formalin. No behavioral abnormality was observed in the drug-treated animals. A new family of bioactive molecules was identified in mammalian brain, the arachidonyl amino acids. Using a variety of approaches, three members of this group were identified in this study: NAGly, NAGABA, and NAAla. NAGly was chosen as a prototypical molecule for detailed characterization because of its structural similarity to other arachidonyl amino acids and previous indications of its bioactivity (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There is a high likelihood that members of this family, such as NAGABA and NAAla, share similar mechanisms of action, in particular with respect to the biosynthetic and degradatory pathways. NAGly was found to be synthesized from precursors arachidonic acid and glycine in rat brain tissues via an enzymatic process. Although the details of NAGly biosynthesis require further elucidation, one mechanism involving enzymes of known activities can be proposed. Arachidonic acid can be converted to arachidonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) by a class of enzymes, acyl-CoA synthetase. To date, one such enzyme with a distinct specificity for arachidonic acid, arachidonyl-CoA synthetase, has been found in the brain, platelets, and aorta (18Reddy T.S. Bazan N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Wilson D.B. Prescott S.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

A second family of enzymes, acyl-coenzyme A:glycineN-acyltransferases, can conjugate glycine to various aliphatic and aromatic acyl-CoAs (21Schachter D. Taggart J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 203: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schachter D. Taggart J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 208: 263-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nandi D.L.

These enzymes have varying substrate specificity depending on the hydrocarbon structure of the individual acyl-CoA. The existence of specific arachidonyl-CoA synthetase and the specialized role of arachidonic acid in mammalian physiology support the notion that the biosynthesis of NAGly may occur via actions of arachidonyl-CoA synthetase and an enzyme of the acyl-coA:glycine N-acyltransferase family. NAGly shares one of the molecular mechanisms of anandamide, namely degradation by the enzyme FAAH. In fact, NAGly exhibits higher potency for FAAH inhibition than anandamide. These results, along with NAGly's lack of affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the vanilloid VR1 receptor, and the anandamide transporter, support the notion that despite its structural similarity to the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide, NAGly likely functions via molecular and cellular pathways distinct from anandamide and other lipid mediators. NAGly was effective in suppressing phase 2 (tonic pain phase) of formalin-induced pain behavior. A combination of mechanisms appears to contribute to the phase 2 pain behavior. Both persistent peripheral nociceptor discharge and the ensuing central sensitization in the spinal cord are important in the initiation and maintenance of the spontaneous pain, allodynia and hyperalgesia (27Puig S. Sorkin L.S. Pain. 1996; 64: 345-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 28Taylor B.K. Peterson M.A. Basbaum A. J.

Sullivan A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 83: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This tonic pain phase has been likened to persistent postoperative pain (reviewed in Ref. 31Abram S.E. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 1015-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The efficacy of peripherally administered NAGly in inhibiting phase 2 pain behavior suggests that NAGly likely suppressed the formalin-induced hyperactivity in nociceptive afferents either directly, on the nerve, or indirectly by modulating their immediate interstitial environment. Because either action would minimize central sensitization leading to reduced pain following tissue injury, the suppression of formalin-induced pain by NAGly may have relevance to postoperative and chronic pain states. Along with the ability of NAGly ability to suppress pain, a previous report showed that NAGABA has analgesic properties in mice, its potency being equivalent to that of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It also produces motor dysfunction in this species (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that NAGly, NAGABA, and NAAla are members of a family of N-arachidonyl amino acids in mammals that may have overlapping functions such as pain modulation. In addition to pain, this new group of compounds are likely to be active in other domains of physiology. This notion is supported by the wide distribution of NAGly in rat tissues. Among the tissues analyzed, relatively high levels of NAGly were present in the spinal cord, small intestine, kidneys, skin, and brain, whereas more modest levels were found in testes, lungs, and liver. The varying levels of NAGly in different organs likely indicate its involvement in additional physiological functions besides pain regulation. Furthermore, the dual effect NAGABA on pain and motor function (4Burstein S.H. Rossetti R.G. Yagen B. Zurier R.B. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 61: 29-41Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggests that the family of arachidonyl amino acids discovered here likely has relevance in multiple physiological systems. In summary, our results show that N-arachidonylglycine is present in mammals, synthesized in situ from arachidonic acid and glycine, and degraded by fatty acid amide hydrolase. Consistent with its high levels in skin and neural tissues, NAGly is capable of suppressing pain via a peripheral action, suggesting that it may serve endogenously to regulate pain. The identification of endogenous NAGly, NAGABA, and NAAla points to a new class of biomolecules that likely serve a variety of regulatory functions in brain and other tissues. We thank Dr. Wayne D.

Furthermore, it is possible that phosphorylation at Thr-668 of APP, which changes the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain, regulates the interaction between the cytoplasmic motifs of APP and APP binders. Therefore, we explored the effects of phosphorylation of Thr-668 on the interaction between APP and APP binders. In previous studies it has been shown that the682YENPTY687 motif of APP is essential for the basic interaction with Fe65 (30Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that this interaction is regulated by phosphorylation at Thr-668. Analysis by CD spectroscopy showed that the structure of the cytoplasmic peptide phosphorylated at Thr-668 differed from that of the nonphosphorylated peptide. Thus, phosphorylation of APP at Thr-668 is likely to alter the conformation of its cytoplasmic domain. Overexpression of Fe65 decreased the production of Aβ from APP; however, this effect was diminished when a mutation at Thr-668 was introduced. These observations suggest that APP metabolism is regulated by the neuron-specific phosphorylation of APP at Thr-668, which causes a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain. Anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-APP polyclonal antibody, UT-18, was raised against the cytoplasmic peptide [Cys]APP-(676–695) (15Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K. Isohara T. Nairn A.C. Kirino Y. Greengard P. Suzuki T.

A polyclonal phosphorylation state-specific antibody (pAbThr-668), UT-33, was raised against the phosphopeptide, APP-(665–673)-[Cys]PiThr-668, as described (15Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K.

The cytoplasmic peptides of APP-(648–695), with or without phosphate at the Thr-668 residue, and Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptides were synthesized using solid phase N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to greater than 90% purity, and their expected molecular weights were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The shorter cytoplasmic peptides, [Cys]APP-(665–673), either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated Thr-668, were synthesized at Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). Human cDNAs encoding Fe65, Fe65L, and Fe65L2 were isolated in a yeast two-hybrid assay using the cytoplasmic domain of APP as bait. Fe65 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(−)/mycHisA vector (CLONTECH). The cDNAs encoding the second PI (PI2) domains derived from Fe65 (amino acids 540–665 of GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number O00213), Fe65L1 (amino acids 548–684 of GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Q92870), and Fe65L2 (amino acids 287–417 of GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number O95704) and WW domains derived from Fe65 (amino acids 232–288 of GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number O00213) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce GST-fusion proteins. The cDNA encoding the PI domain of mDab1 was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using human brain total RNA (CLONTECH) and primers with the nucleotide sequences 5′-gcagtgaagccacttgataaagagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctaattcttctcttgcttcaattcat-3′ (reverse) (genome sequence, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession number NM021080).

Construction of pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695 encoding human APP695 tagged with a FLAG epitope inserted in the extracellular domain between [Ala-17]APP695 and [Leu-18]APP695 is described elsewhere (15Ando K.

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and whole-cell extracts were then prepared by lysing cells in lysis buffer (PBS containing 10 mm CHAPS, 5 µg/ml chymostatin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin A) for 1 h on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants containing APP695, APP695T668A, APP695T668E, APLP2–751 or APLP2–751T724A were used for in vitro pull-down assays. Purified GST-fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with the cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/150 mmNaCl/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 5 min, boiled in SDS sample buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol/3% (w/v) SDS/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/1.2 mm EDTA, 0.005% (w/v) bromo phenol blue, and 4m urea), and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were probed with the indicated antibodies in TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, and visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-Fe65myc/HisA encoding human Fe65 tagged with Myc and His epitopes at the carboxyl-terminal and either pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695, pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695T668A, or pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695T668E. The Ala and Glu substitutions at Thr-668 were introduced to produce pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695T668Aand -T668E (15Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K. Isohara T. Nairn A.C. Kirino Y. Greengard P. Suzuki T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The anti-Myc antibody was added to the supernatant, and the sample was incubated on ice for 2 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged. The beads were washed with TBST three times, and proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% (w/v) polyacrylamide) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunocomplexes were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette. The cytoplasmic peptides of APP-(648–695) with or without phosphate at the Thr-668 residue were dissolved at a concentration of 0.1 mmin 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing either 0% (v/v) or 47% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE). Each CD spectrum is an average of five scans with a 1.0-nm bandwidth, a time constant of 2 s, and a step resolution of 0.2 nm. The percentage of α-helicity was calculated as [θ]222/[θ]max × 100%, where [θ]max = −39500 (1–2.57/n) wheren is the number of residues in the peptide (32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase labeling of cells was carried out with [35S]methionine (1 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AGQ0080). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a combination of pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695 and pcDNA3.1-Fe65myc/HisA or pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695 and pcDNA3.1(−)myc/HisA. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were labeled metabolically in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with [35S] methionine excluding cold methionine for 15 min followed by a chase period as indicated. The chase was initiated by replacing the labeling medium with medium containing excess unlabeled methionine. APP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% (w/v) polyacrylamide). Radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing 25 µg/ml pepstatin, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, and 25 µg/ml chymostatin was used for cell lysis. sAPP, a large extracellular amino-terminal domain cleaved at α- and/or β-sites, was isolated from medium by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide). Radioactivity in APP and sAPP was analyzed using a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer and autoradiography. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a combination of pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695 and either pcDNA3.1-Fe65myc/HisA or pcDNA3.1(−)myc/HisA or a combination of pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695T668E and pcDNA3.1-Fe65myc/HisA or pcDNA3.1(−)myc/HisA. The cells were supplied with fresh growth medium 5 h after the start of transfection, and conditioned medium from cells (∼2 × 106 cells) was collected 48 h after the medium change. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using three types of Aβ-specific monoclonal antibodies (33Tomita S. Fujita T. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The motif,667VTPEER672 (numbering for APP695 isoform), of APP is thought to be important for the regulation of function and metabolism of the protein (11Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.R. Czernik A.J.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr-668 in this motif is believed to regulate the function of the667VTPEER672 motif via alteration of the three-dimensional structure of the cytoplasmic domain of APP (29Ramelot T.A. Gentile L.N. Nicholson L.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2714-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Many known APP binders such as the Fe65 family, X11, X11L, and mDab1 recognize the 682YENPTY687 motif, which lies in the cytoplasmic domain of APP. However, in the case of Fe65, effective binding to APP requires a larger motif that consists of the682YENPTY687 sequence plus several extra amino acids that extend toward the amino terminus (35Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined whether the phosphorylation site, Thr-668, of APP is involved in the binding of Fe65. It has been reported that PI2 of Fe65, but not PI1 or the WW domain (WW), interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (35Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). GST-fusion proteins consisting of the PI2 or WW domains of Fe65 were used in pull-down assays with the wild-type form of APP695 or forms that contained amino acid mutations at Thr-668 (Fig.1a). Glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST-fusion proteins were incubated with the lysate of COS7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAGAPP695 carrying alanine or glutamic acid substitutions for Thr-668 of APP695 or with wild-type APP695. Wild-type (T) APP bound to the PI2 domain of Fe65 (Fe65PI2) strongly, but the binding of the Ala-668 (A) and Glu-668 (E) mutants of APP to Fe65PI2 was weak even though these lysates contained the same amount of expressed APP. APP did not interact with the WW domain of Fe65 (Fe65ww) or the GST protein alone (GST) as was expected. It is well known that the other Fe65 family proteins, Fe65L1 and Fe65L2, as well as other proteins including mDab1 and X11L also interact with the 682YENPTY687 motif of APP. Thus we examined whether the Thr-668 residue of APP was involved in the interaction of this protein with the PI domains derived from these APP binders. GST-fusion proteins consisting of the PI2 domain from Fe65L1 (Fe65L1PI2) and Fe65L2 (Fe65L2PI2) and the PI domains derived from mDab1 (mDab1PI) and X11L (X11LPI) were examined for binding activity to APP695 (Fig. 1 b). As observed for Fe65, Fe65L1PI2 and Fe65L2PI2 bound to wild-type APP (T), and substitution of Thr-668 with Ala (A) or Glu (E) in APP restricted this binding. We concluded that binding of PI2 of all member of the Fe65 family to APP was decreased by mutation at Thr-668. mDab1PI and X11LPI bound to APP regardless of the presence of a mutation at Thr-668. The importance of the Thr-668 residue of APP on the interaction with Fe65 was confirmed in vivo using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Full-length Fe65 protein tagged with Myc/His sequences (Fe65-myc/His) and APP695 tagged with a FLAG sequence (FLAG-APP695) were expressed transiently in HEK293 cells. The detergent-soluble fraction of these cell lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG (Fig. 2) or anti-Myc (data not shown) antibodies. A large quantity of wild-type APP (T) was recovered in association with Fe65. However, comparatively small quantities of APP carrying Ala (A) and Glu (E) substitutions for Thr-668 were co-immunoprecipitated with Fe65 even though the amount of APP expressed was identical between experiments. Furthermore, APP was not co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody when only APP (− in Fe65-myc) or Fe65myc/His (− in APP) were expressed. These results demonstrate that the stable binding of Fe65 family members to APP requires the presence of Thr-668 of APP695. Other APP binders such as X11L and mDab1 did not need Thr-668 to be present for stable binding to APP. APP is a member of the APP family of proteins, which consists also of APLP1 and APLP2 (2Wasco W.

We have demonstrated previously that the phosphorylation site corresponding to Thr-668 of APP695 is conserved in the cytoplasmic domain of APLP2 as Thr-736 (numbering for APLP2–763 isoform) but not in the cytoplasmic domain of APLP1 (31Suzuki T. Ando K. Isohara T. Oishi M. Lim G.S. Satoh Y. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Gandy S.E. Kirino Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In neurons, Thr-736 of APLP2 is phosphorylated in an identical manner to that of Thr-668 in APP. 2K. Iijima, K. Ando, and T. Suzuki, manuscript in preparation. In addition, the YENPTY motif is also conserved in APLP2. Therefore, we examined the influence of Thr-736 on the binding of Fe65 to APLP2 (Fig.3). Glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST-fusion proteins consisting of Fe65PI2 were incubated with lysate from cells transiently expressing wild-type APLP2 (T) or mutant APLP2 containing an alanine (A) substitution for Thr-724 (the position at Thr-724 of APLP2–751 corresponds to Thr-736 of APLP2–763). Wild-type APLP2 bound to Fe65PI2, but the substitution of Ala for Thr-724 of APLP2 interfered with binding. Both wild-type and mutated protein bound to mDab1PI and did not bind to GST beads alone (GST). We concluded that no significant difference was detected between wild-type and mutated APLP2 in the binding to mDab1PI. The result suggests that regulation of the interaction of APLP2 with Fe65 is similar to that for APP and Fe65 in that it is mediated by the phosphorylation of the corresponding threonine in the cytoplasmic domains. Mutagenesis studies of APP695 indicated that the presence of Thr-668 allowed stable interaction of Fe65 with the cytoplasmic domain of APP and also suggested the possibility that phosphorylation at this site regulated the interaction of Fe65 with the682YENPTY687 motif. To demonstrate this possibility, a competition assay studying the interaction of APP with Fe65 was performed using APP cytoplasmic domain peptides with or without phosphate at the Thr-668 residue as competitors (Fig.4). Glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST-fusion proteins consisting of Fe65PI2 were incubated with the APP cytoplasmic domain peptide, APP-(648–695), or the phospho-Thr-668 peptide, [pThr-668]APP-(648–695), prior to incubation with lysate derived from COS7 cells, which expressed FLAG-APP695 transiently. After washing the beads, the amount of APP that had bound to the beads was determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.4 a), and the interaction of APP with Fe65PI2 was qu"

Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, and two proteins that bind to it, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 binding protein 1 and 2 (TAB1 and TAB2), have recently been implicated in IL-1 signaling (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

TAB2 is membrane-bound in untreated cells but translocates to the cytosol upon stimulation with IL-1, where it functions as an adaptor, linking TRAF6 to TAK1 and TAB1, thereby activating TAK1 (19Takaesu G.

Some investigators (20Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) have suggested that activated TAK1 triggers the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IκB kinase cascade, leading to NFκB activation. More recently, studies on NIK-deficient mice have revealed that NIK is required for lymphotoxin-β signaling but is dispensable for IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling (21Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H.

In light of these contrasting results, it remains an open question whether a NIK-like molecule (not NIK itself) is involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. Activated IκB kinase phosphorylates the inhibitory IκB proteins, which are then degraded, releasing NFκB, which translocates to the nucleus, where it activates transcription (23DiDonato J.A.

Activated TAK1 has also been implicated in the IL-1-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and other mitogen-activated protein kinases (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), leading to the phosphorylation and activation of activating transcription factor and activating protein 1, thereby also activating transcription. By taking a genetic approach to study IL-1 signaling pathways, we used random mutagenesis to generate IL-1-unresponsive cell lines lacking specific components of the pathways, and we have isolated the mutant cell line I1A, which lacks both IRAK protein and mRNA (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). IRAK is a multidomain protein (12Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 17Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal death domain (DD, residues 1–103), followed by a domain of unknown function (UD, residues 104–198), a kinase domain (KD, residues 199–522), and a two-part C-terminal domain, also of unknown function (residues 523–618 for C1 and residues 619–712 for C2). IRAK-deficient I1A cells have been used effectively to study the function of IRAK in IL-1-dependent signaling (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Neither NFκB nor JNK is activated in IL-1-treated I1A cells, but these responses are restored in I1A-IRAK cells, indicating that IRAK is required for both. To address the role of the kinase activity of IRAK, its ATP-binding site was mutated (K239A) or the entire kinase domain was deleted (dKD). IRAK-K239A and IRAK-dKD complemented all defects in IL-1-dependent signaling in mutant I1A cells, indicating that the kinase activity of IRAK is not required for these functions (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). K239A and dKD were still phosphorylated in I1A cells upon IL-1 stimulation, showing that IRAK must become phosphorylated by another kinase. Analysis of other IRAK deletion mutants showed that both the DD and C1C2 domains of IRAK are required for both NFκB and JNK activation but that the UD domain was necessary only for NFκB, not JNK, activation (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-1-induced phosphorylation of IRAK is required to activate NFκB but not JNK (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the IL-1-induced signaling pathways leading to NFκB and JNK activation diverge at or upstream of IRAK. It is clear that IRAK plays a critical role in IL-1 signaling. We now address the mechanisms of the IRAK-mediated activation of the downstream signaling proteins TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. Previous studies with IRAK-deficient I1A cells have revealed that IRAK is required for the activation of TAK1, the translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol upon IL-1 stimulation, and the formation of a TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 complex (34Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here, we report that stimulation with IL-1 also leads to the translocation of TRAF6 from the membrane to the cytosol and that this process requires IRAK. We have identified the domains of IRAK required for the translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6, and we propose that IRAK mediates those events separately through protein-protein interactions that are modulated by phosphorylation. Recombinant human IL-1β was provided by the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Antibodies against IRAK and TRAF6 were a kind gift from Dr. Zhaodan Cao (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). Anti-ubiquitin antibody was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). 293-TK/Zeo and I1A cells (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).N-Acetyl-leucine-leucine-methionine (ALLM) was obtained from Calbiochem. IRAK deletion fragments, generated by polymerase chain reaction using IRAK-K239A as a template, were cloned into an expression vector (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) driven by the thymidine kinase gene promoter. For stable transfections, 2 × 105 cells seeded onto a 10-cm plate were co-transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of each expression vector and 1 μg of pBabePuro. After 48 h, the cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin until clones appeared. Cells at 70% confluence, untreated or treated with IL-1 (100 IU/ml) for various times, were resuspended in 10 packed cell volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized on ice with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Unlysed cells, nuclei, and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min. Soluble (supernatant, S100) and particulate (pellet, P100) fractions were generated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot transfers were analyzed with different antibodies. Membrane fractions used for immunoprecipitation experiments were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μmaprotinin. Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μl of anti-IRAK or anti-TRAF6 polyclonal antibody (from Zhaodan Cao, Tularik, South San Francisco, CA) or preimmune serum for 4 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with 50 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads (pre-washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, followed by Western analysis with anti-IRAK or anti-TRAF6 antibodies. It has been reported that IL-1 stimulates translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol, where it mediates the IL-1-dependent association of TAK1 with TRAF6 (19Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We found that TRAF6 also translocates from the membrane to the cytosol upon IL-1 stimulation. To examine the subcellular distribution of the IL-1 signaling proteins, wild-type 293 cells, untreated or treated with IL-1, were fractionated into membranes and cytosol, which were then analyzed with antibodies against IRAK, TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. The IL-1 receptor and α-tubulin were used as markers for the membrane and cytosol fractions, respectively. Whereas unmodified IRAK was found in both membrane and cytosol fractions before IL-1 treatment, the phosphorylated and ubiquitinated IRAK induced by stimulation with IL-1 was found only in the membrane fraction (Fig.1 A). The IL-1-induced phosphorylation of IRAK was confirmed by [32P]orthophosphate labeling of the wild-type 293 cells untreated or treated with IL-1, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-IRAK antibody and analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Since the IRAK deletion mutant dUD, lacking the N-proximal undetermined region, is not phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation, IRAK-deficient I1A cells transfected with dUD were used as a negative control (Fig.1 B). To confirm that IRAK is ubiquitinated upon IL-1 stimulation, cell extracts from 293 cells untreated or treated with IL-1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK antibody followed by Western analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 A, IRAK gradually disappeared from the cytosol fraction after stimulation with IL-1; this change probably resulted from the signal-induced modification of IRAK and its membrane localization after being modified. The modified IRAK in the membrane fraction was eventually degraded 6 h after stimulation. 2Z. Jiang, Y. Qian, and X. Li, unpublished data. TAB2 and TRAF6, mostly in the membrane fraction in untreated cells, translocated to the cytosol upon stimulation with IL-1 (Fig. 1 A). The Scion Image 1.62C program was used to quantitate the amount of TRAF6 and TAB2 in the cytosol before and after IL-1 stimulation. From the averages of five experiments, we observed a 5.6-fold increase in TRAF6 and an 8.5-fold increase in TAB2 in the cytosol 30 min after treatment with IL-1. TAK1 and TAB1, on the other hand, were found mostly in the cytosol before and after stimulation (Fig. 1 A). By using I1A cells, IRAK was shown to be required for the translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol (34Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As shown above, IL-1 also induced the translocation of TRAF6, and similar to findings with TAB2, the TRAF6 translocation was abolished in I1A cells (Fig. 2). Overexpression of wild-type IRAK or IRAK-K239A in I1A cells resulted in some constitutive TRAF6 translocation. Stimulation with IL-1 induced this translocation further (Figs. 2 and3), indicating that the kinase activity of IRAK is not important for the translocation of TRAF6.Figure 3Domains of IRAK required for the IL-1-induced translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from untreated or IL-1-treated (100 IU/ml) I1A cells transfected with IRAK-K239A or IRAK deletion mutants. These fractions were probed with antibodies against TRAF6 and TAB2 after Western blot transfer. This experiment was repeated three times with consistent results. P100, particulate fraction; S100, soluble fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify which domains of IRAK are required for the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2, we studied the subcellular distribution of these proteins in I1A cells transfected with IRAK deletion constructs. Previous studies (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of wild-type IRAK in transfected I1A cells leads to its autophosphorylation, whereas IRAK-K239A is only phosphorylated upon stimulation. The deletion mutant lacking the kinase domain behaved like IRAK-K239A in mediating the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2 (data not shown). To avoid possible complications from autophosphorylation, the other IRAK deletion constructs were generated from IRAK-K239A. Deletion of DD or C1C2 abolished the ability of IRAK to mediate both the IL-1-induced translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2; deletion of UD was only that of TRAF6 (Fig. 3). The IL-1-induced translocation of TAB2 was not affected in I1A-dUD cells (Fig. 3). These results show that different regions of IRAK are required for the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2, suggesting that IRAK mediates their translocation by separate paths. How does IRAK mediate the translocation of TRAF6? Upon stimulation with IL-1, IRAK was phosphorylated and the modified IRAK was found only in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1). TRAF6 was found mostly in the membrane fraction before stimulation and was translocated to the cytosol after IL-1 treatment. Furthermore, previous studies (13Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) have shown that IRAK interacts with TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylated IRAK, induced by IL-1-stimulation, interacts with TRAF6 at the membrane to facilitate the translocation of TRAF6 to the cytosol, where TRAF6 interacts with downstream proteins. To test this model, membrane fractions prepared from wild-type cells untreated or treated with IL-1 were resuspended in lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK, and probed with anti-TRAF6 or vice versa. An IRAK-TRAF6 complex was indeed formed in these membrane fractions after IL-1 stimulation (Fig.4 A). Cytosolic fractions were also obtained from wild-type cells untreated or treated with IL-1. Anti-TRAF6 was used to immunoprecipitate these cytosolic fractions, which were analyzed with antibodies against TAB2, TAK1, TAB1, and IRAK after Western blot transfer. TRAF6 formed a complex with TAB2, TAK1, and TAB1 in the IL-1-treated cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4 B). IRAK was not detected in the cytosol, indicating that the IRAK-TRAF6 complex dissociates before TRAF6 is translocated. The majority of the IRAK-TRAF6 complex was dissociated at 10 min after IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 4 A), which correlates with the time of translocation of TRAF6 to the cytosol (Fig. 1 A) and formation of the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the cytosol (Fig. 4 B). We then examined whether the IL-1-induced degradation of IRAK plays a role in the dissociation of the IRAK-TRAF6 complex and the subsequent translocation of TRAF6 to the cytosol. Wild-type 293 cells were treated with IL-1 for various times (10 min to 4 h) with or without the presence of protease inhibitor ALLM, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-IRAK antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, ALLM inhibited the IL-1-induced degradation of IRAK. However, the inhibition of IRAK degradation had no effect on the IL-1-induced formation or dissociation of the IRAK-TRAF6 complex (data not shown). Likewise, treatment with ALLM did not affect the IL-1-induced IRAK-mediated translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6 (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the release of TRAF6 and TAB2 from IRAK is probably not through the degradation of IRAK. Stimulation with IL-1 leads to the activation of TAK1 (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) and to the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 (19Takaesu G. Kishida S.

Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The activation of TAK1 leads to the autophosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1, but a protein kinase that functions upstream of TAK1 is required for the phosphorylation of TAB2 (19Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced activation of TAK1 (34Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the additional role of IRAK in the IL-1-induced activation of TAK1 and phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. The IL-1-induced TAK1 kinase activity was abolished in IRAK-null I1A cells (Fig. 6 A). Although TAK1 was constitutively activated in I1A cells transfected with wild-type IRAK, it was only activated upon stimulation in I1A cells transfected with the IRAK kinase-dead mutant (K293A). Western blot analysis revealed that the TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 proteins from wild-type cells migrated more slowly in SDS-PAGE when cells were treated with IL-1, indicating that they are phosphorylated (Fig. 6 B) (19Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 35Kishimito K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The IL-1-induced phosphorylation of these proteins was abolished in IRAK-null I1A cells (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, whereas TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 were phosphorylated constitutively in I1A cells transfected with wild-type IRAK, they were also phosphorylated in I1A cells transfected with the kinase-dead K239A upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 6 B). These results show that, although IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced activation of TAK1 and phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, the kinase activity of IRAK is not required for these events. Therefore, IRAK is not the kinase that phosphorylates TAB2. We then investigated the cause for the constitutive activation of TAK1 and phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in I1A-IRAK cells. IRAK was constitutively autophosphorylated in I1A-IRAK cells, whereas IRAK-K239A was only phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 6 B). The phosphorylated forms of IRAK were confirmed by both [32P]orthophosphate labeling (Fig. 1 B) and treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (14Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IRAK in I1A-IRAK cells was capable of forming a constitutive complex with TRAF6, whereas IRAK-K239A only formed a complex with TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 7). Therefore, it is possible that the phosphorylated IRAK is responsible for the constitutive phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in I1A-IRAK cells through its interaction with TRAF6, thereby activating downstream signaling events. We examined the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in I1A cells transfected with different IRAK deletion constructs. Since the expression of wild-type IRAK in I1A cells leads to the constitutive phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, deletion constructs derived from the IRAK-K239A mutant were used. When we tested for IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in the transfected I1A cells, we found that deletion of the DD, UD, or C1C2 regions completely abolished it, whereas deletion of the kinase domain of IRAK had no effect (Fig. 8). Therefore, although the kinase domain of IRAK is dispensable, both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are required for the activation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. This conclusion was supported further by results obtained with the truncated protein DD + UD + C1, in which the N-terminal domains (DD and UD) were fused with a part of the C-terminal region (C1). DD + UD + C1 behaved like full-length IRAK-K239A in conferring IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in transfected I1A cells (Fig. 8). As summarized in Fig. 9, the IRAK deletion mutants that confer IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in transfected I1A cells are themselves phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 8) and form a signal-dependent complex with TRAF6 (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), confirming the correlation between IRAK phosphorylation and phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. Fig. 9also shows that the domains of IRAK (DD, UD, and C1C2) that are required for the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 are also necessary for the IL-1-induced activation of NFκB (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), indicating that the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 correlates with NFκB activation. However, the deletion mutant dUD, which fails to activate NFκB, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, still activates JNK (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9), implying that the activation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 is not necessary for the IL-1-induced activation of JNK.

Phosphorylated IRAK then dissociates from the receptor, followed by its interaction with TRAF6 to activate the downstream signaling components. As summarized in Fig.10, we report here that phosphorylated IRAK, induced by IL-1 treatment, stays at the membrane, where it forms a complex with TRAF6; TRAF6 then dissociates and translocates to the cytosol to form a complex with TAK1-TAB1-TAB2. Previous studies (34Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have indicated that IRAK also mediates the IL-1-induced translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol. We found that different regions of IRAK are required for the translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6, suggesting that IRAK mediates these two events separately. The domains of IRAK required for the IL-1-induced translocation of TRAF6 are the same as those necessary for the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 and activation of NFκB (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9), revealing a tight correlation between the translocation of TRAF6 and the activation of downstream signaling. It is likely that both TAB2 and TRAF6 need to be translocated to the cytosol for the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex to form and for these proteins to be activated. Furthermore, our studies show that the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 correlates tightly with IL-1-induced NFκB activation but is not necessary for JNK activation. We propose that IRAK mediates the IL-1-induced translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2, which leads to the formation of the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the cytosol, the activation of TAK1, and the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, resulting eventually in IL-1-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 10). At present, it is still not clear exactly how IRAK mediates the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2. The translocation is likely to occur through the interaction of IRAK with and dissociation from these two proteins. The phosphorylation of IRAK seems to play an important role in its interaction with them. In wild-type cells, both TAB2 and TRAF6 interact with phosphorylated IRAK upon IL-1 stimulation (12Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 32Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the autophosphorylation of IRAK in untreated I1A-IRAK cells leads to its constitutive interaction with TRAF6 (Fig. 7). Therefore, it is possible that TRAF6 forms a transient complex with phosphorylated IRAK at the membrane upon stimulation. Through its interaction with IRAK, TRAF6 may undergo a conformational change, leading to its dissociation from IRAK, translocation to the cytosol, and formation of the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Further modification of IRAK or TRAF6 might be required for the conformational change of the TRAF6-IRAK complex and the dissociation of TRAF6 from IRAK. We tested whether IL-1-induced IRAK degradation plays any role in the release of TRAF6 and TAB2 to the cytosol. We found that ALLM inhibited IRAK degradation, but it did not affect the dissociation of TRAF6 from IRAK nor the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2 to the cytosol. Therefore, the IL-1-induced and IRAK-mediated translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2 probably does not occur through the degradation of IRAK. We have identified which domains of IRAK are required for the IL-1-induced translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6. The N-terminal (DD) and C-terminal domains (C1C2) of IRAK are required for both TAB2 and TRAF6 translocation. However, the N-proximal undetermined domain (UD) is required for TRAF6, but not TAB2, translocation (Fig. 3). These results suggest that IRAK mediates the translocation of TRAF6 and TAB2 separately. As proposed in our model (Fig. 10), IRAK might interact with TAB2 and TRAF6 simultaneously through its different domains to form a TAB2-IRAK-TRAF6 complex at the membrane, which would subsequently allow their independent disassociation from IRAK and separate translocation to the cytosol. Alternatively, IRAK might form distinct complexes with TAB2 and TRAF6, thereby mediating their translocation individually. TAK1 and TAB1 were localized primarily in the cytosol with or without stimulation, but small fractions of TAK1 and TAB1 were also detected in the membrane (Fig. 1 A). Although the TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 4 B), we could not exclude the possibility that this complex first forms at the membrane with IRAK and then dissociates from IRAK and translocates to the cytosol. Previous studies (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) have shown that the overexpression of TAK1 led to the activation of both NFκB and JNK. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of TAK1 blocked the IL-1-induced activation of both NFκB and JNK (18Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it was concluded that TAK1 is required for both IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation. We found that the domains of IRAK required for the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 are also required for the IL-1-induced activation of NFκB (15, Fig. 9), indicating a tight correlation between the phosphorylation of these three molecules and NFκB activation. However, the deletion mutant dUD, which failed to activate NFκB and to support the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2, still permitted IL-1-induced JNK activation in transfected I1A cells (15, Fig. 9), suggesting that the activation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 is not necessary for the IL-1-induced activation of JNK. Supporting this conclusion, we have recently found (15Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of IRAK correlates strongly with the activation of NFκB but is not necessary for the activation of JNK. Therefore, the IL-1 signaling pathways leading to NFκB and JNK activation bifurcate at or upstream of IRAK and upstream of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. Our results suggest that the IRAK-mediated activation of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 is required for the IL-1-induced activation of NFκB but not of JNK. Analysis of tak1, tab1, and tab2 gene knock-out mice and cell lines derived from them will further elucidate the roles of these proteins in the IL-1 signaling pathway.

CTGF was initially identified in and subsequently purified from human umbilical vein endothelial cells conditioned media (1Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated the strong induction of CTGF expression by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and the promoter region of the CTGF gene contains a unique TGF-β response element not shared by other members of the CCN family (2Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). In an anchorage-independent growth assay of TGF-β, neutralization of CTGF activity with antibodies or inhibition of CTGF expression with antisense oligonucleotides reduced the ability of the cells to form colonies (3Kothapalli D. Frazier K.S. Welply A. Segarini P.R. Grotendorst G.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CTGF is a necessary part of the cascade for induction of anchorage-independent growth.

Co-administration of CTGF with TGF-β produced a persistent fibrotic reaction that lasted for 14 days, but had resolved and was absent by 7 days in animals treated with TGF-β alone (19Mori T.

The emerging understanding that CTGF is actively involved in the induction and/or maintenance of persistent fibrosis has provided a target for the modulation of matrix overproduction in fibrotic disease.The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/α2-macroglobulin receptor (α2MR) (hereto referred to as LRP), is a member of the family of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (30Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar). The LDL receptor family includes two subfamilies: one containing “small” receptor members of ∼120 kDa, including the LDL receptor (LDLR), apoE receptor-2 (apoE-R2), and very low density lipoprotein receptor; and one containing “large” receptor members of ∼600 kDa, including LRP, epithelial glycoprotein 330/megalin, and a related protein, sorLA. LDL family receptors bind multiple ligands. At least two of these protein ligands, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and a 39-kDa receptor-associatedprotein (RAP), bind to all LDL receptor family members (30Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar). A number of functionally and structurally distinct ligands bind LRP and the diversity of these ligands suggests that it may function in a variety of distinct physiological processes, such as lipoprotein metabolism, protease regulation, tissue repair and remodeling, and embryonic development (reviewed in Ref. 30Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar).Here we have further characterized the major CTGF-binding protein. This protein was affinity purified and identified as LRP. Competitive inhibition of CTGF binding using other LRP ligands and immunoprecipitation of CTGF receptor complexes with LRP antibodies has confirmed that LRP is a receptor for CTGF. Additionally, this report shows that CTGF is rapidly internalized and degraded by cells through an LRP-dependent pathway. This is the first identification of direct interaction of a growth factor with LRP. Our findings suggest that LRP has a regulatory role in the biology of CTGF.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have presented evidence that the major cell membrane protein to which CTGF binds is a highMr protein, identified previously as LRP. This study provides the first report of a growth factor that binds directly to LRP, although recently the Wnt family of secreted molecules has been demonstrated to bind to other members of the LRP family (39Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Previous suggestion of growth factor interaction with LRP has been through complexes with α2M as a clearance molecule (40LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar).We were unable to obtain sequence information for two lowerMr proteins that were occasionally affinity co-purified with LRP (estimated Mr of 150,000 and 200,000). These proteins were not detected in the cross-linking/binding assay. CTGF, and the structurally related protein, Cyr61, bind to a number of integrins, including αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and α6β1 (41Chen N.

Recently it has been demonstrated that CTGF-dependent cell adhesion induces cell signaling through integrin-mediated pathways (42Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While the identity of the co-purifying bands is unclear, the Mrestimates are suggestive for some of the integrin subunits. The possibility exists that these bands represented breakdown products of the large LRP protein. Further purification and analysis will be necessary for unambiguous sequence identity of these proteins.Our data indicate that at least part of the CTGF-binding site on LRP is similar or common to the binding site utilized for many of the LRP ligands, as these ligands competed for CTGF binding, although with lower affinity (Fig. 2). LRP contains multiple copies of cysteine-rich repeats known as LDLR class A repeats (complement-type repeats) arranged in 4 clusters, forming ligand-binding sites (45Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is synthesized as a single chain zymogen, pro-urokinase, and binds LRP with a Kd of 45 nm; the active two-chain enzyme (tc-uPA) binds LRP with a Kd of 60 nm. Complex formation with plasminogen activator inhibitor type I increases the affinity of uPA to LRP, such that the uPA/plasminogen activator inhibitor type I complex binds LRP with aKd of 1–3 nm (56Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Kasza A. Petersen H.H. Heegaard C.W. Oka K. Christensen A. Dubin A. Chan L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Many LRP ligands are polyanionic proteins that bind heparin, suggesting that their binding to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycan may be required for interaction with LRP (58Crisp R.J. Knauer D.J. Knauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19628-19637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). heparin sulfate proteoglycan may serve to concentrate the ligands at the cell surface, promoting binding with the relatively low affinity interaction with LRP. The observed Kd for CTGF binding to LRP is 0.5–1 nm,2 which is a much higher binding affinity than reported for other LRP ligands. In Nesbitt et al.,2 we showed that, while CTGF is a heparin-binding protein, CTGF is capable of binding to the surface of cells depleted of GAGs. Perhaps the higher affinity of CTGF for LRP obviates concentration of CTGF on the cell surface by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Nevertheless, the significance of the high affinity binding of CTGF to LRP is unclear at this time, but suggests an important role for LRP in CTGF biology.Experiments aimed at creating mice lacking LRP by genetic deletion of the LRP allele failed to produce viable embryos (59Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for LRP during early development. CTGF is highly expressed in uterine epithelium and in decidualizing endometrial stromal cells during early pregnancy, as well as in embryonic ectoderm, endoderm, and at the ectoplacental cone after implantation (13Surveyor G.A. Wilson A.K. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). LRP is localized to invading trophoblastic cells, in decidualizing tissue, and at the ectoplacental cone after implantation (61Teesalu T. Blasi F. Talarico D. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 62Coukos G. Gåfvels M.E. Wisel S. Ruelaz E.A. Strickland D.K. Strauss J.F.R. Coutifaris C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 383-392PubMed Google Scholar). The similar developmental localization patterns support possible interaction between CTGF and LRP during embryonic development.We have demonstrated that CTGF is rapidly internalized and degraded by cells, and that this represents an LRP-mediated process. We have experienced a rapid disappearance of CTGF from culture medium after addition of CTGF to cell cultures. A rapid internalization and degradation pathway would account for the inability to detect CTGF in conditioned medium. We suggest that one function of LRP in CTGF biology is to modulate the concentration of free CTGF in the extracellular space or at the cell surface.Whether or not LRP serves as a signaling receptor for CTGF bioactivity remains to be determined. LRP binds and internalizes numerous ligands that would necessitate separate ligand-specific signaling mechanisms; yet, signaling involving LRP has been suggested in at least some systems. Most recently, signaling by the Wnt family of proteins requires the LRP-5 or LRP-6 members of the LRP family to function as co-receptors with the Frizzled family of receptors (39Tamai K. Semenov M.

DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activation with activated α2M promotes calcium influx in neuronal cells (66Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q.

Other members of the LDLR family have recently been demonstrated to transduce extracellular signals. For instance, very low density lipoprotein receptor and apoE-R2 function as receptors in the Reelin/disabled-mediated neuronal migration pathway (67Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W.

The short cytoplasmic domain of LRP contains multiple potential endocytosis motifs including 2 NPXY motifs; but, a recent study demonstrated that a YXXL motif serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis (71Li Y.

Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Another member of this family, mDab2/p96/DOC-2, has ∼50% sequence conservation with the amino-terminal sequence of mDab1, but is expressed in a wider variety of cells (75Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Dab2/p96/DOC-2 has been shown to compete with SOS to bind Grb2, suggesting a negative regulatory role in the Ras signaling cascade (76Xu X.X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and may negatively regulate mitogenesis (77Fulop V. Colitti C.V. Genest D. Berkowitz R.S. Yiu G.K. Ng S.W. Szepesi J. Mok S.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether Dab2/p96/DOC-2 or an unidentified member of the Dab family binds to LRP remains unknown and is of much interest to investigate.We have been unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP in cells treated with CTGF (data not shown). In addition, we have examined LRP purified by CTGF affinity chromatography in kinase assays. Although an associated kinase activity toward casein co-purified with LRP, this kinase activity was found not from LRP itself, but rather from an associating protein. Most importantly, the kinase activity did not respond to CTGF stimulation. 3D. Li, unpublished observations. Therefore it remains unclear whether LRP phosphorylation plays any role in mediating biological functions of CTGF.LRP and many of its ligands have been localized to the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (78Rebeck G.W.

There is an increase in LRP expression in monocytes from patients with coronary heart disease (83Handschug K. Schulz S. Schnurer C. Köhler S. Wenzel K. Teichmann W. Gläser C. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and LRP is abundantly expressed by smooth muscles cells and macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions (84Luoma J. Hiltunen T.

In the renal ablation model of experimental kidney fibrosis, LRP expression is significantly increased in the glomeruli and interstitium with preferential localization to fibrotic lesions (60van Goor H. Diamond J.R. Ding G. Kaysen G. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). While to date CTGF has not been documented in Alzheimer's lesions, it is highly expressed in fibrotic kidney disease (22Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and atherosclerotic plaques (24Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.M. Do D.D. Godoy N. Nauck M. Marz W. Rupp J. Pech M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). With co-localization of CTGF and LRP in these diseases, it will be important to understand the functional role of the high affinity interaction of these proteins.It will be of interest to examine whether altered LRP expression is a general marker of disease characterized by impaired wound healing or in fibroproliferative disorders. Future work examining the role of LRP in CTGF signaling by itself or as a co-receptor to a yet unidentified CTGF receptor, and the effect of the modulation of LRP on CTGF activity will be important studies to probe the biology of CTGF and for the design of therapeutics for intervention in fibrotic disease. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)1(Mr ∼38,000 Da), is a member of the CCN family of growth factors, which is characterized by the presence and conserved spacing of some 38 cysteine residues. CTGF was initially identified in and subsequently purified from human umbilical vein endothelial cells conditioned media (1Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated the strong induction of CTGF expression by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and the promoter region of the CTGF gene contains a unique TGF-β response element not shared by other members of the CCN family (2Grotendorst G.R.

https://openalex.org/W2075496544,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-kinase) modulates many metabolic processes in response to fluctuations in cellular energy status. Although most of its known targets are metabolic enzymes, it has been proposed that AMP-kinase might also regulate gene expression. Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional coactivator p300 is a substrate of AMP-kinase. Phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 by AMP-kinase dramatically reduced its interaction, in vitro and in vivo, with the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, thyroid receptor, retinoic acid receptor, and retinoid X receptor, but did not affect its interaction with the non-nuclear receptor transcription factors E1a, p53, or GATA4. These findings indicate that the AMP-kinase signaling pathway selectively modulates a subset of p300 activities and represent the first example of a transcriptional component regulated by AMP-kinase.

Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). AMP levels rise during states of low energy charge (i.e. reduced ATP/AMP ratios) that occur in a variety of normal processes like exercise and possibly also in some pathological states such as diabetes. Activated AMP-kinase phosphorylates key enzymes in both biosynthetic and oxidative pathways and differentially modulates their activities to promote a reestablishment of normal ATP/AMP ratios. In addition, AMP-kinase regulates key enzymes in lipid and glucose metabolism and has been proposed to play a role in glucose homeostasis (2Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that AMP-kinase might also play a direct role in the regulation of gene expression. This possibility is supported by the observation that the yeast homologue of AMP-kinase, the SNF1 complex, mediates the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 3Hardie D.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). However, no component of the mammalian transcriptional machinery has yet been identified as a target of AMP-kinase. In searching for potential AMP-kinase substrates among transcriptional components, we initially considered the possibility that the PPAR family of nuclear receptor transcription factors might be regulated by this signaling pathway. The PPARs modulate the expression of genes involved in many of the same metabolic pathways that are regulated by AMP-kinase. For example, PPARα regulates genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, while PPARγ is clearly involved in glucose homeostasis (4Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 5Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). These potentially overlapping roles of PPARs and AMP-kinase in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism initially prompted us to ask if these transcription factors or their cofactors might be targets for regulation by AMP-kinase. Here we report that p300, a transcriptional coactivator that mediates the activity of many nuclear receptors including the PPARs, is a substrate of AMP-kinase in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of p300 on serine 89 selectively blocks its interaction with nuclear receptors. Np300 contains a fragment of the human p300 cDNA encoding amino acids 1–408 inserted into the expression vector pET28b(+). It produces a fusion protein with N-terminal His and T7 tags. S89A, T371A, and S395A mutants were generated from Np300 using QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Inc.) according to the manufacturer and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterially expressed recombinant wild-type and mutant Np300 proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc.). In vitrophosphorylation reactions were carried out with 100 milliunits of AMP-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) and ∼0.1 µg of Np300 protein. Reactions contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 µm ATP, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and a mixture providing 2 µm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 0.2 µm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 2 µmR24571 (Upstate Biotechnology). Kinase reactions contained 300 µm AMP as indicated and were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and then the products were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography and Western analysis. Transient transfections forin vivo labeling and for mammalian two-hybrid transcription assays were carried out in BHK-21 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections used forin vivo labeling reactions were carried out in 100-mm dishes, which were split into two 60-mm plates 16 h post-transfection. Five micrograms of either wild-type or S89A mutant Np300/pcDNA3.1/Myc·His was used for transfection of cells on each 100-mm dish. Labeling was carried out with 1 mCi (37 MBq) of [32P]orthophosphate per dish for 1 h 40–48 h after transfection. Transfections used in mammalian two-hybrid transcription experiments were carried out at a density of 5.5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well dish. Each transfection contained a reporter plasmid pG5luc (100 ng), CMVβ-galactosidase (0.1 ng), to monitor transfection efficiency, mouse PPARγ/VP16 (0–100 ng), and 100 ng of either wild-type, S89A, or S89D p300/GAL4 constructions. Transfections were carried out in triplicate. Cells were treated with vehicle or rosiglitazone (20 µm for 24 h) and harvested using lysis buffer from Promega Inc. (Madison, WI). Cell lysates were analyzed with Tropix Dual Light luciferase and β-galactosidase assay kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) using an EG&G Berthold Microlumat 96P luminometer. The PPARγ/VP16 construction contained the ligand binding domain of mouse PPARγ1 (amino acids 175–476) inserted downstream of the VP16 activation domain in the plasmid pVP16 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The p300/GAL4 plasmids contained the N-terminal 180 amino acids of p300 inserted downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) in the pm vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The p300/VP16 construction contained the N-terminal 707 amino acids of p300 inserted downstream of the VP16 activation domain in the same plasmid described above. The PPARγ/GAL4 plasmid consisted of the PPARγ ligand binding domain fragment (amino acids 175–476) linked the GAL4 DNA binding domain described above. The coactivator binding assay was performed essentially as described by Camp et al. (7Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. Leff T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, partially purified Np300 protein or35S-labled in vitro transcribed and translated Np300 and full-length p300 was incubated with GST-nuclear receptor fusion protein that was immobilized on glutathione beads. Binding reactions were carried out in GST binding buffer (50 mmKCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors) with receptor ligands as indicated. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of GST binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Bound p300 was eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography or Western blotting using anti-T7·tag antibody as described previously (8Reddy S. Yang W. Taylor D.G. Shen X. Oxender D. Kust G. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33050-33056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed by either phosphor-image analysis or densitometry. As an initial step in determining if AMP-kinase might phosphorylate PPARs or their associated proteins, we examined their amino acid sequences for the presence of consensus AMP-kinase phosphorylation sites (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, the best matches to the consensus AMP-kinase target sequence were found in the coactivator p300 (Fig. 1A). p300 and its close relative CBP have been shown to mediate the transcriptional activity of PPARs and other nuclear receptors (10Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

Of the four potential AMP-kinase sites in p300, the best match to the ideal site was located at serine 89. This site was particularly interesting, because it is immediately adjacent to an LXXLL motif that is important for the interaction of p300/CBP with nuclear receptors (12Chen S. Johnson B.A. Li Y. Aster S. McKeever B. Mosley R. Moller D.E. Zhou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3733-3736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S.

Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These sites were also highly conserved in the human CBP sequence (Fig. 1B). To determine whether p300 could serve as a substrate for AMP-kinase, anin vitro phosphorylation reaction was carried out with a purified fragment of p300 representing the N-terminal 408 amino acids of the protein (Np300) and partially purified AMP-kinase. The Np300 protein was efficiently phosphorylated by AMP-kinase, and the degree of phosphorylation was enhanced 3–5-fold by the inclusion of AMP in the reaction (Fig. 2A). The ability of p300 to serve as a substrate of the kinase was similar to that of a well characterized AMP-kinase substrate, hormone-sensitive lipase (15Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This degree of activation by AMP is typical of thein vitro activity of this kinase (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the three potential AMP-kinase target sites in Np300 were phosphorylated by the kinase, each serine/threonine was mutated to alanine and tested for its ability to serve as a substrate for the kinase in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction. Mutation of serine 89 to alanine (S89A) dramatically reduced the ability of AMP-kinase to phosphorylate Np300, while mutation of sites at 371 and 395 had no significant effect (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrate that AMP-kinase phosphorylates p300 on serine 89 in vitro. In cells, AMP-kinase can be partially activated by treatment with the compound AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside), which is converted to the AMP analog ZMP (16Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). We used AICAR to determine whether AMP-kinase can phosphorylate p300 at serine 89in vivo. Expression constructs producing wild-type or S89A mutant Np300 protein were transfected into BHK cells that were subsequently treated with AICAR and labeled with orthophosphate. Phosphorylation of wild-type p300 was increased 1.6-fold by AICAR treatment, while the S89A mutant phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig.2, C and D). This change in phosphorylation in response to AICAR treatment was similar to that observed for other well characterized AMP-kinase substrates like 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (16Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that p300 is a substrate for AMP-kinase both in vitro and in vivo and that serine 89 is the major site of phosphorylation. The proximity of the LXXLL motif to serine 89 (Fig.1B) suggested the possibility that phosphorylation at this site could influence the interaction of p300 with nuclear receptors. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction of p300 and PPARγ in an in vitro ligand-dependent association assay. The interaction of PPARγ with wild-type Np300 was strongly inhibited when the coactivator was phosphorylated by AMP-kinase prior to the binding reaction (Fig.3A). The AMP-kinase treatment also inhibited the interaction of PPARγ with both the T371A and S395A mutants of Np300 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the interaction of the S89A mutant with PPARγ was not inhibited by AMP-kinase treatment, indicating that phosphorylation of S89 was required for the inhibition of the coactivator/PPARγ interaction (Fig. 3, Band C). In some cases, substitution of serine with a negatively charged aspartic acid residue mimics the effect of phosphorylation at that site (17Buchbinder J.L. Luong C.B. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8039-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the case of p300, the mutation of serine 89 to aspartic acid (S89D) dramatically reduced the affinity of the coactivator for PPARγ (Fig. 3D). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 reduces its affinity for liganded PPARγ. To determine whether the phosphorylation of p300 at S89 affects its interaction with other nuclear receptors, in vitroassociation assays were performed with the retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR and with the thyroid hormone receptor. As reported previously (11Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 18Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), each of these nuclear receptors interacted with Np300 in a ligand-dependent manner (data not shown). Similar to PPARγ, each receptor showed dramatically reduced interaction with Np300 when the coactivator was phosphorylated at serine 89 (Fig.4A). p300 is known to interact with a variety of transcription factors in addition to the nuclear receptors (19Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the phosphorylation at serine 89 also affects the interaction of p300 with other transcription factors,in vitro association assays were carried out with p53, E1a, and GATA4 and either wild-type p300 or phosphomimetic S89D mutant of p300. As expected, the S89D mutant showed dramatically reduced PPARγ binding, while in contrast, p53, GATA4, and E1a interacted with both the wild-type and S89D mutant to the same degree (Fig. 4B). Likewise, the phosphorylation of wild-type full-length p300 by AMP-kinase reduced its interaction with PPARγ while having no effect on its interaction with E1a or p53 (data not shown). These findings indicate that phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 has a selective effect on the activity of the coactivator, specifically inhibiting its interaction with nuclear receptors. To determine whether the reduced affinity of PPARγ for S89D mutant p300 also occurs in vivo, we used a mammalian two-hybrid analysis of the p300/PPARγ interaction. BHK cells were transiently transfected with a p300/GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein and a PPARγ/VP16 transactivation domain fusion protein (Fig.5, A–C). Transcription from the GAL4-driven luciferase reporter was dependent on the presence of both the PPARγ and p300 fusion proteins and was further stimulated ∼4-fold by rosiglitazone (Fig. 5 and results not shown). These results indicate that the transcriptional activity in this system was due to a ligand-dependent PPARγ/p300 interaction. When cells were transfected with S89A p300 and increasing amounts of PPARγ/VP16, a higher level of transcriptional activity was achieved compared with equivalent transfections carried out with wild-type p300 (compare left and middle panels of Fig.5B). These results suggest that the S89A mutant p300 has a higher affinity for PPARγ than wild-type p300, presumably due to the fact that some portion of the wild-type p300 is phosphorylated at S89 under these conditions. In contrast, the S89D phosphomimetic mutant showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity relative to wild-type p300 (compare the left and right panelsof Fig. 5B). The effect of the S89D mutation on the affinity of p300 and PPARγ was even more dramatic when the experiment was carried out in the alternative configuration, with the PPARγ-LBD fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and p300 linked to VP16 (Fig. 5,D and E). These results are consistent with the reduced interaction of PPARγ with the S89D mutant that was observedin vitro (Fig. 4B) and suggest that phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 may also reduce its interaction with PPARγ in cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that in several experimental systems phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89 dramatically reduced its affinity for nuclear receptors. An important issue that remains to be explored is the physiological role of this phosphorylation event in a native transcription environment. In this regard, it is interesting to speculate as to whether all nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activity is equally affected by AMP-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of p300. Some selectivity could occur if AMP-kinase were part of the transcriptional complex assembled on the promoters of a subset of active genes (for example PPAR but not TR target genes). Consistent with this possibility, evidence suggests that certain isoforms of AMP-kinase are present in the nucleus (20Salt I. Celler J.W. Hawley S.A. Prescott A. Woods A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The possibility that AMP-kinase is a component of transcriptional regulatory complexes is under investigation. p300 is frequently described as a transcriptional cointegrator to reflect its ability to associate with a variety of cellular and viral transcription factors, including nuclear hormone receptors, CREB, AP-1, and E1a, as well as with other coactivator proteins (18Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In certain cellular settings, transcriptional squelching has been observed between transcription factors that compete for limiting amounts of p300/CBP cofactors (11Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). The findings reported here demonstrate that the AMP-kinase signaling pathway can selectively regulate a subset of p300/transcription factor interactions. Given the possibility that multiple transcription factors compete for limiting amounts of p300, the effects of the phosphorylation event we describe here may extend beyond the modulation of nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. Recently, it has been reported that protein kinase C can also phosphorylate p300 on serine 89 (21Yuan L.W. Gambee J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40946-40951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As this phosphorylation event would presumably have the same effect on the interaction of p300 with nuclear receptors that we have reported here, it raises the possibility that additional signaling pathways regulate p300-mediated nuclear receptor activity.

Unlike the well characterized S phase-specific RNR R2 protein, the new form was induced in response to DNA damage by the p53 protein. Because the R2 protein is specifically degraded in late mitosis and absent in Go/G1 cells, the induction of the p53R2 protein may explain how resting cells can obtain deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair. However, no direct demonstration of RNR activity of the p53R2 protein was presented and furthermore, no corresponding RNR large subunit was identified. In this study we show that recombinant, highly purified human and mouse p53R2 proteins contain an iron-tyrosyl free radical center, and both proteins form an active RNR complex with the human and mouse R1 proteins. UV irradiation of serum-starved, Go/G1-enriched mouse fibroblasts, stably transformed with an R1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, caused a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity 24 h after irradiation, paralleled by an increase in the levels of R1 protein. Taken together, our data indicate that the R1 protein can function as the normal partner of the p53R2 protein and that an R1-p53R2 complex can supply resting cells with deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair.

Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This is the rate-limiting step in DNA precursor synthesis, and it is regulated at many different levels in the mammalian cell: (i) by allosteric control of the activity and specificity of ribonucleotide reductase by nucleoside triphosphate effectors (2Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), (ii) by the S phase-dependent transcription of the ribonucleotide reductase genes (3Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and (iii) by the rapid, proteasome-dependent proteolysis of the small subunit in late mitosis (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Errors in the allosteric control lead to unbalanced dNTP pools, misincorporation of deoxyribonucleotides in DNA, genetic abnormalities or cell death (5Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The mammalian ribonucleotide reductase consists of a 1:1 complex of two homodimeric non-identical subunits called proteins R1 and R2. The 90-kDa R1 protein contains the catalytic site, the binding sites for the allosteric effectors, and redox active disulfides that participate in the reduction of the substrates, while the 45-kDa R2 protein contains an iron center-generated tyrosyl free radical essential for catalysis (6Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). Transcription of both the R1 and R2 genes is S-phase specific but only the R2 protein shows S-phase-specific expression (3Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of the R1 protein are in excess and almost constant during the cell cycle in proliferating cells because of a long half-life of the protein (>24 h) (8Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mann G.J. Musgrove E.A. Fox R.M. Thelander L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5151-5156PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell cycle-dependent activity of ribonucleotide reductase is controlled by the synthesis and degradation of the R2 protein. This synthesis starts in early S phase, and then the R2 protein slowly accumulates in the cell up to late mitosis when it is rapidly degraded (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). DNA damage or replication blocks in S-phase cells lead to cell cycle arrest and stabilization of the R2 protein, which is effective until cells pass into mitosis. This mechanism ensures an adequate supply of dNTPs for replication and repair in S phase and during G2. The specific degradation of the R2 protein in late mitosis, which inactivates ribonucleotide reduction in G1 may contribute to preventing reduplication of DNA before the next S phase. However, DNA damage and replication blocks neither increase nor prolong the R2 promoter activity in S phase or in logarithmically growing cells (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). How then would proliferating cells in G1, which lack the R2 protein and consequently an active ribonucleotide reductase, obtain deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair? Even more importantly, how would nonproliferating cells with no detectable R1 or R2 proteins and no ribonucleotide reductase activity obtain dNTPs for repair? This question recently received an elegant answer by the discovery of a new, p53-induced R2 protein called p53R2 (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Similar results were later published from another laboratory (11Nakano K. Bálint É. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The p53R2 gene is located on chromosome 8 while the R2 gene is located on chromosome 2 in humans (6Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar,10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The finding of the DNA damage-inducible p53R2 gene demonstrates the direct involvement of the p53 protein in DNA repair. Cells that cannot make the p53R2 protein were reported to be more sensitive to killing by DNA-damaging agents. However, the assay used to demonstrate ribonucleotide reductase activity of the p53R2 protein was indirect, and its validity has been questioned (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 12Spyrou G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1986; 135: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an R2 protein by itself would be completely inactive and up to now, no new DNA damage inducible form of the R1 protein has been reported. In this study, we express and purify recombinant human and mouse p53R2 proteins and demonstrate by EPR spectroscopy that they both can form a tyrosyl free radical very similar to the tyrosyl radical in the R2 proteins. In in vitro ribonucleotide reductase assays with highly purified proteins, the human and mouse p53R2 proteins form fully active ribonucleotide reductase complexes with the human and mouse R1 proteins. Finally, UV irradiation of serum-synchronized Go/G1 mouse fibroblast cells results in activation of the R1 promoter and expression of the R1 protein, indicating that this protein can function as a partner of the p53R2 protein in DNA repair in Go/G1 cells. The coding sequence of the human p53R2 protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a pET21a plasmid containing the human p53R2 coding sequence (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) cloned in-frame with an N-terminal T7 tag and a C-terminal histidine tag using the 5′ oligonucleotide primer CCGATCCCATATGGGCGACCCGGAAAGGCCG and the 3′ oligonucleotide primer GTGGTGGTGGATCCCTTAAAAATCTGCATCCAAGGTGAA. After cleaving the PCR product with the restriction endonucleases NdeI andBamHI, the resulting fragment without tags was inserted into a pET3a vector (Novagen) cleaved with the same restriction endonucleases. The coding sequence of the mouse p53R2 was amplified by PCR from an expressed sequence tag cDNA clone in the pBluescribe vector (AA 681631; The WashU-HHMI mouse EST project) using the 5′ oligonucleotide primer AGCTGCACCATGGGCGACCCGGAAAG and the 3′ oligonucleotide primer TATACTGGATCCTTAGAAATCTGCATCC. After cleaving with the restriction endonucleases NcoI and BamHI, the fragment was inserted into the pET3d vector (Novagen) opened with the same enzymes. The coding sequence of the human R2 protein was amplified by PCR from an Okayama-Berg cDNA clone isolated from a human fibroblast cDNA library (14Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) using mouse R2 cDNA as a probe. The 5′ oligonucleotide primer was CTGCGCCGCCCATATGCTCTCCCTCCGTGTC and the 3′ oligonucleotide primer was GCCAAGTAAGGGATCCTCTTCAGTTCATTTAGAAG. The cloning of the PCR fragment into a pET3a vector was made as described for the human p53R2 cDNA. Finally, most of the coding sequence of the human R1 protein was isolated by cleaving a human R1 cDNA clone in a Bluescript SK+ vector (15Parker N.J. Begley C.G. Fox R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the restriction endonucleasesNsiI and XbaI. The fragment was then cloned into a pET3a plasmid containing a linker oligonucleotide with restriction endonuclease sites for NsiI and XbaI and in addition the first 5 nucleotides of the human R1 coding sequence. All constructs were verified by dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing. Recombinant mouse R1 and R2 proteins were prepared from BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria containing the plasmids pETM1 or pETM2 and purified to homogeneity according to Refs. 16Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J.

Expression and purification of the human R1 and R2 proteins were made in essentially the same way as the mouse proteins except that the human R1 protein was expressed at 30o instead of 15o. For the expression of p53R2 proteins, an overnight culture of BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL or RP bacteria (Stratagene) transfected with the human or mouse pET p53R2 plasmids was diluted 200 times in 4.8 liters of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 µg/ml of carbenicillin and 34 µg/ml of chloramphenicol. The bacteria were grown at 37ountil they reached an A595 of 0.6 and then induced by 400 µmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 2.5 h at 37o before harvesting. The cells were disrupted by bead beating with 0.1-mm glass beads (Biospec Products) or by using an X-press (AB BIOX, Gothenburg). Precipitation of nucleic acids with streptomycin, and ammonium sulfate fractionation were performed as described for the purification of mouse R2 protein (17Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E-I. Ingemarson I. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The human p53R2 protein was eluted with 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl in the final DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Instead of the DEAE-cellulose column, the mouse p53R2 protein was chromatographed on a 6-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6 using a 120-ml linear gradient of 150–270 mm KCl. The mouse p53R2 protein eluted around 180 mm KCl. EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer as described earlier (18Rova U. Adrait A. Pötsch S. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23746-23751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ability of the different R2 and p53R2 proteins to catalyze the reduction of [3H]CDP in the presence of the R1 protein was determined as described earlier (19Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163) were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Serum synchronization and UV irradiation of cells were performed as described earlier (20Filatov D. Björklund S. Johansson E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23698-23704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was carried out on a CCA-I flow cytometer, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Partec, GmBH). The construction of the pGL3R1 5.7 and 287 mouse R1 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, the 1.5 kilobase pair mouse R2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, transfection by electroporation, and selection of stably transformed clones were described earlier (4Chabes A.

Luciferase assays were performed on cell lysates obtained by incubating cells with passive lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was measured in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner designs) as described (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein from the lysates were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to membranes, and analyzed (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) using the anti-R1 protein monoclonal antibody AD203 (22Engström Y. Rozell B. Hansson H-A. Stemme S. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, detection was done using the ECL-plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As an independent control for equal loading of the gel lanes, a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used. The nucleotide sequence of the human and mouse p53R2 genes differs enough from the corresponding R2 genes to explain why they were not detected in Southern blot analyses or by in situ hybridization using R2 cDNA probes. In contrast, the amino acid sequence homology between the p53R2 and R2 proteins is very high (Fig. 1). The mouse p53R2 protein shows 81% identity to the mouse R2 protein and 82% identity to the human R2 protein while the human p53R2 protein shows 90% identity to the mouse p53R2 protein. The major difference between the p53R2 proteins and the R2 proteins is that the former lacks 33 amino acid residues in the N terminus. All the iron ligands (23Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S.

Human R1 and R2 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 polymerase pET vector system and purified by dATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, respectively, as described earlier for the corresponding recombinant mouse proteins (16Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mann G.J.

The purity of the final preparations is demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Initial attempts to use the same pET vector system in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria for expression of the p53R2 proteins were unsuccessful, and no expression was detected. However, changing to BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) strains containing extra copies of rare E. coli tRNA genes including argU, resulted in good expression of the p53R2 proteins. The purity of the final preparations of the human and mouse p53R2 proteins is shown in Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4. A minimal requirement of an active R2 protein is that it can form an iron-tyrosyl free radical center. The presence of a tyrosyl free radical is best studied by EPR spectroscopy, and therefore we analyzed our p53R2 proteins by this technique. Fig. 3shows the EPR spectra at 30 K of the mouse R2 and p53R2 proteins and the human p53R2 protein. All three spectra show very similar hyperfine patterns indicating similar iron center-tyrosyl free radical structures. Also the microwave saturation at 20 K is very similar (data not shown). Like the mouse R2 protein, the mouse p53R2 protein rapidly lost its tyrosyl free radical on incubation with hydroxyurea (T 12 = 2 min at 20o and 4 mm hydroxyurea, see Ref. 24Nyholm S. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11569-11574Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the mouse p53R2 protein was about 43% of the specific activity of the mouse R2 protein when both were assayed for ribonucleotide reductase activity in the presence of an excess of mouse R1 protein (Table I). Similarly, the specific activity of the human p53R2 protein was 60% of the specific activity of the human R2 protein when assayed in the presence of an excess of human R1 protein. We know from earlier experiments that the human and mouse R1 and R2 proteins give fully active ribonucleotide reductase complexes in all combinations, and in Table I we also show that the mouse p53R2 protein gives the same activity when assayed with the mouse R1 protein as with the human R1 protein.Table IRibonucleotide reductase activity of R2 and p53R2 proteinsSmall subunit1-aAssays No. 1–5 were made in the presence of 18 µg of mouse R1 protein and assays No. 6–8 were made in the presence of 20 µg of human R1 protein.

Open table in a new tab In resting, nonproliferating cells neither of the R1 and R2 mRNA transcripts nor the corresponding proteins or ribonucleotide reductase activity can be detected. We now wanted to study if the R1 gene promoter and R1 protein expression can be induced in resting cells after DNA damage. Mouse fibroblast cells stably transformed with the pGL3R1 5.7 plasmid (21Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), containing 5.7 kilobase pairs of the mouse R1 promoter in front of the luciferase gene, were synchronized by serum starvation for 48 h. The medium was removed, the cells irradiated with UV light, and then the same low serum, conditioned medium was added back, and the cells were incubated in parallel with non-irradiated control cells for another 48 h. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested for cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry, for measurements of luciferase activity, and for the determination of R1 protein by immunoblotting (Fig.4). The luciferase activity started to increase about 10 h after irradiation, reached a maximum after 24 h and then slowly declined (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry analyses of the cells after 48 h of serum starvation showed 91% of the cells being in Go/G1, 4% in S and 5% in G2 + M, and this distribution did not change significantly during the experiment (Fig. 4B). Immunoblots using an R1 protein-specific monoclonal antibody showed a clear increase in R1 protein levels in the irradiated cells compared with the non-irradiated cells (Fig. 4C). This increase was first detected after 18 h and remained at least to 48 h after the irradiation. Similar results were obtained with cells stably transformed with the plasmid pGL3R1 287 (21Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), containing only 287 bp of the R1 promoter in front of the luciferase gene, but now the increase in luciferase activity was slightly lower (2.5 instead of 3 fold; data not shown). As a control, cells stably transformed with the same pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid, but now containing 1.5 kilobase pairs of the mouse R2 promoter in front of the luciferase gene (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), were serum-synchronized and irradiated in the same way as the pGL3R1 5.7-transformed cells. The R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct-transformed cells did not show any significant increase in luciferase activity after irradiation (data not shown). Our results clearly demonstrate that the human and mouse p53R2 proteins can form active iron-tyrosyl free radical centers like the R2 proteins. The specific activities of the p53R2 proteins assayed in the presence of an excess R1 protein were almost as high as the specific activities of the R2 proteins. We believe that the small differences can be explained by a different purity of the preparations or lower content of iron-radical center in the p53R2 proteins as a result of the different expression systems. By itself, the ability of the p53R2 proteins to form an active ribonucleotide reductase complex with the R1 protein does not prove that this is what happens in a resting cell after DNA damage. However, our demonstration that the mouse R1 promoter is activated in serum-synchronized Go/G1-enriched fibroblast cells after UV irradiation and that this activation results in increased R1 protein levels strongly indicates that the R1 protein is the physiological partner of the p53R2 protein. Interestingly, the rather slow R1 promoter activation and increase in R1 protein levels after UV irradiation correlate well to the slow induction of the p53R2 transcript in DNA-damaged cells (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4C, the long half-life of the R1 protein makes it still detectable in cells after 48 h of serum starvation (8Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mann G.J. Musgrove E.A. Fox R.M. Thelander L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5151-5156PubMed Google Scholar) but the increase in the irradiated cells compared with the non-irradiated control cells after 18 h is quite clear. The DNA damage-induced activation of the R1 promoter is in strong contrast to the R2 promoter, which is not affected by DNA damage or replication blocks. This observation has been repeatedly made both by us and in other laboratories (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Our earlier report that cells stably transformed with an older version of an R1/R2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct showed a very rapid increase in luciferase activity after UV irradiation most probably was an artifact caused by the p19luc reporter plasmid (20Filatov D. Björklund S. Johansson E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23698-23704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in previous studies we were never able to record a parallel increase in promoter activity and protein levels as we now show in Fig. 4. The levels of dNTP in a cell appear to be critical for DNA repair and replication. The DNA damage response has been best studied in yeast where it activates the MEC1 and RAD53 protein kinases pathway, which activates the transcription of the ribonucleotide reductase genes (25Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and in parallel leads to the degradation of the Sml1 protein, a specific inhibitor of the yeast ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (26Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of MEC1 and RAD53 are the ATM/ATR and CHK2 (27Rothman R. Shiloh Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which activate and stabilize p53, which in turn activates the p53R2 gene (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 11Nakano K. Bálint É. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the mammalian enzyme, the major control of yeast ribonucleotide reductase appears to focus on the large subunit. The RNR1 transcript fluctuates more than the RNR2 transcript during the cell cycle (28Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA damage in yeast specifically induces a homologue of RNR1 called RNR3 (28Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, ribonucleotide reductase activity is controlled during the cell cycle by the synthesis and breakdown of the small subunit and DNA damage induces a new form of this subunit, the p53R2 protein. Once an active ribonucleotide reductase is formed in mammalian cells, the fine-tuning of the overall size of the dNTP pools is controlled at every moment by the feedback inhibition of the enzyme by the negative allosteric effector dATP. This regulation functions independently of the amounts of R1 and R2 proteins (4Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We thank R. M. Fox for providing the plasmid containing the human R1 cDNA."

Blood. 1999; 93: 2431-2448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine cell fate selection. In adult mammals, anomalous Notch signaling has been linked to neoplasia (N1, N2, and N4), stroke (N3), and possibly schizophrenia (N4) (3Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Neurol. 1997; 9: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Wei J. Hemmings G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5Ujike H. Takehisa Y. Takaki M. Tanaka Y. Nakata K. Takeda T. Kodama M. Fujiwara Y. Yamamoto A. Kuroda S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 301: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The biochemical details of the N1 signaling mechanism have been elucidated and are supported byCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genetic experiments (6Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). It is currently thought that N1 undergoes a conformational change upon DSL1 ligand binding (Delta, Serrate, lag-2) exposing the extracellular juxtamembrane region to proteolysis at N1V1711 (site 2 or S2, see Fig. 1Aand Ref. 6Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The resultant C-terminal product, NEXT (Notchextracellular truncation), then undergoes a presenilin-dependent cleavage at N1V1744 (S3 cleavage), releasing the N1 intracellular fragment, NICD (Notch intracellulardomain). N1NICD is free to translocate to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator of CSL (CBF1, Su(H),Lag-1)-dependent pathways. It is not clear however, whether all murine NEXT-like Notch proteins are substrates for presenilin. The phenotype of mice deficient in both presenilin genes (7Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Schrijvers V. Checler F. Vanderstichele H. Baekelandt V. Dressel R. Cupers P. Huylebroeck D. Zwijsen A. Van Leuven F. De Strooper B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These embryos display more severe phenotypes than any single Notch null (9Swiatek P.J. Lindsell C.E. del Amo F.F. Weinmaster G. Gridley T.

Interestingly, oncogenic forms of N1, N2, and N4 loosely mimic N1NEXT or N1NICD (13Girard L. Hanna Z. Beaulieu N. Hoemann C.D. Simard C. Kozak C.A. Jolicoeur P.

Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that regardless of the final nuclear target(s), Notch proteolysis is a key to neoplastic transformation as well as normal activity of these genes. In this study, we sought to determine whether N2, N3, or N4 NEXT mimics undergo intramembranous proteolysis in a manner analogous to N1 and whether the cleavage site is conserved. We observe that all undergo presenilin-dependent proteolysis at a conserved transmembrane position to produce NICD fragments that are post-translationally modified. All NICD peptides translocate to the nucleus and interact with CSL proteins. Additionally, all activate a simple reporter containing multiple CSL binding sites in a presenilin-dependent manner. All Notch ΔE constructs were amplified from plasmids using PCR. Primers were created to introduce flankingClaI sites to the amplified fragments.ClaI-digested PCR products were inserted intoClaI-digested pCS2+/N1ΔE, which removes the N1 intracellular domain and leaves the N1 signal peptide. N2ΔE (1660–2145 amino acids of the full-length N2) was amplified from a N2 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Y. Hamada) using primers mN2–1 (5′-GGGATCGATTCCTACCCTCTAGTGTCTGT3-′) and mN2–2 (5′-CCGATCGATGAGTCACTGAGCTCTCGGACA-3′). N3ΔE(1623–2099 amino acids) was amplified from TT1 and AA2 plasmids, gifts from Dr. U. Lendahl utilizing primer pairs mN3–4/mN3–6 (5′- CGCATCGATTTCCCATACCCACTTCGG-3′, 5′-CTCCGTCTGCATCTGCATCTCC-3′) and mN3–5/mN3–7 (5′-CCACCTGGTTGCTGCTGAT-3′, 5′-CGGATCGATATGTGACAGAGCTGTCTGCC-3′). Both fragments were digested withClaI and EcoRV, and a three-piece ligation with the backbone vector was conducted. N4ΔE (1421–1864 amino acids) was amplified from the Int-3 plasmid, a gift from Dr. J. Kitajewski, using 5′-ACAATCGATCTGCCTGGACCCTT-3′ and 5′-ACAATCGATAGTCCACCGACCAAGT-3′. Stratagene QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit was utilized to create N2ΔE·M1697L and N3ΔE·M1663L. Primers utilized for N2ΔE(M1697L) were 5′-GGGGGTCATCCTGGCCAAGCGGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCCGCTTGGCCAGGATGACCCCC-3′ changing A5046C of the N2 sequence. N3ΔE was mutagenized at A5049C using mN3–12/mN3–13 (5′-ATCCTGGGTGTCCTGGTTGCCAGGCGAAAGC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCGCCTGGCAACCAGGACACCCAGGATG-3′) to create N3ΔE·M1663L. The N4TM and N4TMV1463L constructs were made using the primer pairs: mN4-13 (5′-CCCCTGGCCCATTCTATGTTCACCAGTGGTTGGGGTGCTTCTCCTGGCCCTTGGGGCCCTTCTCGTCCTCCAGCTCC-3′)/mN4-14 (5′-TTAAGGAGCTGGAGGACGAGAAGGGCCCCAAGGGCCAGGAGAAGCACCCCAACCACTGGTGAACATAGAATGGGCCAGGGGAGCT-3′) and mN4-15 (5′-CCCCTGGCCCATTCTATGTTCACCAGTGGTTGGGGTGCTTCTCCTGGCCCTTGGGGCCCTTCTCCTCCTCCAGCTCC-3′)/mN4-16 (5′-TTAAGGAGCTGGAGGAGGAGAAGGGCCCCAAGGGCCAGGAGAAGCACCCCAACCACTGGTGAACATAGAATGGGCCAGGGGAGCT-3′), respectively. The primers were annealed and subcloned into a N1ΔE derivative, which lacks the transmembrane domain (details available upon request). All Myc-tagged IC constructs were created by PCR from their respective ΔE constructs with the following primer pairs: for N2IC, 5′-GGGGGATCCATGGCCAAGCGG-3′ and mN2-2 were used; N3IC was created with mN3-11 (CTGGGATCCATGGTTGCC) and mN3-7; mN4-10 (CTCGGATCCATGCAGCTCATTCG) and mN4-4 were utilized for N4IC. The resulting PCR fragments were double-digested with BamHI andClaI and introduced into a derivative of pCS2. The 4xCSL-luciferase reporter was constructed from the CBF1/pGL2-GLO TATA CAT plasmid, a gift from Dr. S. Speck. A fragment containing the multimerized high affinity CSL sites (4× CGTGGGAA) was excised by BamHI digest and ligated into a BglII/BamHI-digested RSV-TATA pGL2 vector, a gift from Dr. D. Towler. This modified vector has a TATA box from Rous sarcoma virus inserted into the pGL2-basic vector (Promega) to reduce the basal luciferase activity. Hes1-luciferase and Hes5-luciferase are gifts from Drs. A. Israel and R. Kageyama, respectively. All constructs were sequenced prior to use. For the presenilin cells, 2.5 × 104 cells were plated in 1 ml of the media (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.)) per well of a 12-well plate. Each well was transfected with 200 ng of 4×CSL-luciferase reporter, 100 ng of Notch, 20 ng of pCS2+/β-gal, and the remaining DNA up to 1 µg with pCS2+ vector. The DNA mixture was transfected into MEF cells using FuGene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were re-fed with medium after 16 h and lysed 48 h after transfection in 200 µl of buffer (100 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 7.8; 0.2% Triton). 20 µl of lysate was used to determine β-galactosidase concentration to normalize for transfection efficiency. These assays were performed per the Tropix Galacton chemiluminescent substrate protocol. 50 µl of lysate incubated with luciferin assay buffer (30 mm Tricine, pH 7.8; 3 mm ATP; 15 mmMgSO4; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 0.2 mmCoA; 1 mm luciferin) was used to determine luciferase activity using a Tropix TR717 luminometer. To transfect 3T3 and 293 cells, cells were plated at ∼10% density. A total of 10 µg of DNA mixture was incubated with 500 µl of 0.25 mCaCl2 and 500 µl of 2× BBS (10 min, 23 °C). Cells were re-fed with appropriate medium 16 h later. 3 µg of Notch DNA were transfected into 100-mm dishes of 293 cells. Lysates immunoprecipitated to enrich for Notch proteins were sheared 42 h post-transfection with 26 gauge needles and spun to remove cellular debris. Lysates were incubated overnight with 1 µg of 9E10 ascites antibody (Sigma) and bound to protein A-beads for 2 h the following day. Beads were rinsed four times (4 °C) with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide, and three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. Beads were stored in Laemmli buffer at −80 °C. For CSL co-immunoprecipitations, 7 µg of CSLRBP3·FLAGwas co-transfected with Notch. Cells were lysed in 500 µl of sterile filterized Co-IP buffer (200 mm KCl, 25 mmHepes, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mmEGTA, pH 7.5) and incubated (30 min, 4 °C). The lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG, M2® agarose affinity gel (Sigma) (4 h, 4 °C). The beads were rinsed four times in cold Co-IP buffer and stored at −80o. Cells co-immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for presenilin1 and presenilin2 were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. Lysates were incubated with protein A-beads overnight. Presenilin antibodies were incubated with precleared lysates for 1 h (α-presenilin1 (1:100) and α -presenilin2 (1:50)) and precipitated with protein A-beads for 1 h. Beads were washed two times with wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 0.5m NaCl; 2 mm EDTA) and two times with wash buffer 2 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 150 mm NaCl; 2 mm EDTA) before being stored in Laemmli buffer. All protein sample were boiled for 5 min prior to being resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gels in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS buffer. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol buffer. Gels were incubated with primary antibody overnight (9E10 hybridoma medium at 1:4 dilution; FLAG ascites at 1:3000) and incubated with secondary antibody (9E10, α-mouse Ig-HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); FLAG, α-rabbit Ig-HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) diluted in 1× PBS (1:3000) for 1 h. After a 1× PBS rinse, protein was visualized with either LumiGLO (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) or SuperSignal® Ultra (Pierce) per instructions on Hyperfilm™ MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 3 µg of Notch DNA was transfected into 3T3 cells and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde 2 days post-transfection. After three washes with 1× PBS (10 min, 23 °C), cells were briefly permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/PBS solution, rinsed with 1× PBS and incubated with 9E10 hybridoma overnight. Cells were rinsed the following morning and visualized with 1:300 α-mouse Texas-red secondary antibody. 30 plates of HEK293 cells were transiently transfected and lysed 2 days post-transfection. Notch proteins were α-Myc-immunoprecipitated and separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to Problot (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were excised and N-terminally sequenced using an ABI 480A sequencer. 2 µg of Notch and 3 µg of carrier DNA were transfected into 60-mm dishes. For pulse-chases, cells were starved for 60 min in methionine-free DMEM and labeled with 500 µCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min. Proteins were chased in the presence of cyclohexamide for the times noted. Alternatively, cells were 32PO4labeled (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum/phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting. CIP experiments: half of the beads bound with labeled proteins were incubated with or without CIP in 1× CIP buffer (New England Biolabs) at 37o for 30 min. Beads were then stored in Laemmli buffer and analyzed as described above. Truncated N1 proteins lacking an extracellular domain (N1ΔE) mimic the N1NEXT fragment generated as a result of ligand binding (21Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X.L. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) are cleaved at Val1744 (S3) releasing the N1NICD fragment; these proteins are constitutively active (19Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). To assess whether N2, N3, or N4 NEXT mimics, analogous to N2 and N4 oncogenic proteins, undergo S3 cleavage and are thus capable of forming NICD in vivo, similarly constructed Notch proteins were compared in parallel biochemically. N2ΔE, N3ΔE, and N4ΔE were constructed to closely resemble N1ΔE. Each of the ΔE constructs include the N1 leader peptide and ∼20 amino acids of the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain and extend intracellularly to the region N-terminal to the PEST region, ending with a hexameric Myc tag (Fig.1 A). To determine whether a stable NICD-like fragment was present in cells expressing Notch ΔE proteins, Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, extracts from 3T3 cells transfected with each of the four Notch ΔE constructs contain an uncleaved ΔE polypeptide of the expected size. In addition, a faster migrating band is observed in all lanes. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 and CHO cells (Fig. 4). It has been previously demonstrated that the formation of smaller peptides from N1ΔE can result from initiation of translation at an alternative methionine within the transmembrane domain (22Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To prevent generation of NICD-sized fragments due to alternative translation from methionines abutting the putative S3 cleavage site in N2 and N3 (Fig.1 B), these amino acids were mutated to leucine (N2ΔE·M1697L and N3ΔE·M1663L). Cells expressing N2ΔE·M1697L and N3ΔE·M1663Lproduced the same pattern of uncleaved ΔE and NICD-like fragments (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, cells expressing any of the four truncated Notch proteins produce, in addition to the full-length ΔE protein, a stable NICD-like fragment, most likely by proteolysis.Figure 4Notch and presenilins. presenilin1 (A) and presenilin2 (B) form a stable and preferential interaction with the longer, uncleaved forms of Notch in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. A portion of the lysed cell extract was saved for Western analysis (L), the remaining sample was co-immunoprecipitated (C) using a presenilin1- or presenilin2-specific antibody. C, functional presenilin is required for S3 processing of all Notch proteins as NICD formation is severely reduced in cells expressing the dominant negative presenilin. ΔE Notch constructs were transfected into wild type CHO cells (marked −) or a CHO cell line stably expressing a dominant negative presenilin mutation (D257A, marked +). D, NICD formation is severely reduced in the presence of Compound 11 protease inhibitor (26Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Notch were [35S]methionine-labeled with or without Compound 11 prior to immunoprecipitation. E, NICD formation requires the presence of presenilins. Cell lysates from Notch-transfected presenilin-deficient versus presenilin wildtype cells were analyzed. F, N4 NICD production is severely reduced when a valine in the transmembrane domain is mutated to leucine. Cells expressing TM4 and TM4V1463L were lysed for Western analysis. If the gel is overexposed, small amounts of NICD are seen in the TM4V1463L lane (data not shown). In the figure, TM4V/L represents TM4V1463L. All gels were immunoblotted using an α-Myc-specific antibody.Open circles mark the NICD fragment. ΔE construct mutants for N1, N2, and N3 methionines were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that a precursor/product relationship exists between all uncleaved ΔE polypeptides and NICD-like fragments, metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed, demonstrating that despite the low degree of amino acid conservation within the transmembrane domain, all Notch ΔE constructs produce a NICD fragment (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, several higher molecular mass bands were also observed in cells expressing N2ΔE and N3ΔE (Fig.3 B), suggesting that N2NICD and N3NICD fragments may be post-translationally modified more extensively than N1NICD and N4NICD. Indeed, a similar shift in mobility was detected with N2IC and N3IC proteins after labeling (Fig. 3 B). Immunoprecipitation of Notch proteins from orthophosphate (32PO4)-labeled cells unequivocally demonstrate that NICD proteins are phosphorylated (Fig. 3, C–F). Incubating immunoprecipitated proteins in the presence of CIP only affects the mobility of N2 peptides (Fig. 3, D andF), suggesting either that additional modifications are present on N3 or that the phosphates on N3NICD cannot be removed by CIP. As N1NICD formation is dependent on presenilin, we sought to determine whether presenilin proteins are required for proteolysis of all murine Notch proteins. Previous experiments have demonstrated that presenilin1 preferentially binds the full-length N1ΔE polypeptide (23Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P. Mumm J. Zhang W. Wu J.Y. Kopan R. Goate A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that presenilin1 binds N1 prior to S3 cleavage. Our co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that uncleaved N2ΔE·M1697L, N3ΔE·M1663L and N4ΔE proteins preferentially bind to both presenilin1 and presenilin2 (Fig.4, A and B). The importance of presenilin to the production of NICD in all four proteins was further assessed using three experimental paradigms. First, CHO cells expressing a dominant negative presenilin mutation, known to inhibit both presenilin1 and presenilin 2 activity (24Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 25Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S. Hardy J., Yu, X. Picciano M. Fechteler K. Citron M. Kopan R. Pesold B. Keck S. Baader M. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), demonstrate a marked reduction in NICD fragments (Fig. 4 C). Second, treatment with an inhibitor specific for γ-secretase activity (26Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) decreases the amount of NICD produced from all Notch proteins (Fig. 4 D). Lastly, in cells deficient for both presenilin1 and presenilin 2 proteins (27Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Z.H. Nadeau P. Song W.H. Donoviel D. Yuan M.L. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), no NICD is detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that presenilin is involved in converting all truncated Notch proteins to NICD. Experiments conducted in Drosophila suggest that transmembrane proteins can undergo presenilin-dependent processing if the extracellular domain has been truncated within a particular size range (29Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), suggesting a lack of cleavage site specificity. We therefore wished to determine whether Notch proteins are cleaved at an equivalent position to N1V1744. As the N4 transmembrane domain is the most divergent from N1 (Fig. 1 B), N4NICD was purified and sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid of N4NICDis Val1463 placing the N4 cleavage site at the same relative position as the N1 S3 cleavage site (N1V1744, Fig.1 B). Importantly, N4NICD production is severely reduced in constructs in which this valine has been mutated to leucine (N4V1463L) in the N4 transmembrane domain (Fig.4 F); an analogous mutation (N1V1744L; (19Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar)) similarly effects S3 processing of N1. Once N1 has undergone cleavage at the cell surface, the non-membrane tethered N1NICD fragment translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with CSL proteins to regulate transcription of target genes. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed Notch nuclear staining in cells expressing membrane bound N2ΔE·M1697L, N3ΔE·M1663L, or N4ΔE (Fig.2 C). Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that CSL proteins preferentially interact with nuclear N1NICD fragments rather than the uncleaved N1ΔE polypeptide (19Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 30Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast to the enrichment for the NEXT-like fragments by presenilin co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.4, A and B), CSLRBP3-FLAGco-immunoprecipitations enrich for the NICD fragments produced from cells expressing N2, N3, and or N4 ΔE constructs (Fig. 2,A and B). The preference of CSL for the low molecular weight NICD may suggest that non-modified NICD (Fig. 3,C–F) accumulates preferentially in the nucleus or that phosphatases are active during co-immunoprecipitation procedure. These results establish biochemically that presenilin-dependent γ-secretase is the predominant S3 proteolytic activity in cultured cells. To determine whether any truncated Notch protein activate a CSL-dependent reporter in the absence of presenilin proteins, MEF cells derived from embryos heterozygous for presenilin1 and presenilin2 or from littermates deficient for both genes were used to compare the CSL-dependent activity of truncated Notch proteins (Fig.5). In the absence of presenilin, the activity is similar to that of the 4xCSL reporter alone. We conclude that no alternative protease exists in these cells capable of releasing sufficient NICD protein to elicit activity. Upon ligand binding, the full-length N1 receptor is cleaved by a metalloprotease just extracellular to the transmembrane domain (S2 cleavage); the resulting cleavage product, NEXT, is then processed to form NICD. Western blot analysis demonstrates that a NICD-like fragment is produced from all NEXT-like, truncated Notch proteins (Figs. 2 and 3). While such fragments can be the result of alternative translation-initiation (22Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) or translation from a cryptic internal ribosome entry site (31Lauring A.S. Overbaugh J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we demonstrate unequivocally that proteolysis is responsible for NICD production as mutating methionine residues in the N2 and N3 transmembrane domains do not impact NICD production (Figs. 2 B, 3, 4). Pulse-chase analyses confirm that a precursor/product relationship exists between all Notch ΔE and NICD-like peptides (Fig. 3). Post-translational phosphorylation of all Notch proteins was also observed (Fig. 3), N2 and N3 modifications have been previously noted (32Lardelli M. Williams R. Mitsiadis T. Lendahl U. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the Notch ΔE constructs used in this paper include the analogous S2 cleavage site (Fig. 1 B), we do not detect any S2 cleavage products by N-terminal sequencing. 2M. T. Saxena, J. S. Mumm, and R. Kopan, unpublished observations. This is consistent with the model suggesting that S2 cleavage is only necessary in molecules containing an inhibitory extracellular domain and that molecules with a short extracellular domain can be directly processed to form NICD (21Mumm J.S.

Protein sequencing data confirm that the cleaved peptide bond in N4 occurs at a position equivalent to the known N1 S3 cleavage site (N4V1463, N1V1744, Fig. 1 B). This conservation is intriguing as N1 and N4 share only 24% identity within the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 B). The fact that intramembranous Notch processing is highly dependent on this conserved valine (Fig. 4 F, Refs. 19Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar and 34Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R.

We only detect one proteolytic product from N1ΔE and N4ΔE by N-terminal sequencing. It is worth noting that while we measure the release of a C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase, γ-secretase activity on APP was assayed by measurements of released N-terminal fragments. Recent sequencing of the N terminus of an APP C-terminal fragment identified a presenilin-dependent cleavage site in APP at Val50, a position equivalent to S3 in Notch (37Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Three of five γ-secretase substrates are now known to be cleaved at an equivalent position (N1, N4, APP). It is however possible that the low-level proteolysis observed in Notch S3 valine mutants results from cleavage at position equivalent to APP Aβ40. Alternatively, residual proteolysis may occur at the mutant S3 site. Isolation of NΔE N-terminal stubs will reveal if such additional proteolytic fragments exist, perhaps resulting from rare cleavage events in the middle of the Notch transmembrane domain as in APP (36Murphy M.P.

It has been suggested that many transmembrane proteins can be cleaved by a presenilin-dependent activity (29Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of chimeric, membrane tethered proteins containing a potent transcription activator in Drosophila demonstrated that different transmembrane domains can all be cleaved by a presenilin-dependent activity as long as they lack an extensive extracellular domain and have the appropriate conformation. However, even with this sensitive assay, the authors reported a decline in proteolysis when the conserved valine in Drosophila Notch is mutated. It remains to be determined how many other proteins are natural substrates for presenilins and whether their proteolysis depends on specific sequences at the cleavage site. Finally, the observation that all Notch proteins are dependent on presenilins for proteolysis supports the hypothesis that the more severe phenotype of the murine presenilin 1/presenilin 2 nulls is due to a loss of all Notch activity (7Herreman A.

There is considerable evidence indicating that residues in transmembrane segments 4–6 and 10–12 form the drug-binding site. We attempted to measure the size of the drug-binding site by using thiol-specific methanethiosulfonate (MTS) cross-linkers containing spacer arms of 2 to 17 atoms. The majority of these cross-linkers were also substrates of P-gp, because they stimulated ATPase activity (2.5- to 10.1-fold). 36 P-gp mutants with pairs of cysteine residues introduced into transmembrane segments 4–6 and 10–12 were analyzed after reaction with 0.2 mm MTS cross-linker at 4 °C. The cross-linked product migrated with lower mobility than native P-gp in SDS gels. 13 P-gp mutants were cross-linked by MTS cross-linkers with spacer arms of 9–25 Å.

In this study, we used a series of thiol-specific cross-linkers with spacer arms of various lengths to measure distances between these residues. There are seven endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 in wild-type P-gp. None of the cysteines are needed for activity, because mutation of all cysteines to alanine (Cys-less P-gp) resulted in an active molecule (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Cys-less P-gp cDNA was also modified to code for ten histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule (Cys-less P-gp(His)10). The histidine tag facilitated purification of the Cys-less P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (42Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were then introduced into the Cys-less P-gp(His)10 as described previously (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (43Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants were described previously (42Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 10-cm diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and is a powerful chemical chaperone for promoting maturation of P-gp (44Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later, solubilized with 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (Ni-NTA columns; Qiagen, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The P-gp-(His)10 mutants were eluted from the column and mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S; Sigma-Aldrich) that was washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The P-gp:lipid mixture was then sonicated for 45 s at 4 °C. An aliquot of the mixture was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 2 mm MTS cross-linker. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (45Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The mutant P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence of 10 μm cyclosporin A. Membranes were prepared from transfected cells and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and treated with 0.2 mm cross-linker (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; see Fig. 1) for 15 min at 4 °C. At this concentration, the MTS cross-linkers stimulated the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp by about 50%. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. In the protection experiments, the membranes were pretreated for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm vinblastine or 1 mmcyclosporin A (saturating conditions). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels and immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To measure distances between residues in the NH2 and COOH halves of the drug-binding domain, we constructed P-gp mutants that had a pair of cysteine residues, one in the NH2 half and the other in the COOH half (Table I). The mutants were then tested for cross-linking with thiol-specific cross-linkers. In attempting to measure distances between residues, it would be most useful to use cross-linkers that had similar spacer arms and reactive groups to minimize differences in chemical reactivity with cysteines. A set of thiol-specific cross-linkers with these properties is the MTS cross-linkers shown in Fig.1. Alkylthiosulfonates react selectively with cysteines in a protein resulting in a disulfide attachment of the spacer arm and release of a sulfonic acid byproduct (46Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 47Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Protein Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The MTS compounds are generally more reactive with cysteines than other thiol-specific compounds such as maleimides or iodoacetates (47Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J.

Open table in a new tab In using cross-linkers to map distances in the drug-binding domain, it is important that the compounds can actually occupy the drug-binding site. It is best to be able to measure P-gp-mediated transport of these MTS compounds. This is technically not feasible, because radioactive forms are not available commercially. Another complication is the short half-lives of MTS compounds in aqueous media (46Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and they are also not fluorescent. One way around these problems is to measure stimulation of ATPase activity. Binding of most substrates to P-gp stimulates its ATPase activity, and there is good correlation between drug-stimulated ATPase activity and drug transport (48Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Accordingly, all the MTS cross-linkers (Fig. 1) were assayed for their ability to stimulate Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity. Cys-less P-gp has all seven endogenous cysteines replaced with alanine and is nearly as active (drug transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity) as wild-type P-gp (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the stimulation of Cys-less P-gp ATPase activity in the presence of saturating concentrations (2 mm) of each MTS cross-linker. All the compounds, except M3M, stimulated the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp. The most potent stimulators of activity were M6M and M8M (about 10-fold). Relatively lower levels of stimulation were observed with M5M, M11M, M14M, and M17M (6- to 8-fold), whereas M2M and M4M stimulated activity 2.5- to 3.5-fold. In general, the best stimulators of activity were compounds with spacer arms of intermediate lengths (10 to 13 Å). For comparison, verapamil, the best stimulator of P-gp activity, stimulates Cys-less P-gp activity about 14-fold, whereas the substrate vinblastine stimulates activity about 6-fold (41Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The results show that most of the MTS cross-linkers can occupy the drug-binding site of P-gp. Recently, we used dibromobimane (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to show that cysteines introduced at positions 222(TM4), 306(TM5), 339(TM6), and 342(TM6) in the NH2 half of P-gp and at 868(TM10), 871(TM10), 872(TM10), 942(TM11), 945(TM11), 975(TM12), 982(TM12), 984(TM12), and 985(TM12) in the COOH half of P-gp contribute to the drug-binding domain (40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test for cross-linking, mutants with one cysteine in the NH2 half (positions 222, 306, 339, and 342) and another in the COOH half (positions 868, 871, 872, 942, 945, 975, 982, 984, and 985) were made (Table I). The mutants were first expressed in HEK 293 cells and were found to be processed to the fully mature (170 kDa) form of P-gp (data not shown). The 36 mutants (Table I) were then subjected to cross-linking by the MTS cross-linkers (Fig. 1). Membranes were prepared from transfected cells and treated with different cross-linkers (0.2 mm) at 4 °C. The reactions were done at 4 °C to reduce molecular motions in the protein. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing N-ethylmaleimide, and the mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In previous studies we had shown the cross-linking between residues in the NH2 and COOH halves of P-gp resulted in the cross-linked product migrating with lower mobility in SDS gels (49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 50Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, cross-linking by MTS cross-linkers resulted in decreased mobility of the cross-linked protein. Cross-linked product was detected in 13 mutants. Representative positive (mutant I306C/V982C) and negative (mutant I306C/A871C) results are shown in Fig. 3. In mutant I306C/V982C, strongest cross-linking was observed with M14M (20.8 Å) and M17M (24.7 Å). Cross-linking was also observed with M8M (13 Å) and M11M (16.9 Å). No evidence of cross-linking was observed with the smaller cross-linkers M2M to M6M (5.2 to 10.4 Å). Cross-linking of mutant I306C/V982C was reversible, because the cross-linked product was not detected after treatment with 5 mm dithiothreitol (data not shown). We then tested whether drug substrates could inhibit cross-linking. If cross-linking occurred between residues in the drug-binding domain, then the presence of substrates such as cyclosporin A and vinblastine should inhibit cross-linking. Cyclosporin A is an inhibitor of P-gp-medicated drug resistance (51Chan H.S. Grogan T.M. DeBoer G. Haddad G. Gallie B.L. Ling V. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 6: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar) whereas vinblastine is a cytotoxic drug substrate (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The membranes containing P-gp mutant I306C/V982C were preincubated with 1 mmcyclosporin A or 1 mm vinblastine for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were then treated with M17M and subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig. 3 shows that cyclosporin A and vinblastine blocked cross-linking of mutant I306C/V982C by M17M. An example of a blot showing no detectable cross-linking is seen in mutant I306C/A871C (Fig.3, lower panel). The cross-linking results of the other mutants (data not shown) are summarized in Table I. Two of the nine S222C(TM4) mutants were cross-linked. Mutant S222C(TM4)/I868C(TM10) was cross-linked with M5M, M6M, M8M, and M17M, whereas mutant S222C(TM4)/G872C(TM10) was cross-linked with M5M, M6M, and M17M. Only five of the nine I306C(TM5) mutants could be cross-linked. Mutants I306C(TM5)/I868C(TM10) and I306C(TM5)/G872C(TM10) were cross-linked with M8M and M17M. Mutant I306C(TM5)/T945C(TM11) was cross-linked with M8M, M11M, and M17M. Mutants I306C(TM5)/V982C(TM12) and I306C(TM5)/G984C(TM12) were cross-linked with M8M, M11M, M14M, and M17M. Six L339C(TM6) mutants were cross-linked. Mutant L339C(TM6)/F942C(TM11) was cross-linked with only M17M. Mutants L339C(TM6)/T945C(TM12) and L339C(TM6)/A985C(TM12) were cross-linked with M14M and M17M, mutant L339C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) was cross-linked with M11M, M14M, and M17M, whereas mutants L339C(TM6)/I868C(TM10) and L339C(TM6)/G872C(TM10) were cross-linked with M8M, M11M, M14M, and M17M. No cross-linking was detected with the A342C(TM6) mutants. All cross-linking was blocked when the membranes were preincubated with 1 mm vinblastine, 1 mm cyclosporin A. Similarly, no cross-linked product was detected after treatment with dithiothreitol (data not shown). The cross-linking results in Fig.4A show that residues 222(TM4), 306(TM5), 339(TM6), 868(TM10), 872(TM10), 942C(TM11), 945(TM11), 982(TM12), 984(TM12), and 985(TM12) must line a common drug-binding site. Residues in TMs 5 and 6 were cross-linked to residues in TMs 10, 11, and 12, whereas residue S222C(TM4) was cross-linked with two residues (I868C and G872C) in TM10. In all cases, cross-linking was blocked by substrates such as vinblastine or cyclosporin A. Vinblastine and cyclosporin are quite large molecules. Their crystal structures show that they are about 20–25 Å in length at their widest point (52Bau, R., and Jin, K. K. (2000) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 2079–2082Google Scholar, 53Jegorov A. Cvak L. Husek A. Simek P. Heydova A. Ondracek J. Pakhomova S. Husak M. Kratochvil B. Sedmera P. Havlicek V. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 2000; 65: 1317-1326Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cross-linking results indicate that the drug-binding site would be large enough to accommodate vinblastine or cyclosporin A. For example, mutants L339C(TM6)/F942C(TM11), L339C(TM6)/T945C(TM11), and L339C(TM6)/A985C(TM12) are only cross-linked with MTS compounds with spacer arms of more than 20 Å. The smallest distance between TMs 4, 5, and 6 and TM 10, 11, and 12 as measured by these cross-linkers is about 9 Å and occurs between TMs 4 and 10, because mutants S222C(TM4)/I868C(TM10) and S222C(TM4)/G872C(TM10) could be cross-linked with M5M. It is interesting to note that none of the 36 mutants (Table I) showed any detectable cross-linking with a zero-length cross-linker (copper phenanthroline) at either 22 or 4 °C (data not shown). It was surprising to find mutants such as the S222C mutants that were cross-linked with smaller reagents (e.g. M8M) were also cross-linked with the larger M17M cross-linker. One explanation is that the TMs of P-gp are quite flexible (54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and therefore, can expand or contract to accommodate different sizes of substrate. This mobility of the helices in accommodating different substrates would inherently expose different residues to the drug-binding site and thereby dictate the affinity of P-gp for a particular substrate. It is also possible that the reactive cysteines may be in a sterically favored position to react with cross-linker of a certain size. This may indeed be the case. Table I show that some but not all of the mutants react with the same combination of MTS cross-linkers. Similarly, no cross-linking was detected in 23 of the mutants. Another possibility is that M17M may be a particularly flexible reagent. Recently, Green et al. (55Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein. Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported that a potential problem with using homobifunctional protein cross-linking agents as molecular rulers is that they can be quite flexible. These compounds can adopt a range of conformations due to rotation of the bonds that form the linker arm. There are several C-O bonds in the spacer arm of M17M that could adopt gauche conformations, thereby bringing the two reactive ends closer together. Thus, it is possible that some mutants are reacting with M17M when it is in conformations that bring the reactive groups closer together, whereas other mutants would react only with the M17M when it is in the extended conformation. The residues that have been identified to contribute to the drug-binding site are in the middle of the predicted TM segments and to be 9–25 Å apart (Fig. 4B). Previous studies have shown that the cytoplasmic side of the TMs (4–6 and 10–12) predicted to line the drug-binding site are closer than this, because disulfide cross-linking occurred between residues in these TMs with a zero-length cross-linking agent (copper phenanthroline) (54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The TM segments on the extracellular surface, however, must be quite far apart. A low resolution crystal structure of P-gp shows the presence of a pore of about 50 Å in diameter on the extracellular surface (56Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The emerging picture of P-gp is shown in a cross-sectional view in Fig.4B. In this model, the drug-binding domain appears to be a “funnel” shape, with the widest point at the extracellular side and the narrowest at the cytoplasmic side. Drug binding would occur close to the center of the pore. ATP hydrolysis would change the affinity of P-gp for substrate through conformational changes in the drug-binding domain by rotation (57Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and possibly large movements of helices (50Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ATPase activity is inhibited if conformational changes are prevented by cross-linking of the TM segments (50Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 57Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These movements would result in expulsion of the drug substrate and closing of the extracellular side of the pore.

https://openalex.org/W2007124162,"Dyrk is a dual specific protein kinase thought to be involved in normal embryo neurogenesis and brain development. Defects/imperfections in this kinase have been suggested to play an important role in the mental retardation of patients with Down's syndrome. The transcriptional factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has been implicated in the formation of many types of synaptic plasticity, such as learning and memory. In the present study we show that Dyrk1 activity is markedly induced during the differentiation of immortalized hippocampal progenitor (H19-7) cells. The addition of a neurogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, to the H19-7 cells results in an increased specific binding of Dyrk1 to active CREB. In addition, Dyrk1 directly phosphorylates CREB, leading to the stimulation of subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription during the neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells. Blockade of Dyrk1 activation significantly inhibits the neurite outgrowth as well as CREB phosphorylation induced by basic fibroblast growth factor. These findings suggest that Dyrk1 activation and subsequent CREB phosphorylation is important in the neuronal differentiation of central nervous system hippocampal cells.

The response elicited by a given transduction pathway varies according to the cell type. One major signal transduction system utilizes cAMP as a secondary messenger and has as its ultimate target a DNA control element, the cAMP response element (CRE)1(1Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The CRE-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that activates CRE-mediated transcription. CREB activity is regulated by multiple kinases after various kinds of stimulation (2Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Specific roles for CREB in neuronal development and differentiation have been revealed through in vivo and in vitro manipulations of CREB function. For example, the expression of a dominant-interfering CREB within certain pituitary neurons causes them to develop abnormally and die perinatally (3Struthers R.S. Vale W.W. Arias C. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). “Minibrain” (Mnb) is a mutant of Drosophila whose presence is exhibited by a specific and marked size reduction of the optic lobes and central hemispheres in the adult brain (4Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The Mnb gene encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase that possesses a Tyr-X-Tyr sequence in the activation loop (5Shindoh N. Kudoh J. Maeda H. Yamaki A. Minoshima S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At least 7 closely related homologous mammalian kinases have since been isolated, and a novel superfamily of protein kinases called Dyrk(s) has been established (6Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Dyrks possess Ser/Thr phosphorylation activity as well as autophosphorylation activity on Tyr residues, suggesting that Dyrk seems to be a dual specificity kinase (5Shindoh N. Kudoh J. Maeda H. Yamaki A. Minoshima S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Dyrk is dependent on the Tyr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop, suggesting the existence of a phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of Dyrk by certain upstream kinases (6Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The most homologous protein among the Dyrks in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is YAK1, which has been characterized as a negative regulator of growth (7Garrett S. Menold M.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4045-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human Dyrk1A is mapped to the Down's syndrome (DS) critical region on chromosome 21 (4-megabase region containing 60∼100 genes between the markers D21S17 and ETS2) (31Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 51: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and, thus, could be a candidate gene responsible for the mental retardation of DS patients (8Smith D.J. Stevens M.E. Sudanagunta S.P. Bronson R.T. Makhinson M. Watabe A.M. O'Dell T.J. Fung J. Weier H.U. Cheng J.F. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, fromDrosophila to humans, it is suggested that Dyrk/Mnb is a key regulator of neuronal cell growth (36Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the exact cellular function of the Dyrk kinases is still unknown, an understanding of the physiological role(s) of this protein kinase family will prove to be very relevant. Although little is known about the mechanism by which the overexpression of Dyrks interferes with normal development in DS patients, Dyrk genes are strongly implicated in normal neuronal development by a mechanism that may involve a signal transduction pathway (36Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This study examined the functional role played by Dyrk1 during the neuronal differentiation in hippocampal progenitor cells. We found that Dyrk1 is activated and phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB during neuronal differentiation. In addition, Dyrk1 activation induces CRE-mediated gene transcription. These findings suggest that Dyrk1 may play an important role during neurogenic factor-induced differentiation of central nervous system (CNS) neuronal cells. The following materials were purchased.

As gifts, pCRE-TK-Luc and pTK-Luc constructs were received from K. Saeki (Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan). The plasmids encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged pSVL-HA-Dyrk1A and mutant type K188R were provided by W. Becker (Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, RWTH, Aachen, Germany). The bait vector for yeast two-hybrid assay was constructed by subcloning the mutant CREB cDNA, in which RRPSY (amino acid 130–134) was replaced by RRSLY, into pHybTrp/Zeo vector. Human fetal cDNA library subcloned into prey vector (pACT2) was purchased from CLONTECH. The yeast strain L40, containing the reporter genes lacZ and HIS3downstream of the LexA promoter, was sequentially transformed with bait vector followed by cDNA library vectors and then plated on a synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan residue. After incubating the plates for 10–14 days at 30 °C, the transformants were tested with a synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan residue and containing 50 µg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoryl-d-galactoside. After incubation for 2–3 days at 30 °C, the yeast colonies showing blue color were selected as positive clones. The positive clone plasmids were extracted from yeast in lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1.0 mm EDTA and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α using electroporation. Sequences of the inserts in positive library plasmids were analyzed by automatic DNA sequencer (ALF express, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). H19-7 cells were generated from rat embryonic hippocampal neurons (9Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). They were conditionally immortalized by stable transfection with temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin under G418 selection throughout the experiments. To induce neuronal differentiation, the cells were placed in N2 medium and shifted to 39 °C before treatment with differentiating agents as previously described (10Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test the effect of Dyrk1 activation on the neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells, the cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either wild type or kinase-inactive Dyrk1 at 33 °C for 24 h. Then the cells were switched to N2 medium, cultured at 39 °C for 48 h, treated with bFGF, and analyzed for morphological changes with a optical microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Differentiated cells were defined as cells with a rounded and refractory cell body containing at least one neurite whose length was greater than the cell body diameter. To prepare cell lysates, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmNa2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were scraped, and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kit. The H19-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells per well in 100-mm-diameter dishes. When the cell confluency was 70∼90%, the cells were transfected with suitable plasmid constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Where indicated, luciferase reporter construct, pCRE-TK-Luc, was transiently co-transfected with kinase-inactive Dyrk1 mutant (K188R), and the luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer (EG & G Berhold, Germany). In every transfection experiment the CRE-lacking thymidine kinase (TK) promoter construct (pTK-Luc) was used as a negative control. One microgram of either monoclonal anti-Dyrk1 or polyclonal anti-CREB antibodies was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 300 µg of cell extracts prepared using lysis buffer. Forty microliter of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the cell lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling the samples in PAGE sample buffer, and whole samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel. The whole cell lysates were separated through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Japan). The membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat dry milk for 3 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk containing either anti-phospho CREB, anti-CREB, or anti-Dyrk1 (Becton Dickinson). The membrane was then washed several times in TBST and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase antibodies. After 1 h, the blot was washed several times with TBST and developed with ECL reagents. H19-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and switched to N2 medium before differentiation for 2 days at 39 °C. The cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of bFGF, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer. Then 300 µg of protein was incubated with monoclonal Dyrk1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immuno-complexes were added to 40 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation, the samples were washed three times in lysis buffer, and the kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in 20 µl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mmMnCl2, 200 µm sodium orthovanadate, 5 µg of acid-treated enolase, 10 µm ATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 µg of either bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CREB or mutant GST-CREB (S133A) as a substrate. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiograpy. Immortalized hippocampal H19-7 cells differentiate in response to bFGF at 39 °C, the temperature at which the simian virus 40 large T antigen is not active (11Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In an earlier work we have shown that CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription play an important role during bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells and that the activation of novel protein kinase-signaling pathways is required for bFGF-responsiveness (12Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). During the differentiation of H19-7 cells, Ser-133 residue in the CREB protein was phosphorylated rapidly and sustained for 1–2 h after growth factor stimulation. In addition, the activation of two previously unreported CREB kinases in response to bFGF was observed by using in vitro in-gel kinase assays (12Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, in order to isolate the novel CREB kinase(s) we undertook yeast two-hybrid assays by using mutant CREB mutant in which the critically regulatory Pro-132–Ser-133 residues of CREB had been mutated to Ser-132–Leu-133 as bait. As a result of the screening of human fetal brain cDNA library, we identified a number of unknown as well as previously reported CREB-interacting genes, for example, histone deacetylase (34Chariot A. van Lint C. Chapelier M. Gielen J. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4007-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), retinoblatoma-binding protein 4 (35Zhang Q. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and zinc finger protein ZEB. A BLAST search revealed that one of the isolated clones encodes a partial clone of mammalian homolog of yeast minibrain kinase, Dyrk1. Because Dyrk1 was known to be important in the cell cycle control in neuronal cells and implicated in the pathogenesis of DS mental retardation, we chose Dyrk1 as a target for further analysis. Next we examined whether Dyrk1 specifically binds to CREB in mammalian neuronal cells and how the neurogenic growth factor affects the expression of Dyrk1 during neuronal differentiation. The H19-7 cell extracts obtained after the stimulation with neurogenic bFGF were immunoprecipitated against anti-Dyrk1 antibodies and then blotted with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies. As shown in Fig.1A, the expression of Dyrk1 protein with 105 kDa was not induced by bFGF, whereas significant levels were constitutively expressed in H19-7 cells. Although there was no complex formation without any stimulation, the addition of bFGF led to an increase of Dyrk1 binding to phosphorylated CREB. In the following experiment, the cells were either not transfected (Fig.1 C) or transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild type Dyrk1 (Fig. 1 B). Then the cells were stimulated with bFGF under differentiating conditions, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated against either anti-CREB or anti-phospho-CREB antibodies, and the protein mixtures were analyzed using anti-HA tag (Fig. 1 B) or anti-Dyrk1 IgG (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the previous finding, bFGF stimulation promoted the formation of binding complex between Dyrk1 and phospho-CREB in H19-7 cells. A construct encoding dominant-negative Dyrk1 was used to block the activation of Dyrk1. When the kinase-inactive K188R Dyrk1 (pSVL-HA-Dyrk1A/K188R), in which critical Lys-188 residue in the catalytic domain of Dyrk1 was converted to Arg-188 (13Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was transiently transfected into the cells, the specific binding of Dyrk1 to active CREB markedly decreased in response to bFGF (Fig. 1,A–C). As a control for protein loading, we measured the amount of immunoprecipitated CREB by Western blot analysis. In all samples, CREBs were present at the same levels (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that Dyrk1 specifically binds to active CREB in response to neurogenic growth factor. Because Dyrk1 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation loop of the catalytic domain (14Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we examined whether Dyrk1 is also activated by bFGF. After cells were stimulated with bFGF, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated against anti-Dyrk1 antibodies, and the precipitated Dyrk1-bound mixtures were analyzed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.2, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dyrk1 increased in response to bFGF. Compared with the control cells, the overexpression of kinase-dead Dyrk1 mutants by transient transfection extensively repressed the Dyrk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the addition of bFGF induces Dyrk1 activation. Differences in CREB phosphorylation are known to be critical in the determination and regulation of both mitogenic factor-mediated proliferation and neurotrophin-mediated differentiation in neuronal PC12 cells (15Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Like PC12 cells, H19-7 cells also respond differentially to EGF and bFGF (12Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature (33 °C) EGF treatment induces proliferation, whereas at the nonpermissive temperature (39 °C), the addition of either FGF or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, but not EGF, induces differentiation (9Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Eves E.M. Kwon J. Downen M. Tucker M.S. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to prolonged CREB phosphorylation by neurogenic bFGF, the addition of EGF induces transient CREB phosphorylation. These findings from previous studies imply that stable CREB activation by bFGF is important in deciding the fate of hippocampal progenitor cell to terminally differentiate to neuronal cell (12Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether Dyrk1 activation is selectively induced during neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells, the cells were stimulated with either EGF under mitogenic conditions or bFGF under differentiation conditions. Then immunoprecipitation was performed with the cell lysates using anti-Dyrk1 antibodies followed by Western blot analysis against an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine residue to detect Dyrk1 activation. Compared with a stable but slight activation of Dyrk1 within 2 h after EGF stimulation (Fig.3A), a transient but significant phosphorylation of Dyrk1 was observed upon the stimulation with bFGF reaching the maximum peak at 1 h (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the addition of either EGF at 39 °C or bFGF at 33 °C failed to induce a significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Dyrk (Fig.3 C). These data indicate the differential activation of Dyrk1 in response to mitogenic and neurogenic growth factor. In particular, Dyrk1 activation may contribute to neuronal differentiation by neurogenic bFGF in the H19-7 cells.Figure 3Selective activation of Dyrk1 in response to neurogenic bFGF , but not mitogenic EGF , in H19-7 cells. Where specified, H19-7 cells were stimulated with either 50 ng/ml EGF or 10 ng/ml bFGF for the indicated times. The Dyrk1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the Dyrk1-bound protein mixtures were blotted with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibodies. The quantity of immunoprecipitated Dyrk1 kinase was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-Dyrk1 antibodies (lower panel). All expressed results are representative of two independent experiments.A, EGF at 33 °C; B, bFGF at 39 °C;C, EGF at 39 °C (top panel) and bFGF at 33 °C (bottom panel). IP, immunoprecipitation; No T, no treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we investigated whether active Dyrk1 could phosphorylate CREB. The H19-7 cell lysates obtained after bFGF treatment were immunoprecipitated using anti-Dyrk1 antibodies, and immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using bacterially expressed GST fusion protein with either wild type CREB or S133A mutant CREB as a substrate. Phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4, CREB phosphorylation was remarkably induced by bFGF. Furthermore, transient transfection of kinase-deficient Dyrk1 significantly diminished the bFGF-induced CREB phoshorylation, whereas overexpression, in a similar way, of wild type Dyrk1 proteins caused a remarkable induction of CREB phosphorylation compared with the control cells. When GST-CREB S133A, encoding CREB mutant, in which Ser-133 residue was substituted to Ala-133, was used as a substrate, there was no significant phosphorylation of CREB (Fig.4). In addition, the effect of kinase-inactive Dyrk1 on the CREB phosphorylation was examined in H19-7 cells (Fig.5). Consistent with the previous finding that phospho-CREB selectively binds to active Dyrk1, the addition of bFGF induced a marked CREB phosphorylation. Furthermore, the overexpression of dominant-negative Dyrk1 in a transient manner remarkably attenuated the CREB phosphorylation upon the stimulation with bFGF compared with the control cells (Fig. 5). These data suggest that Dyrk1 directly phosphorylates the Ser-133 residue of transcription factor CREB during neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells.Figure 5Effect of kinase-deficient Dyrk1 on bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation. Where indicated, H19-7 cells were treated with vehicle or transiently transfected with 5 µg of plasmid encoding kinase-deficient Dyrk1. Then, the cells were either untreated (N) or stimulated with 10 ng/ml of bFGF for 1 h under differentiating condition. Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis using the antibodies against CREB, Dyrk1, or phosphorylated CREB. N, no treatment; C, control; MT, kinase-inactive Dyrk1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether Dyrk1 exerts its stimulatory effect on CRE-mediated gene transcription as well as on CREB activation, the gene expression of CRE-containing TK promoter-reporter construct was assayed in response to bFGF (Fig.6). Treatment of H19-7 cells with bFGF resulted in the increase of CRE-mediated gene transcription in a time-dependent manner, and it reached a plateau after 4 h (12Sung J.Y. Shin S.W. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13858-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test the role of Dyrk1 activation on CRE-mediated gene transcription, the cells were transfected transiently with pCRE-TK-Luc reporter plasmid plus an expression vector encoding kinase-inactive Dyrk1 mutants (pSVL-HA-Dyrk1A/K188R). Whereas the addition of bFGF led to an increase of CRE-mediated reporter luciferase activity, the expression of kinase-deficient Dyrk1 proteins with the mutation of critical Lys-188 residue significantly inhibited the activation of luciferase activity triggered by bFGF (Fig. 6). Taken together, these findings implied that neurogenic bFGF causes the activation of CRE-mediated gene transcription, possibly through the activation of Dyrk1 and subsequent CREB phosphorylation in embryonic CNS hippocampal cells. The functional role of Dyrk1 activation during neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells was further examined. After treatment with bFGF, most of the H19-7 cells displayed neurite extension at 39 °C at which the large T-antigen is inactive (Fig.7A). The differentiated cells were shown to be resistant to mitogenic stimulation by serum and to express neuronal markers such as neurofilament and brain type II sodium channel (9Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Eves E.M. Kwon J. Downen M. Tucker M.S. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The capability of the H19-7 cells to differentiate in response to bFGF is similar to the response of primary hippocampal cells during late embryogenesis, since bFGFs act as a differentiating factor in certain CNS regions, such as the hippocampus, to express bFGF receptor (33Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After a plasmid encoding either wild type or dominant-negative Dyrk1 was transfected into the cells, the formation of neurite outgrowth was subsequently analyzed. As shown in Fig.7 A, the vehicle-transfected control cells displayed a similar percentage of differentiated cells (∼68%) in two separate transfection experiments. However, cells in the mutant Dyrk1-transfected population exhibited only 26% differentiated cells (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, transient transfection of wild type Dyrk1 had no apparent effect on the neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells (Fig. 7 A). These results suggest that Dyrk activation is likely to play an important role in the differentiation of neuronal H19-7 cells. The participation of Dyrk1 or other Dyrk-related kinases in any particular signal transduction pathway has not been elucidated so far. The selective recognition of the correct substrate by protein kinase is an important biochemical mechanism that underlies the specificity of cellular responses to various stimuli (13Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine the nature of Dyrk substrate to understand its function in the regulation of cellular responses. Previously, Dyrk was shown to be required for the proliferation of distinct neuronal cell types during postembryonic neurogenesis in Drosophila (4Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mutant flies with a reduced Dyrk1 expression have a reduced number of neurons in distinct areas of the adult brain and exhibit specific behavioral defects (4Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the cellular Dyrk1 substrate and its functional role during neuronal differentiation in hippocampal H19-7 cells. We have shown that Dyrk1 is activated by neurogenic bFGF but not by mitogenic EGF and that active Dyrk1 stimulates CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription. Our data strongly suggest that Dyrk1 may play an important role during neurogenic factor-induced differentiation in CNS neuronal cells. Such a role was further supported by the finding that the expression of kinase-deficient Dyrk1 in a transient manner remarkably attenuates the formation of differentiated cells. We have shown that the kinase-inactive Dyrk mutant could block bFGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 5). Since this mutant does not bind to CREB (Fig. 1), the effect in Fig. 5 might not be due to the competition between endogenous and kinase-deficient Dyrk1 for CREB. Rather, it shows that if the kinase-inactive mutant is working specifically, then it must act by binding to the site that normally activates Dyrk1 and competing with endogenous Dyrk1 there. Since there could be other effectors that might also be activated at this site, such as non-Dyrk1 proteins, then the kinase-minus Dyrk mutant might block more than Dyrk1-mediated effects. The Dyrk1 protein contains several striking structural features, such as a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a PEST region, repetitively present 17-serine/threonine residues, and an activation loop (YQY motif) between subdomain VII and VIII (14Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Dyrk1 is localized to the cell nucleus (17Song W.J. Chung S.H. Kurnit D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), hence gaining the potential to control the expression of other genes. A green fluorescent protein-Dyrk1A fusion protein was found in the nucleus of transfected COS-7 or HEK293 cells (6Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Song W.J. Chung S.H. Kurnit D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this kinase has been shown to be a dual specificity protein kinase regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation loop (14Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This suggests that Dyrk1 might be a component of a signaling pathway regulating nuclear events, but exactly how Dyrk1 is involved in this mechanism has not been elucidated so far. The present study, showing as it does that Dyrk1 is activated by bFGF and could activate CREB and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription, strongly supports the idea that Dyrk1 controls the expression of a certain gene(s). It is possible that gene dosage for such a protein could alter the expression of downstream genes and contribute to the welter of phenotypic effects seen in DS (17Song W.J. Chung S.H. Kurnit D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also found that bFGF does not affect the expression of Dyrk1 and that significant levels of Dyrk1 continue to be constitutively expressed in H19-7 cells. This is in good accordance with previous reports that Dyrk1 is expressed strongly in the brain from embryonic rat (18Okui M. Ide T. Morita K. Funakoshi E. Ito F. Ogita K. Yoneda Y. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1999; 62: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and ubiquitously but most abundantly in CNS regions of 17-day mouse embryo, such as in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and the hippocampus (19Rahmani Z. Lopes C. Rachidi M. Delabar J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Song W.J. Sternberg L.R. Kasten-Sportes C. Keuren M.L. Chung S.H. Slack A.C. Miller D.E. Glover T.W. Chiang P.W. Lou L. Kurnit D.M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Neuronal activity plays a critical role in many forms of synaptic plasticity such as learning and memory (21Bear M.F. Kleinschmidt A. Gu Q.A. Singer W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 909-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the formation of long term memory indicate that the induction of immediate early genes is often associated with memory storage (22Rose S.P. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 390-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Mello C.V. Vicario D.S. Clayton D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6818-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The immediate early gene products are thought to activate late effector genes, which alter the structural and functional properties of nerve cells. Although the molecular mechanism by which neuronal activity is coupled to the alteration in gene expression is poorly understood, CREB phosphorylation appears to be important in mediating the expression of several immediate early genes (24Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 25Konradi C. Cole R.L. Heckers S. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5623-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CREB has been implicated in the formation of long term memory. CREB supports memory in various organisms that perform different behavioral tasks, from simple reflexes in mollusks to complex emotional behaviors in mammals. For example, blockade of CREB activation by injection of CRE-containing oligonucleotides has been found to impede long term facilitation, a correlate of memory in the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica (26Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice with a deletion in the CREB gene and Drosophila melanogaster expressing a repressor form of CREB show deficits in long term memory without any effect on short term memory (27Bourtchuladze R. Frenguelli B. Blendy J. Cioffi D. Schutz G. Silva A.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar, 28Yin J.C. Wallach J.S. Del Vecchio M. Wilder E.L. Zhou H.

Cell. 1995; 81: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The CNS limbic system, including the hippocampus, plays a critical role in the processes of emotional behavior, memory, integration of homeostatic responses, sexual behavior, and motivation. The transgenic mice overexpressing Dyrk1 in the forebrain, including the hippocampus, show significant defects in learning and memory as well as long term potentiation (29Bartsch D. Bourtchuladze R. Patterson S. Chen A. Small S. Karl K.A. Lacefield C. Kandel E.R. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 804Google Scholar, 30Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C. Marti E. Visa J. Guimera J. Oset M. Gonzalez J.R. Florez J. Fillat C. Estivill X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging indicates a lower level of metabolic activity in the hippocampus of these mice (29Bartsch D. Bourtchuladze R. Patterson S. Chen A. Small S. Karl K.A. Lacefield C. Kandel E.R. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 804Google Scholar). Underlying these changes are anatomical deficits in the expression of hippocampal synaptic and axonal markers. Furthermore, with progressing age, transgenic mice show a significant reduction in hippocampal volume and a concomitant enlargement in ventricular size, suggesting that the overexpression of Dyrk may affect postnatal hippocampal development. Down's syndrome is a developmental disorder. Individuals with DS have a higher incidence of complicated medical problems (31Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 51: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For example, children with DS are at increased risk for congenital heart defects and have increased susceptibility to infection, respiratory problems, obstructed digestive tracts, and childhood leukemia. Adults with DS are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Most people with DS have some level of mental retardation. The secondary messenger cAMP regulates a striking number of physiological processes, including intermediary metabolism, cellular proliferation, and neuronal signaling, by altering the basic pattern of gene expression via a conserved CRE motif. In addition, CREB phosphorylation appears to be important in mediating the expression of various kinds of genes and in the formation of long term memory, as described previously. Based on the findings presented here that Dyrk1 activates CREB during neuronal differentiation in CNS hippocampal cells, further analysis of the upstream signaling pathways activated by various neurogenic growth factors may give deeper insights into the mechanism of neuronal differentiation mediated by Dyrk1 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2111589125,"Calcium-activated protein for secretion (CAPS) is proposed to play an essential role in Ca2+-regulated dense-core vesicle exocytosis in vertebrate neuroendocrine cells. Here we report the cloning, mutation, and characterization of the Drosophila ortholog (dCAPS). Null dCAPS mutants display locomotory deficits and complete embryonic lethality. The mutant NMJ reveals a 50% loss in evoked glutamatergic transmission, and an accumulation of synaptic vesicles at active zones. Importantly, dCAPS mutants display a highly specific 3-fold accumulation of dense-core vesicles in synaptic terminals, which was not observed in mutants that completely arrest synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Targeted transgenic CAPS expression in identified motoneurons fails to rescue dCAPS neurotransmission defects, demonstrating a cell nonautonomous role in synaptic vesicle fusion. We conclude that dCAPS is required for dense-core vesicle release and that a dCAPS-dependent mechanism modulates synaptic vesicle release at glutamatergic synapses."

The ORF3 protein of HEV appears to be the first example of a SH3 domain-binding protein encoded by a virus that causes an acute and primarily self-limited infection. hepatitis E virus Src homology extracellular signal-regulated kinase open reading frame mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis binding domain activation domain synthetic dextrose myelin basic protein phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase tetracycline response element hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus Hepatitis E virus (HEV),1 the causative agent for hepatitis E, is a waterborne pathogen endemic to much of the developing world where it causes rampant sporadic infections and large scale epidemics (1Purcell R.H.

The studies on HEV biology and pathogenesis have been severely restricted by the lack of a reliable cell culture system and small animal models of viral infection. We have used subgenomic expression strategies to study the properties and functions of individual HEV gene products toward understanding viral replication and pathogenicity (9Panda S.K. Nanda S.K. Zafrullah M. Ansari I.H. Ozdener M.H. Jameel S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Kumar R. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HEV genome is a ∼7.5-kilobase polyadenylated, positive-sense RNA that contains three open reading frames (ORFs) designated ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 (13Tam A.W. Smith M.M. Guerra M.E. Huang C.C. Bradley D.W. Fry K.E. Reyes G.R. Virology. 1991; 185: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The ORF3 of HEV encodes a protein of ∼13.5 kDa, called pORF3, for which no function has been assigned. When expressed in animal cells, pORF3 is phosphorylated at a single serine residue (Ser80) in its 123-amino acid primary sequence (11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation experiments suggested that pORF3 may be a substrate for the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and subcellular fractionation revealed its association with the cytoskeleton (11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results using inhibitors, activators, and dominant negative alleles show that pORF3 is a substrate for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as well as the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase members of the MAP kinase superfamily of enzymes. 2S. Jameel, unpublished results.2S. Jameel, unpublished results. These observations suggest a possible role for pORF3 in the cellular signal transduction pathway. Another clue that pORF3 may have a potential role in cell signaling is the presence of proline-rich (P XXP) sequences, which are conserved among different isolates of HEV (Fig. 1). Such P XXP motifs are part of polyproline helices found in a number of viral and cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and bind the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains found in a diverse group of signal-transducing molecules (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 15Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Another well characterized modular signaling domain that mediates selective protein-protein interactions is the SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 15Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The SH2/SH3 domain-containing enzymes and adaptors form distinct multiprotein complexes for transducing the extracellular signals to downstream effectors leading to the regulation of cellular responses (16Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, 17Mayer B.J. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 439-452Google Scholar). A number of viral proteins are known to bind these host cell proteins to either interfere with or promote signal transduction for the benefit of viral replication, persistence, or evasion from host responses (18Krajcsi P. Wold W.S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we show that pORF3 binds some SH3 domain-containing proteins through one of its P XXP motifs. We have developed models for the binding of a proline-rich region in pORF3 to the SH3 domains of two proteins: c-Src, a protein tyrosine kinase, and Grb2, an adaptor protein. Further, in cells stably expressing pORF3, we present evidence for (a) specific association of an 80-kDa protein (p80) with pp60src and (b) increased activity and nuclear localization of ERK, a member of the MAP kinase family of enzymes. The functional consequences of these observations for HEV pathogenesis are discussed. Vectors for the prokaryotic expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused SH3 domains were generously provided by Dr. I. Gout and Dr. M. J. Waterfield (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom), Dr. R. Ren (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA), and Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). The expression vector pRSET-ORF3 has been described previously (9Panda S.K. Nanda S.K. Zafrullah M. Ansari I.H. Ozdener M.H. Jameel S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pRSET-ORF3(Δ92–123), pRSET-ORF3(Δ78–123), and pRSET-ORF3(S80A) expressing mutant ORF3 proteins were generated by subcloning appropriate fragments (11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into plasmid pRSET-B (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Plasmid pRSET-ORF3(Mex), expressing an ORF3 protein from the Mexican isolate of HEV, contained a NcoI/EcoRI fragment from plasmid pBS-HEV-MRP14-1 (a kind gift of Dr. A. Tam, Genelab Technologies, Redwood City, CA) in pRSET-B. The vector for expression of ORF3 in animal cells, pMT-ORF3, has been described previously (12Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Kumar R. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of pORF3 in insect cells, recombinant baculoviruses were constructed using the transfer vector pBacPak-ORF3. 3D. Sehgal, unpublished results. The cloning of the nef gene of HIV-1 has been described elsewhere (19Ahmad K.M. Mujtaba S. Das R. Zafrullah M. Sehgal S. Jameel S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 1998; 14: 1491-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRSET-Nef, expressing a full-length Nef protein from HIV-1 subtype C, was constructed by subcloning a ∼650-base pair EcoRI/BamHI nef fragment into plasmid pRSET-B. Polyclonal antibodies to the HEV ORF3 protein have been described previously (11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-v-Src (Ab-1) from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA) or anti-c-Src (SRC 2), anti-Src-agarose conjugate (N-16), and anti-Grb2 (C-7) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) and anti-ERK1 (K-23) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-p44/42 and anti-phospho-p44/42 from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and anti-hexahistidine tag fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The ORF3 gene was subcloned as a BamHI/HindIII fragment into the EcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA1neo (Invitrogen). Following transfection of U2-OS human osteosarcoma cells with pcDNA-ORF3, colonies were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). A number of independent clones were selected and screened for pORF3. Control cell lines stably integrated with the pcDNA1neo vector were similarly developed. The stable cell lines were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. The COS-1, HEK293, and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transiently transfected as described elsewhere (10Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later under “Analysis of MAP Kinase Activity.” Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum unless stated otherwise. Where required, serum starvation was carried out for 4–6 h in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Labeling of cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine or [32P]orthophosphate was carried out as described previously (11Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For harvest, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and unless stated otherwise, the monolayers were dissolved in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4and 5 mm NaF). Wherever a protease inhibitor mixture was used, it included 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml phenanthroline. The lysates were passed four times through a 23-gauge needle to shear the DNA and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min in a Biofuge 17RS (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). For immunoprecipitation, the desired amount of supernatant was made up to 500 μl and immunoprecipitated with the primary antibodies for 1 h on ice followed by the addition of 100 μl of a washed 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose and end-on mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed and analyzed further. The GST-SH3 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified as described (20Rosenberg I.M. Protein Analysis and Purification. Birkhauser, Boston1996: 343-344Google Scholar). The ORF3 protein was purified from E. coli as described previously (9Panda S.K. Nanda S.K. Zafrullah M. Ansari I.H. Ozdener M.H. Jameel S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sf21 insect cells were infected with ORF3 recombinant baculoviruses at an multiplicity of infection of 10, and the crude cell lysates were prepared in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNaPPi, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture and were used for binding experiments. For purification of the Nef protein, pRSET-Nef/DH5α cells were washed with sonication buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles in sonication buffer containing 10 μg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm PMSF, and sonicated four to five times with 1-min pulses. The clarified lysate was used to purify the Nef protein on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the recommendations of the supplier. The purified protein was eluted at 0.1–0.3 m imidazole. For the GST pull-down assay, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 2 μg of bound GST-SH3 were mixed with either 2 μg of E. coli-expressed pORF3 or a lysate from 1 × 106Sf21 insect cells in 500 μl of a GST binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 180 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation with mixing at 4 °C for 90 min, the beads were washed six times with GST binding buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 but no bovine serum albumin. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-ORF3 antibodies. For the filter binding assay, 2 μg of each GST-SH3 fusion protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C in GST binding buffer with about 30 μg of purified, biotinylated ORF3 protein. Biotinylation of pORF3 and subsequent Western blotting and detection steps were carried out with an ECL Protein Biotinylation Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the recommendations of the supplier. Glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 2 μg of the GST-SH3(Hck) fusion protein were mixed with 5 μg of purified pORF3 in the presence of increasing amounts of a 30-mer peptide (amino acids 92–121 of the Indian ORF3 sequence, Fig. 1 B). Alternatively, increasing amounts of the peptide were preincubated with the fusion protein-carrying beads at 4 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of pORF3. For competition between pORF3 and Nef for SH3 domain binding, 3 μg of pORF3 and increasing amounts of Nef were co-incubated with beads containing 2 μg of the fusion protein. Alternatively, 3 μg of Nef and increasing amounts of pORF3 were used. The binding and washes were carried out as described above for the GST pull-down assay. The beads were boiled in loading dye and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. Densitometric analysis was carried out with the Kodak ID Image Analysis Software (Kodak Digital Science). The ORF3 and Grb2 genes were cloned in-frame in the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) and activation domain (AD) vectors, respectively. For ORF3, a SmaI/BamHI fragment from plasmid pSG-ORF3 (10Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into plasmid pGBT9 (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 30: 245-246Crossref Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) to give pBD-ORF3. The truncated ORF3 mutant (Δ80–123) was constructed by digesting pBD-ORF3 with EagI and BamHI and religation of the remaining vector. For Grb2, a BamHI/NotI fragment from plasmid pGEX-Z1-Grb2 was first cloned into plasmid pSGI (10Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); a PstI fragment was then cloned into plasmid pGAD424 (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 30: 245-246Crossref Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) to give pAD-Grb2.Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 (MATa trp1-901 his3 leu2-3,112 ura3–52 ade2 gal4 gal80 URA3::GAL-lacZ LYS2::GAL-HIS3) cells were co-transformed by the LiCl method (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) with pAD-Grb2 and pBD-ORF3. Y190 contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. Single and co-transformants were plated on synthetic dextrose medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (SDTrp−Leu−His−) to select for clones in which the HIS3 gene was transactivated. Appropriate positive and negative controls were used. The β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a confluency of about 50% on coverslips in six-well plates and grown for 18 h. The PBS-washed cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 3 min, and then rehydrated with PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 5% normal donkey or goat serum for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies in PBS/0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% normal serum for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were monoclonal or polyclonal anti-ORF3 at 1:200 to 1:500, polyclonal anti-c-Src at 1:500 or 1:1000, or monoclonal anti-Grb2 at 1:400. Cells were washed thrice with PBST for 5 min each and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of conjugated secondary antibodies. For colocalization experiments, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to either Alexa488 or Alexa594 dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). These were chosen to always label pORF3 with Alexa488 (green) and Src or Grb2 with Alexa594 (red). For the MAPK and phospho-MAPK localization experiments, the secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Cells were washed as described earlier and mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS. Confocal images were collected using a 60× or 100× planapo objective in a Bio-Rad 1024 LSM attached to a Nikon inverted microscope. To prevent cross-talk in dual labeling experiments, only one dye was excited at a time, keeping the other channel completely closed. The images were processed in Confocal Assistant followed by Adobe Photoshop version 5.0. The three-dimensional structures of known SH3·ligand complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were used for generating a scaffold. For modeling the HEV pORF3 peptide RPSAPPLPHV (P-2) bound to the Src SH3 domain, the structure of c-Src complexed with the class I peptide RALPPLPRY (called RLP2) was used as a guiding model (PDB code 1RLQ). The complexes were energy minimized using AMBER (version 6.0) along with the forcefield parameters of Cornell et al. (23Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar). This included 500 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. A 10-Å cut-off for the nonbonded interactions and a distance-dependent dielectric constant were used. Subsequently the energy-minimized complex was solvated with a 5-Å shell of TIP3P water molecules. Torsion angle and interaction energy analysis was done using ANAL (AMBER version 6.0). The final models were displayed using INSIGHT-II (Molecular Simulations Inc.). A similar strategy was used to model the complex of P-2 and the Grb2 SH3 domain (PDB code 1SEM). The immune complex Src kinase assays were carried out as follows. Control pCneo and pORF3-expressing cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mm NaF. The cell lysates were quantitated for protein content using the Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad), and an equivalent amount of each lysate was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of agarose-conjugated anti-Src antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C with end-on mixing. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, and phosphatase inhibitors. The washed beads were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of acid-denatured enolase and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 6× SDS dye, boiled for 4 min, and subjected to SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then exposed to an x-ray film. The MAP kinase activity in cell lysates was assayed with a p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the recommendations of the supplier. This assay measured phosphorylation of the ERK substrate Elk-1. Alternatively an immunoprecipitation kinase assay was also carried out using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate. Equivalent amounts of each lysate were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the anti-ERK1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose as described above. The beads were washed thrice with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and once with a kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 mm NaF. The beads were then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of MBP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with 25 μl of 2× SDS dye, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then exposed to an x-ray film. The MAPK activity in transfected cells was determined using the In Vivo MAP Kinase Assay System (CLONTECH) according to the guidelines of the supplier. HEK293 cells were seeded at about 50% confluency in wells of a six-well plate the day before transfection. The cells were co-transfected with the required expression vectors using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (10Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical experiment to study the effect of pORF3 expression on cellular MAPK activity, cells in each well were co-transfected with three vectors: the transactivator vector pTet-Elk-1 (50 ng), the reporter vector pTRE-Luc (1 μg), and the ORF3 expression vector pMT-ORF3 (50 ng). All transfections were carried out in duplicates or triplicates. Other controls included transfections with 50 ng of plasmid pTet-Neg or pMT3 (expression vector for ORF3) to determine background signals or plasmid pTet-Off as positive control. Six hours post-transfection, cells were switched to complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and grown for an additional 12 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h during which time some control cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 12 h to ensure that the response was mediated by the Tet transactivator. Cell were washed twice with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and lysates were prepared in 200 μl of Cell Lysis Buffer supplied with the Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the supplier. Twenty microliters of each lysate was then assayed for luciferase activity as instructed in the assay manual. Two C-terminal proline-rich regions, P-1 (amino acids 75–86) and P-2 (amino acids 104–113), are conserved in pORF3 from various isolates of HEV (Fig. 1). Because similar P XXP motifs, including those found in other viral proteins, bind to SH3 domains found in signaling proteins, we tested the ability of pORF3 to interact with these domains from a number of such proteins. In a GST pull-down assay, pORF3 expressed in E. coli or insect cells bound to SH3 domains from Src family tyrosine kinases Src, Hck, and Fyn and the signaling proteins Grb2 and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (Fig. 2 A). No binding was observed with GST alone or with SH3 domains from Csk, Spectrin, and p130cas, while weak binding was observed with the SH3 domains of the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Crk although equivalent amounts of GST-SH3 fusion proteins were used to trap pORF3 on beads (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The interactions were also evaluated independently by a filter binding assay (Fig. 2 B), the results being consistent with those from the GST pull-down assay. The only exception was the SH3 domain of Abl, which bound to E. coli-expressed but not to insect cell-expressed pORF3 in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 A, lanes 12 and 25); no binding was observed in the filter binding assay as well (Fig. 2 B, lane 13). The binding of pORF3 to other SH3 domains was both specific and reproducible between the two assays. To test which of the two P XXP regions in pORF3 bound SH3 domains, we carried out GST pull-down assays using mutant ORF3 proteins (Fig. 1) and fusion proteins containing the Grb2 or Src SH3 domains. While the wild type pORF3 bound Grb2 and Src SH3 domains (Fig. 2 C, lane 3), the Δ92–123 or the Δ78–123 mutants did not (Fig. 2 C, lanes 6 and 7). A mutant of pORF3 in which Ser80 (in the P-1 region) was changed to alanine as well as pORF3 from the Mexican isolate of HEV, containing a conserved P-2 region but a variant P-1 region, also bound the GST-SH3(Grb2) and GST-SH3(Src) fusion proteins (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The Δ92–123 protein did not bind to any of the GST-SH3 fusion proteins in our panel in either of the two assays used (data not shown). These results showed the P-2 region of pORF3 to be necessary for its binding to SH3 domains. The binding of pORF3 to SH3 domains was further characterized by competition with a 30-mer synthetic peptide. Although the peptide included the entire P-2 region and its flanking sequences, it competed very poorly with the full-length ORF3 protein for SH3 domain binding (Fig. 3 A). Only at a 1000-fold molar excess of the peptide was there up to 90% reduction in pORF3 binding when the peptide was preincubated with the GST-SH3(Hck) beads prior to pORF3 binding. However, when pORF3 and the peptide were co-incubated with GST-SH3(Hck) beads, protein binding was reduced only by about 50% at a 1000-fold molar excess of the peptide. Thus, compared with pORF3 a peptide encompassing the P-2 region bound SH3 domains with reduced affinity. The interaction of HIV-1 Nef with SH3 domain-containing cellular proteins has been characterized in detail, and the binding affinities have been measured. Since Nef binds the Hck SH3 domain with high affinity, we carried out a competition analysis for binding of pORF3 and Nef to the GST-SH3(Hck) target. The results showed that pORF3 and Nef were equally effective in competing with each other for binding to the Hck SH3 domain (Fig. 3 B). To test if the interaction of pORF3 with SH3 domains took place in vivo as well, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and chose Grb2 as an example of the interacting part"

These enzymes synthesize neurotransmitters, e.g.catecholamines, serotonin, and nitric oxide (NO). We established mice unable to synthesize BH4 by disruption of the 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase gene, the encoded protein of which catalyzes the second step of BH4 biosynthesis. Homozygous mice were born at the almost expected Mendelian ratio, but died within 48 h after birth. In the brain of homozygous mutant neonates, levels of biopterin, catecholamines, and serotonin were extremely low. The number of TH molecules was highly dependent on the intracellular concentration of BH4 at nerve terminals. Alteration of the TH protein level by modulation of the BH4 content is a novel regulatory mechanism. Our data showing that catecholaminergic, serotonergic, and NO systems were differently affected by BH4 starvation suggest the possible involvement of BH4 synthesis in the etiology of monoamine-based neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Alteration in the metabolism of these monoamines leads to abnormalities in behavior and neuropsychiatric states. For example, increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic system induces hallucinations, illusions, and delusions, which are the major symptoms of schizophrenia (1Carlsson A. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1988; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of monoamines may be the cause of depression, because drugs that can increase the level of monoamines and blockers of norepinephrine or serotonin uptake show therapeutic effects in patients with depression (2Hirschfeld R.M. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2000; 61: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Abnormal monoamine metabolism is also suspected to be involved in Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Rett syndrome, and infantile autism (3Anderson G.M. Med. Biol. 1987; 65: 67-74PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cook E.H. Leventhal B.L. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1996; 8: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Biosynthesis of catecholamines and serotonin is mainly regulated by the activity of the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in catecholamine synthesis (5Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in 5HT synthesis (6Lovenberg W. Jaquier E. Sjoerdsma A. Science. 1967; 155: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The TH activity is tightly regulated by several factors (for review, see Ref. 7Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar and references therein). Short term regulation is achieved by phosphorylation of the enzyme and by feedback inhibition with the end products. Long term regulation is mainly governed at the transcriptional level.(6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for both TH and TPH. Although many cofactors such as folic acid and cobalamin (vitamin B12) are required to be dietary supplemented, mammals have a de novobiosynthetic pathway for BH4. In this pathway, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is converted to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate by GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH), and 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate is then converted to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin by pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS). This tetrahydropterin is subsequently converted to BH4 by sepiapterin reductase (Fig. 1A). The intracellular concentration of BH4 is mainly regulated by the activity of GCH. Factors that can stimulate GCH activity, for example, phytohemagglutinin (8Blau N. Joller P. Atares M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1985; 148: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ziegler I.

Reibnegger G. Yim J.J. Wachter H. Biochem.

Chem. 1959; 234: 2677-2682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) (13Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

Phenylalanine hydroxylase in the liver is essential for metabolism of the essential amino acid phenylalanine, and converts it to tyrosine. Nitric oxide (NO) has a variety of physiological roles. NO synthesized by neural NOS (nNOS) in neuron functions as a neurotransmitter, whereas that generated by NOS in endothelial cells serves as a vasodilator. Additionally, NO generated by inducible NOS (iNOS) in macrophages acts as a chemical mediator, and iNOS activity in these cells is strongly stimulated by lipopolysaccharide and cytokines.There are two types of inherited disorders that are caused by a genetic defect in BH4-synthesizing enzymes. One is atypical hyperphenylalaninemia (malignant type of phenylketonuria), which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Mutations in the BH4-synthesizing or BH4-recycling enzymes such as GCH, PTPS, or dihydropteridine reductase, cause this disease. In the patients, neurological symptoms, e.g. convulsion, drowsiness, and disturbance of muscle tone, are caused by decreased levels of neurotransmitters; e.g. catecholamines, 5HT, and NO, in addition to the excess amount of phenylalanine. The other is dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD; also called Segawa's disease). We found in 1994 that autosomal dominant mutations in the GCH gene cause this disease (15Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K. Tanaka H. Tsuji S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This disease is characterized by childhood-onset dystonia with remarkable responsiveness to low doses ofl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) (16Segawa M. Ohmi K. Itoh S. Aoyama M. Hayakawa H. Shinryo (Tokyo). 1971; 24: 667-672Google Scholar, 17Segawa M. Hosaka A. Miyagawa F. Nomura Y. Imai H. Eldrige R. Fahn S. Advances in Neurology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1976: 215-233Google Scholar). The DRD patients have both mutated and wild-type alleles of theGCH gene, and the resultant partial depletion of BH4 causes a shortage in DA in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the brain of DRD patients (15Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K. Tanaka H. Tsuji S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In these patients, there are no symptoms other than dystonia, and dysfunction of serotonergic neurons is not obvious, even though BH4 is a cofactor for both TH and TPH.In this present study, for the first time, we established BH4-deficient mice by disrupting the Ptps gene to investigate the effects of BH4 depletion on the animals and the involvement of BH4 in regulating neural systems. Our results indicated that BH4 distinctively regulates the synthesis of catecholamines altering the amount of TH protein and that of 5HT, and suggested that BH4 metabolism may be deeply involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, stress responses, and neuropsychiatric disorders.DISCUSSIONFor the first time, we established mice in which de novo biosynthesis of BH4 was impaired by disruption of thePtps gene, whose product catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. Homozygous mutants were born nearly according to the Mendelian law, but all of them died within 48 h. In the brain of newborn Ptps-null mutants, only a trace amount of biopterin was present in the brain, neopterin derived from 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate accumulated, and catecholamine and 5HT levels were markedly reduced. It was surprising that TH activity was selectively diminished compared with that of TPH and NOS, for BH4 is an essential cofactor for those enzymes as for TH. The reduction of TH activity was accompanied by a decreased amount of the enzyme only at the nerve terminals. Whereas a single administration of BH4 to the null mice led to a great increase in the 5HT content, 1 h after the administration, the DA content remained low. These results suggest differential action of BH4 between the regulation of catecholamines and that of 5HT in the brain.We observed accumulation of phenylalanine in the brain and liver of homozygous mutant mice. Most cases of hyperphenylalaninemia are caused by a genetic defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase. However, in ∼10% of the cases it is caused by genetic defects in biopterin metabolism. More than 400 patients were reported to have this “atypical” form of hyperphenylalaninemia, and ∼40% of them had the genetic defect in the PTPS gene (28Blau N Barnes I. Dhondt J.L. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presentPtps knockout mouse is an animal model for this type of atypical hyperphenylalaninemia.PTPS Knockout Mice Were Not Embryonically LethalDespite the dramatic change in BH4 and monoamine levels in the brain, homozygous mutants were born according to the Mendelian ratio, and no gross anomaly was seen by microscopic examination of major organs including the brain. The present result thus indicates that the Ptpsknockout mouse is not an embryonically lethal. Previous studies onTh knockout mice (26Kobayashi K. Morita S. Sawada H. Mizuguchi T. Yamada K. Nagatsu I.

Nature. 1995; 374: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and dopamine β-hydroxylase (Dbh) knockout mice (30Thomas S.A. Matsumoto A.M. Parmiter R.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) showed that catecholamines are essential for embryonic development, because these knockout mice diedin utero at a late stage of embryonic development or shortly after birth. Dbh knockout mice die at embryonic day 11 or 12 if the mother was also Dbh-null. Our findings raise the possibility that a minor side pathway for BH4 biosynthesis may exist, because it was reported that BH4 hardly passed through placenta (31Blau N. Kierat L. Matasovic A. Leimbacher W. Heizmann C.W. Guardamagna O. Ponzone A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 226: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).We succeeded in rescuing homozygous mutants from death for up to 7 days by intraperitoneal administration of BH4. BH4, being a hydrophilic molecule, is believed to hardly permeate into the blood-brain barrier. However, in the neonatal stage, peripherally administered BH4 could pass through the immature blood-brain barrier well and was incorporated into cells to increase neurotransmitter levels (Fig. 7). Their increase by administration of BH4 was more remarkable in the Ptpsknockout mice than in the wild-type mice. It is possible that a BH4 transporter or carrier protein to maintain the BH4 concentration constant in the cell exists.Mice lacking nNos (32Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1273-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), eNos (33Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashino H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), andiNos (34MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) were established by gene targeting. Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter and the circulate muscle layer along with the lack of NADPH-diaphorase-containing neurons occurred in thenNos knockout mice (32Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1273-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). eNos mutant mice were hypertensive, and acetylcholine-induced relaxation was absent in their vascular system (33Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashino H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Hypotension caused by endotoxin in wild-type mice was not observed in mice deficient in iNos, and antibacterial and anti-tumor activities in the latter were poor (34MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Since we did not subfractionate the brain homogenate, the NOS activity that we assayed was that of mixed types of NOS. However, the major subtype of NOS in the brain is nNOS in neurons, and iNOS activity remained low before induction with immunological stimulation including cytokines. Thus, the NOS activity that we assayed would mainly reflect that of nNOS. In the present study, the NOS activity was slightly reduced by the lack of BH4 in vitro, but no phenotype relating to NO systems was evident in vivo. We could not determine whether in vivo NO production was impaired or not, because the levels of NO metabolites such as nitrite and nitrate were too low to be quantified under the unstimulated condition. However, as the Km value (0.02–0.03 µm) of NOS against BH4 is very low (35Pastor C.M,. Williams D. Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. Singleton S. Naylor E. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24534-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the binding between BH4 and NOS protein may be so strong that a trace amount of BH4 may be sufficient for constitutive NOS activity. It is likely that depleted BH4 may affect the immune response or host defense mechanisms when iNOS induction is required. We are currently planning an experiment to examine this possibility.Cause of Death in PTPS Knockout MiceTh knockout mice, which were embryonic lethal but could be rescued by administration of l-DOPA orl-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine, died apparently of cardiovascular failure as shown by congestion in the liver and vessels and by an abnormal electrocardiogram (26Kobayashi K. Morita S. Sawada H. Mizuguchi T. Yamada K. Nagatsu I. Hata T. Watanabe Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27235-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Zhou Q.-Y. Qualfe C.J. Parmiter R.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although the cause of neonatal death in our Ptps knockout mice remains unclear, the severe decrease in catecholamine levels, bradycardia, and the marked reduction in TH immunoreactivity in sympathetic nerve terminals suggest that failure in the peripheral nervous system in addition to abnormality in the brain could be a causative factor leading to death. BH4 could be maternally supplied in utero; however, it would be gradually depleted after birth. This assumption is further supported by the prolonged survival period with administration of BH4. The mortality of Ptps knockout mice resembled that of Phox2a (36Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsh M.-R. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) or Nurr1-deficient mice (37Zetterström R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlman T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In the former, the locus ceruleus and subsets of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory ganglia were absent; and in the latter, TH-positive cells in the ventral midbrain were not generated. DA-deficient mice were reported to be hypoactive and showed a feeding disturbance after weaning (38Zhou Q.-Y. Palmiter R.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 1120-1197Google Scholar). However, as thinning out of littermates did not seem to be very helpful for survival of homozygous mutants ofPtps knockout mice (data not shown), simple competition with their littermates was not a critical factor. The phenylalanine content in the brain of homozygous mutant neonates was only 2 times higher than that of the wild type. The contribution of hyperphenylalaninemia to the early death seems to be low, as it is known that the symptom of human phenylketonuria is not remarkable at the neonatal stage, but becomes worse by intake of phenylalanine in the milk. Further, the level of 5HT also decreased in Ptps knockout mice, and NO system could be impaired by BH4 starvation. Although symptoms based on dysfunction of 5HT and NO systems were not observed in human PTPSdeficiency, these factors also may have contributed to the death of knockout mice.TH-positive Cells in the StriatumInterestingly, we found TH-positive cells in the striatum of the BH4-deficient mice, which cells were not detectable in the wild-type mice. AADC-positive cells were also not visible, and GCH-immunopositive cell bodies were not detected in the striatum of wild-type and homozygous mice. It is possible that TH- and/or AADC-positive cells in the wild type were masked by the extensively stained nerve terminals. However, such intrinsic TH-positive cells were also observed in the striatum of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions (39Tashiro Y. Sugimoto T. Hattori T. Uemura Y. Nagatsu I. Kikuchi H. Mizuno N. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 97: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (a dopaminergic neurotoxin that induces parkinsonism) (40Betarbet R. Turner R. Chockkan V. DeLong M.R. Allers K.A. Walters J. Levey A.I. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6761-6768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these cells were reported to be increased in number after the treatment. In the latter case, the cells were reported to be doubly positive when stained with anti-TH and anti-DA transporter antibodies, and they were further reactive with anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) antibodies. TH-positive neurons in the striatum were also observed in DA transporter knockout mice, in which the DA content and TH protein were reduced by 95 and 90%, respectively (41Jaber M. Dumartin B. Sagné C. Haycock J.W. Roubert C. Giros B. Bloch B. Caron M.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Physiological and pathological meanings of these cells are still unclear; however, they could represent an endogenous mechanism compensating for DA deficiency in the striatum and may be common in BH4-and/or DA-deficient states of the human brain.Differential Regulation of Monoaminergic Neurons by BH4The fact that catecholaminergic, serotonergic, and NO systems were differently affected by BH4 starvation was clearly shown by our results. In the catecholaminergic system, depletion of BH4 resulted in a reduced level of TH protein (accompanied by reduced TH activity) at nerve terminals. A reduction in TH immunoreactivity was observed in the striatum and sympathetic nerve terminals, whereas cell bodies of catecholaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and locus ceruleus, as well as adrenomedullary cells, were well stained with the anti-TH antibody. In the serotonergic system, however, TPH activity was not affected by the severe reduction in the BH4 level. These differences were clearly reflected by responses to acute BH4 administration. In the Ptps knockout mice, the 5HT content in the brain was dramatically increased 60 min after the administration, although the DA content was only slightly elevated. These differences were also observed to a lesser extent even in normal animals, which could synthesize BH4 (Fig. 7, B andC).The BH4 concentration in the cell had been thought to be not high enough to saturate TH (42Kettler R. Bartholini G. Pletscher A. Nature. 1974; 249: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Levine R.A. Miller L.P. Lovenberg W. Science. 1981; 214: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 44Miwa S. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, our results showed that acute administration of BH4 to the wild-type mice was not effective to increase the DA content in the brain, although the biopterin content in the brain was elevated up to 7-fold of that of the vehicle-injected mice (Fig. 7). Instead, BH4 depletion caused a reduction in the content of TH protein. These findings suggest that BH4 regulates the catecholamine synthesis through altering the amount of TH molecules, especially at nerve terminals.One possible explanation for the reduction only at nerve terminals would be that TH forms a stable complex with BH4 and/or catecholamines, and that only the stable complex is carried to nerve terminals through axonal flow. We showed previously that human TH shows regulatory kinetic properties for BH4 (45Nasrin S. Ichinose H. Hidaka H. Nagatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Flatmark et al. (46Flatmark T. Almås B. Knappskog P.M. Berge S.V. Svebak R.M. Chehin R. Muga A. Martı́nez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 840-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also observed the negative cooperativity of BH4 binding to TH. On the other hand, TH has been reported to make a stable and inactive complex with catechol compounds (47Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2633-2635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that TH is carried to the terminals with or without BH4. TH protein and mRNA levels are normal in neural cell bodies because that is where the protein is synthesized. A shortened half-life would only be revealed at nerve terminals where TH accumulates. We observed an additional immunoreactive band of small molecular size in the brain homogenate ofPtps-null mutants by Western blot analysis (data not shown), which could represent degraded TH protein. Although more study is required to clarify the molecular mechanism, these data strongly suggest that the turnover of TH protein is very rapid in the absence of the biopterin cofactor.A similar reduction in the level of TH protein only in the striatum was shown also in patients with DRD (Segawa's disease). DRD is caused by disturbed BH4 synthesis (15Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K. Tanaka H. Tsuji S. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Autopsied brains of patients with the disease showed a marked reduction in the content of TH protein in the striatum (48Rajput A.H. Gibb W.R. Zhong X.H. Shannak K.S. Kish S. Chang L.G. Hornykiewicz O. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 49Furukawa Y. Nygaard T.G. Gütlich M. Rajput A.H. Pifl C. DiStefano L. Chang L.J. Price K. Shimadzu M. Hornykiewicz O. Haycock J.W. Kish S.J. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our present results would explain the reason why only dysfunction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is apparent, and why serotonergic systems can function properly in the DRD patients. Because of decreased synthesis of BH4, the amount of TH protein carried to the nerve terminal is reduced. At the nerve terminal (striatum), although a small amount of BH4 is present there, the ability to synthesize DA is not sufficient due to the decreased number of the TH molecules. In the case of serotonergic neurons, the stability of the TPH protein is not affected by depletion of BH4. Thus, the number of TPH molecules at the nerve terminal is the same as the normal one, and a sufficient amount of 5HT can be synthesized, although the rate of de novosynthesis of BH4 is partly impaired. The presence of a recycling system powered by dihydropteridine reductase may help to facilitate the monoamine synthesis through re-redox of quinonoid-dihydrobiopterin, which is formed from the reaction with aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, to BH4.Reduction in the Level of TH Protein in the Striatum Was Reversed by BH4 AdministrationOur results also showed that the reduction in the TH protein level was reversible by supplementation with BH4. Intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg BH4 increased TH activity in the brain even after 1 h, and this increase was remarkable in mice continuously injected with 50 mg/kg BH4 for 7 days. This is a novel regulatory mechanism for TH protein by BH4.In the brain of homozygous mutant mice, DA and 5HT levels were very low (16 and 5%, respectively, of those of ascorbic acid-treated heterozygous mice), although the BH4 level was elevated up to 44% of the control 24 h after the last of the repeated injections of 50 mg/kg BH4 (Table II). The low levels of 5HT and DA would be explained by the time after the last injection. We think that the local concentration of BH4 in monoaminergic neurons would not be as high as 44% of the control, because BH4 incorporated into monoaminergic neurons might be consumed during the 24 h before the analysis was made.There have been several reports describing the dissociation betweenTh mRNA levels and expression of the enzyme activity (7Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For example, a transgenic mouse bearing extra copies of the humanTH gene expressed the transgene mRNA in dopaminergic neurons at levels 50 times over that of the endogenous gene. Despite this increase in the amount of mRNA, TH immunoreactivity and enzyme activity in the striatum were altered by only 2–3-fold (50Kaneda N. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi K. Kiuchi K. Nagatsu I.

A part of the dissociation between Th mRNA and the protein could be explained by the stabilizing effect of the cofactor.In summary, our results showed that the amount of TH protein at the nerve terminal is governed by the intracellular concentration of BH4, that transient elevation in the BH4 content increases the biosynthesis of 5HT but not that of catecholamines, and that a continuous elevated level of BH4 leads to an increase in the catecholamine levels. We think that this paper opens a new insight into regulation of monoamines by BH4. Catecholamines, e.g. dopamine (DA),1 norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) are well known to be involved in many aspects of brain function, including mood, addiction, reward, and sleep. Alteration in the metabolism of these monoamines leads to abnormalities in behavior and neuropsychiatric states. For example, increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic system induces hallucinations, illusions, and delusions, which are the major symptoms of schizophrenia (1Carlsson A. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1988; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of monoamines may be the cause of depression, because drugs that can increase the level of monoamines and blockers of norepinephrine or serotonin uptake show therapeutic effects in patients with depression (2Hirschfeld R.M. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2000; 61: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Abnormal monoamine metabolism is also suspected to be involved in Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Rett syndrome, and infantile autism (3Anderson G.M. Med.

https://openalex.org/W2003692378,"We have identified a novel exon 11 of the human prolactin receptor (hPRLR) gene that is distinct from its rodent counterparts and have demonstrated the presence of two novel short forms of the hPRLR (S1a and S1b), which are derived from alternative splicing of exons 10 and 11. S1a encodes 376 amino acids (aa) that contain partial exon 10 and a unique 39-aa C-terminal region encoded by exon 11. S1b encodes 288 aa that lack the entire exon 10 and contains 3 amino acids at the C terminus derived from exon 11 using a shifted reading frame. These short forms, which were found in several normal tissues and in breast cancer cell lines, were expressed as cell surface receptors and possessed binding affinities comparable with the long form. Unlike the long form, neither short form was able to mediate the activation of the β-casein gene promoter induced by prolactin. Instead they acted as dominant negative forms when co-expressed with the long form in transfected cells. Due to a marked difference in the cellular levels between the two short forms in transfected cells, S1b was more effective in inhibiting the prolactin-induced activation of the β-casein gene promoter mediated by the long form of the receptor. The low cellular level of S1a was due to its more rapid turnover than the S1b protein. This is attributable to specific residues within the C-terminal unique 39 amino acids of the S1a form and may represent a new mechanism by which the hPRLR is modulated at the post-translational level. Since both short forms contain abbreviated cytoplasmic domains with unique C termini, they may also exhibit distinct signaling pathways in addition to modulating the signaling from the long form of the receptor. These receptors may therefore play important roles in the diversified actions of prolactin in human tissues.

PRLRs are present in several forms that are generated from alternative splicing of the receptor gene and mainly differ in their intracellular domains (1Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PRLR gene has a complex structure that is amenable to alternative splicing that leads to the generation of multiple PRLR transcripts (2Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 94-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The genomic region of the long form human PRLR (hPRLR) comprises eight exons (exons 3–10) in which exon 8 codes for the transmembrane domain and exon 10 codes for most of the intracellular domain (4Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Leondires M. Dufau M.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). While exon 2 is a common noncoding exon corresponding to the middle region of the 5′-untranslated region of the hPRLR mRNA, there are multiple alternative first exons, hE13and hE1N (4Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Leondires M. Dufau M.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and more recently hE1N2–5 (5Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. The Endocrine Society's 81st Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, June 12–14, 1999, P2-Abstract 303. The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1999Google Scholar), each of which is transcribed into the 5′-end sequence of the hPRLR mRNA under the control of their respective promoters and is alternatively spliced onto the common exon 2. However, the 5′ diversity of the hPRLR gene does not alter the N-terminal coding region of the hPRLR. In humans, an intermediate form of the hPRLR was identified from the breast cancer cells that was derived from partial nucleotide sequence deletion of exon 10 at nt +1010/+1581 of the hPRLR gene (6Kline J.B. Roehrs H. Clevenger C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35461-35468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). While the long form receptor has been linked to several signaling pathways including Jak-Stat and mitogen-activated protein kinase that may account for much of the diverse functions of prolactin, the signal transduction of the intermediate form of the receptor remains unknown. To date no short forms of the hPRLR that utilize alternative exons downstream of exon 10 have been reported. The aim of this study was to isolate new forms of the human PRLR and to study their functional differences from the long form of the receptor. In the present work, we identified two novel forms of the hPRLR, S1a and S1b, which are derived from alternative splicing between exon 10, well conserved among the human and rodents, and exon 11, distinct from those of the rodents at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. We have demonstrated that both short forms are transmembrane receptors expressed on cell membrane and capable of ligand binding. These forms lack intrinsic activity in Jak-Stat5 activation but can act as dominant negative forms. They are widely expressed as is the long form and may exert distinct functions. Significant differences of expression are observed between the two short forms. These findings are of significance to further understanding of the diverse actions of prolactin in human tissues. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed as described previously (7Hu Z.Z. Buczko E. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using total RNA isolated from the breast cancer cell T-47D. Forward specific primer (hP23, +970/+992, 5′-ACTTCACCATGAATGATACAACC-3′) located at exon 8 and oligo(dT) were used for amplification of the 3′ species of the hPRLR mRNA. The PCR products were directly subcloned into pCR2.1 by the TA cloning procedure (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and were further sequenced for the inserts. The full lengths of the hPRLR isoforms were cloned from the T-47D cell by RT-PCR using a 5′ common forward primer (hP1, −284/−262, 5′-GGAGGCTGAAATCCCCAGACGC-3′) and the specific reverse primer to the 3′ novel sequence (hP40, 5′-TCCCAGTCAATTCTGCTTTGG-3′) (exon 11). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (8Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using total RNA isolated from human tissues of normal adult subjects (25–40 years old) including mammary gland, ovary, testis, liver (male) (Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Philadelphia, PA), and T-47D cells. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers used for PCR were the forward hP23 (exon 8) and the reverse hP44, 5′-ATGCTCTTCAGCTC TACTGG-3′ (exon 11), and the reverse primer hP50, 5′-TGAACATTTGGATCCACCAGCATG-3′ (exon 10). The hPRLR cDNA forms were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRV site. A chimeric receptor that contains the C-terminal 39 aa of the S1a form within the intracellular domain of the long form at aa 442 was achieved by inserting the 39-aa (117-bp) PCR DNA fragment into the XbaI restriction site of the long form at nt 1325. The point mutation or deletion within the unique C-terminal region of the S1a form was performed as described previously (9Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26225-26235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The full-length coding regions of the long, S1a, and S1b forms of the hPRLR were subcloned into the pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH) at sites so that the receptors were in-frame with GFP and so that the junction between the receptor and GFP of the three fusion proteins differs minimally. All plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing. Both COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The hPRLR plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-1 and HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The hPRLR-GFP plasmids (2 µg/ml) or pEGFP2 vector only (2 µg/ml) were transfected into COS-1 cells grown on polylysine coated glass coverslips using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. After 24 h of incubation the cells were examined in an inverted microscope under a 40× oil-immersion objective (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) and a Bio-Rad laser confocal microscope system (MRC-1024). To measure cell surface receptors, intact COS-1 cells transfected with hPRLRs were incubated with 50,000 cpm125I-hGH (30 µCi in Medium 199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 14 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of an increasing amount unlabeled hGH. 1 µg of hGH was added into the nonspecific wells. Cells were collected into the 12- × 75-mm Falcon tube and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min followed by washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The final cell pellets were counted for radioactivity in a γ counter. The binding data were analyzed as described previously (10Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). β-Casein-luciferase reporter plasmid (0.1 µg) (kindly provided by Dr. Warren Leonard, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was cotransfected with hPRLR plasmids in COS-1 or HEK293 cells. After transfection cells were replaced with serum-free DMEM and stimulated with human prolactin (hPRL) at a final concentration of 0.1 or 1 µg/ml for 24 h followed by measurement of luciferase activities using a luminometer. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from COS-1 and HEK293 cells transfected with hPRLR cDNAs and from untransfected T-47D cells using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). 3 µg of poly(A)+ RNA samples from COS-1 and HEK293 cells and 20 µg from T-47D cells were resolved on a 1% agarose gel as described previously (8Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA fragments (nt 72–855 of hPRLR cDNA or nt 68–313 of exon 11 specific for short hPRLR forms) and subsequently reprobed with β-actin probe for normalization of data. The blots were subject to autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat films. 20–40 µg of total cellular lysate from cells transfected with individual hPRLR forms were resolved by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies (monoclonal antibody U5 recognizing the extracellular domain of the hPRLR, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody recognizing specifically the C-terminal region (aa 344–362) of the S1aform developed in our laboratory. The blots were subsequently incubated with goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG second antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immunosignals were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The same blots were used to detect β-actin signals with a mouse monoclonal actin antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) for normalization of the data. In vitrotranslation was performed using the combined transcription and translation (TNT) system (Promega, Madison, WI) using T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. 1 µg of plasmids containing different hPRLR cDNAs was incubated in the TNT mixture containingl-[35S]methionine at 37 °C for 30 min. The synthesized products were diluted 5-fold, and 10 µl of the diluted reaction were analyzed by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were subject to autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film. In vivo translation was performed in HEK293 cells that were briefly labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 20 min after the cells were depleted of methionine for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM, and the cellular proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see below in this section). HEK293 Cells were transfected with S1a or S1b with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as above. 20 h after transfection, cells were incubated with methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min. Cells were then pulse-labeled with 100 µCi/mll-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 60 min followed by medium replacement of DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing 2 mmunlabeled l-methionine for various lengths of time. Cells were terminated, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma). Immunoprecipitation was performed using monoclonal anti-PRLR antibody (U5) and protein G plus-agarose beads according to manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The complex was eluted with 1× SDS sample loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed on an 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The specific35S-labeled S1a or S1b protein was quantified using PhosphorImager analysis of the dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To isolate potential subtypes of the hPRLR, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of the hPRLR mRNA from the human breast cancer cell line T-47D using a specific 5′ primer located at the extracellular domain (exon 8) proximal to the transmembrane region, which is common to all known forms of the receptor (Fig.1, top and bottom). We identified two new hPRLR mRNA species that diverge from the long form at two sites. One deviates at the junction (nt 786) between exon 9 and 10 (aa 285) with omission of exon 10, and the other form results from an internal splicing site within exon 10 at nt 1010 (aa 337) (Fig.1, top and bottom), both followed by a novel 3′-end sequence of 420 bp (GenBankTM accession numberAF214012) that contains a putative poly(A) signal (AGTAAA, Fig.1, middle) different from that of the long form (AATAAA). To examine whether this novel 3′ sequence is derived from an alternative exon of the hPRLR gene, we isolated a gene fragment containing this sequence from a human phage artificial chromosome genomic clone and determined that this sequence represents an additional exon (exon 11) of the hPRLR gene (Fig. 1). The intron-exon junction at the 5′-end of exon 11 conforms to the consensus splicing pattern (CT-rich … AG), and the junction at the 3′ polyadenylation site conforms to the genomic recognition site (poly(A) signal … GT-rich) for the 3′ cleavage and polyadenylation (Fig. 1,middle). This exon contains a polyadenylation signal, AGTAAA, at 15 bp upstream of the poly(A)+ tail that is a weaker variant form of the poly(A) signal AATAAA (11Wahle E. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Full lengths of the two hPRLR species were subsequently cloned from T-47D cells by RT-PCR using the forward primer located at the 5′-untranslated region (hP1) and reverse primer at the 3′-untranslated region of the unique sequence (hP40). The predicted amino acids from the two cDNAs indicated that both transcripts code for short forms of the hPRLR, one for 376 aa (termed S1a) and the other for 288 aa (termed S1b). The two short forms are identical to the long form in their extracellular, transmembrane, and proximal intracellular domains but differ from the long form by having much abbreviated intracellular domains with 39 (S1a) and 3 (S1b) unique amino acids at their C termini (Fig. 1,bottom). Although the two short forms share identical 3′ nucleotide sequences (exon 11), the partial presence of exon 10 (+856/+1009) in S1a or its deletion in S1balters the reading frames and results in different C termini between the two short forms (Fig. 1, top). To determine whether the two short forms of the hPRLR are expressed in normal human tissues, we performed RT-PCR analysis of hPRLR mRNAs in human ovary, testis, breast, liver, and peripheral lymphocytes (Fig.2) using 5′ primer in exon 8 (hP23) and 3′ primer specific for exon 11 (hP44). Two mRNA species of 460 and 306 bp were amplified from all these tissues and cells (Fig. 2,middle) corresponding to the S1a and the S1b forms, respectively, as indicated by Southern blot analyses with oligomer probes corresponding to regions common to both short forms (hP34, exon 9) or specific for S1a (hP15, exon 10). This result was further verified by sequencing of the two RT-PCR products (not shown). In addition, a multiple human tissue RNA blot hybridization using a probe corresponding to the exon 11 sequence indicated that exon 11-containing messages (corresponding to both S1a and S1b) are present in a wide range of tissues with relative high abundance in the breast, placenta, uterus, and kidney (data not shown). These results indicated that both short forms of the hPRLR are widely expressed in human tissues as the long form of the receptor. To determine the relative abundance of the long and the two short forms of the hPRLR within a tissue, we estimated the intratissue expression of the three receptor subtypes using a semiquantitative RT-PCR method (Fig. 2, bottom). A 557-bp fragment of the long form was co-amplified with the S1a and S1b forms by including a long form-specific reverse primer (hP50) in the PCR for the two short forms (Fig. 2, middle). Southern blot analyses of the RT-PCR using a probe (hP34) common to all three receptor forms showed that the relative ratios between these forms in all tissue/cells examined were rather consistent. The long form was the most abundant mRNA species (50–60%), the S1a form was second (∼30%), and the S1b form was the least abundant (15–20%) (Fig. 2, bottom). Both S1a and S1b forms are predicted to be single membrane-spanning proteins. S1a, S1b, and the long form cDNAs were transfected into COS-1 and HEK293 cells, and their expressions were examined by Northern blots, Western blots, and radioligand binding analyses. Using a probe containing extracellular sequences, mRNA transcripts of 2.6, 2.3, and 2.1 kb were revealed corresponding to the long, S1a, and S1b forms, respectively, as predicted from their respective expressing constructs (Fig.3A, lanes 1–4). Transcripts of the 2.0- and 1.8-kb species corresponding to the S1a and S1b short forms, respectively, of the endogenous hPRLRs were observed in Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA from T-47D cells (Fig. 3A,lane 5). The size difference of ∼0.2 kb on Northern blots between the S1a and S1b transcripts in both COS-1 and T-47D cells was consistent with the partial exon 10 retention of 153 bp in the S1a form. The slight size difference between the endogenous and transfected mRNA species of S1a and S1b was accounted for by additional sequences flanking the cDNA inserts in the expression vector (pcDNA3.1) used in transfected cells. The apparent molecular masses of the expressed proteins in COS-1 and HEK293 cells were 90, 56, and 42 kDa for the long, S1a, and S1bforms, respectively (Fig. 3, B, lanes 6–8 andC, lanes 9–11). The glycosylation of the extracellular domain of the receptor could account for the differences between the calculated (39 kDa for S1a and 29 kDa for S1b) and the apparent molecular weights of the short forms (56 kDa for S1a and 42 kDa for S1b). Confocal microscopy of hPRLR-GFP fusion proteins transiently expressed in COS-1 cells was conducted to visualize subcellular localization of the short forms as well as the long form of the hPRLR. As shown in Fig.4, the long (L-GFP) and S1b forms (S1b-GFP) were expressed at relatively high levels and were clearly localized on the cell membrane as well as at intracellular sites. This is consistent with our previous studies that demonstrated in ovarian tissue that a major pool of receptors is hindered even in membrane preparations and only becomes bindable upon detergent solubilization (12Koppelman M.C.S. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also other studies demonstrated that a considerable pool of receptors resides at intracellular sites of several tissues (13Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. Josefberg Z. Sikstrom R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4058-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bonifacino J. Dufau M.L. Serono Symp. Publ. Raven Press. 1984; 9: 141-163Google Scholar). The S1aform (Fig. 4, S1a-GFP) was localized for the most part at the cell membrane but expressed at a much lower level than the long and S1a forms, consistent with results obtained by other approaches (see below). 125I-hGH binding assays were performed on intact cells transfected with individual hPRLR forms. The ligand binding affinities of the three receptor forms (long, S1a, and S1b) to hGH were similar (Kd, 3–5 × 10−9m) (Fig.5). However, the surface receptor binding sites for the S1a form was significantly less than the long and S1b form (25% of the long and 15% of the S1b) in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells. These results demonstrated that the two short forms expressed at the surface of intact cells are capable of ligand binding with similar affinities to the long form. Thus, the two short forms showed significant differences in their expression in whole cells shown by Western blot (Fig. 3) and by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4) as well as on the cell surface shown by the surface ligand binding assay (Fig. 5). The β-casein promoter is a well known prolactin target that can be activated through the long form receptor-mediated Jak-Stat5 signaling pathway (15DaSilva L. Howard O.M. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the S1a and S1b forms can mediate this gene activation, we cotransfected individual receptors with β-casein promoter reporter gene in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells. Stimulation of transfected cells with 100 ng/ml human prolactin for 24 h induced the luciferase activity by 5- (COS-1) or 16-fold (HEK293) in cells transfected with the long form but not with either short form (Fig. 6). This result demonstrated that both S1a and S1b lack intrinsic activity required for the Jak-Stat5 signaling pathway leading to the β-casein promoter activation. To examine whether the two short forms could modulate the signaling of the long form, we cotransfected the long form with increasing amount of either the S1a or S1b form along with the β-casein reporter gene. HEK293 cells were chosen for this experiment due to the greater -fold induction of reporter activity by prolactin in this cellversus COS-1 cells (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig.7, S1b inhibited over 50% of the prolactin-induced reporter activity at an equal DNA ratio between the long form and S1b (L/S1b) in transfection, while a DNA ratio of more than 1:8 between the long form and S1a (L/S1a) was required to inhibit 50% of the reporter activity (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, an L/S1b DNA ratio of 1:8 nearly abolished the induction of the reporter activity by prolactin (Fig. 7C), while over 20% of the induced reporter activity still remained at an L/S1a ratio of 1:64 (Fig. 7B). To examine whether the inhibitory effect of the short forms resulted from ligand competition between the long and short receptor forms, the ligand (hPRL) concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 µg/ml in transfection studies (Fig. 7D). The results showed that the inhibition of the long form-mediated activation of the β-casein gene by the short forms was independent of the ligand concentration since a 10-fold increase in hPRL concentration did not alter the extent of inhibition (Fig. 7D). These results indicated that S1a and S1b could act as dominant negative forms to inhibit prolactin-induced transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter mediated by the long form of the receptor. However, the S1b form was much more effective than S1ain suppressing the reporter activation mediated by the long form of the receptor. This result appears to be consistent with the low cellular level of S1a protein (Fig. 3) as well as low binding activity on the cell surface (Fig. 5) compared with the S1bprotein. As a result, the S1a form requires a much higher DNA ratio over the long form during transfection to achieve a significant inhibitory effect. A post-translational mechanism may account for the differential expression of the two short forms in transfected cells (see below).Figure 7Cotransfection of S1a or S1b with the long form in HEK293 cells.S1a (A) or S1b (C) was cotransfected in increasing DNA doses (0.25–8× of the long form) with a constant amount of the long form (0.4 µg) along with the β-casein reporter (0.1 µg) in HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with hPRL (100 ng/ml) for 24 h before termination. The activities of the β-casein promoter are shown as percentage of the activity from cells transfected with the long form of the receptor and stimulated with prolactin (% of long form). B, S1a was cotransfected in increasing DNA doses (1–64× of the long form) with a constant amount of the long form (0.1 µg) along with the β-casein reporter (0.1 µg) in HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with hPRL as above. The activities of the β-casein promoter are shown as percentage of the -fold induction of the luciferase activity by prolactin in cells transfected with the long form alone (the average induction was 32-fold by prolactin).D, S1a or S1b was cotransfected with the long form at ratios of 1:16 (L/S1a, 16×) or 1:4 (L/S1b, 4×), respectively, and cells were stimulated with 0.1 or 1 µg/ml hPRL for 24 h. The luciferase activities were measured as percentage of those of long form-transfected cells stimulated with 0.1 or 1 µg/ml of hPRL.vt, vector only; Long, long form only;S1a or S1b, short form only. A β-galactosidase plasmid was also included in the transfection, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured for normalization of the reporter activity. Data were collected from four to seven independent transfections and were expressed as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blot analysis showed that the cellular level of S1a is significantly lower than that of S1b or the long form in both COS-1 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). This was independent of the expression vector since when these hPRLR forms were cloned into a GFP fusion vector, the cellular level of the S1a-GFP fusion protein was also greatly reduced compared with the long and S1b forms (data not shown). Considering the close structural similarity between S1a and S1b, similar expression level of these two proteins would have been expected when both cDNAs were expressed in transfected cells. However, there was consistent and marked difference of cellular protein levels between the two forms of the receptor (Fig. 8,right). In contrast, the steady-state level of mRNAs from transfected cDNAs of the two forms was similar (Fig.8, left), indicating t"

Germline mutations in this locus are associated with melanoma susceptibility in 20–40% of multiple case melanoma families. Many of these mutations specifically impair p16INK4a, whereas mutations uniquely targeting p14ARF are rare. Nevertheless, the importance of p14ARF has not been excluded because more than 40% ofINK4a/ARF alterations affect p16INK4a and p14ARF. We now report that p14ARF is functionally impaired in melanoma kindreds carryingINK4a/ARF mutations.

This work establishes the importance of p14ARF in melanoma predisposition. cyclin-dependent kinase phosphate-buffered saline enhanced green fluorescent protein The INK4a/ARF locus on the short arm of chromosome 9 is one of the most frequently altered sequences in human cancer. It is mutated, deleted, or hypermethylated in many tumors with a frequency ranging from 30% in esophageal tumors to ∼60% in gliomas and mesotheliomas (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). Inherited mutations involving this locus are also associated with melanoma predisposition in 20–40% of multiple case melanoma families (2Kefford R.F. Newton Bishop J.A. Bergman W. Tucker M.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 3245-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The dual coding capacity of theINK4a/ARF locus may account for its high disruption rate in human tumors. This locus encodes two distinct proteins, which are translated in different reading frames from alternatively spliced transcripts (3Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Although p53 stabilization is the best understood function of ARF, recent evidence confirms that p14ARF also functions in the pRb pathway. The growth inhibitory activity of ARF remains active when the p53 pathway is inactivated but can be suppressed by inactivation of both the pRb and p53 pathways (15Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The various functions of p14ARF presumably reflect its multiple binding partners. In addition to hdm2, p14ARF interacts with the pRb-associated transcription factors E2F 1, -2, and -3, the protein phosphatase subunit, spinophilin, and the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I (16Martelli F.

Although all the functional details have not been determined, p14ARF is activated in response to abnormal oncogenic stimuli, including E1A, MYC, and oncogenic Ras, and therefore must play an important role in sensitizing transformed cells to either growth arrest or apoptosis (20de Stanchina E.

This region encodes a nucleolar localization domain (80PRRGAQLRRPRHSHPTRARRCP101) that is required for full activity of the human ARF protein (14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Mol.

This work contradicts an earlier study, which concluded that tumor mutations dually affecting p16INK4a and p14ARF did not impair the function of the murine homologue, p19ARF (39Quelle D.E. Cheng M. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this earlier study, however, missense INK4a/ARF mutations, identified in human tumors, were introduced into mouse p19ARF (39Quelle D.E. Cheng M. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently two families have been described in which exon 1β-specific genetic alterations are linked to melanoma susceptibility, the first in a kindred of melanoma and nervous system tumors (42Randerson-Moor J.A.

Proof of principle is lacking, however, as in the first case the deletion involved may affect p16INK4a expression, and in the second case the nuclear nature of the affected kindred provides only preliminary evidence of disease association. Clear demonstration of a functional involvement of p14ARFin melanoma susceptibility is important for two reasons. First, it will implicate downstream targets of p14ARF in the investigation of other candidate molecules in melanoma susceptibility and development. Second, it will carry important implications for determination of individuals at high risk (2Kefford R.F. Newton Bishop J.A. Bergman W. Tucker M.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 3245-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functional effect of INK4a/ARF exon 2 alterations we introduced a series of melanoma-associated mutations into the human p16INK4a andp14ARF genes. Seven point mutations located in the shared INK4a/ARF exon 2 and encoding non-conservative amino acid substitutions in both p16INK4a and/or p14ARF were evaluated for protein interactions, cellular distribution, cell cycle inhibitory function, and p53 pathway activation. Five missenseINK4a/ARF exon 2 mutations engineered in this project were identified in the germline of familial melanoma kindreds. The G67S variant was identified in a single Australian family with three affected individuals (30Holland E.A. Schmid H. Kefford R.F. Mann G.J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 25: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The A68L and N71K variants segregated with melanoma in a single and two French melanoma-prone kindreds, respectively (29Soufir N. Avril M.-F. Chompret A. Demenais F. Bombled J. Spatz A.

The missense mutation A68T was detected in the DNA derived from a primary melanoma; the presence of this mutation in the germline was not determined (45Piccinin S. Doglioni C. Maestro R.

All mutants were ligated to the N terminus of the FLAG epitope encoded by the pFLAG-CMV-5b vector (Sigma) and completely sequenced. NM39, a human melanoma cell line, expresses pRb and p53. This cell line carries wild typeCDKN2A and exon 1β sequences but does not express detectable p16INK4a or p14ARF (47Rizos H. Darmanian A.P. Indsto J.O. Shannon J.A. Kefford R.F. Mann G.J. Melanoma Res. 1999; 9: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NM39 and Saos 2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Trace Scientific, Sydney, Australia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and glutamine. For immunofluorescence studies, cultured cells (1 × 105) were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates and transfected with 1–3 µg of purified plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For cell cycle distribution analysis, cultured cells (3 × 105) were seeded in T25 flasks and co-transfected with the pFLAG-CMV-5b expression plasmid (3 µg) and pCMVEGFP-spectrin (1 µg). Approximately 40 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were immunostained for 50 min with either monoclonal mouse α-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or rabbit α-p21waf1 (Santa Cruz) or rabbit α-hdm2 (Santa Cruz) followed by a 50-min exposure to either a fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated α-mouse secondary IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or α-rabbit secondary IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33258 staining (2 µg/ml). Subcellular distribution was determined from a total of at least 1100 fluorescent cells, from three independent transfection experiments, unless otherwise indicated. The standard deviation obtained within transfection experiments was always less than ±6%. Forty hours post transfection, cells were fixed in 80% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 1 h, washed in PBS, and stained with propidium iodide (50 ng/µl) containing ribonuclease A (50 ng/µl). EGFP-spectrin was used as a marker for analysis of transfected cells. DNA content from at least 2000 EGFP-spectrin-positive cells were analyzed using ModFIT software. The G1 arrest induced by the mutant proteins is expressed relative to the wild type protein. Expression of FLAG-tagged proteins was determined 40 h after co-transfecting NM39 cells with 1–3 µg of the FLAG construct and 1 µg of pEGFPN1 vector (CLONTECH). Proteins were extracted using a PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Roche). The remaining insoluble protein pellet was re-extracted with PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 6 murea, and protease inhibitors (Roche) Electrophoresis was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Bio-Rad). Western immunoblotting of p14ARF-FLAG was carried out using the monoclonal mouse α-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), and detection of EGFP proteins was performed, in order to standardize the transfection efficiency, using a commercial polyclonal α-EGFP antibody (CLONTECH). p14ARFand p16INK4a inserts were each cloned in frame with the GAL4 nuclear localization signal in the pM vector (CLONTECH). The hdm2 cDNA was digested out of the pCMV-mdm2 plasmid and cloned in frame with the SV40 nuclear localization sequence in the pVP16vector (CLONTECH). The CDK4 cDNA was also cloned in frame with the SV40 nuclear localization sequence in thepVP16 vector. Each assay was performed at least twice, in duplicate using Saos 2 cells seeded in six-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well). Each well was transfected with a total of 4 µg of DNA consisting of the pM DNA,hdm2-pVP16 or CDK4-pVP16, the pG5lucreporter vector (Promega), and pEGFPN1 vector (CLONTECH) in a 5:5:1:1 µg ratio. Cells were assayed 40 h after transfection essentially as described by the manufacturer. Transfection efficiencies were determined by quantitating the number of green fluorescent cells using a Coulter EPICS Profile II flow cytometer. Seven melanoma-associatedINK4a/ARF mutations were selected for study: two identified in sporadic melanomas, and five identified as inherited mutations in the germline of multiple affected members of melanoma families (TableI). These mutations were located in the shared p16INK4a andp14ARF exon 2 (Fig.1) and caused changes to the amino acid sequence of both p16INK4a and p14ARF (six mutants) or to p14ARF only (one mutant) (Table I). Six of the engineered p14ARF mutations were located within the exon 2-encoded nucleolar localization domain of this protein (Fig. 1) (14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Mol.

Open table in a new tab As expected, the p16INK4a variant carrying the silent mutation, Ala-73 (A73A), bound CDK4 as effectively as the wild type protein (Fig. 2A). All other tested p16INK4a mutants had reduced binding to CDK4; the G67S familial melanoma mutant gave intermediate CDK4 binding results (30 ± 6% of wild type) and the remaining p16INK4amutants (A68L, A68T, N71I, N71K, R112G) showed minimal residual CDK4 binding (Fig. 2A). The binding affinity of the p14ARF variants and hdm2 was also determined in Saos 2 cells, using the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Four p14ARF variants, R82L, R82H, Q85H and L86M, were indistinguishable from the wild type protein in their capacity to interact with hdm2. The R81Q and P126R familial melanoma mutants showed reduced binding to hdm2 in this assay whereas the prematurely truncated ARF protein (R88ter) showed hdm2 binding activity 60% higher than the full-length wild type ARF protein (Fig. 2B). Each of the p16INK4a andp14ARF mutants was cloned in frame with the FLAG epitope in the pFLAG-CMV-5b vector. The subcellular distribution of each construct was evaluated in transiently transfected NM39 melanoma cells. These cells lack endogenous p16INK4aand p14ARF but express p53 and pRb (47Rizos H. Darmanian A.P. Indsto J.O. Shannon J.A. Kefford R.F. Mann G.J. Melanoma Res. 1999; 9: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As expected, p16INK4a-FLAG localized evenly throughout NM39 cells (Fig.3A) and p14ARF-FLAG localized predominantly in the nucleoli of most transfected NM39 melanoma cells (Fig.4A).Figure 4Cellular distribution of melanoma-associated p14ARF variants.A, the subcellular distribution of p14ARF-FLAG-tagged proteins was examined in transiently transfected NM39 cells as detailed in Fig. 3 legend.LM, light microscopy. B, localization of various FLAG epitope-tagged p14ARF mutation constructs in NM39 melanoma cells. According to the relative intensity of fluorescence in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and nucleolus of each individual cell, subcellular distributions of the FLAG fusion proteins were divided into four groups, as indicated. The percentage of each localization was determined from separate transfection experiments and from a total of at least 1100 fluorescent cells, unless otherwise indicated. a, localization was determined from two independent transfection experiments from a total of 899 fluorescent cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Of the p16INK4a-FLAG variants tested, only A73A showed wild type localization and was distributed evenly throughout transiently transfected NM39 cells (Fig. 3). All other p16INK4a-FLAG mutants showed disrupted localization within these cells (Fig.3B). The subcellular distribution of the mutant p16INK4a proteins was no longer homogeneous but showed areas of intense fluorescence, which were classified as either speckled (small discrete areas of intense fluorescence, e.g. N71I in Fig. 3A) or punctate (larger aggregates of intense fluorescence, e.g. G67S in Fig. 3A). Speckling was observed in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, whereas the punctate aggregates accumulated in the cytoplasm only (Fig. 3A). The subcellular distribution of the mutant p14ARF-FLAG proteins in transfected NM39 cells also showed considerable variation. Of the seven constructs, three (R82H, L86M, P126R) showed wild type distribution and were predominantly located in the nucleolus of NM39 cells (Fig. 4). The remaining four p14ARF-FLAG mutants (R81Q, R82L, Q85H, R88ter) showed altered subcellular localization (Fig. 4A). Replacing Arg-81 (R81Q) and Arg-82 (R82L) dramatically reduced the proportion of transiently transfected NM39 cells with exclusively nucleolar localization and led to an increase in cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 4B). The altered localization of the Q85H variant was less obvious, but a consistently higher percentage of NM39 cells accumulated predominantly nucleolar Q85H ARF (87 ± 4%) compared with cells expressing wild type ARF (76 ± 4%). The removal of the 45 C-terminal p14ARF amino acids (R88ter) eliminated exclusively nucleolar staining in NM39 cells, and almost half the transiently transfected NM39 cells showed cytoplasmic ARF staining only (Fig.4B). The effect of p16INK4a or p14ARF proteins on cell cycle progression was investigated by transiently transfecting FLAG-tagged constructs into NM39 melanoma cells. Forty hours after transfection, DNA content was assayed by flow cytometry to determine cell cycle distribution. At this time point, the expression of wild type p16INK4a or p14ARF in NM39 cells induced potent G1 cell cycle arrest. Similarly, the p16INK4a missense mutants, G67S, A68T, and A73A, remained fully active in mediating cell cycle arrest (Fig.5A). In contrast, the remaining p16INK4a variants (A68L"

The deduced primary sequence, after complete sequencing of the longest snake venom VEGF (svVEGF) cDNA, displayed similarity with vertebrate VEGFs and with the hypotensive factor fromVipera aspis venom. Its cDNA was subcloned, expressed in Escherichia coli with a His6 tag as an insoluble monomer, and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography after 8 m urea extraction. Antiserum against svVEGF was generated and tested in Western blot against proteins from snake venoms and cellular extracts. The mature svVEGF appears to be ubiquitously distributed throughout snake venoms and was also confirmed by Northern blot studies of other related Viperidae species and by cDNA cloning of svVEGF from Bothrops jararacapit viper. The produced recombinant protein dimerizes after refolding processes and was biologically characterized, showing ability to increase vascular permeability.

In Viperidaesnakes, these effects can be categorized in local damage or systemic injury. Local damage results mainly from enzymes such as phospholipases A2, which produce myonecrosis and edema (1Gutiérrez J.M. Lomonte B. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 1405-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and metalloproteinases, which destroy the endothelium, components of vascular wall and extravascular matrix, causing vascular permeability disorders. The systemic effects are those related to the disruption of the hemostatic equilibrium of blood coagulation and hemorrhage caused by other metalloproteinases, serinoproteinases, disintegrins, and type C lectins (2Markland F.S. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1749-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Another common effect observed in these envenomings is hypotension, first known to be a consequence of bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs),1 described and cloned in Bothrops jararaca venom/venom glands, respectively (3Ferreira S.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1965; 25: 265-277Google Scholar, 4Murayama N. Hayashi M.A.F. Ohi H. Ferreira L.A.F. Hermann V.V. Saito H. Fujita Y. Higuchi S. Fernandes B., L. Yamane T. Camargo A.C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These peptides inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) and enhances bradykinin action, generated by proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by venom proteases. Kallikrein-like enzyme is one of them, which promotes kinins release from kininogen, increasing capillary permeability (5Markland F.S. Kettner C. Schiffman S. Shaw E. Bajwa S.S. Reddy K.N. Kirakossian H. Patkos G.B Theodor I. Pirkle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite the well characterized action mechanisms of BPPs, it was established that other factors present in the venoms also act as hypotensive agents. For instance, the presence of natriuretic peptides was described by protein chemistry and cDNA cloning studies (4Murayama N. Hayashi M.A.F. Ohi H. Ferreira L.A.F. Hermann V.V. Saito H. Fujita Y.

In Vipera aspis venom, a hypotensive factor (HF) was described as being a potent non-lethal decreasing pressure protein (9Komori Y. Sugihara H. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The identity of this toxin and of ICPP (10Gasmi A. Abidi F. Srairi N. Oijatayer A. Karoui H. Elayeb M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a related polypeptide fromVipera lebentina, remained unknown until its amino acid sequence was uncovered by Edman sequencing, showing a strong similarity with vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) (10Gasmi A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The biological properties of HF, besides the hypotension, includes the angiogenic effects and the vascular permeability increasing capability of typical VEGFs (11Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The VEGF family of proteins is composed by several members, including the VEGF, first known as vascular permeability factor (12Keck P.J. Hauser S.D. Krivi G. Sanzo K. Warren T. Feder J. Connolly D.T. Science. 1989; 246: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), the placental growth factor (PlGF), and platelet-derived growth factor. They are dimeric proteins composed of two identical or structurally related subunits linked by two interchain disulfide bridges. VEGFs act through binding to specific tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-1 (flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR/flk-1), and/or VEGFR-3 (flt-4), which are mainly expressed in endothelial cells (see reviews in Refs. 13Ferrara N.

Human VEGF gene is composed of 8 exons that can be alternatively spliced, resulting in five C-terminal truncated isoforms of monomeric proteins named by their length in amino acids of the mature protein: VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (13Ferrara N.

The longer ones stay adsorbed to the extracellular matrix of cell surfaces through heparin-like proteoglycans molecules that binds to the basic amino acid residues localized at the C terminus of the longest VEGF forms (17Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 12: 1317-1326Crossref Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The distribution of VEGF occurs throughout vertebrates, being found and cloned in zebrafish, Xenopus, chick, and many mammals. Other VEGF-related molecules has also been reported: VEGF-B (18Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl.

During the analysis of preliminary ESTs generated from a cDNA library of venom glands from the snake Bothrops insularis, an endemic Viperidae snake restricted to Queimada Grande Island in the São Paulo State coast (Brazil), we identified many independent clones coding for a VEGF-like protein. A cDNA library from Bothrops jararaca, a pit viper snake responsible for the majority of snake envenoming accidents in Brazil, was screened and also revealed cDNAs coding for this factor. This is the first report of VEGF-like cDNA sequences cloned from snake venom glands, here named svVEGF. In addition, B. insularis svVEGF was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was biologically characterized. An antiserum was also produced and used to detect svVEGF in other snake venoms. 2The anti-rmsvVEGF antiserum is available on request.2The anti-rmsvVEGF antiserum is available on request. One specimen of B. insularis was collected from Ilha da Queimada Grande in São Paulo State coast (Brazil). The snake was milked to stimulate the production of mRNAs in the venom glands. After 5 days, the animal was sacrificed by CO2 and the pair of venom glands was dissected and kept in liquid nitrogen until use. For total RNA extraction, we used the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer protocol. A column of oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for mRNA purification. The cDNAs were synthesized from 5 µg of mRNA using the Superscript plasmid system for cDNA synthesis and cloning (Life Technologies, Inc.), linked to EcoRI adapters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), selected by size (350–600 bp and greater than 600 bp) in agarose gel electrophoresis and directionally cloned in pGEM11Zf+ plasmid (Promega) at EcoRI/NotI sites.E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the cDNA library plasmids and then plated on a 2YT agarose plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). ESTs were generated fromB. insularis venom gland cDNA library. Random colonies were inoculated in the liquid culture medium, grown overnight, and the plasmidial DNA purified and sequenced on a ABI 377 sequencer using BigDye2 dideoxyterminators (Applied Biosystems). The primers used to sequence were M13 forward and M13 reverse. Generated ESTs were compared with GenBank nucleotide and protein data bases using Blastn and Blastx programs at NCBI to identify putative gene products. Complete DNA sequence was obtained by primer walking and deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY033151. Sequence analysis was performed by using Vector NTI Suite software (Informax). Total RNAs from several tissues and snakes were isolated as described above (cDNA library construction). 10 µg of total RNAs were fractionated on denaturant 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and fixed by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. The probe was obtained by digestion of clone GH027 by EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The svVEGF fragment was isolated after agarose gel electrophoresis and labeled by random primer extension, using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane was incubated with denatured DIG-labeled probe diluted in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0, 1%N-laurylsarcosine, and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C for 16 h. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 20 °C for 5 min and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Detection was performed with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate according to manufacturer's protocol and interrupted after 20 min of colorimetric reaction. A DNA fragment encoding the mature svVEGF was amplified by PCR using clone GH027 as template. The svVEGF forward primer (svVEGF-M, 5′-tgctcgagcaagtgatgccctttatgga-3′) was designed and contained a XhoI restriction site and the nucleotide sequence coding the first seven amino acids of the putative mature protein (Fig. 1). The reverse primer used was SP6 (5′-atttaggtgacactatag-3′), which anneals to the SP6 promoter located in the pGEM11Zf+ vector. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). Plasmidial DNA containing the mature svVEGF insert was digested with XhoI and HindIII enzymes. The excised insert was subcloned in the same sites of pAE expression vector, 3C. R. R. Ramos, P. A. E. Abreu, A. L. T. O. Nascimente, and P. L. Ho, unpublished results. a plasmid derived from pRSET (Invitrogen) and pET 3-His (24Cem B.P.C. Hai T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) plasmids, resulting in the pAE-msvVEGF construct. The correct cloning was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant mature svVEGF (rmsvVEGF) was expressed with additional eight amino acids fused at the N terminus, including a His6tag. For the production of rmsvVEGF, transformed E. coliBL21 (DE3) cells were inoculated in 100 ml of LB/amp and grown overnight at 37 °C. In the next day, the culture was diluted with 2× YT medium to 1 liter and grown until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. At this moment, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the induced culture was incubated for additional 2 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation. Bacterial pellet was ressuspended in TIN buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl) and disrupted by French pressure. Inclusion bodies were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 2 m urea in TIN buffer. rmsvVEGF was extracted with extraction buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and 5 mm imidazole) for 12 h and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 10 volumes of extraction buffer, followed by 10 volumes of wash buffer (extraction buffer + 60 mmimidazole), and rmsvVEGF was eluted with elution buffer (extraction buffer + 1 m imidazole). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. Protein refolding was achieved essentially as described (25Cao Y. Chen H. Zhou L. Chiang M.K. Anand-Apte B. Weatherbee J.A. Wang Y. Fang F. Flanagan J.G. Tsang M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3154-3162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Ten mg of unfolded rmsvVEGF, determined by Coomassie Blue (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209748) Google Scholar), were pooled, diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. 20 ml of this solution was dialyzed against 250 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 m urea, containing 2 mm reduced glutathione (GSH) and 0.5 mmoxidized glutathione (GSSG) for 24 h at 4 °C. The dialysis buffer was changed to 500 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble refolded protein was extensively dialyzed against PBS. The mixture of monomers and dimers was separated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described (11Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein mixture was adsorbed on the resin in PBS, washed by PBS, and the refolded rmsvVEGF dimers were eluted with PBS containing 300 mm NaCl. Ten male Swissmice (20 g/animal) were immunized with 15 µg of unfolded rmsvVEGF. The protein was injected intraperitoneal in 500 µl of PBS buffer containing 10% (w/v) Al(OH)2 used as adjuvant. After 15 days, the animals were injected with a booster dose of additional 15 µg of the protein. In the 30th day, they were bled from periorbital artery and the serum extracted by centrifugation after clothing. The serum title was followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples of snake venoms obtained from the Herpetology Department (Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil), cellular extracts, and recombinant rmsvVEGF were resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE in both reducing or non-reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, incubated with the anti-rmsvVEGF serum at 1:500 dilution in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 for 2 h, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h. The blot was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Life Technologies, Inc.) after metal ion enhancement with CoCl2. A cDNA library from B. jararaca venom glands (27Junqueira de Azevedo I.L.M. Prieto da Silva A.R. Carmona E. Ho P.L. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was constructed as described above for B. insularis cDNA library. The svVEGF cDNA from B. jararaca venom gland was isolated by PCR using the forward svVEGF-M primer and the SP6 primer described above (see “Recombinant Protein Expression”). These primers would hybridize, respectively, to the svVEGF cDNA and to the SP6 promoter at pGEM11Zf(+) plasmid used to construct the library. The amplified DNA was further subcloned in pGEM-T (Promega) and completely sequenced as described above. To obtain the complete cDNA sequence containing the 5′-untranslated region and the signal peptide, a PCR was performed using B. jararaca cDNA library as a template and the svVEGF reverse primer (5′-agctggtcaaagaggctttc-3′, Fig. 1) and the T7 promoter, which would hybridize to the cDNA and to pGEM11Zf(+) plasmid, respectively. The amplified fragment was further subcloned and completely sequenced. All the sequences were assembled with ContigExpress software (Informax) to derive the complete B. jararaca svVEGF cDNA sequence. The complete B. jararaca svVEGF sequence was confirmed after sequencing of at least three independent clones and is available in GenBank™ under accession number AY033152. The refolded dimeric form of rmsvVEGF was assayed for its ability to induce vascular permeability in male Swiss mice (18–22 g), obtained from Instituto Butantan. Briefly, 50 µl of PBS or equivalent volume of PBS containing different concentrations of protein were injected intradermally into mice backs. Immediately afterward, 200 µl of 1% Evan's Blue solution was injected intravenously through orbital plexus. The dye binds to plasma albumin and is used as a macromolecular tracer during microvascular permeability increasing (28Miles A.A. Wilhelm D.L. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1955; 36: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar). At varying intervals of time after injections, animals were sacrificed and the dorsal epithelium dissected and photographed to visualize the leakage of the dye into the extravascular space. A cDNA library was constructed from the venom glands of B. insularis in order to characterize abundant ESTs from this specialized tissue. The ESTs obtained from 5′ and/or 3′ ends were searched with Blastn and Blastx programs (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (66970) Google Scholar), for similar sequences in DNA and protein data bases. From the first 163 clones analyzed, 4 clones revealed significant similarity at amino acid level with VEGFs from different sources. Danio rerio (zebrafish) VEGF165 showed the highest score, followed by mammalians VEGFs. Since the size of the longest cDNA, accessed by restriction analysis were about 1.2 kilobase pairs, two primers (svVEGF-f and svVEGF-r) were designed based on both EST ends to extend and close the sequence. The complete nucleotide sequence (Fig.1) was 1200 bp and revealed an ORF of 146 amino acids with an ATG start codon at position 186 and the TGA stop codon at position 624. The cDNA possesses an unusual superimposed double polyadenylation signal (AATAAATAAA) located 11 bp upstream of the poly(A)+ tail. The deduced svVEGF polypeptide has a predicted signal peptide composed by the first 24 amino acids, according to Nielsen's algorithm (30Nilsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref Scopus (4901) Google Scholar), and is in accordance with the N-terminal amino acid sequence alignment of HF protein characterized from V. aspis snake venom (11Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). A molecular mass of 13.8 kDa and pI of 8.19 were predicted for the putative mature protein. Fig. 2 shows the sequence alignment and comparison of deduced svVEGF with HF protein, VEGFs and PlGFs. The mature 122-amino acid sequence presents 68.4% of identity with HF protein from V. aspisand around 50% with other vertebrate VEGFs, being more similar toD. rerio (64, 2%) than to human VEGFs (60.0%). PlGFs and VEGF-B are less similar to svVEGFs, but showed some conserved structural features. The main characteristic of VEGF/PlGF family is the presence of the three intrachain and the two interchain disulfide bridges. svVEGF possesses all 8 cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bridge formation, thus suggesting its ability to dimerize through the formation of the same intra- and interdisulfide bonds. The deduced signal peptide is shorter (Fig. 2), and the putative mature protein displays the hydrophobic residues Val2, Phe5, and Met6, which have been shown to participate in an amphipathic α-helix that stabilize the dimerization of human VEGF (31Siemeister G. Marme D. Martiny-Baron G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11115-11120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The methionine at position 3 would participate in that process in the place of the valine in this same position in VEGF121. Val3 was also shown to be an important amino acid residue in the dimerization of human VEGF. Except for Glu7, none of the other charged residues are observed in the N terminus. The C terminus is different from that of HF protein and longer than the shortest isoforms of VEGF/PlGF. The glycosylation site presented in some VEGFs (Fig. 2) is absent in svVEGF. To determine its biochemical and biological properties, rmsvVEGF was expressed in E. coli. A cDNA fragment coding the mature protein was amplified by PCR, cloned in pGEM-T system (Promega), and subcloned in the T7-based promoter pAE plasmid.3 The final construct encodes a N-terminally fused sequence containing a His6 tag and two amino acid residues derived from XhoI restriction site. The 17-kDa rmsvVEGF monomer was clearly visible in the extracts of induced or uninduced E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pAE-msvVEGF for 2 h by IPTG (Fig.3A). Overnight inductions were also efficient in rmsvVEGF expression, producing up to 50 mg of the recombinant protein. The protein was expressed in the cells as inclusion bodies. The protein in the inclusion bodies was solubilized by urea and further purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography, resulting in 30 mg of purified monomers (Fig.3 A). Since VEGFs are active just in the dimerized forms through intra- and interdisulfide bonds (32Potgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), several attempts to refold the monomers were made. The best results were achieved by using oxidizing/reducing pair of 2 mm GSH and 0.5 mm GSSG, before urea removal essentially as described (25Cao Y. Chen H. Zhou L. Chiang M.K. Anand-Apte B. Weatherbee J.A. Wang Y. Fang F. Flanagan J.G. Tsang M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3154-3162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although some protein loss occurs due to precipitation after urea remove, this procedure could dimerize ∼20% of monomeric mature svVEGF, producing a final yield of 2 mg of refolded protein from 10 mg of monomers (Fig. 3 B). To purify the refolded dimeric rmsvVEGF from monomeric forms, we raised the possibility that rmsvVEGF could bind to heparin-Sepharose like HF protein and some VEGF forms. The binding to heparin-Sepharose is not a general rule for VEGFs. Human VEGF121 does not bind to heparin-Sepharose, whereas VEGF189 binds strongly and VEGF165 binds with intermediary affinity, being eluted with 0.9 m NaCl (33Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of rmsvVEGF, our results showed that it has a relatively weak affinity for heparin-Sepharose, being eluted with 0.3 m NaCl (Fig. 3 B). Anti-rmsnVEGF antiserum was generated in mice, against the unfolded rmsvVEGF. This antiserum was able to recognize in Western blot the reduced (17 kDa) monomeric form of rmsvVEGF in reducing SDS-PAGE condition (Fig. 4,lane 1), but not the refolded (30 kDa) dimeric form in SDS-PAGE in nonreducing condition (data not shown). To investigate the biological distribution of svVEGF, Western blots were performed with samples of some Viperidae andElapidae snake venoms. These include the venoms fromB. insularis, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, and Crotalus durissus terrificus(Viperidae), as well as the Micrurus corallinus(Elapidae) venom. A major immunoreactive band of 14 kDa was detected in the B. insularis venom extract (Fig. 4, lane 3). The molecular mass is in accordance with that predicted from the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA cloning. Major immunoreactive bands of 15 and 14.5 kDa were also detected in the B. jararaca andB. jararacussu venom, respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). In the later venom, a minor band of 16 kDa was also detected. C. durissus terrificus venom also displayed a 16.0-kDa band (Fig. 4, lane 6). TheElapidae snake, M. corallinus, presents a 16.5-kDa immunoreactive component in its venom (Fig. 4, lane 7). These results clearly show that svVEGFs are widely distributed among the snake venoms. In addition, svVEGFs are present in the venoms with different molecular masses. This may be due to the differences in the primary amino acid sequences among the svVEGFs, by alternative splicing or to their post-translational modifications. It is interesting to note that, in the B. insularis venom gland extract, a band of 14 kDa was detected (Fig. 4, lane 8). In contrast, extracts of the B. insularisheart tissue did not present any immunoreactive band (Fig. 4,lane 9). It was shown that heart, lung, kidney, and other organs from adult vertebrates are typical VEGF-expressing tissues (34Berse B. Brown L.F. Van de Walter L. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the svVEGF is a snake venom component and its expression is specific to the snake venom glands. These results were also confirmed by Northern blot studies. A 1.3-kilobase pair transcript was detected in the venom glands ofB. insularis, B. jararaca, and C. durissus terrificus, but not in the B. insularis lung, carotid artery, pancreas, and maxillary muscle tissues (Fig.5). Since the Western blot and Northern blot results indicated an ubiquitous distribution of svVEGF in snake venoms and no other nucleotide sequence of snake VEGFs had been described, we decide to clone the svVEGF cDNA from B. jararaca for comparison to B. insularis svVEGF.B. jararaca snake bite represents the main cause of snake envenoming accidents in Brazil (35Ribeiro L.A. Jorge M.T. Rev. Soc. Bras. Med. Trop. 1997; 30: 475-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire cDNA sequence ofB. jararaca svVEGF was obtained after PCR, using theB. jararaca venom gland cDNA library (27Junqueira de Azevedo I.L.M. Prieto da Silva A.R. Carmona E. Ho P.L. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a template"
https://openalex.org/W2017778883,"Reversible phosphorylation plays important roles in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, desensitization, and endocytosis, yet the precise location and role of in vivophosphorylation sites is unknown for most receptors. Using metabolic32P labeling and phosphopeptide sequencing we provide a complete phosphorylation map of the human bradykinin B2receptor in its native cellular environment. We identified three serine residues, Ser339, Ser346, and Ser348, at the C-terminal tail as principal phosphorylation sites. Constitutive phosphorylation occurs at Ser348, while ligand-induced phosphorylation is found at Ser339 and Ser346/Ser348 that could be executed by several G protein-coupled receptor kinases. In addition, we found a protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Ser346that was mutually exclusive with the basal phosphorylation at Ser348 and therefore may be implicated in differential regulation of B2 receptor activation. Functional analysis of receptor mutants revealed that a low phosphorylation stoichiometry is sufficient to initiate receptor sequestration while a clustered phosphorylation around Ser346 is necessary for desensitization of the B2 receptor-induced phospholipase C activation. This was further supported by the specifically reduced Ser346/Ser348 phosphorylation observed upon stimulation with a nondesensitizing B2 receptor agonist.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase bradykinin B2 receptor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C phospholipase C polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphorylated serine G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 constitute the largest family of proteins converting external stimuli into intracellular activity. They share a common deduced structure comprising seven α-helical transmembrane domains connected by extra- and intracellular loops. Through their intracellular domains they interact with heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn modulate the activity of various effectors, such as adenylate cyclases, phospholipases, and ion channels. These effectors generate the intracellular second messengers, which ultimately evoke cellular responses (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Signal transduction of GPCRs is carefully controlled: continuous or repeated agonist stimulation leads to an attenuation of the response, a phenomenon called desensitization. Although desensitization of receptor/G protein/effector systems generally involves perturbations of all three components, the impairment of the ability of receptors to activate G proteins appears to be the most important and seems to involve an agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation (2Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 322: 1-18Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 3Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Much of the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms governing desensitization has come from studies of rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptors (5Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. De Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Sibley D.R. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin, which is available in much greater quantities than any other GPCR, has been successfully subjected to mapping of in vitro(i.e. purified and reconstituted components) and invivo (i.e. in cultured cells) phosphorylation sites in its C-terminal tail (8Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Papac D.L. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-57124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More recently, the identification of phosphorylation sites in the reconstituted β2-adrenergic receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 and GRK5 was reported (10Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these in vitro phosphorylation sites has subsequently been challenged by mutagenesis studies that failed to correlate the presence of the mapped residues with cellular receptor-mediated functions (11Seibold A. January B.G. Friedman J. Hipkin R.W. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7637-7642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be explained by the rather poor substrate specificity of GRKs in reconstituted systems resulting in the phosphorylation of sites not used in vivo (2Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 322: 1-18Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). For instance, rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) phosphorylates the β2-adrenergic receptor in vitro, and rhodopsin is an excellent substrate for GRK2 in reconstituted systems (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 12Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Somers R.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1986; 322: 869-872Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, due to their differential tissue distribution both combinations are very unlikely to play a relevant role under physiological conditions. Thus, phosphorylation sites of GPCRs identified in vitro do not necessarily correlate with sites that tune receptor functions in a native cellular environment. In many studies site-directed mutagenesis and total phosphorylation of GPCRs has been performed to screen for key amino acids involved in signal transduction. Using this approach, several mutant receptors have been generated that were useful to corroborate a role of GPCR phosphorylation in adaptation processes (5, 13, 14). For example, four consecutive serine residues in the third intracellular loop were identified as the major phosphorylation sites of the α2A-adrenergic receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their phosphorylation correlated in an additive manner with the desensitization of the receptor-mediated reduction of cellular cAMP levels (13Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A general limitation of the mutagenesis approach is that truncations, deletions, or exchanges of amino acids often affect receptor structure, trafficking, localization, and stability or intervene with GRK recognition. Therefore, mutagenesis studies may allow valuable deductions about in vivo phosphorylation sites but the unequivocal identification of these sites requires receptor purification and biochemical analysis. Because of the hydrophobic nature and inherently low expression of GPCRs this particularly challenging task has not yet been accomplished for a single non-rhodopsin GPCR. In an effort to identify the in vivophosphorylation sites of a prototypical GPCR, we chose to study the human bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). Previous work has demonstrated that the B2R desensitizes upon prolonged or repeated agonist stimulation (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a cluster of serine and threonine residues located in the C-terminal tail of the B2R has been suggested to hold potential phosphorylation sites (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J.

Using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and Edman sequencing we report the complete in vivophosphorylation pattern of the human B2R and demonstrate that the differential usage of clustered phosphoacceptor sites contributes to the complex regulation of receptor sequestration and desensitization. [3H]Bradykinin (1.48–4.07 TBq/mmol), [32P]orthophosphate (360 MBq/ml), andmyo-[3H]inositol (2.96–4.44 TBq/mmol) were from Amersham; bradykinin was from Bachem; aprotinin (TrasylolTM) was from Bayer; AG-X8 anion exchanger resin was from Bio-Rad; GF109203X and PMA were from Calbiochem; bacitracin and PefablocTM were from FLUKA; FR190997 was a kind gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., LipofectAMINETM and protein markers were from Life Technologies; cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from Merck; sequencing grade trypsin was from Promega; leupeptin was from Roche Molecular Bioscience; nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell; phosphoamino acid standards were from Sigma; and protein A-agarose was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. All tissue culture reagents were from Sigma and Life Technologies. Mutants of the human B2R were generated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH. The following constructs have been previously described: S339A, S348A, and ΔST (17Pizard A. Blaukat A. Müller-Esterl W. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12738-12747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Point mutations were created by the same procedure to replace serine residues (by single nucleotide substitution) by alanine using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GCACACTGCGGACCGCCATCTCCGTG-3′ for S346A, 5′-GAACGCCATGGGCACACTGCGGACCGCCATCTCCGTGG-3′ for S339A/S346A, 5′-GCGGACCGCCATCGCCGTGG-3′ for S346A/S348A, and 5′-GAACGCCATGGGCACACTGCGGACCGCCATCGCCGTGG-3′ for ΔS. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the AmplicycleTM kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human embryonic kidney cells HEK293T were grown to about 50–70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were done in serum-free medium with the indicated cDNAs using 0.2–0.4 µg/well of a 24-well plate, 0.4–1 µg/well of a 12-well plate, 1–2 µg/well of a 6-well plate or 10 µg/10-cm dish by the LipofectAMINETM method according to the suppliers manual. Cells were used for experiments 48–60 h after transfection. HF-15 human foreskin fibroblasts were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Ligand binding and internalization were measured according to established procedures using [3H]bradykinin (20Munoz C.M Cotecchia S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 301: 336-344Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells grown on 12-well plates were used 40 h after transfection with B2R constructs. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmbacitracin, and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in the same solution containing 5 nm [3H]bradykinin in the absence (“total binding”) or presence (“nonspecific binding”) of 5 µm unlabeled bradykinin. Internalization of the receptor was initiated by incubating cells for different time periods at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice to remove free ligand, and the cell-bound [3H]bradykinin was extracted with 0.2m acetic acid, pH 2.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and radioactivity of the extract was measured (“surface-associated bradykinin”). The acid-stripped cells were dissolved in 1 m NaOH and the radioactivity of the lysate was determined (“intracellular bradykinin”). Phospholipase C activity was measured by analyzing inositol phosphate accumulation (21Cramer H. Müller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13325-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells grown on 24-well plates were labeled with 1 µCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h in inositol-free Ham's F-12 including 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, treated for 5 min with 10 mm LiCl and then challenged with 0.01–1 µm bradykinin for 10 min in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid. Water-soluble inositols were extracted for 2–12 h at 4 °C and separated by anion exchange chromatography using AG-X8 as a resin. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 m ammonium formate and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Results were normalized for total labeling of lipid pools, which was calculated from the radioactivity in water-soluble extracts and cells. To follow desensitization, cells were pretreated with 100 nm bradykinin for 5 min. Following removal of excess of ligand by washing cells three times with medium, 10 mm LiCl was added 10 or 15 min after the initial stimulation and inositol phosphate levels were measured as described above. 32P labeling of cells (1–2 mCi/ml for 6–8 h), solubilization, and immunoprecipitation of B2R using an antiserum against the C-terminal receptor domain were done as detailed previously (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For HF-15 cells with endogenous B2R, a 10-cm dish was used, whereas for transiently transfected HEK293T and COS-7 cells a well of a 6-well plate was sufficient for the following procedure. After 10% SDS-PAGE proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry unit from Bio-Rad. Radiolabeled B2R was detected by PhosphorImager (BAS2000, Fuji) analysis and tryptic digests were performed as described by Boyle et al. (22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, membrane pieces containing the32P-labeled B2R were cut out and blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidon 40 in 0.6% acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. Following extensive washes with water, membrane bound B2R was cleaved in situ with 1 µg of modified sequencing grade trypsin in 200 µl of 50 mm(NH4)HCO3 for 12 h at 37 °C. Released tryptic peptides were vacuum-dried and oxidized with 50 µl of performic acid for 1 h on ice. Reactions were stopped by dilution with 500 µl of 20% (v/v) ammonia solution. Thereafter samples were frozen, vacuum-dried, and a second digest was performed with 1 µg of trypsin in 50 µl of 50 mm(NH4)HCO3 for 12 h at 37 °C. Following vacuum drying, samples were dissolved in 5 µl of electrophoresis buffer (formic acid:acetic acid:water, 46:156:1790 (v/v/v)) and phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer plates in a first dimension (2000 V, 40 min, electrophoresis buffer) and ascending chromatography in a second dimension (15 h, isobutyric acid, 1-butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, water, 1250:38:96:58:558 (v/v/v/v/v)). Phosphopeptides were detected by PhosphorImager analysis and eluted from the cellulose matrix with 2 × 250 µl of 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in a sonicated water bath for 15 min. Part of the extract (25–100 cpm) was hydrolyzed with 6m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C and subjected to a phosphoamino acid analysis (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

Twenty sequencing cycles were collected, dried, and analyzed for their content of 32P radioactivity using a PhosphorImager. Data obtained from Edman degradation (position of phosphoamino acids in tryptic peptides) and phosphoamino acid analysis (phosphorylated amino acid), the known sequence of tryptic peptides (Table I) and the anticipated transmembrane topography of the B2R (23Hess J.F.

To molecularly characterize the importance of receptor phosphorylation in signal transduction of the B2R, we applied an analytical two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping strategy to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites of the receptor (22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). HF-15 human fibroblasts expressing 400–750 fmol of endogenous B2R/mg of protein were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with bradykinin, lysed, and B2R was immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-peptide antibody (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and the radiolabeled B2R was detected as a 55–68-kDa band by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig.1A). Notably the broadness of the band and an occasionally observed doublet are likely due to heterogeneous glycosylation (24Blaukat A. Herzer K. Schroeder C. Bachmann M. Nash N. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In average a 4.0 ± 0.5-fold increase of the basal B2R phosphorylation was observed in bradykinin-stimulated cells. In situ digestion with trypsin-generated phosphopeptides that were separated on thin layer plates by high voltage electrophoresis and ascending chromatography. PhosphorImager analysis revealed a major phosphopeptide in untreated cells that contained more than 80% of the total radioactivity (Fig.1A, peptide 1). The same phosphopeptide was present in bradykinin-stimulated cells as well as three additional32P-labeled peptides (Fig. 1A, peptides 2–4). Total hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis performed with a fraction of the material isolated from the spots revealed that peptides 1, 2, and 3 contained exclusively phosphoserine whereas peptide 4 carried the 32P label both on serine and threonine (Fig.1B). The major fraction of the peptides was used for solid phase Edman sequencing. Because peptide quantities were too low for chemical conversion and identification of released amino acids, cleavage products of 20 sequencing cycles were collected and analyzed for their 32P content using a PhosphorImager. The majority of radioactivity from peptide 1 eluted in cycle 4 (Fig. 1C). Together with the finding that phosphate in peptide 1 is exclusively attached to serine (cf. Fig. 1B), we conclude that the fragment covering amino acid positions 345–351 of the human B2R sequence (Ref. 23Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, TableI) is the only one present in the tryptic digest that can be serine phosphorylated at position 4, namely at Ser348 (pS348). Peptide 2 generated a peak of radioactivity in sequencing cycle 9 thus identifying Ser339 as the phosphorylation site (Fig. 1C, Table I). In the case of peptide 3, peaks of radioactivity were detected in cycles 2 and 4, whereas peptide 4 released 32P in cycles 9 and 12 (Fig.1C). Alignment with the sequence of tryptic peptides (TableI) and consideration of the data from the phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1B) allowed the identification of Ser346and Ser348 (peptide 3) and Ser339 and Thr342 (peptide-4) as B2R phosphorylation sites. For a more quantitative comparison, two-dimensional maps from several experiments were analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The contribution of the individual 32P-labeled peptides to total phosphorylation was calculated for untreated and bradykinin-stimulated cells and corrected for the increase in total phosphorylation. The contribution of peptide 4 containing pS339/T342 to total receptor phosphorylation was always very low (<5%), and therefore this peptide was excluded from quantitative studies. As shown in Fig. 1D, phosphorylation of Ser348 in peptide 1 did not significantly change during agonist challenge on this relative scale. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser339 and the double-labeled peptide 3 containing pS346/S348 increased about 10- and >40-fold, respectively, in the presence of bradykinin (Fig. 1,A and D). To validate the assignment of B2R phosphorylation sites we used receptor mutants in which Ser339, Ser346, and Ser348individually or in combinations were replaced by alanine residues. Comparable expression levels of all mutants were confirmed by binding assays and immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins (not shown). Immunoprecipitation of the 32P-labeled B2R mutants revealed that the ligand-induced phosphorylation of S339A and S346A was slightly reduced whereas the basal phosphorylation in the absence of a ligand was essentially unchanged over the wild-type receptor (Fig.2A). In contrast, we observed a complete lack of basal phosphorylation in S348A and S346A/S348A mutants, together with a significantly decreased bradykinin-induced phosphorylation. Basal phosphorylation of the double mutant S339A/S346A was slightly increased, and only a minor increment was observed upon bradykinin stimulation. Finally, the ΔS (S339A/S346A/S348A) and ΔST (S339A/S346A/S348A-T342A/T345A) mutants failed to produce any significant phosphorylation above background (Fig.2A). Mutant B2R were further subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and the resultant phosphopeptides were characterized by phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman degradation. Surprisingly, a major phosphorylated peptide was seen in the S348A mutant in a similar location as peptide 1 in wild-type B2R (Fig. 2B, arrow). Sequence and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the S348A mutant had a compensatory phosphorylation at Ser346 in position 2 of the corresponding peptide (Fig.2B). In the single mutants S339A and S346A as well as in the double mutants S339A/S346A and S346A/S348A, phosphopeptides corresponding to peptides 2 and 3 of wild-type B2R (cf. Fig. 1A) were absent from the two-dimensional maps (Fig. 2C) thus confirming our identification of vivo B2R phosphorylation sites. Under these conditions, no phosphopeptide(s) of significant quantity was detected in the two-dimensional maps of the ΔS and ΔST variants. Taken together, we have identified (i) graded phosphorylation of four closely spaced residues, Ser348 > Ser346 > Ser339 ≫ Thr342, (ii) basal phosphorylation at a single site, Ser348, (iii) bradykinin-induced phosphorylation at two major sites, Ser346 and Ser339, and (iv) combined phosphorylation at Ser346 and Ser348. Co-expression of receptors with GRKs is commonly used to obtain information about the nature of kinases involved in GPCR phosphorylation (25Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To identify potential kinase(s) executing B2R phosphorylation and to locate their corresponding substrate sites we analyzed the phosphopeptide patterns of B2R co-transfected with human GRK2–6 in HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled cells indicated that total basal and bradykinin-mediated B2R phosphorylation did not significantly change upon co-expression with GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, or GRK6 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, expression of GRK4α drastically increased the basal level of32P incorporation into B2R. However, phosphopeptide maps revealed quantitative changes in the distribution of phosphopeptides for the various GRKs. For example, 32P labeling of peptide 3 containing pS346/pS348 was enhanced 1.5–3-fold as compared with mock-transfected cells in the order GRK6 < GRK5 < GRK2 < GRK4α < GRK3. Most prominently, GRK4α elevated the basal phosphorylation of Ser339 and Ser346/Ser348 15- and 24-fold, respectively. These results suggest that several endogenous GRKs may phosphorylate the B2R and that the various GRKs, even without apparent effect on total GPCR phosphorylation levels, may induce distinct phosphorylation patterns with possible functional consequences for receptor desensitization and sequestration. We have previously observed that activators of protein kinase C may induce a ligand-independent phosphorylation of the B2R (15Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

Little is known, however, about how accessory factors function in these hormone response units.

This series of observations suggests that the accessory factors required for the glucocorticoid response may facilitate GR binding to the GR1 and GR2 elements. Here we perform quantitative, real time equilibrium and stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy measurements of protein-DNA interactions in nuclear extracts to demonstrate that the multicomponent complexes that regulate PEPCK gene transcription form and dissociate with kinetics appropriate for the rapid changes in the transcription of this gene mediated by hormones (15Sasaki K.

Further, two functionally distinct accessory factor elements, which bind HNF3β and HNF4, differentially promote the stability of GR in the GRU complex. These results suggest that the magnitude of gene regulation in response to glucocorticoids may be achieved by modulation of GR binding by accessory factors. Oligonucleotides were made by an Expedite 8909 oligonucleotide synthesizer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I.

Emission at 620 nm was detected through two photo detectors, assembled in T format, which allows simultaneous determination of the horizontal and vertical components of emitted light. At these excitation/emission wavelengths, the contribution of background fluorescence from the buffer or from protein scattering is negligible. For each fluorescence anisotropy determination, 60–100 consecutive 0.5-s measurements were made and averaged. Using this technique, 95% confidence intervals of individual measurements are typically less than 0.0001 anisotropy unit; thus even small changes in anisotropy can be measured. The binding buffer used contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 250 µm ZnSO4, 6% glycerol, 6.25 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 500 nm dexamethasone and was prepared fresh for each experiment. The concentrations of zinc and dexamethasone used provide for optimal binding of GR (24Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). There is no difference in the binding capacity of GR if the extract is preincubated at 25 °C for 30 min or kept on ice for the duration of the experiment, presumably because of the presence of dexamethasone in both cell culture and binding buffer (25Schmidt T.J. Miller-Diener A. Webb M.L. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16255-16262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by two complementary methods; first, by competition with unlabeled GRE and secondly by binding of nuclear extract to a labeled oligonucleotide with point mutations in the GRE and without necessary flanking sequences for GR binding (26La Baer J. Yamamoto K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 664-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,27Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Cao X.A. Beato M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These methods produced identical results. The nonspecific binding experiment was repeated three times with an S.E. < 0.001 anisotropy unit. Linear regression through these data (Sigma Plot 5.0) was used to generate the line for nonspecific binding shown in Fig. 1 b. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Only specific binding is shown in the remaining steady-state experiments (Figs. 1 c and 2, a–d). Titrations of nuclear extract up to 20 µg are shown. There is no increase in specific binding with further additions. The nonspecific oligonucleotide used in Fig. 1 c contains the gAF2 element to demonstrate that competition with gAF2 itself does not eliminate GR binding. Other nonspecific oligonucleotides produced similar results. For antibody experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the indicated antibodies on ice for 30 min (anti-GR was a gift from K. Yamamoto; anti-mineralocorticoid receptor was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Curves were generated using non-linear regression analysis (Sigma Plot 5.0). In graphs in which multiple curves are presented (Fig. 2, a, b, andc), the results represent the mean of at least three experiments. The standard error at each data point between experiments was typically less than 0.001 anisotropy unit. A pre-steady-state stopped-flow analysis allows complex assembly and disassembly to be observed in real time. This set of binding experiments uses a fluorescence depolarization assay similar to that employed in the previous experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), except that fluorescence excitation utilized a Coherent Inova 310 argon-ion laser (Santa Clara, CA) directed into the sample cell. Excitation was vertically polarized at 488 nm. This wavelength is near the excitation maximum of the fluorescent dye fluorescein; thus the same oligonucleotides used in Figs. 1 and 2 were conjugated with fluorescein for detection (Fig. 1 a). Fluorescent emission was observed simultaneously in the vertical and horizontally polarized planes through Oriel 20 nm band pass filters centered at 520 nm and Glan-Thompson polarizers. A Biologic SFM4 stopped-flow unit (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, MA) was used with a 50-µl FC15 fluorescence cuvette and hard-stop shutter. More details about this experimental setup have been reported (20Dunkak K.S. Otto M.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All buffers were extensively degassed before use. Data for all experiments were collected with a fraction of data channels devoted to internal controls. Data were collected for 20 ms per channel for 8192 total channels. Dilute solutions of labeled oligonucleotide and buffer, or oligonucleotide and nuclear extract, were rapidly mixed (1:1) to determine free oligonucleotide anisotropy and association rates, respectively. The dead time is ∼15 ms for flow rates of 2 ml/s. To measure dissociation rates, complexes were preformed on ice for 15 min, allowed to equilibrate to room temperature, and mixed 1:1 with a 50× excess of unlabeled palindromic GRE. The ratio of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide and nuclear extract used corresponds to a saturating level with regard to GR binding detected in steady-state experiments. 16–25 kinetic measurements, or shots, were summed to obtain adequate signal to noise ratios. All shots are precisely synchronized with regard to mixing by a sync-out pulse from the SFM4 control unit. Differences in intrinsic depolarization between rhodamine X and fluorescein account for the differences in the free oligonucleotide anisotropy values seen for the same oligonucleotides (0.184 for the palindromic GRE as observed by rhodamine emission and 0.048 as observed by fluorescein emission). The equilibrium and kinetic properties of the protein-DNA complexes quantitated in this study were found to be independent of the specific fluorophore used for detection. The dynamics of assembly of the GRU were studied using fluorescence anisotropy, an assay based on the principle that DNA in solution undergoes rotational diffusion that varies with molecular weight. The rotational motion of DNA is slowed when proteins are bound and can be detected through changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled oligonucleotides, which include various segments of the PEPCK gene promoter represented in Fig.1 a (21Bloom L.B.

Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar). H4IIE hepatoma cell nuclear extracts provided the GR and accessory factors in appropriate physiologic concentration. This protein preparation is particularly useful for studying the function of GR, which is not easily purified and is unstable in solution in the absence of appropriate stabilizing factors (28Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Meshinchi S. Stancato L.F. Gordon B.M. Jones K.W. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Induction and repression of PEPCK gene transcription are rapid events (15Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L.

Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); thus the most important advantage of this assay is that dynamic binding events can be observed. No separation of free and complex-bound DNA is required; thus the equilibrium conditions necessary to study cooperative binding can be maintained. The requirements for GR binding to a simple response element in vitro have been well characterized (26La Baer J. Yamamoto K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 664-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Payvar F. Wrange O. Carlstedt-Duke J. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6628-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We used this knowledge to demonstrate that GR in a nuclear extract can specifically bind to a palindromic GRE contained within a double-stranded oligonucleotide 29 base pairs in length (29-mer) labeled at the 5′ end with the fluorescent dye rhodamine X (filled circles, Fig.1 b). Addition of GR-containing nuclear extract shows the expected saturation (open triangles, Fig. 1 b), and nonspecific binding increases linearly (dashed line, Fig. 1 b). Competition with an unlabeled palindromic GRE eliminates nearly all specific binding (Fig. 1, b and c, bar 3). Addition of a nonspecific oligonucleotide that does not bind GR has little effect (Fig. 1 c, bar 4). A competitor containing a consensus GRE competes for this binding as well as the palindromic GRE (data not shown); thus competition is dependent on affinity of the competitor for GR and is specific. The binding seen in Fig. 1 b can be recapitulated using partially purified GR (data not shown). We quantified the GR content in the nuclear extract preparations using this partially purified GR as a standard. There are ∼0.16 pmol of GR/µg of nuclear extract, providing an approximateK d of binding to the palindromic GRE of 5 nm. Binding of purified GR to this palindromic GRE has aK d of 7.5 nm (data not shown); thus GR from the nuclear extracts closely recapitulates the activity of the purified protein. The observed binding of GR from the nuclear extract is not restricted to the palindromic GRE. A consensus GRE with flanking sequences that maximize affinity for GR (26La Baer J. Yamamoto K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 664-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) binds GR with aK d of 1.6 nm GR (Fig. 1 c,bars 5 and 6, and Fig.2 a, filled circles). Preincubation of the nuclear extract with an antibody raised against the DNA binding domain of GR significantly reduces the ability of GR to associate with the consensus GRE, whereas an antibody raised against the mineralocorticoid receptor does not inhibit binding (Fig. 1 c, bars 8 and 9). The observed binding of GR to the palindromic and consensus GRE elements correlates with the measured affinity of GR for these sites (32Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wrange O. Eriksson P. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GR binds with very low affinity to the PEPCK GR1 and GR2 elements (13Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test whether the accessory factors enhance binding of GR for the low affinity GR1 and GR2 elements, we constructed a double-stranded rhodamine X-labeled oligonucleotide that spans the gAF2, GR1, and GR2 elements from the PEPCK gene promoter (Fig. 1 a). The presence of the gAF2 element restores the affinity of the GR-accessory factor complex binding to this promoter segment to a level comparable with that exhibited by GR for the consensus GRE (compare the filled circles in Fig. 2,a and b). This binding is completely dependent on association of the accessory factor with the gAF2 element, as a block mutation in gAF2, which prevents accessory factor binding and reduces the glucocorticoid effect (10Wang J.-C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar), leaves only GR1 level affinity (compare open triangles in Fig. 2, a andb). The gAF2-GR1-GR2 construct (a 76-mer) has a higher free anisotropy value than the palindromic GRE (a 29-mer); thus we predict that binding of a large protein complex would be needed to produce the observed anisotropy changes seen in Fig. 2 b (19Steiner R.F. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar). If the association of accessory factors with the gAF2 element does indeed restore affinity of GR for this complex, the GR should represent most of the bound mass on the gAF2-GR1-GR2 promoter segment. This prediction is based on the presumption that the complex is comprised of HNF3 (40 kDa) and four monomers of GR (each 90 kDa), as shown schematically in Fig.1 a. Preincubation of the nuclear extract with the anti-GR antibody prevents ∼70% of the mass assembled to this complex from forming, based on the anisotropy changes seen (Fig. 2 d,bar 3). Thus, the complex formed in vitrorecapitulates the complex that is required for functional induction of PEPCK gene transcription. The anti-GR antibody reduces the effective concentration of GR able to participate in this complex. The remaining mass on this promoter segment may indicate that this antibody is not 100% effective but likely represents the remaining mass of the gAF2-bound accessory factor, which binds to its response element with high affinity in the absence of GR (data not shown). HNF3 interacts with GR in vitro (14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the helical spacing between the gAF2 element and the GR1 element is critical for the glucocorticoid response (14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that a physical interaction between HNF3 and GR may be responsible for the facilitated binding seen here. In support of this hypothesis, we show that although GR represents the majority of the protein mass assembled to this complex (Fig. 2 d, bar 3), there is significantly less competitor-induced dissociation of GR from this complex than from the palindromic GRE (compare Fig. 2 d,bars 2 and 4, with Fig. 1 c, bars 2 and 3), indicating that this complex is quite stable with regard to GR binding. Whereas the gAF2 element can bind both HNF3 and C/EBP in vitro (10Wang J.-C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar), the facilitated binding of GR seen here requires HNF3, as the TTR HNF3 element can substitute for gAF2, whereas a gAF2 element with point mutations that only permit C/EBP binding, cannot (data not shown). This correlates precisely with the ability of these proteins to function as accessory factors in vivo (10Wang J.-C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). A complete set of accessory factors is required for induction of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids (1Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, when the GR1 element is replaced with a palindromic GRE, the gAF2 element is still required for the glucocorticoid response, but the gAF1 and gAF3 elements are not (13Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that two functionally distinct classes of accessory factors are required for the PEPCK gene glucocorticoid response. The gAF1 element binds both HNF4 and COUP-TF, whereas the gAF3 element binds only COUP-TF (Fig. 1 a) (8Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,9Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There is no functional consequence of replacing gAF3 with gAF1 and vice versa (14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this observation to create a GRU segment that contains the GR1 and GR2 elements but where the associated accessory factor element is gAF1 (Fig. 1 a). This allowed us to generate an oligonucleotide of the same length and free anisotropy value of gAF2-GR1-GR2. As with the gAF2 element, the association of gAF1 also restores affinity of the GR-accessory factor complex to the PEPCK gene promoter to a level comparable with the binding of GR to the consensus GRE (compare filled circles in Fig. 2,c and a). Again, GR contributes the majority of the mass in this protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 d, bar 7). Whereas GR binding to the GRU is facilitated by either class of accessory factor element, the GR1-GR2-gAF1 complex is less stable with regard to GR binding than is gAF2-GR1-GR2, as competition with an unlabeled consensus GRE oligonucleotide effectively eliminates GR binding from the former (compare Fig. 2 d, bars 4and 8). A block mutation that prevents HNF4 and COUP-TF binding is much less effective in recruiting GR to GR1-GR2 (open triangles, Fig. 2 c, and Ref. 8Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although it is not known if HNF4 or COUP-TF can interact with GR, the set of experiments shown in Fig. 2 suggests that the factors bound to the gAF1 element facilitate binding of GR by a mechanism different from that employed by HNF3 at gAF2. The increases in anisotropy seen by binding of GR to the consensus GRE and PEPCK gene GRU segments occur too rapidly to be measured by steady-state techniques (Figs. 1 and 2). Pre-steady-state stopped-flow analysis provides the additional advantages of rapid mixing and detection to these experiments, so that complex assembly and disassembly can be observed in real time. For the palindromic GRE, binding is effectively complete in less than 100 ms (Fig. 3a). A slower second phase of association is observed but is of undetermined significance (Fig. 3 a). Competition with an unlabeled palindromic GRE gives a rapid decrease in anisotropy, again with most dissociation complete in less than 100 ms (Fig. 3 b). The association-dissociation rates measured here represent multiple rounds of binding and dissociation of GR to the palindromic GRE before equilibrium is reached (34Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28413-28420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The experiments shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that association of the PEPCK accessory factor elements facilitates GR binding to the GRU. Using fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides that span GR1–GR2, and including either gAF2 or gAF1 (Fig. 1 a), we sought to determine the association rates of the protein-DNA complexes. The observed formation of an enhanceosome-like structure by either gAF2 or gAF1 occurs rapidly (Fig. 3, c and e). Both GRU segments form complexes with kinetics of binding similar to that observed when GR binds to the palindromic GRE (Fig. 3 a). Whereas all of the complexes formed equally rapidly within the detection limits of this system, dissociation of GR is dramatically slowed by the presence of the adjacent accessory factor elements. Indeed, there is substantially less dissociation of GR from the complex bound to gAF2-GR1-GR2 (Fig. 3 d). These results are qualitatively similar to the steady-state composition of this complex, where there is very little GR dissociation (Fig. 2 d,bar 4), despite GR contributing ∼70% of the mass of this complex (Fig. 2 d, bar 3). The physical association of GR with HNF3 may account for the stability of this complex (14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, GR readily dissociates from the GR1-GR2-gAF1 complex (Fig. 2 d, bar 8), albeit about 10 times more slowly than dissociation of GR from the palindromic GRE (compareb and f in Fig. 3). Binding to an oligonucleotide containing only the gAF2 element is also complete within 100 ms (data not shown); thus it may be that prior association of the accessory factors creates a high affinity binding environment to the GR1-GR2 elements that, as a complex, functions as well as the palindromic GRE. Indeed, in this study we show that high affinity binding of GR to the PEPCK gene promoter is strictly dependent on associated accessory factor elements. It was not possible to test the individual roles of HNF3, HNF4, and COUP-TF as accessory factors in these biophysical experiments (as described for GR in Fig. 2) because antibodies that prevent DNA binding for these factors are not currently available. However, in support of this model, we have shown by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that the accessory factors described here are constitutively bound to the PEPCK gene promoterin vivo, creating a high affinity binding environment for GR, which only binds to the promoter in the presence of glucocorticoids (35Faber S. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Duong and D. K. Granner, unpublished observation. Additionally, we show that GR binding to a GRE is intrinsically rapid but can be altered by association with accessory factors. We speculate that even small changes in the dynamics of the structures involved in gene regulation could have a large impact on the physiological end points of the processes controlled by these gene products, such as glucose production. Simultaneous changes in the regulation of multiple genes whose products are involved in the same pathway have a large combined impact on glucose production (36Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For instance, overexpression of an HNF3 variant that reduces the responses of the PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase genes to glucocorticoids by ∼50% nearly abolishes glucocorticoid-induced glucose production in hepatoma cells. Although GR binding to a GRE is dynamic (Fig. 3 and Ref. 37McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and such binding is stabilized by accessory factors, these complexes still form and dissociate within a few seconds (Fig. 3). We propose that dynamic structures such as the PEPCK gene GRU provide for the adaptable regulation of metabolic genes that is seen in vivo. The maintenance of glucose homeostasis in the face of the gradient of nutrient availability imposed by the extremes of the fasting and fed states is created by changes in the rates of glucose production and utilization. These adaptive responses are achieved by the products of a concert of genes that require accessory factors for hormonal regulation of their expression. Complex hormone response units, in which receptor binding and dissociation are modulated by accessory factors, provide variable rates of gene transcription and could be a mechanism by which a gradient of glucose production is generated. Gradients of gene products necessary for processes such as development, differentiation, and host defense responses may also be achieved by this mechanism.

Lee Limbird, Mary Waltner-Law, Utpal Banik, and Jen-Chywan Wang for helpful advice, and Deborah Caplenor Brown for helping to prepare this manuscript."

However, in most aquatic ecosystems it can be sufficiently low to limit photosynthetic activity (1Martin J.H. et al.Nature. 1994; 371: 123-129Crossref Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 2Behrenfeld M.J. Bale A.J. Zbigniew S.K. Aiken J. Falkowski P.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 508-511Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This finding is attributed mainly to the low solubility of Fe3+ above neutral pH in oxygenic ecosystems (3Braun V. Schaffer S. Hantke K. Troger W. Hauska G. Thauer R. The Molecular Basis of Bacterial Metabolism. Berlin VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft, Germany1990: 35-51Google Scholar). As a result, cyanobacteria and other microorganisms have evolved a number of responses to cope with frequently occurring conditions of iron deficiency (4Straus N.A. Bryant D.A. Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 731-750Google Scholar). One such response is to express two “iron stress-induced” genes, isiA and isiB (5Pakrasi H.B. Riethman H.C. Sherman L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Laudenbach D. Straus N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5018-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which are located on the same operon. The isiB gene encodes for flavodoxin, which can functionally replace the iron containing ferredoxin (7Hutber G.N. Hutson K.G. Rogers L.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 1: 193-196Crossref Google Scholar). The isiA gene encodes for a protein often called CP43′, because it has an amino acid sequence homologous to that of the chlorophyll a-binding protein, CP43 of photosystem II (PSII)1 (8Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Falk S. Samson G. Bruce D. Hunter N.P.A. Laudenbach D.A. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 45: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Like CP43, CP43′ is predicted to have six transmembrane helices, and judged by the conservation of histidine residues, it is likely to bind the same number of chlorophyll a molecules. The major difference is that CP43′ lacks the large hydrophilic loop that joins the luminal ends of helices V and VI of CP43. For this reason, it has 342 amino acids rather than 472 (see Fig. 1). Under iron stress, the isiA gene is transcribed into two messages, a monocistronic message containing only isiA and a dicistronic message that also contains the isiB gene (10Laudenbach D.E. Reith M.E. Straus N.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 258-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the discovery of the CP43-like iron stress-induced protein was made some time ago (11Guikema J.A. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1984; 74: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its precise function has not been elucidated. There have been at least four postulates. (i) CP43′ aids the recovery of cells by acting as a chlorophyll store so that PSII and photosystem I (PSI) complexes can be quickly synthesized when iron becomes readily available in the environment (12Riethman H.C. Sherman L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). (ii) CP43′ protects PSII from photo-induced damage by acting as a dissipater of excitation energy (13Park Y.P. Sandström S. Gustafsson P. Öquist G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). (iii) CP43′ is a functional replacement for CP43 in PSII during iron starvation (8Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). (iv) CP43′ acts as a light-harvesting complex under iron stress conditions, mainly for PSII (5Pakrasi H.B. Riethman H.C. Sherman L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) but perhaps also for PSI (16Tetenkin V.L. Golitsin V.M. Gulyaev B.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1998; 63: 584-591PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we showed for the first time that a CP43′-PSI trimer supercomplex can be isolated from the cyanobacteriaSynechocystis PCC 6803 when grown under iron-stressed conditions (17Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here we report a more detailed description of this supercomplex and present a preliminary three-dimensional model of its structure. All studies were conducted on preparations isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 having a histidine tag attached to the C terminus of the PSII protein, CP47 (18Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Marsi N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were grown photoheterotrophically in mineral medium BG-11 (19Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar), containing kanamycin and glucose at 30 °C and 70 microeinstein m−2·s−1 illumination. Iron-stressed cultures were obtained by growing cells in the same BG-11 medium but lacking iron-containing compounds. Cultures were harvested after 3 days, and in the case of the iron-starved culture, the cells had a blue shift in their long wavelength absorption band of approximately 7 nm compared with that of normal cells. Thylakoid membranes were isolated using a procedure similar to that described by Tang and Diner (20Tang X-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The isolated membranes (1 mg chlorophyll·ml−1) were solubilized with 1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm using a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The supernatant was then passed through a Ni2+affinity column. Given that CP47 had a histidine tag, PSII was selectively bound to the column while the non-bound fraction containing PSI was collected. Continuous sucrose density gradients were prepared according to the freeze-thaw method provided by Hankamer et al. (21Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The PSI-enriched fraction eluted from the affinity column was layered on top of the gradient and subjected to 12 h of centrifugation in a SW28 rotor at 26,000 rpm. The resulting bands were independently removed for biochemical and structural characterization. The separation of the PSI fraction into discrete populations for estimating molecular masses was also accomplished by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex BioSep SEC S3000 column coupled to a Kontron high performance liquid chromatography system. Elution profiles were monitored at 670 nm and 280 nm to detect chlorophyll protein-containing fractions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described in Hankamer et al. (21Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Optical absorption spectra were measured at room temperature using a Shimadzu MPS 2000 spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer LS50 at 77 K and measured with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. To record fluorescence excitation spectra, the sample was excited between 650 and 700 nm, and the emission was detected at 720 nm. Preparations were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate on glow-discharged carbon-evaporated grids and imaged using a Philips CM 100 electron microscope at 80 kV. The magnification was calibrated at × 51,500. Twenty electron micrographs were taken for each preparation and subsequently calculated to have the first minima of their contrast transfer functions to be in the range of 17–23 Å. Electron micrographs were digitized using a Leafscan 45 densitometer set at a step size of 10 μm. Single particle data sets of ∼3000 (CP43′-PSI supercomplex) and 4200 (PSI trimer) were obtained by interactively selecting all possible particles from the micrographs. All subsequent processing was performed within the IMAGIC-5 software environment (22van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar,23van Heel M. Gowen B. Matedeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The single particle images were coarsened by a factor of 2, resulting in a sampling frequency of 3.88 Å/pixel on the specimen scale. Reference-free alignment coupled with multi-variate statistical analysis was used to classify each data set to identify initial class averages. These data were then used for iterative refinement, resulting in the improved class averages. The relative orientations of the improved class averages were determined by the angular reconstitution technique (24van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), allowing for an initial three-dimensional reconstruction to be obtained by exact-back projection (25Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Reprojections were taken from this initial three-dimensional map to further refine the class averages and identify any atypical views present within the data set. The data converged after several rounds of iterative refinement in this manner, whereby roughly 40% of the class averages were discarded after assessment through cross-correlation functions. The resolution of the final three-dimensional map was determined by Fourier shell correlation (FCS) between two independent three-dimensional reconstructions (26Schatz M. Orlova E.V. Dube P. Jäger J. van Heel M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) compensated for the C3 symmetry used (27Orlova E.V. Dube P. Robin Harris J. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Coordinate data sets were obtained from the Research Collaboratory Structural Bioinformatics Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) for the entry codes 1C51 (PSI 4 Å structure (28Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)) and 1FE1 (PSII 3.8 Å structure (29Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar)). These structural models were visualized using the program Swiss-Protein Data Bank viewer (Glaxo-Wellcome Experimental Research (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar)) and modeled into the calculated three-dimensional map using the “O”-modeling software package (31Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). To isolate the CP43′-PSI supercomplex from Synechocystis PCC6803, we used a mutant that had a His tag attached to the C terminus of CP47, kindly provided by Dr. T. Bricker (Louisana State University, Baton Rouge) (18Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Marsi N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mutant was grown photoheterotrophically in the presence and absence of iron in the culture medium. Thylakoid membranes were isolated, and after solubilization with 1%β-d-dodecyl maltoside, were passed through a Ni2+ affinity column. PSII was selectively bound to the column via the His tag, whereas the non-bound fraction containing PSI was collected and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fig. 2 a shows that in the case of normal cells (Gradient A) two main chlorophyll-containing bands were observed corresponding to monomeric (band 2) and trimeric (band 3) PSI, whereas iron-stressed cells (Gradient B) gave two additional green bands (bands 1 and 4). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis shown in Fig. 2 b characterized the various bands and revealed that bands 1 and 4 contained free CP43′ and CP43′ plus PSI respectively. Size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the solubilized PSI fractions presented in Fig.3 a indicated that the two PSI bands obtained with normal cells corresponded to the approximate molecular masses expected for a monomeric (∼356 kDa) and trimeric (1068 kDa) PSI complex (32Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauβ N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar) with the trimer being the dominant species. The additional peaks observed after iron stress correspond to native chlorophyll-binding CP43′ (∼47 kDa) and a high molecular mass chlorophyll-containing species of approximately 1900 kDa, indicative of a CP43′ and PSI supercomplex. Also of importance is that the level of the PSI trimer in iron-stressed cells was significantly reduced compared with that of normal cells when normalized against the monomeric level of PSI.Figure 3High performance liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatography of PSI-enriched fractions ofSynechocystis isolated from (a) normally grown cells and (b) iron-stressed cells, detected at 670 nm for chlorophyll containing proteins, are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The room temperature optical absorption spectra of the isolated PSI trimer, CP43′, and the CP43′-PSI supercomplex are shown in Fig. 4. The PSI trimer has a long wavelength absorption maximum at 680 nm as compared with 670 nm for isolated free CP43′. As expected, the CP43′-PSI band has a maximum absorption at the intermediate wavelength of 673 nm. The high level of absorption in the 450–500-nm region in the case of CP43′ is because of its copurification with free carotenoid in the sucrose density gradients (see asterisk in Fig. 2 a). Fluorescence measured at 77 K showed that the PSI trimer had an emission maximum at 720 nm, whereas CP43′ fluoresced maximally at 685 nm (Fig. 5 a). However, in the case of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex, the emission profile was similar to that of PSI with the exception of some weak emission at approximately 685 nm. Upon the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, this weak signal at 685 nm changed to the dominant emission (Fig. 5 b), indicating that the detergent had uncoupled CP43′ from PSI and therefore suggesting that in the untreated sample, energy is efficiently transferred from CP43′ to PSI. Sucrose density gradient analyses showed that indeed the Triton X-100 treatment converted the CP43′-PSI band into trimeric PSI and free CP43′ (data not shown). Further confirmation that CP43′ within the CP43′-PSI supercomplex was functionally coupled to PSI was made by measuring excitation spectra for 77-K fluorescence emission at 720 nm (data not shown). We have shown previously by electron microscopy and single particle analysis that the CP43′-PSI supercomplex is composed of a PSI trimer surrounded by a ring of 18 subunits of CP43′ (17Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The structural model presented in this initial report (17Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) was obtained by analyzing top views only, but other views were also observed in the electron micrographs including side elevations and views attributed to tilting particles. We have, therefore, taken advantage of these other views to obtain a range of class averages of the supercomplex, and a three-dimensional model has been calculated. Fig. 6 a shows nine typical class averages taken from 76 class averages that shows a range of orientations as derived from a 3000-particle data set. All 76 class averages were used to construct the three-dimensional model representing ∼2200 single particles. This three-dimensional model is shown in Fig. 6 b as surface-rendered views and at the same orientation as the class averages given in Fig. 6 a. It clearly indicates that the central PSI trimer is surrounded by 18 CP43′ subunits. According to Fourier shell correlation analysis (Fig.6 c), the three-dimensional model has a resolution of approximately 24 Å. It is quite apparent from the comparison of the class averages that both stromal and luminal views were incorporated into the three-dimensional model. For example, the feature marked with an arrow in the class average numbered 1 in Fig.6 a is displaced to the right within each of the PSI monomers, whereas in class average numbered 4 it is displaced to the left. This finding indicates that these 2 two-dimensional class averages are derived from particles imaged from different sides of the supercomplex. Thus, the relative orientations of these two averages differ by ∼180°. This difference is present in the three-dimensional model and therefore is a reliable feature within all the class averages used. From this observation, we conclude that the supercomplex can orientate itself with its luminal or stromal surface toward the carbon grid and that the three-dimensional model reflects this fact. Although the present three-dimensional model of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex has potential for further refinement by electron cryomicroscopy of non-stained vitrified samples, it does provide a framework in which to model the structures of PSI (28Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and CP43 (29Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) obtained by x-ray crystallography of complexes isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus. The structure of the PSI trimer is now at a resolution of 2.5 Å (32Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauβ N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar), but at the time of submitting this paper only the 4-Å model of Krauβet al. (28Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) was available in the data base. In the case of CP43, the 3.8-Å data are available (29Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) and have been used to model the 6-transmembrane helices and the positioning of the tetrapyrrole headgroups of chlorophyll a. We have taken the models of the PSI trimer and CP43 derived by x-ray crystallography and built them into the three-dimensional electron microscopy map of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex as shown in Figs. 7 and8.Figure 8Preliminary model of chlorophyll organization of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex using coordinates from the 4-Å x-ray PSI trimer structure (27Orlova E.V. Dube P. Robin Harris J. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and 3.8-Å PSII CP43 structure (28Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The model is based on the coordinate data sets IC51 (PSI) and IFE1 (PSII). The chlorophylls of the PSI trimer are in green and those of CP43 in red. The modeled chlorophylls of CP43′ come closest to those of PSI at the regions marked with asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As a consequence of iron starvation, Synechocystis PCC 6803 expresses its isiA and isiB genes. Concomitant with this gene expression is a drop in the level of PSI (33Ivanov A.G. Park Y.-I. Miskiewicz E. Raven J.A. Huner N.P.A. Oquist G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and phycobiliproteins (5Pakrasi H.B. Riethman H.C. Sherman L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have found that in addition to these well recognized responses to iron limitation, Synechocystisforms a supercomplex composed of a ring of 18 copies of the CP43′ protein surrounding a PSI trimer. The CP43′-PSI supercomplex was isolated by sucrose density centrifugation, and size exclusion chromatography estimated its molecular mass to be approximately 1900 kDa. This mass is consistent with that predicted by the calculation for a PSI trimer (1068 kDa) plus 18 copies of the CP43′ protein (846 kDa). Assuming that each CP43′ subunit binds at least 12 chlorophylls as does CP43 (29Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Kraus N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), the CP43′ antenna ring of the PSI supercomplex would contain 216 or more chlorophylls. It is for this reason that the optical absorption spectrum of this supercomplex is significantly different from that of the PSI trimer alone. The chlorophyll amolecules bound within the CP43′ protein have a long wavelength absorption maximum at approximately 670 nm. Therefore, the long wavelength absorption peak shifts from 680 nm for PSI to 673 nm for the CP43′-PSI supercomplex. Some free CP43′ in the supercomplex preparation could also contribute to this blue shift, but fluorescence measurements suggest that this contamination is not significant. When isolated, the CP43′ protein has a relatively high fluorescence yield at 77 K peaking at 685 nm. Although some emission at this wavelength was detected from the CP43′-PSI supercomplex, the PSI low temperature fluorescence peaking at 720 nm was the dominating emission. Only after the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 to dissociate the CP43′ protein from the PSI trimer was a large fluorescence emission seen at 685 nm from the supercomplex. Therefore, we conclude that the chlorophylls within the CP43′ ring are excitonically coupled to those within the PSI trimer core. Given that the PSI trimer binds almost 300 chlorophylla molecules (32Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauβ N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar), we can conclude that the additional 216 chlorophylls in the CP43′ ring increases the light-harvesting capacity of the PSI reaction centers within the supercomplex by at least 70%. It has previously been suggested that CP43′ could act as an additional antenna of PSI (16Tetenkin V.L. Golitsin V.M. Gulyaev B.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1998; 63: 584-591PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here and elsewhere (17Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) clearly show that in response to iron deprivation, Synechocystis induces an additional antenna system for PSI. The processing of top views of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex indicate that the 18 CP43′ subunits do not form a perfect ring because of the fact that the PSI trimer is not circular. The three-dimensional model presented in Fig. 6 b was constructed using a number of top, intermediate, and side views showing that the supercomplex has a diameter of approximately 330 Å and a thickness of ∼80 Å in negative stain. Because the hydrophobic surfaces of the supercomplex must have a detergent layer, the true diameter is likely to be slightly less. The two-dimensional class averages (Fig. 6 a) and three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 6 b) reveal rather flat stromal and luminal surfaces that are not expected for the stromal surface since the PSI trimer normally binds extrinsic PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE proteins. However, we are confident that the three-dimensional model is composed of characteristic stromal and luminal views because differences can be observed in the internal density distribution of the PSI monomers within different two-dimensional class averages, indicative of different orientations on the carbon grid (see Fig. 6 a). The absence of the expected surface structural features attributed to PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE is emphasized when the x-ray structure of the PSI trimer is modeled into the three-dimensional model of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex (see Fig. 7). There is a possibility that the extrinsic proteins are dislodged by the uranyl acetate-staining procedure used before imaging in the electron microscope. It would be highly desirable to obtain a three-dimensional model for the supercomplex using non-stained samples and electron cryomicroscopy, which would remove any effects of uranyl acetate. However, there is the alternative possibility that the PSI reaction centers within the supercomplex do not bind all three extrinsic proteins. Under iron-stressed conditions flavodoxin replaces ferredoxin as the PSI electron acceptor. This may lead to modifications in the levels and binding affinities of the three extrinsic proteins. For example, flavodoxin can act as a PSI electron acceptor in the absence of PsaD and PsaE, whereas ferredoxin cannot (35Xu Q. Jung Y.S. Chitnis V.P. Guikema J.A. Goldbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 294: 21512-21518Google Scholar). The modeling of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex using the x-ray structures of the PSI trimer and of the PSII CP43, however, does provide a framework to start to understand how the chlorophylls of the CP43′ ring transfer energy to those bound within the PSI trimer. In Fig. 8, we have modeled the position of the chlorophylls derived from the x-ray crystallography into the CP43′-PSI complex. For convenience, we have assumed that the transmembrane helix and chlorophyll organization is the same in CP43′ and CP43, and that helices V and VI of CP43′ are located closest to the reaction center core as they are in the case of CP43 within the PSII structure (36Klukas O. Schubert W.D. Jordan P. Krauss N. Frommme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7351-7360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Hankamer, B., Morris, E., Nield, J., Gerle, C., and Barber, J. (2001)J. Struct. iol, in press.Google Scholar). The resulting model is consistent with our finding that the chlorophyll molecules of the CP43′ ring and PSI trimer are sufficiently close to facilitate energy transfer to the PSI reaction centers. Of particular note is that there seems to be possible entry points for energy transfer (seeasterisks in Fig. 8) corresponding to chlorophyll interdistances of 12–18 Å. The three entry points for each monomer seem to involve chlorophyll a molecules clustered close to helices c and d of the PsaB (single asterisk) and PsaA proteins (triple asterisk) and those probably associated with the PsaJ protein (double asterisk) (32Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauβ N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). However, this modeling is preliminary and will be improved with a better resolution of the three-dimensional map of the CP43′-PSI supercomplex and by having access to the coordinates of the 2.5-Å x-ray model of PSI (32Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauβ N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The results presented here raise the question of why do cyanobacteria increase the antenna size of PSI under iron-stressed conditions? One possibility is that it is a compensatory response to the lowering of the PSI and phycobiliprotein levels (4Straus N.A. Bryant D.A. Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 731-750Google Scholar). With an extra antenna system, PSI can increase its rate of photochemical charge separation. This is important at light-limiting intensities, a situation which is usually found in the euphotic zone where cyanobacteria live. Our results are not only important for understanding how certain cyanobacteria respond to iron stress but also have implications with regard to the organization of light-harvesting systems of the chlorophylla/b-containing oxyphotobacteria, formerly known as prochlorophytes (38Partensky F. Hess W.R. Vaulot D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 106-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These green, oxygenic prokaryotes containpcb genes that encode for chlorophylla/b-binding proteins similar to the IsiA/CP43′ protein. Although there is usually only one isiA gene in phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, the number of pcbgenes differ between the three known classes of prochlorophytes,Prochloron, Prochlorothrix, andProchlorococcus and even between different strains ofProchlorococcus (39La Roche J. Van der Staay G.W.M. Partensky F. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Li R. Golden S.S. Hiller R.G. Wrench P.M. Larkhum A.W.D. Green B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15244-15248Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 40Garczarek L. Hess W. Holtzendorff J. van der Staay G. Partensky F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4098-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It would seem highly probable that one or more of these genes will encode chlorophylla/b-binding proteins, which form a Pcb-PSI structure similar to that described here for the CP43′-PSI supercomplex. Indeed, we have recently shown thatProchlorococcus strain SS120 does have an 18-subunit Pcb ring around its PSI trimer (14Bibby, T. S., Nield, J., Partensky, F., and Barber, J. (2001)Nature, in press.Google Scholar). In this case, the ring is rich in Chlb with a Chl a/b ratio of approximately 1. It should be noted that the IsiA protein is not only structurally homologous to CP43 and the Pcb proteins but also to the CP47 subunit of PSII and the N-terminal domains of the PsaA and PsaB reaction center proteins of PSI. However, like CP43, CP47 differs from the other members of the chlorophyll-binding 6-transmembrane helical protein superfamily by having a large loop joining the luminal ends of helices V and VI. The function of this special feature of CP43 and CP47 is not yet understood but probably was important for the evolution of the water oxidation activity of PSII. In the absence of a high resolution structure of PSII, little is known about the location of these loops relative to the manganese cluster, which forms the catalytic center for the water-splitting reactions. Finally it is worth noting that Prochlorophytes, like cyanobacteria, have trimeric PSI (15van der Staay G.W.M. Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. Matthijs H.C.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Endophilin family members have also been identified as binding partners for a number of diverse cellular proteins. We define here the endophilin 1-binding site within synaptojanin 1 and show that this sequence independently and selectively purifies from brain extracts endophilin 1 and a closely related protein, endophilin 2. Endophilin 2, like endophilin 1, is highly expressed in brain, concentrated in nerve terminals, and found in complexes with synaptojanin and dynamin. Although a fraction of endophilins 1 and 2 coexist in the same complex, the distribution of these endophilin isoforms among central synapses only partially overlaps. Endophilins 1 and 2 are found predominantly as stable dimers through a predicted coiled-coil domain in their conserved NH2-terminal moiety.

Nerve terminals, which are spatially segregated from the biosynthetic machinery in the neuronal cell body, must locally recycle synaptic vesicle membrane components to maintain a functional pool of secretory vesicles (1Heuser J.E.

The physiological importance of this recycling pathway has been demonstrated in a variety of systems in which inhibition of synaptic vesicle recycling results in synaptic failure (3Koenig J.H.

Many protein factors that participate in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling have been identified as direct or indirect interactors of either components of the clathrin coat or the GTPase dynamin, a protein required for the maturation and scission of nascent coated pits (reviewed in Ref. 5Slepnev V.I.

Synaptojanin 1 contains two separable enzymatic activities that dephosphorylate phosphoinositides. A central inositol 5′-phosphatase domain mediates cleavage of the 5′ phosphate and an NH2-terminal domain homologous to the yeast protein Sac1p that hydrolyzes phosphates at the 3′, 4′, or 5′ positions from a number of phosphoinositide species (6McPherson P.S.

We now show that the two major endophilin isoforms expressed in brain exist as dimers and can therefore act as bivalent SH3 domain-containing adaptors between different binding partners. Endophilins 1 and 2 share many properties, including highly specific binding to a proline-rich peptide motif PPXRP previously reported in a preliminary form (19Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G.

Endophilin 2, however, is expressed in a restricted set of synapses. Affinity purified antibodies against endophilin 1, endophilin 2, and anti-synaptojanin 1 monoclonal antibodies have been described previously (19Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G. Brodin L.

Anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. R. Jahn, Gottingen, Germany. Polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Triton X-100 extracts of total brain homogenate or transfected cells were prepared from frozen rat brains (Pel Freeze) as previously described (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). 5 µg of affinity purified antibodies were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 500 µg of either total brain cytosol (see below), Triton X-100-extracted total brain homogenate, or cell lysate. Immune complexes were precipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 µl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl (buffer A) or buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100. Pellets were washed 3 times in buffer A or buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 and eluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Fragments of the proline-rich tail of synaptojanin 1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector for expression as GST fusion proteins and sequenced (see Fig. 1). Fusion proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain DH5α and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. 50 µg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to 5 mg of Triton X-100 extracted total brain homogenate and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The affinity matrix was collected by gentle centrifugation and washed 3 times with buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100. Fusion proteins and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Affinity purification using the immobilized peptides CVAPPARPAPPQRPPPPSGA (PP19), CTIEPKRPPPP (PP10) (amino acids 1111–1129 and 1098–1107, respectively, of rat synaptojanin 1), and CQRRAPAVPPARPGSRGPA (DPP19) (amino acids 782–799 of rat dynamin) were performed as previously described. Bound proteins were eluted using 1 bed volume of 300 µm free peptide in buffer A, precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Full-length endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 cDNAs or various deletion mutants were subcloned into the pGex6p1 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed in the bacterial strain BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins on the beads were incubated overnight with Precision protease in 100 mmKCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove the GST tag. 3 µg of each purified protein was incubated in 20 µl of final volume of buffer A plus varying amounts of the heterobifunctional cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[dimethylaminopropryl]carbodiimide·HCl (EDC) (Pierce) for 20 min at 30 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer to a final concentration of 1 and the resulting products were separated on a 10, 12, or 15% polyacrylamide SDS reducing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For cross-linking of brain extracts, 50 µg of Triton X-100 extracted total brain homogenate was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDC for 30 min at room temperature. As above, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the reaction products were separated on a 5–12% polyacrylamide reducing gel and processed for Western blotting. The affinities of proline-rich peptides for the recombinant SH3 domain of endophilin 1 (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) were measured using changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence according to Ref. 22Cowburn D. Zheng J. Xu Q. Barany G. J. Biol.

GST was cleaved from the fusion protein with bio-tinylated thrombin (Novagen). Gel filtration chromatographies of total brain cytosol and recombinant proteins were performed on a Sephadex G100 column and a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with buffer A, respectively. Columns were calibrated using gel filtration molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double immunofluorescence experiments with rat brain sections and cultured hippocampal neurons were performed as described (23De Camilli P. Cameron R. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96 (a): 1337-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cell transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE cationic lipids (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monodimensional SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard procedures. Western blotting was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgGs (Jackson) and an ECL detection system (Pierce). It has been shown by us and others that interactions between endophilins and synaptojanin 1 are mediated by the binding of the SH3 domain of endophilins to the COOH-terminal proline-rich domain of rat synaptojanin (11de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To identify specific endophilin-binding elements in the proline-rich domain of synaptojanin we generated a panel of GST fusion proteins derived from the COOH terminus of synaptojanin (Fig.1A). These fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and used to affinity purify interactors from extracts of total rat brain homogenate. Purified material was analyzed by Western blot for the presence of endophilin 1 and, as a control, for the presence of amphiphysin 1, another SH3 domain-containing interactor of synaptojanin (6McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) (Fig.1B). Initially, deletional analysis indicated that amino acids 1112–1130 were required for endophilin 1 binding. This region contains two PPXRP motifs, where x = A or Q, which conform to the core PXXP SH3 binding consensus (24Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Deletion of these motifs in either direction revealed that either one of them was sufficient to mediate endophilin binding. We note that synaptojanin orthologs from diverse taxa have at least one PPXRP motif and that the two PPXRP motifs of rat synaptojanin 1 are conserved between mammals and a distant vertebrate, lamprey (9Gad H. Ringstad N. Low P. Kjaerulff O. Gustafsson J. Wenk M. Di Paolo G. Nemoto Y. Crun J. Ellisman M.H. De Camilli P. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Neuron. 2000; 27: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one such motif is also present in a short fragment of the dynamin 1 proline-rich domain previously shown to bind endophilin 1 (25Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, amphiphysin 1 binding to the proline-rich domain of synaptojanin required either amino acids 1054–1069 which conform to a previously identified amphiphysin binding consensus (PXRPXR) (26Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or the very COOH terminus of the proline-rich domain, demonstrating the existence of two distinct binding sites for this protein. To test whether PPXRP motifs are sufficient to bind endophilin 1, and to assess the specificity of this interaction, peptides containing either the two conserved PPXRP motifs of synaptojanin (PP19) or the single PPXRP motif present in dynamin (DPP19) were synthesized, immobilized on a solid support, and used to affinity purify interactors from extracts of total brain homogenate. As a negative control, another proline-rich peptide (PP10) corresponding to sequences NH2-terminal to the first PPXRP motif in synaptojanin and predicted not to bind endophilin by our deletional analysis was used (Fig.2A). Bound material was eluted with an excess of free peptide and analyzed either by silver stain or Western blot using anti-endophilin antibodies. Both PPXRP-containing peptides specifically bound a major protein species of 40 kDa that was identified as endophilin 1 by Western blot (Fig. 2B). We also measured the affinity of the interaction between PPXRP motifs and the SH3 domain of endophilin 1. The SH3 domain of endophilin 1 contains a single tryptophan residue whose intrinsic fluorescence changes specifically in the presence of PPXRP containing peptides. Peptide-induced changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the endophilin 1 SH3 domain were dose-dependent and saturable and reflected an affinity constant of ∼14 µm for the interaction between endophilin 1 and the synaptojanin peptide and ∼79 µmfor the interaction between endophilin 1 and the dynamin peptide. In addition to endophilin 1, a 45-kDa protein species was found in eluates from both PPXRP columns (Fig. 2B). We postulated that this band could be the endophilin family member of 45 kDa, endophilin 2. Endophilin 2 was previously identified as an endophilin isoform whose message was present in all tissues analyzed (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Using antibodies specific to endophilin 2 we detected endophilin 2 protein expression predominantly in brain and testis although low levels were detected in many tissues (Fig. 3). The same antibodies confirmed that the 45-kDa protein retained on our peptide columns was endophilin 2 (Fig. 2B). To show that the binding of endophilin 2 to PPXRP sequences is independent of endophilin 1, we repeated the affinity chromatography experiments using detergent extracts of the cell line BHK21 which only expresses endophilin 2 (20Ochoa G.C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Kim W. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig.2D). In these experiments, we detected only a single protein of 45 kDa specifically bound to the PPXRP column and Western blot analysis identified this protein as endophilin 2. Since endophilin 2 has not been characterized, we compared its properties to those of endophilin 1. We first tested whether endophilin 2 is found in protein complexes with dynamin and synaptojanin 1 by immunoisolating endophilin complexes from detergent extracts of brain homogenate using isoform-specific antibodies. Anti-endophilin 1 immunoprecipitates contained three major protein species (asterisks in Fig.4A) whose identities were assigned by Western blot (Fig. 4B): endophilin 1 (40 kDa), dynamin 1 (100 kDa), and synaptojanin 1 (145 kDa). In anti-endophilin 2 immunoprecipiates only endophilin 2 (45 kDa) could be detected by protein staining. Synaptojanin 1 and dynamin were detected in the isolated material by Western blot, however (Fig. 4B). The lower amounts of co-precipitated dynamin and synaptojanin with endophilin 2 are consistent with the lower abundance (∼8 fold) of endophilin 2 in the immunoprecipitates. Since these experiments we performed under antigen-depleting conditions, this difference in the amounts of the two endophilin isoforms reflects their relative abundance in brain. Note that anti-endophilin immunoprecipitates primarily contain the cognate endophilin isoform recognized by the antibody (Fig. 4A) although a minor cross-precipitating pool of endophilins does exist as revealed by Western blotting (Fig.4C), possibly reflecting the existence of a small pool of heterodimers (see below). Within the NH2terminus of the endophilins are sequences predicted to adopt a coiled-coil conformation with the potential to mediate protein-protein interactions or dimerization. We therefore compared the oligomerization state of endophilin 1 and 2. Both proteins were found to elute as 80–90-kDa complexes from a number of gel filtration columns and when fractionated on a Sephadex G-100 column they eluted in overlapping fractions with distinct peaks (Fig.5A). Chemical cross-linking of detergent extracts of rat brain homogenate with the heterobifunctional cross-linker EDC followed by Western blot using anti-endophilin antibodies similarly showed that both endophilins could be cross-linked into 80–100-kDa complexes (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, when FLAG-tagged endophilin 1 and HA-tagged endophilin 1 were co-transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, FLAG-tagged endophilin 1 could be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged endophilin 1 from detergent extracts of these cells using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5C). The self-association of endophilins, together with the apparent size of endophilin complexes observed in brain extracts, suggests that endophilins form homodimers. Accordingly, both purified recombinant endophilin 1 (Fig. 6A) and endophilin 2 (data not shown) could be cross-linked into several closely spaced bands in the same size range. The heterogeneous electrophoretic motility of these bands may be due to multiple conformers of the dimers.Figure 6Self-association of endophilins requires a central coiled-coil domain. 3 µg of recombinant endophilin 1 or endophilin 1 deletion mutants were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm EDC, quenched with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. Arrowheads indicate cross-linked products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the role of the predicted coiled-coil in endophilin dimerization, we generated a number of endophilin deletion mutants which were expressed, purified, and subjected to chemical cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). Recombinant proteins containing amino acids 125–290 could be cross-linked into higher molecular weight complexes while deletion of this sequence resulted in a protein that remained monomeric after treatment with EDC. Our characterization of endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 complexes showed that endophilin isoforms primarily exist in separate complexes while interacting with a common set of synaptic proteins. It was therefore of interest to determine whether endophilin isoforms are expressed in distinct populations of neurons. Cultures of hippocampal neurons were fixed, immunostained with antibodies that recognize selectively either endophilin 1 or endophilin 2, and counterstained for the presynaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig.7). Both endophilin 1 (Fig. 7,A and C) and endophilin 2 (Fig. 7, Eand G) immunoreactivities were concentrated in puncta which colocalized with synaptophysin (Fig. 7, B, D, F, andH). While endophilin 1 staining was detected in the majority of synaptophysin-positive puncta, only a restricted population of nerve terminals was stained with anti-endophilin 2 antibodies (arrowheads in Fig. 7, G and H). A co-localization of endophilin 1 and 2 with synaptophysin was also visible in a frozen section of rat brain (Fig.8) where the differential expression of endophilins 1 and 2, and the more widespread expression of endophilin 1, was even more apparent (see, for example, the more restricted distribution of endophilin 2 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus). Some synapses, however, such as the mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampal area CA3, were predominantly endophilin 2 positive (Fig. 8,A and C). In other regions of the brain, endophilin 1 and 2 had similar distributions such as in deep cerebellar nuclei where both proteins were enriched in axosomatic synapses (Fig.8, G and J). The endophilins have been proposed to play roles in membrane trafficking reactions through interactions with endocytic proteins and via physical or chemical modifications of membrane bilayers (11de Heuvel E.

Sequences matching the endophilin binding motif described in this study are present in a number of signaling, trafficking, and integral membrane proteins not yet shown to bind endophilin family members (Table I) raising the possibility that endophilins participate as adaptors in a wide array of biological reactions. It is interesting to note that among SH3 domains, the SH3 domains of the endophilins are most highly related to the COOH- and NH2-terminal SH3 domains of the adaptor protein Grb2 which is known to couple signaling molecules to the endocytic machinery (27Wang Z. Moran M.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other SH3 domain-containing proteins initially identified as components of the endocytic machinery are also multivalent (either through dimerization or the presence of multiple SH3 domains) and have been shown to function in signaling networks, most likely as adaptors (28Leprince C.

Castagnoli L. Dente L. Minenkova O. Petrelli A. Migone N. Hoffmuller U. Schneider-Mergener J. Cesareni G. J. Biol.

We note, however, that when inverted, the PPXRP motif identified in this study fits the P+RPP consensus. SH3 domain ligands can, in fact, bind SH3 domains in opposing orientations (33Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) and it is possible that endophilin ligands exist in two classes as mirror images of one another. Some of the known interactors for endophilins contain sequences that only partially conform to these motifs suggesting that the spectrum endophilin interactors might be very broad. Our data indicate that tandem sequences of the form PPXRP between amino acids 1112 and 1125 are the major endophilin-binding sites in synaptojanin 1. Interestingly, a distinct mammalian synaptojanin protein, synaptojanin 2B, also contains a PPXRP sequence within an alternatively spliced exon in its COOH terminus and its presence or absence correlates with endophilin binding. 2Nemoto, Y., Weak, M. R., Watanabe, M., Daniell, L., Murakami, T., Ringstad, N., Yamada, H., Takei, K., and De Camilli, P. (August 9, 2001) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M106404200. Although previous studies have shown that endophilin 2 mRNA is present in many tissues (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 34So C.W. Caldas C. Liu M.M. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Gu L.J. Sham M.H. Wiedemann L.M. Chan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2563-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we have now found that this protein is abundantly expressed in brain where, like endophilin 1, it is primarily concentrated in nerve terminals. The localization of endophilin 2 in nerve terminals and in complexes with synaptojanin and dynamin suggests that endophilin 2 participates in clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling. In non-neuronal cells, endophilin isoforms may also participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, endophilin 2 has been localized to specialized actin scaffolds along with a dynamin isoform (20Ochoa G.C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Kim W. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This localization may reflect a role for endophilins in actin function as well, possibly as components in a signaling pathway regulating the actin cytoskeleton. A dual role for endophilins in endocytosis and actin function is consistent with growing evidence that actin participates in many types of endocytosis including synaptic vesicle recycling (5Slepnev V.I.

The endophilins may therefore represent a set of adaptors that coordinate endocytosis, actin function, and signaling cascades at the synapse and in non-neuronal cells.

In the present study, we report the redox switching of the rotation of this enzyme. For this purpose, the switch region from the γ subunit of the redox-sensitive chloroplast F1-ATPase was introduced into the bacterial F1-ATPase. The ATPase activity of the obtained complex was increased up to 3-fold upon reduction (Bald, D., Noji, H., Stumpp, M. T., Yoshida, M. & Hisabori, T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 12757–12762). Here, we successfully observed the modulation of rotation of γ in this chimeric complex by changes in the redox conditions. In addition we revealed that the suppressed enzymatic activity of the oxidized F1-ATPase complex was characterized by more frequent long pauses in the rotation of the γ subunit.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The water-soluble part of ATP synthase, the F1 region, consists of five subunits with a composition of α3β3γ1δ1ε1(2Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3480-3485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic FO part is composed of a1b2c10–14 (3Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rotation of the γ subunit in the α3β3 hexagon was first postulated by P. D. Boyer and co-workers (8Gresser M.J. Myers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12030-12038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the analysis of the cooperative kinetics of F1-ATPase. A high resolution x-ray structure of a major part of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1 (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar) revealed an alternating hexagonal arrangement of the α3β3 ring with the γ subunit as a central axis. Then the rotation of γ in the central cavity of α3β3 was suggested by biochemical experiments (10Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and finally, direct visualization of the rotation of an actin filament attached to the γ subunit of F1 showed unequivocally that γ rotates unidirectionally during ATP hydrolysis (11Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1961) Google Scholar, 12Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The chloroplast ATP synthase has basically the same structure as those from other sources. However the enzyme activity of chloroplast ATP synthase (CFOCF1) from higher plants is modulated in a unique way, reduction of a disulfide bridge in the γ subunit (15Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the solubilized CF1 part, the reduction of this disulfide bond, which is located in a switch region on γ unique to chloroplast ATP synthase, strongly enhances the ATP hydrolysis activity (ATPase activity). This switch region consists of 37 amino acid residues (Pro194–Ile230 in case of the spinach chloroplast enzyme) containing two cysteine residues, but its structure is unknown, and there are no data available on how reduction of the disulfide bond leads to activation of the enzyme. Such redox regulation is a common property of so-called thiol enzymes in the chloroplasts like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (17Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (18Clancey C.J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13545-13549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (19Cadet F. Meunier J.C. Ferte N. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), phosphoribulokinase (20Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and NADP-malate dehydrogenase (21Jacquot J.-P. Lancelin J.-M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The chloroplast thioredoxin, which is reduced by electron flow from photosystem, plays a main role in this regulation system (21Jacquot J.-P. Lancelin J.-M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge there are no data available, neither for chloroplast enzymes nor for enzymes from other organelles, on whether regulation affects the reaction rate of a single enzyme molecule or influences the number of active enzyme molecules. To address this question, observation of the rotation of F1-ATPase is the useful system, because it allowed us to observe the real-time behavior at the single molecule enzyme level. Then we recently constructed the chimeric α3β3γ complex, in which central 111 amino acid residues of the F1-γ from a thermophilic bacterium were replaced by the homologous 148 residues derived from spinach CF1-γ, which includes a switch region (22Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the report, we designated the obtained chimeric γ subunit as γTCT(thermophilic-chloroplast-thermophilic). The newly designed α3β3γ complex (α3β3γTCT complex) was susceptible to redox regulation, and the ATPase activity in the reduced state was up to 3-fold higher than that in the oxidized state. In the present study we investigated the differences of the rotation behavior of this engineered complex under the reduced and oxidized conditions. Then we successfully controlled the rotation of the γ subunit by redox switching and succeeded to observed the differences of the behavior of the active enzyme and that of the suppressed enzyme at the single molecule level. Biotin-PEAC5 maleimide was purchased from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan). Streptavidin-coated microspheres (mean diameter, 530 nm) was from Bangs Laboratories, Inc. (Fishers, IN). DTT1 was from Sigma. Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. The original chimeric α3β3γ complex was prepared as described (22Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a result of the substitution of the central region of γ from thermophilic F1 (11Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) with the counterpart from the chloroplast F1-γ, a cysteine residue used for the labeling with biotin-maleimide (12Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was deleted. Therefore an additional cysteine residue was introduced in place of Ser107 (the numbering is for the engineered γ subunit (22Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) on the imported sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. This introduced cysteine did not affect the regulatory function nor the enzyme activity of the chimeric complex. This new α3β3γTCT complex was obtained as described (6Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the complex was expressed inEscherichia coli strain JM 103 and purified directly from the cell extract using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid super-flow column (Qiagen). We found that the cysteines in the regulatory region of the complex were in the oxidized state after completing the purification process. We therefore used this complex as the original oxidized complex. We then incubated the fully oxidized complex overnight with a 2-fold excess of Biotin-PEAC5 maleimide. The complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a G3000SWXL column (7 × 300 mm; Tosho, Tokyo, Japan). Reduction of the complex was carried out by incubation for 1 h with 200 µm DTT + 4 µm spinach chloroplast thioredoxin-f as described (23Stumpp M.T. Motuhasi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the real-time control of the chimeric complex under the redox conditions using chloroplast thioredoxin plus DTT for reduction or CuCl2 for oxidation. The low concentration of CuCl2 is known to catalyze the formation of the disulfide bond by facilitating the oxidation in the presence of oxygen without having any other inhibitory effect on the ATPase activity of F1 (24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 15 µl of the biotinylated, reduced α3β3γTCT complex (1–5 nm) in an assay mixture containing 10 mmMOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, and 200 µm DTT was infused into the flow cell (11Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature for immobilization. The flow cell was washed with 30 µl of assay mixture supplemented with 10 mg/ml BSA. Next 15-µl streptavidin-coated microspheres (100 nm to 2 µm) in the assay mixture plus BSA were infused. After 15 min of incubation the assay was started by addition of 70 µl of assay mixture/BSA supplemented with 2 mm Mg-ATP, and the rotation was observed under the reduced conditions (R-phase) for about 5 min and then the mixture was exchanged with 150 µl of assay mixture/BSA/Mg-ATP plus 100 µm CuCl2 as oxidant, and the rotation was observed (O-phase). Switching back to R-phase was carried out by exchanging the O-phase mixture with assay mixture/BSA/Mg-ATP plus 200 µm DTT and 4 µmthioredoxin-f (R2-phase). Rotation of the microsphere was monitored with a conventional optical microscope type IX70 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded with a video tape recorder. Recorded images were analyzed with the image analysis software provided by R. Yasuda (25Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity was measured by quantifying the amount of produced phosphate (26Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP supplemented with 200 µm DTT + 4 µm thioredoxin-f (for R- and R2-phase) or 100 µm CuCl2 (for O-phase), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme solution. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.4% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of produced phosphate was determined. To mimic the solution exchange that we used in the rotation assay, we reduced or oxidized the enzyme, removed the reductant/oxidant by desalting through a column, and injected this enzyme solution in the reaction mixture containing the oxidant/reductant. In the present study, the redox control of the activity of the redox-sensitive α3β3γTCT complex was observed by monitoring the rotation of the γ subunit. Because the fluorescence from the dye-labeled actin filament, which was used for the former studies (11Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1961) Google Scholar, 12Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is quenched very quickly under the oxidizing conditions, we could not use the filament as a probe for our study. Instead of that, we adopted the polystyrene microsphere method of detection (27Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This microsphere method allowed us to use both redox conditions for the observation of the rotation behavior of the single molecule complex with a conventional microscope. In addition we could exchange the buffer in the microflow cell directly without seriously damaging the rotating enzymes. We first observed the rotation of the complex under the reducing conditions and labeled this phase as R-phase. Here we could observe several well rotating particles under the microscope, and we typically observed continuous counter-clockwise rotation with several brief pauses (Fig. 2A, R-phase). These brief pauses may be attributable to the special state of F1-ATPase known as ADP inhibition (9Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 202: 9-14Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enzyme trapped in this inhibition state can easily recover and re-start the rotation because of the high ATP concentration in the reaction mixture. After switching to the O-phase, characteristic, long pauses appeared (Fig. 2 A, O-phase). This phenomenon was observed irrespective of the size and the number of attached microspheres that act as the load on the rotating γ subunit. Despite these long pauses in the O-phase, the rotation in most cases did not stop completely over the whole phase. For the periods between the long pauses, i.e. when the enzyme in the O-phase did rotate, the rotation rate was not distinguishable from that observed in the R-phase. When the complex was switched back to the reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A, R2-phase), the average rotational rate typically increased again compared with that in O-phase although it was in most cases lower than in R-phase because of a lag. To characterize the rotation under the different conditions, pause lengths and the frequency of the pauses of each rotating particle were analyzed. All pauses with >30-s length were counted for each phase, and their frequencies were calculated based on the length of the pauses (Fig. 2 B). This analysis revealed a nearly constant number of short pauses (<1 min) in all three phases; however the pauses longer than 1 min were significantly more frequent in the O-phase. Although we observed a higher frequency of the long pauses during the R2-phase than that during the R-phase, they were obviously residual effects of the prior oxidizing conditions (O-phase). For 10 of 12 particles observed, the averaged rotation rate in the O-phase was lower (<85%) than in both R- and R2-phase. In contrast, zero of ten of the wild type particles lacking the switch region showed such a tendency (data not shown). We compared the average rotation rates with the ATP hydrolysis activity to confirm that the observed particles for which rotation was analyzed in this study were representative of the whole population (Fig.3). The average ratio of rotation rates was 100:41:78 for the R-, O-, and R2-phases. This ratio was consistent with the ratio of the ATP hydrolysis activity (100:43:87) under similar conditions, implying the observed regulation of the rotation in the present study is the actual regulated enzyme behavior. Thus our single molecule observation study can reliably provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of F1-ATPase, especially in the suppressed state. Under the oxidizing conditions, the rotating particle shows two different patterns, the counter-clockwise rotation whose rate is indistinguishable from that of the enzyme under the reducing conditions, and the very long pause. Particularly, we could observe rotation in the O-phase after long pauses (Fig. 2 A,traces ii, iii, v, and vi), although this rotation in some cases only lasted for several seconds (Fig. 2 A, traces ii and vi). We regard it as highly unlikely that a single molecule is oxidized and then reduced again under the same oxidizing conditions. Therefore, the oxidized complex must assume two independent states, in one state F1 works in the usual manner, as under the reducing conditions, in the other it assumes a non-rotating form. The oscillation between these two states lowers the number of revolutions of the γ subunit, resulting in lower enzyme activity under oxidizing conditions than under reducing conditions in contrast to the rate of rotation of all molecules being diminished uniformly. In summary, we have successfully attached a redox-sensitive switch to a molecular motor enzyme, F1, and could control the rotation via this switch, thus creating the first nanomotor of this kind. Mechanistically, we could prove the existence of two distinct states of the oxidized enzyme. To the best of our knowledge our present study is the first to elucidate this kind of precise details of the regulation mechanism of an enzyme, and it describes one of the most significant physiological phenomena, regulation of ATP synthase, occurred on the enzyme molecule itself, at the single molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2000789117,"The product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, pVHL, functions as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase in regulating HIF-1 protein turnover, thus accounting for the increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes that accompanies VHL mutations. The increased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA stability in cells lacking pVHL has been hypothesized to be due to a similar regulation of an RNA-binding protein. We report the expression of the GLUT-1 3′-untranslated region RNA-binding protein, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2, is specifically increased in pVHL-deficient cell lines. Enhanced hnRNP A2 expression was apparent in all cell fractions, including polysomes, where a similar modest effect on hnRNP L (a GLUT-1 and VEGF 3′-untranslated region-binding protein), was seen. Steady state levels of hnRNP A2 mRNA were unaffected. Regulation of hnRNP A2 levels correlated with the ability of pVHL to bind elongin C. Proteasome inhibition of cells expressing wild type pVHL selectively increased cytoplasmic hnRNP A2 levels to that seen in pVHL-deficient cells. Finally, an in vivo interaction between pVHL and hnRNP A2 was demonstrated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data indicate that hnRNP A2 expression is regulated by pVHL in a manner that is dependent on elongin C interactions as well as functioning proteasomes. The product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, pVHL, functions as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase in regulating HIF-1 protein turnover, thus accounting for the increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes that accompanies VHL mutations. The increased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA stability in cells lacking pVHL has been hypothesized to be due to a similar regulation of an RNA-binding protein. We report the expression of the GLUT-1 3′-untranslated region RNA-binding protein, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2, is specifically increased in pVHL-deficient cell lines. Enhanced hnRNP A2 expression was apparent in all cell fractions, including polysomes, where a similar modest effect on hnRNP L (a GLUT-1 and VEGF 3′-untranslated region-binding protein), was seen. Steady state levels of hnRNP A2 mRNA were unaffected. Regulation of hnRNP A2 levels correlated with the ability of pVHL to bind elongin C. Proteasome inhibition of cells expressing wild type pVHL selectively increased cytoplasmic hnRNP A2 levels to that seen in pVHL-deficient cells. Finally, an in vivo interaction between pVHL and hnRNP A2 was demonstrated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data indicate that hnRNP A2 expression is regulated by pVHL in a manner that is dependent on elongin C interactions as well as functioning proteasomes. von Hippel-Lindau vascular endothelial growth factor glucose transporter 1 A+U-rich element heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein renal clear cell ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase hypoxia-inducible factor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase untranslated region 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid horseradish peroxidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)1disease is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by the predisposition to develop highly vascular tumors, including renal clear cell (RCC) carcinomas, cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomata, and pheochromocytomas (1McKusick V.A.

Both germline as well as sporadic mutations of the VHL gene have been identified in patients afflicted with this disease (2Chen F. Kishida T. Yao M. Hustad T. Glavac D. Dean M. Gnarra J.R.

Sporadic renal clear cell carcinomas are highly associated with mutation or transcriptional silencing of the VHL gene and subsequent loss or inactivation of the remaining VHL allele (6Gnarra J.R.

Hosaka M. Nagashima Y. Kitamura H. Latif F. Zbar B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2852-2855PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, VHL conforms to Knudson's two-hit model of a tumor suppressor gene, in which gene inactivation occurs as the result of loss of function of both alleles (8Knudson Jr., A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5423) Google Scholar). The human VHL gene encodes a full-length protein of 213 amino acids which migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (9Latif F. Tory K. Gnarra J. Yao M. Duh F.M. Orcutt M.L. Stackhouse T.

VHL protein is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasmic compartments of most tissue and cell types, although it can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (10Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S.

The localization of pVHL appears to be regulated according to cell density; pVHL is cytoplasmic in confluent cultures, but shuttles to the nucleus under sparse culture conditions (15Lee S. Chen D.Y.T. Humphrey J.S. Gnarra J.R. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of pVHL is reduced by inhibitors of RNA polymerase II and polyadenylation, whereas nuclear import is unaffected, resulting in the localization of pVHL to the nucleus (16Lee S.

VHL has been demonstrated to form a multimeric complex with two components of the transcriptional elongation factor elongin (elongin B and C) (11Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl.

Significantly, the majority of VHL mutants are defective in their ability to bind elongin C, implying functional significance for this interaction in vivo (14Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W. Aso T.

Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Additional clues to VHL function were provided by the discovery that elongin C and cullin-2 bear homology to yeast proteins (Skp1 and Cdc53), which function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase when complexed with an F-box protein (26Bai C.

Furthermore, anti-pVHL immunoprecipitates can support E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro if supplemented with exogenous ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (30Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 31Listzwan J. Imbert G. Wirebelauer C. Gstaiger M. Krek W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1822-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a model has evolved in which the pVHL-elongin B/C-Cul-2 complex functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which targets specific substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (32Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The absence of pVHL in renal carcinoma cell lines is associated with a hypoxic phenotype under normoxic culture conditions; these cells express increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) (33Iliopoulos O. Jiang C. Levy A.P. Kaelin W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar,34Gnarra J.R. Zhou S. Merrill M.J. Wagner J.R. Krumm A.

The overproduction of these genes likely contributes to the hypervascular phenotype characteristic of VHL disease-associated neoplasms (35Wizigmann-Voos S. Breier G. Risau W. Plate K.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1358-1364PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin E3 ligase model of pVHL action accounts for the increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes (VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor), which occurs under normoxic conditions with pVHL mutations (33Iliopoulos O. Jiang C. Levy A.P. Kaelin W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 34Gnarra J.R. Zhou S. Merrill M.J. Wagner J.R. Krumm A.

The transcription of these genes is regulated by the levels of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 (Refs. 40Dang C.V. Lewis B.C. Dolde C. Dang G. Shim H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 41Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P.

Under conditions of normoxia, rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation of HIF-1α is mediated by an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (42Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, the stability of HIF-1α protein increases, resulting in enhanced transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes (43Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5990) Google Scholar,44Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that pVHL and HIF-1α directly interact under normoxic conditions, resulting in the ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of HIF-1α by the pVHL-elongin B/C-Cul-2 complex (45Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5363-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of pVHL or with mutations that alter its ability to function as part of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, HIF-1α levels rise, leading to increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes such as VEGF (44Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Increased GLUT-1 and VEGF mRNA stability has also been observed in cells under conditions of hypoxia (47Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). In cells lacking pVHL, VEGF mRNA stability has been demonstrated (33Iliopoulos O. Jiang C. Levy A.P. Kaelin W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 34Gnarra J.R. Zhou S. Merrill M.J. Wagner J.R. Krumm A.

It has been hypothesized that a similar mechanism accounts for the stabilization of GLUT-1 and VEGF mRNA observed in pVHL-deficient cells (45Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25733-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 47Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). In this model, an RNA-binding protein, instead of a transcription factor such as HIF-1α, constitutes the target by which pVHL regulates the stability of these mRNA. The 3′-UTR of both GLUT-1 and VEGF have been shown to contain AU-rich elements (AURE), which regulate mRNA turnover (48Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory indicated that hnRNP A2 binds acis-acting instability element in the GLUT-1 3′-UTR that plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of GLUT-1 expression (49Hamilton B.J. Nichols R.C. Tsukamoto H. Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. Rigby W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These data suggested that overexpression of hnRNP A2 might account for the change in GLUT-1 mRNA turnover associated with the absence of pVHL. In RCC cell lines that differ only in their expression of functional pVHL, we observed that hnRNP A2 expression is increased in pVHL-deficient cell lines. This pVHL-dependent reduction in hnRNP A2 expression occurs independently of cell confluence. Northern blotting demonstrated that hnRNP A2 mRNA levels were unaffected, suggesting that pVHL deficiency results in decreased hnRNP A2 protein expression through changes in protein turnover or translation. Proteasome inhibition of cells expressing wild type pVHL resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A2, but not the closely related and homologous protein hnRNP A1 (50Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Finally, anin vivo interaction between pVHL and hnRNP A2 is demonstrated in both proteasomally inhibited cytosolic and untreated nuclear extracts. Collectively, these data indicate that hnRNP A2 expression is regulated by pVHL, and suggest the possibility that hnRNP A2 is a target of the pVHL/elongin B/C/Cul2/Rbx1 ubiquitin degradation machinery. The human 786-0 renal carcinoma cell line (obtained from ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). 786-0 subclones (generously provided by Dr. William Kaelin) stably transfected with pRc/CMV (pRc-9), pRc/CMV-VHL (C162F), and pRc/CMV-VHL (WT-8) (as previously described in Ref. 10Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) were cultured in the presence of G418 (500 µg/ml). The UMRC6 (UMRC) human renal carcinoma cell lines (generously provided by Dr. Bert Zbar), stably transfected with either a vector control (parental) or a plasmid expressing wild type VHL cDNA, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For proteasome inhibition experiments, cells were treated with either 100 µm LLnL (Sigma) or 25 µmMG132 (Sigma) overnight. Cytosolic lysates were prepared using a method characterized by its lack of contamination by nuclear proteins (51Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed by gentle resuspension in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 µL/2 × 107 cells) consisting of 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 2 µg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A. Samples were incubated for 3 min on ice and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and then spun through a 30% sucrose cushion. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.5 nuclear pellet volume in low salt buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 µmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 2 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A. While vortexing, 1.5 nuclear pellet volume of high salt buffer (containing 0.5 m KCl) was added dropwise. Samples were incubated with agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C (52Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C as the nuclear fraction. For polysome preparations, pRc-9, C162F, and WT-8 cells were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 µg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 2 mm Pefabloc), and nuclei removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was layered over a 30% sucrose cushion followed by ultracentrifugation at 36,000 × rpm for 5 h at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared by washing cells twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilizing in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of pVHL with hnRNP A2 from WT-8 proteasomally inhibited cytoplasmic (100 µg) or untreated nuclear (400 µg) lysates was performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against pVHL (1G32) (10Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacin) for 2 h at 4 °C, and beads were washed six times in 300 mmNaCl. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane in CAPS buffer, pH 11.0, with 15% methanol. Immunoblots were washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against hnRNP A2 (EF67) and goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). To demonstrate the reciprocal interaction, CNBr-hnRNP A2-conjugated beads were used to immunoprecipitate from WT-8 lysate, and then immunoblotted with 1G32, followed by a goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. CNBr beads were used in lieu of protein-A Sepharose in order to eliminate interfering signal generated by detection of the light chain of the secondary antibody. Depleted lysates represent supernatants of immunoprecipitations. Polysomal lysates were probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-hnRNP A2 antibody (Act2), followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection of hnRNP A1 protein was accomplished by probing with rabbit polyclonal anti-hnRNP A1 antibody (Act1), followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. As indicated, blots were probed with anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (6C5-American Research Products), followed by goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to control for loading. Reactive antigens were visualized with Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Total cellular RNA was extracted by acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction (54Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). RNA was size-fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC, and baked under vacuum for 2 h at 80 °C. Filters were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 0.8m NaCl, 0.1 m PIPES, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and salmon sperm DNA (200 µg/ml). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 24 h in prehybridization mix containing 10% dextran sulfate and 1 × 106 cpm/ml cDNA probes for hnRNP A2 and β2-microglobulin, which had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a random primer method (55Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed with 0.1× SSC containing 0.02% sodium pyrophosphate and 0.5% Sarkosyl four times for 30 min each at 56 °C. Blots were dried and exposed at −70 °C to Fuji XAR film using one intensifying screen. Protein and mRNA bands were quantified by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs and immunoblots using NIH Image software. The mechanism by which pVHL deficiency increases GLUT-1 mRNA stability is unknown. It was hypothesized that the effect on GLUT-1 mRNA stability is mediated through a specific GLUT-1 mRNA-binding protein (24Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous work identified hnRNP A2 as a GLUT-1 mRNA 3′-UTR-binding protein (49Hamilton B.J. Nichols R.C. Tsukamoto H. Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. Rigby W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we examined hnRNP A2 protein levels in three RCC cell lines, which differ only in their expression of VHL. Cytoplasmic lysates derived from 786-0 RCC cells, which lack functional VHL protein, pRc-9 cells (786-0 cells transfected with empty expression vector), and WT-8 cells (transfected with wild type VHL) were examined for hnRNP A2 expression. Data shown are representative of seven experiments. Immunoblotting demonstrated increased hnRNP A2 levels in cells lacking functional VHL (786-0 and pRc-9) relative to those containing wild type VHL (WT-8) (Fig.1A). Densitometric analysis of hnRNP A2 expression in these lysates demonstrated 3–5-fold elevated levels of this protein in cells lacking wild type pVHL. The change in cytosolic hnRNP A2 levels among the cell lines did not appear to be due to differences in subcellular distribution, as extracts directly lysed in SDS loading buffer (whole cell lysates) and boiled showed similar patterns of expression (Fig. 1 B). The expression of hnRNP A1 and GAPDH was unaffected. This finding indicates that pVHL-dependent regulation of hnRNP A2 was highly specific; hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2 have 70% homology at the amino acid level (50Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the expression of other AURE-binding proteins reportedly associated with mRNA turnover such as HuR and AUF1 was unaffected (data not shown). Nevertheless, to ensure that the observed hnRNP A2 overexpression observed in the 786-0 and pRc-9 cell lines was not cell line-specific, another set of RCC cell lines was tested (Fig. 1 C). As seen above, UMRC cells transfected with pVHL (WT) exhibited decreased levels of hnRNP A2 relative to the pVHL-deficient parental cell line (PAR). Recent reports have described the influence of cell density on the ability of pVHL to mediate biochemical and morphological differentiation of renal carcinoma cell lines (56Davidowitz E.J. Schoenfeld A.R. Burk R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 57Lieubeau-Teillet B. Rak J. Jothy S. Iliopoulos O. Kaelin W. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4957-4962PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, VHL expression promoted renal cell differentiation and growth arrest under conditions of high cell density, in association with down-regulation of integrins and up-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α, a global activator of proximal tubule-specific genes (56Davidowitz E.J. Schoenfeld A.R. Burk R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To exclude differences in cell density and growth as possible explanations for the disparity in hnRNP A2 protein expression, all of the experiments delineated above were performed with 100% confluent cells. Subsequently, we examined cytosolic levels of hnRNP A2 at various states of confluence (Fig.2). As seen earlier, hnRNP A2 protein was expressed consistently higher in pRc-9 cytosol, independent of cell density. In neither cell line did hnRNP A2 levels vary as a function of cell confluence. Moreover, GAPDH levels are constant between the cell types, regardless of cell density. These data suggest the observed differences in hnRNP A2 protein expression were not a consequence of altered rates of proliferation or differentiation between the cell lines. Some studies indicate that AURE-mediated mRNA turnover requires either polysomal loading or ribosomal transit (58Curatola A.M. Nadal M.S. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since tot"

This dual activation is unique among the large family of K+ channels and provides a direct feedback mechanism to regulate Ca2+ influx. In many tissues, the activation gating of BK channels is modulated by accessory β-subunits, a family of membrane proteins (KCNMB) closely associated with the α-subunit (7Knaus H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3921-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four KCNMB proteins have been identified (KCNMB1–4), and they all share a prototypic topology of two transmembrane domains with intracellular N and C termini (9Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A.

Duan K.L. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4890-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, each of these KCNMB proteins distinctly changes the rates of channel activation and deactivation as well as the apparent sensitivity of the channel for Ca2+ (9Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A. Liu Y. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6453-6461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the β-subunits, KCNMB2 (β2), was found to confer rapid and complete inactivation to the BK channel complex (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 12Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that observed in chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland or in hippocampal CA1 neurons (14Hicks G.A. Marrion N.V. J.

Science. 1992; 257: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Analysis of this KCNMB2-mediated inactivation gating showed that it closely resembled the famous ball-and-chain-type inactivation of voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv): (i) it is determined by the N terminus of KCNMB2; (ii) it occludes the open channel pore and competes with the pore-blocking agent tetraethylammonium (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar,12Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) recovery from inactivation is speeded up by an increase of the extracellular K+ concentration (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal stretch of the KCNMB2 N terminus (19 amino acids) was shown to be a functional entity, i.e. its fusion to the N terminus of KCNMB1 (β1) conferred rapid inactivation to this non-inactivating β-subunit, and it occluded BK channels as a synthetic peptide very similar to the “pore plugging” observed for the synthetic inactivation domains (ID) derived from various α-subunits and one β-subunit of Kv-type K+channels (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Kv-derived IDs was analyzed with NMR spectroscopy in solution and revealed a wide range of structural variability for these proteins. Thus, the ID of Kv3.4 was found to exhibit well defined and compact folding although the backbone lacks secondary structural elements. In contrast, the ID from Shaker B and the inactivating N terminus of Kvβ1.1 (amino acids 1–62) showed no uniquely folded structure but rather behaved like random-coil peptides (16Antz C. Geyer M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To gain structural insight into KCNMB2-mediated inactivation of BK channels, we investigated the solution structure and function of the hydrophilic N terminus of KCNMB2 using NMR spectroscopy and giant patch clamp recording on a synthetic peptide (BKβ2N) corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic N terminus of KCNMB2 (amino acids 1–45). BK channels were expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes as described elsewhere (20Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Giant patch recordings were made at room temperature (∼23 °C) 3–7 days after injection of capped cRNA encoding hBKα (GenBankTMaccession no. U23767). Pipettes used were made from thick-walled borosilicate glass, had resistances of 0.3–0.6 megaohms (tip diameter of about 20 μm), and were filled with (in mm) 5 KOH, 115 NaOH, 10 HEPES, and 0.5 CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.2 with MES. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and corrected for capacitative transients with an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA electronics, Lamprecht, Germany) with the analog filter set to 3 kHz (−3 db). The fast application system used is described elsewhere (17Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and allowed for a complete solution exchange in less than 2 ms. BKβ2N was dissolved in Kint solution and applied via one barrel of the application system. Kint was composed as follows (in mm): 119 KOH, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with MES. The amount of CaCl2required to yield a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm was calculated according to Fabiato (36Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and added to the EGTA solution under pH meter control. Thereafter, pH was readjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Rates of inactivation were determined as described previously (17Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, koff was determined from the time constant of the wash-off (τoff) as koff = 1/τoff.kon was then calculated as kon = (1/τon −koff)/[peptide], with τon the time constant for wash-in. Affinity for the peptide-receptor interaction was calculated as koff/kon. All values throughout the paper are given as mean ± S.D. of nexperiments. The BKβ2N protein was synthesized by standard solid-phase synthesis and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry. 5.4 mg of BKβ2N were dissolved in 500 μl of 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v), pH 3.0, resulting in a final peptide concentration of 2 mm. To verify structural properties under physiological conditions, NMR experiments were carried out on BKβ2N dissolved in physiological salt solution (90 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2) at pH 6.0. All NMR samples contained 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as the internal standard for1H chemical shift referencing. Homonuclear NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer at either 293 or 288 K with a spectral window of 11.5 ppm. Standard pulse sequences were used to record NOESY (21Jeener J. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4825) Google Scholar) (mixing times between 100 and 250 ms), CLEAN-TOCSY (22Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R. J. Am. Chem.

Marrion N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) spectra with 4096 data points in F2 and 512 increments in F1. All two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra employed the method of time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the F1 dimension (24Marion D. Wuthrich K. Hicks G.A. Marrion N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar). Water suppression was achieved either by presaturation or by the WATERGATE technique (25Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed with the Bruker XWINNMR software using shifted squared sine window functions prior to Fourier transformation. The final matrix size was 4096 × 1024, except for the DQF-COSY spectrum, which was transformed to 16384 × 1024 (corresponding to a digital resolution of 0.42 Hz/point in the F2 dimension) to extract 3JHNHα coupling constants through a fit of the COSY cross-peaks to two antiphase Lorentzian lines. The programs AURELIA (26Neidig K.P. Geyer M. Görler A. Antz C. Saffrich R. Beneicke W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and XEASY (27Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) were used for analysis of two-dimensional spectra. NOE distance constraints were derived from a 250-ms NOESY spectrum in H2O and a 200-ms NOESY spectrum in D2O solution, both recorded at 288 K, pH 3.0. Unambiguously assigned NOESY cross-peaks were integrated manually with XEASY, and the resulting volumes were converted into proton-proton upper distance limits with the program CALIBA (28Güntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) using five different classes of NOEs. Constraints for the backbone dihedral angle Φ were obtained from the 3JHNHα coupling constants ≤ 6 Hz. In these cases, a Φ angle between −85° and −35° was imposed. Structures of BKβ2N were calculated with the program DYANA (version 1.5) (29Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) employing a simulated annealing algorithm in the torsion angle space. Structures from preliminary DYANA calculations were used to recalibrate the distance restraints and to obtain stereospecific assignments by the GLOMSA (28Güntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) routine within DYANA. The final family of structures was generated in a calculation with 300 random starting structures and 9000 annealing steps. 30 structures with target function values < 0.92 Å2 and no violations of dihedral angle constraints > 5° were obtained. The 24 structures without NOE violations > 0.4 Å were selected for further analysis. Visualization of structures and preparation of figures were done with the program MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). The functional characteristics of BKβ2N were tested in inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing non-inactivating homomeric BK channels. As shown in Fig. 1 A, BKβ2N induced rapid inactivation of the BK α-subunit when present at the cytoplasmic side of the patch. Moreover, BKβ2N-mediated inactivation occurred only at open channels. Despite the long-lasting presence of BKβ2N, channels first opened upon depolarization before they were inactivated by the peptide (Fig. 1, A and B). The time course of inactivation was strongly dependent on the BKβ2N concentration (not shown) and exhibited mild voltage dependence (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the time constant as obtained from a monoexponential fitted to the current decay (τinact) changes e-fold with a change in membrane potential of 117 mV, which is equivalent to a valence (z) of 0.21. These results suggested that very similar to IDs derived from Kvα or Kvβ1.1 subunits, BKβ2N blocks BK channels in a “ball-like manner” via interaction with a receptor site on the α-subunit that becomes accessible once the channel is in the open state. Therefore, interaction between BKβ2N and the channel α-subunit was more closely investigated by the “fast application” technique. This technique allows for complete solution exchanges at inside-out patches in less than 2 ms and enables separate determination for on- and off-rates of channel-peptide interaction (17Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows rapid application and wash-off of BKβ2N at a concentration of 27 μm. Channels were activated prior to peptide application by a voltage-step to 0 mV at a [Ca2+]i of 10 μm. Inactivation occurred with a time constant of ≈17 ms (16.9 ± 1.5 ms,n = 8), identical to that induced by the continuously present BKβ2N (Fig. 1 B). Wash-off of BKβ2N, which should reflect unbinding of the peptide from the receptor, exhibited a time constant of ≈850 ms (851.5 ± 69.3 ms, n = 8) and could be well fitted with a monoexponential (Fig. 1 C). This was an indication that interaction between BKβ2N and its receptor on the α-subunit could be described as a bimolecular reaction as suggested (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with on- and off-rates (kon,koff) of 2.0·106(Ms)−1 and 1.2 s−1 (Fig. 1 D), respectively. The affinity (IC50) of BKβ2N for its receptor as calculated from these rates is 0.59 μm (Fig. 1 D), which is very similar to the value obtained from a steady-state concentration-inhibition relationship (not shown). Interestingly, a comparison among the inactivation rates of various IDs shows that koff of BKβ2N closely resembles that of the compactly folded Kv3.4-ID, whereas kon of BKβ2N is very similar to that of Kvβ1.1 or the Shaker B-ID, IDs that both lack ordered three-dimensional structure in solution (Fig. 1 D and Ref. 19Wissmann R. Baukrowitz T. Kalbacher H. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Pongs O. Antz C. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Next we investigated the structural properties of BKβ2N in solution with NMR spectroscopy. NMR experiments were performed under various conditions in aqueous solution at pH 3.0 and in a physiological salt solution at pH 6.0 (see “Materials and Methods”). The 1H NMR resonances of BKβ2N were completely assigned by two-dimensional NMR methods in the low pH solution and verified under physiological salt and pH conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, NOE contacts between nonadjacent amino acids (i,i+x) indicative for structured domains were only observed on the sequence stretch roughly extending from Ser10 to Leu31. This “core domain” exhibited NOE patterns typically observed with α-helices. Thus, connectivities between the α-proton of one amino acid and the amide (αN(i,i+3)) or β-proton (αβ(i,i+3)) of the third amino acid following were observed. Most residues throughout this stretch show sequential contacts between backbone amide protons (dNN NOEs). Moreover, 3JHNHα coupling constants were determined in this region for 8 of 22 residues. Five of these J-couplings showed values between 5.3 and 6 Hz, indicative of helical conformations, and three were between 6 and 8 Hz. The NOE-based indication of secondary structural elements in BKβ2N was corroborated by results of an H/D exchange experiment, where one-dimensional spectra were recorded 15, 30, 45, and 65 min after dissolving lyophilized BKβ2N in D2O. Thus, a number of amide protons (HN) including those of Ile21, Gln23, Ile25, Asp29, and Leu31 were identified in the first and second one-dimensional spectrum (see supplemental material). Resonances of the HNs of Ile25 and Leu31 were present even in the spectrum recorded 65 min after dissolution, indicating significant protection from exchange with the solvent as would be expected for hydrogen bonding in a helical conformation. This view is further supported by the deviations of the α-proton chemical shifts from random-coil values (31Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B(upper panel), the α-protons of all residues in the core region are shifted up-field as typically seen in helical structures (32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Hicks G.A. Marrion N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Together, the NOE pattern, the H/D exchange, the J-couplings, and the chemical shifts suggest that BKβ2N consists of an ordered mostly helical core domain flanked by flexible N and C termini. A total of 728 experimentally determined NOE constraints (average of 16.2/residue; Fig. 2 B, lower panel) together with the restraints for dihedral angles and stereospecific assignment of protons were used to calculate the solution structure of BKβ2N (TableI). After structure calculations using the simulated annealing protocol of DYANA (29Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) in the torsion angle space 24 structures with the lowest values of the target function and without NOE violations of >0.4 Å were selected as the final family of BKβ2N structures (for structural statistics see TableI).Table IStructural statistics of BKβ2NTotal number of experimental distance restraints728Intraresidual486Sequential191Medium range (‖i–j‖ ≤ 5)51Long range (‖i–j‖ > 5)0Φ dihedral angle restraints from 3JHNHα ≤ 6 Hz5Stereospecific assignments11Distance restraint violations > 0.4 Å (per structure)0Dihedral angle restraint violations (per structure)0Average number of distance restraint violations > 0.2 Å (per structure)1 ± 1Average sum of distance restraint violations (per structure)5.1 ± 0.6 ÅAverage maximum distance restraint violation0.25 ± 0.08 ÅAverage target function 0.66 ± 0.13 Å2r.m.s. deviations to the respective mean structure:Superimposed residuesBackbone N, Cα, and CaStructural statistics for the final family of 24 structures.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows 18 representatives of this family of best structures, superimposed either between residues 10 and 17 (Fig. 3 A) or residues 18 and 31 (Fig. 3 B). Both superpositions display reasonable convergence with similar r.m.s. deviation values to the mean structure (0.65 ± 0.22 and 0.48 ± 0.27 Å for the backbone atoms in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), whereas superposition on the entire range was not meaningful because of the divergent orientation of residues Glu17—Arg19 that connect both stretches. The Glu17—Arg19 linker thus divides BKβ2N into an N- and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain consists of a disordered part made up of residues 1–10 and a loop-helix motif formed by amino acids Ser11—Asp16 (Fig. 3 A). Superposition of residues 10–16 revealed r.m.s. deviations from the mean structure of 0.60 ± 0.17 Å for backbone atoms and of 1.14 ± 0.17 Å for all atoms. The C-terminal domain is made up of an extended helical structure formed by residues 20–31 and a flexible C terminus (residues 32–45; Fig. 3 B). Within the helical structure, residues 22–30 form a regular α-helix that is preceded by one turn of a 310-helix (Fig. 3 B). Superposition of structures over the range of the helix domain results in r.m.s. deviations of 0.43 ± 0.26 Å for backbone atoms and of 0.90 ± 0.25 Å for all atoms. When correlated with functional properties, it is only the N-terminal domain that is required for occlusion of the channel pore, as seen in experiments with this domain fused to the KCNMB1 subunit or applied to BK channels as a synthetic peptide (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this domain was termed the ball domain (Fig. 4). In contrast, the C-terminal domain, which links the ball to the transmembrane segment of KCNMB2, may be regarded as the chain domain (Fig. 4). BKβ2N inactivates BK channels with characteristics known from the ”pore plug-in“ described for inactivation domains of Kv-type K+ channels. Accordingly, BKβ2N-mediated pore occlusion exhibits shallow voltage dependence and is competed by the pore-blocking agent TEA (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar,13Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Zeng X.H. Duan K.L. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4890-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As determined from NMR experiments, BKβ2N presents with a unique solution structure; it consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker, the ball domain, made up of a disordered N terminus anchored at a loop-helix motif, and the chain domain, a 4-turn helix with an unfolded region at its C terminus. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the structure of BKβ2N is accompanied by functional properties that are unique with respect to those of Kv-derived IDs. Thus, the association rate of BKβ2N with its receptor on the channel is very similar to that observed with the unstructured IDs of Kvβ1.1 or Shaker B, but considerably slower than that determined for the compactly folded Kv3.4-ID (17Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Wissmann R.

Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate of BKβ2N, on the other hand, is more than 10-fold lower than that of Kvβ1.1-ID or the ID of Shaker B and even about 2-fold lower than that of Kv3.4-ID. These correlations between structural and functional properties are consistent with our earlier observations that well ordered IDs exhibit a faster kon and a much slower koff than unfolded domains (17Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Wissmann R.

The latter seems to be caused either by the higher number of molecular contacts (hydrogen bonds, etc.) formed between the folded domain and the receptor or by the higher flexibility of the unfolded IDs, which destabilizes the ID-receptor interaction. Together with the observation that the actual pore block is realized by the N-terminal 19 or 26 residues (11Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), BKβ2N-mediated inactivation may be imagined to occur as follows. The ball domain (Fig. 4) will approach the open channel and, in a second step, bind to its receptor, which finally results in occlusion of the channel pore. Channel approach and binding are reflected by kon and are determined by the flexible part of the ball domain as suggested recently for Kvβ1.1-mediated inactivation (34Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Hicks G.A. Marrion N.V. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Unbinding of the ID from its receptor, as reflected by koff, should be controlled by the structured part of the ball domain. As koff of BKβ2N is the lowest of all ID peptides investigated to date, the ball-receptor interaction must be particularly strong. Interestingly, the structured region of the ball domain contains a cluster of charged residues suggesting that hydrophilic interactions may be an important determinant for the BKβ2N-BKα interaction. This premise would be in line with work by Toro et al. (35Toro L. Ottolia M. Stefani E. Latorre R. Hicks G.A. Marrion N.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7220-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) who investigated the interaction between the ID from Shaker B with BK channels and concluded that the ID receptor of BK channels in the inner vestibule of the channel may contain hydrophilic residues and a “pocket” that favors binding of helical structures. The molecular identity of the BK ID receptor, however, must remain open at this point as well as the question of how far BKβ2N enters the channel pore and whether interactions between charges on the ball domain and the channel wall are involved in ID receptor interaction.

Here we studied the effects of the IGF-IR on intercellular connections mediated by the major epithelial adhesion protein, E-cadherin (E-cad). We found that IGF-IR overexpression markedly stimulated aggregation in E-cad-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not in E-cad-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. However, when the IGF-IR and E-cad were co-expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, cell-cell adhesion was substantially increased. The IGF-IR-dependent cell-cell adhesion of MCF-7 cells was not related to altered expression of E-cad or α-, β-, or γ-catenins but coincided with the up-regulation of another element of the E-cad complex, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). ZO-1 expression (mRNA and protein) was induced by IGF-I and was blocked in MCF-7 cells with a tyrosine kinase-defective IGF-IR mutant. By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that ZO-1 associates with the E-cad complex and the IGF-IR. High levels of ZO-1 coincided with an increased IGF-IR/α-catenin/ZO-1-binding and improved ZO-1/actin association, whereas down-regulation of ZO-1 by the expression of an anti-ZO-1 RNA inhibited IGF-IR-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The results suggested that one of the mechanisms by which the activated IGF-IR regulates E-cad-mediated cell-cell adhesion is overexpression of ZO-1 and the resulting stronger connections between the E-cad complex and the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that in E-cad-positive cells, the IGF-IR may produce antimetastatic effects.

Recent evidence indicates that the IGF-IR may be involved in breast cancer development. The IGF-IR is significantly (10–14-fold) overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive primary breast tumors compared with normal mammary epithelium or benign tumors (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Resnik J.L. Reichart D.B. Huey K. Webster N.J.G. Seely B.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the intrinsic ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR has been found to be substantially up-regulated (∼2–4-fold) in breast cancer cells (4Resnik J.L. Reichart D.B. Huey K. Webster N.J.G. Seely B.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the increased receptor function coupled with enhanced receptor expression amounts to a 40-fold elevation in IGF-IR activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors (4Resnik J.L. Reichart D.B. Huey K. Webster N.J.G. Seely B.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). Recent clinical and experimental data indicate that up-regulation of IGF-IR signaling in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells is associated with autonomous cell proliferation, estrogen-independence, and increased resistance to various antitumor treatments (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is believed that hyperactivation of the IGF-IR may induce and sustain the growth of primary breast tumors (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The role of the IGF-IR in breast cancer metastasis, however, is unclear. The experimental data suggest that the IGF-IR has a function in cell spreading by effectively stimulating the motility of different metastatic breast cancer cell lines lacking the expression of a major adhesion protein, E-cadherin (E-cad) (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 5Dunn S.E. Ehrlich M. Sharp N.J.H. Reiss K. Solomon G. Hawkins R. Baserga R. Barrett J.C.

On the other hand, we and others have shown that in more differentiated E-cad-positive cells, IGF-I treatment or IGF-IR overexpression up-regulates cell-cell adhesion, which correlates with increased cell survival in three-dimensional culture and with reduced cell migration in vitro and in organ culture (1Surmacz E.

Immunol. 1996; 213: 123-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The mechanism of IGF-I-dependent intercellular adhesion and the clinical consequences of this phenomenon have not been fully elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, the IGF-IR co-localizes and co-precipitates with the E-cad complex and that IGF-induced aggregation is blocked with an anti-E-cad antibody (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study we assessed the effects of the IGF-IR on the elements of the E-cad adhesion complex, i.e.E-cad; β-, γ-, and α-catenins; and α-catenin-associated proteins (see Fig. 6). The initial results prompted us to focus on an α-catenin-binding element, the junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). ZO-1 is a ∼220-kDa scaffolding protein containing various domains (an SH3 domain, three PDZ domains, a proline-rich region, and a guanylate kinase domain) that allow its interaction with specialized sites of plasma membrane as well as with other proteins (11Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar). ZO-1 is a characteristic element of tight junctions, but recently its presence has also been demonstrated in E-cad adherens junctions (13Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 14Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez-Boulan E.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The role of ZO-1 in adherens junctions is yet unclear, but it is assumed that it may functionally link E-cad with the actin cytoskeleton because it associates with α-catenin and actin through its N and C terminus, respectively (Ref. 13Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, see Fig. 6). In addition, as a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue (MAGUK) family of putative signaling proteins, ZO-1 may be involved in signal transduction. Indeed, ZO-1 has been found to bind a target of Ras, AF6 (16Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Deletions or mutations in the ZO-1 gene produced overgrowth, suggesting that ZO-1 may act as a tumor suppressor (11Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, ZO-1 is usually co-expressed with E-cad and is a strong independent marker of a more differentiated phenotype (17Hoover K.B. Liao S.-Y. Bryant P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1767-17773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At present, very little is known about the regulation of ZO-1 by growth factors. However, some recent studies demonstrated that epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor are able to increase ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, modulate its subcellular localization, and consequently produce increased permeability (18Van Itallie C.M. Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1735-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 19Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol.

Here, we present the first evidence that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells 1) the IGF-IR up-regulates ZO-1 expression, 2) elevated levels of ZO-1 coincide with enhanced IGF-IR/E-cad-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and 3) ZO-1 expression is required for IGF-IR-increased cell aggregation in E-cad-positive MCF-7 cells. The pBAT-EM2 plasmid is a derivative of pBR322 and contains the mouse E-cad cDNA cloned under the β-actin promoter in pBR322 (21Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously, transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with pBAT-EM2 results in E-cad overexpression, improved cell aggregation, and reduced metastatic potential of the cells (21Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 22Mbalaviele G. Dunstan C.R. Sasaki A. Williams P.J. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4063-4070PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3/anti-ZO-1 plasmid encoding the anti-ZO-1 antisense RNA contains a 959-base pairBamHI fragment of the human ZO-1 cDNA (nucleotides 4205–5164) inserted (in the 3′-5′ orientation) into the pcDNA3.1/hygro plasmid (Invitrogen). pcDNA3/sense-ZO-1 is the control vector in which the above 959-base pair ZO-1 cDNA fragment was cloned in the 5′-3′ orientation. MCF-7/IGF-IR clones 12, 15, and 17 are MCF-7-derived clones overexpressing the IGF-IR at the levels 5 × 105, 3 × 106, and 1 × 106receptors/cell, respectively (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To avoid clonal variation, in several experiments we used a population of mixed clones 12, 15, and 17. The mixed population is referred to as MCF-7/IGF-IR cells and expresses ∼0.9 × 106 IGF-IR receptors/cell (which represents ∼18-fold overexpression over the levels in normal cells) (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F express an IGF-IR (∼3 × 106receptors/cell) with inactivating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (Tyr-1131, Tyr-1135, and Tyr-1136 replaced with Phe) (23Kato H. Faria T. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F cells were derived from MCF-7 cells by stable transfection with the pcDNA3/IGF-IR/KR plasmid and subsequent selection in 2 mg/ml G418. The results obtained with the MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F clone were verified using a population of MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with the IGF-IR/Y3F vector (see below). MCF-7/IGF-IR/anti-ZO-1 and MCF-7/IGF-IR/sense ZO-1 cells were derived from MCF-7/IGF-IR clone 15 by stable transfection with the antisense and sense ZO-1 vectors, respectively and subsequent selection in 500 µg/ml hygromycin B. MDA-MB-231 is a metastatic breast cancer cell line lacking E-cad and expressing ∼7 × 103 IGF-IR receptors/cell (24Peyrat J.P. Bonneterre J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Leroy-Martin B. Dijane J. Demaille A.

In the experiments requiring serum-free conditions, the cells were cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 µm FeSO4, and 2 mml-glutamine (referred to as SFM). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (reagent/DNA ratio, 5 µl/1 µg). The transfection was carried out in growth medium for 24 h, and then the cells were lysed and processed for E-cad Western blotting (WB). To evaluate the extent of cell-cell adhesion in the transfected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR cells, the cells were trypsinized upon transfection, counted, and placed in three-dimensional suspension culture as described below. MCF-7 cells were transfected for 6 h in growth medium using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (reagent/DNA ratio, 3 µl/1 µg). To study IGF-I signaling, the transfected MCF-7 cells were shifted to SFM for 36 h and stimulated with IGF-I for 15 min. The efficiency of transfection (transfected cells/total cell number) was at least 70% for all cell types and was estimated by scoring fluorescent cells in cultures transfected with the plasmid pCMS (encoding green fluorescent protein) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown to 70–80% confluence, trypsinized, and plated in single-cell suspension in 2%-agar-coated plates containing either normal growth medium or SFM. 2 × 106 cells were plated per 100 mm culture dish. To generate three-dimensional spheroids, the plates were rotated for 4 h at 37 °C. The spheroids started to assemble at ∼1 h after plating and were completely organized after 3–4 h of culture in suspension. The three-dimensional cultures were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon or Olympus). The extent of aggregation was scored by measuring the spheroids with an ocular micrometer. For each cell type, the spheroids between 25 and 50, 50 and 100, and >100 µm (in the smallest cross-section) were counted in 10 different fields under × 10 magnification. 70% confluent cell cultures were synchronized in SFM for 36 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml IGF-I for 0–72 h. The expression of different elements of the adhesion complex was assessed in 500 µg of protein lysate by immunoprecipitation and WB with appropriate antibodies. The expression of ERK1/ERK2 was tested in 50 µg of total cell lysate. The cell lysis buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin as described before (25Mauro L. Sisci D. Salerno M. Kim J. Tam T. Guvakova M. Ando S. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-ZO-1 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for ZO-1 immunoprecipitation (5 µg/ml) and WB (2 µg/ml); anti-E-cad monoclonal antibody (mAB), clone 36 (Transduction Laboratories) for E-cadherin immunoprecipitation (2 µg/ml) and WB (0.1 µg/ml); anti-α-catenin pAb (Sigma or Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for α-catenin immunoprecipitation (4 µg/ml) and WB (anti-serum dilution 1:4000); anti-β-catenin mAb (Transduction Laboratories) for β-catenin immunoprecipitation (4 µg/ml) and WB (0.5 µg/ml); anti-γ catenin pAb (Sigma) for γ-catenin WB (1 µg/ml); anti-actin mAb clone AC-40 (Sigma) for actin WB (0.4 µg/ml); anti-IGF-IR mAb, clone αIR-3 (Calbiochem) for IGF-IR immunoprecipitation (3 µg/ml), and anti-IGF-IR pAb C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for IGF-IR WB (0.2 µg/ml); anti-p85 pAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase WB (0.25 µg/ml); anti-phospho-MAPK mAb (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for active ERK1/ERK2 WB (0.5 µg/ml); and anti-MAPK pAb (New England Biolabs) for total ERK1/ERK2 WB (1 µg/ml). Tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated proteins was measured by WB with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Transduction Laboratories) (0.03 µg/ml). Western blots were developed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of bands representing relevant proteins was measured by laser densitometry scanning. First, we demonstrated that under three-dimensional culture conditions, overexpression of the IGF-IR stimulated cell-cell adhesion in E-cad-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells but not in E-cad-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.1, A and B) (TableI). However, co-expression of the IGF-IR and E-cad resulted in robust cell-cell adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the expression of E-cad alone was less efficient in inducing intercellular contacts (Fig. 1,C and D) (Table I). These results, together with our previous data showing that IGF-IR-mediated aggregation in MCF-7 cells is blocked with an anti-E-cad antibody (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), indicated that IGF-IR adhesion signals are transmitted through the E-cad complex.Table IEffects of IGF-IR and ZO-1 expression on cell aggregation in E-cad-positive and -negative breast cancer cellsCellsSpheroids25 ≤ 50 µm50 ≤ 100 µm>100 µmMCF-721.0 ± 1.996.0 ± 6.72.7 ± 0.9MCF-7/IGF-IR1.7 ± 0.722.3 ± 1.486.5 ± 3.9MCF-7/IGF-IR/anti-ZO-175.0 ± 3.540.7 ± 2.10.0 ± 0.0MCF-7/Y3F45.0 ± 2.939.8 ± 4.60.0 ± 0.0MDA-MB-2317.0 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.20.0 ± 0.0MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR12.5 ± 0.80.5 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.0MDA-MB-231/E-cad39.8 ± 3.615.2 ± 1.10.0 ± 0.0MDA-MB-231/vector10.0 ± 1.40.6 ± 0.40.0 ± 0.0MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR/E-cad27.0 ± 2.268.3 ± 7.28.0 ± 1.5MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR/vector18.6 ± 2.20.9 ± 0.30.0 ± 0.0The stable cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/IGF-IR, MCF-7/IGF-IR/anti-ZO-1, MCF-7/Y3F, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR) and transiently transfected populations (MDA-MB-231/E-cad, MDA-MB-231/vector, MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR/E-cad, and MDA-MB-231/IGF-IR/vector) were cultured as three-dimensional spheroids in normal growth medium.

The results are mean ± S.E. from at least three experiments. Representative three-dimensional cultures are shown in Figs. 1 and 7. We tested whether high levels of the IGF-IR affect the expression of the proteins within the E-cad complex and found that in MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells cultured as three-dimensional spheroids, the levels of E-cad and α-, β-, and γ-catenin were similar. However, the abundance of ZO-1 was significantly increased in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells (Fig.2). The tyrosine phosphorylation of all these adhesion proteins was undetectable in spheroids and was not influenced by IGF-IR overexpression (Fig. 5and data not shown).Figure 5Interactions of ZO-1 with the IGF-IR in the E-cad complex. A, the IGF-IR, E-cad, and ZO-1 were immunoprecipitated from 500 µg of total protein lysates obtained from MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells cultured as three-dimensional spheroids in normal growth medium. The immunoprecipitates (IP) were then probed by Western blotting (WB) for phosphotyrosine (PY), the IGF-IR (∼97 kDa), ZO-1 (∼220 kDa), E-cad (∼120 kDa), and α-catenin (∼102 kDa). B, to confirm α-catenin presence in IGF-IR immunoprecipitates, the lysates were first treated with anti-α-catenin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) overnight to deplete α-catenin and then immunoprecipitated with either anti-E-cad or anti-IGF-IR antibodies. The E-cad and IGF-IR immunoprecipitates were then probed with another anti-α-catenin antibody (Sigma). Note significantly reduced α-catenin associations with IGF-IR and E-cad compared with that seen in A. C, 500 µg of protein lysates were precipitated with anti-α-catenin antibody and probed by WB for α-catenin, actin, and ZO-1. The blots presented in A, B, andC were identically developed with film exposure time 10 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the increased expression of ZO-1 in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells depends on IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity, we generated by stable or transient transfection MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F cells expressing high levels of a kinase-defective IGF-IR mutant (IGF-IR/Y3F). The overexpression of the IGF-IR/Y3F mutant resulted in impaired IGF-I response, which was reflected by markedly reduced IGF-IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, decreased IRS-1/p85 binding, and diminished ERK1/ERK2 stimulation (Fig. 3). The basal expression of ZO-1 in MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F cells was significantly reduced compared with that in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is required for the up-regulation of ZO-1 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the inhibition of IGF-I response did not affect E-cad expression, suggesting a selective action of the IGF-IR toward ZO-1 (Fig. 3). The blockade of the IGF-IR signal in MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F cells coincided with reduced cell-cell adhesion (Table 1). To establish whether the activation of the IGF-IR by IGF produces a similar effect on ZO-1 as that seen with IGF-IR overexpression, we studied ZO-1 mRNA and protein in MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells treated with 20 ng/ml IGF-I for 1–72 h (Fig.4). In MCF-7 cells cultured in SFM, the basal levels of ZO-1 mRNA were low and were markedly increased between 4 and 36 h of IGF-I treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the abundance of ZO-1 mRNA was always elevated in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells and was only moderately improved by IGF-I (4–72 h) (Fig. 4 A). ZO-1 protein levels in IGF-I-treated cells generally reflected the expression of ZO-1 mRNA (Fig.4 B). It has been recently reported that ZO-1 is an element of the E-cad complex (12Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar, 13Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 14Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez-Boulan E.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This complex also contains the IGF-IR, as described in our previous work (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Surmacz E. Guvakova M. Nolan M. Nicosia R. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation status of the IGF-IR, E-cad, and ZO-1, and the interactions among these proteins in MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells cultured as three-dimensional spheroids (Fig.5). The autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR was elevated in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, reflecting the increased responsiveness of the cells to IGF-IR ligands (IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin) present in serum. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cad and ZO-1 were unaffected by IGF-IR overexpression (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, high levels of the IGF-IR did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of α-, β-, or γ-catenin (data not shown). Next, we asked whether hyperactivation of the IGF-IR and increased expression ZO-1 have consequences for the associations among the proteins within the E-cad complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that IGF-IR overexpression resulted in an increased abundance of IGF-IR·E-cad and IGF-IR·ZO-1 complexes (Fig.5 A). Also, the elevated levels of ZO-1 in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells coincided with an increased association of ZO-1 with either E-cad or the IGF-IR (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, the binding of α-catenin (a ZO-1-associated protein) to the IGF-IR or ZO-1 but not to E-cad was greater in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells than in MCF-7 cells (Fig.5 A). The presence of α-catenin in IGF-IR immunoprecipitates was confirmed with cell lysates in which α-catenin was first removed with a specific antibody. As expected, immunoprecipitation of such depleted lysates with either anti-IGF-IR or anti-E-cad antibodies revealed reduced α-catenin/E-cad and α-catenin/IGF-IR associations (Fig. 5 B). Further experiments with α-catenin immunoprecipitates indicated increased abundance of α-catenin·actin and α-catenin·ZO-1 complexes in MCF-7/IGF-IR cells (Fig. 5 C). A hypothetical model of possible interactions between adhesion proteins and the IGF-IR is shown in Fig. 6. Because the results suggested that ZO-1 may be an important intermediate in IGF-IR-stimulated cell-cell adhesion, we set out to confirm this notion using MCF-7/IGF-IR cells in which ZO-1 levels were down-regulated by the expression of an anti-ZO-1 RNA (MCF-7/IGF-IR/anti-ZO-1 cells) (Fig. 7). The clones with the best ZO-1 reduction and an intact E-cad and IGF-IR expression were analyzed in three-dimensional culture. The cell-cell adhesion of MCF-7/IGF-IR/anti-ZO-1 cells was greatly inhibited compared with that in the parental MCF-7/IGF-IR cells (Fig. 7 and Table 1). The expression of the anti-ZO-1 plasmid in the parental MCF-7 cells was toxic, and no viable clones were obtained. The transfection of the sense-ZO-1 vector had no effect on cell-cell adhesion (data not shown). Cell-cell adhesion is a known factor modulating the motility of tumor cells and consequently impacting tumor metastasis (26Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The regulation of this process by exogenous growth factors is still not well understood. In E-cad-positive breast cancer cells, the overexpression or activation of the IGF-IR has been shown to stimulate cell-cell adhesion and reduce cell spreading in vitro or in organ culture (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Surmacz E. Guvakova M. Nolan M. Nicosia R. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res.

Immunol. 1996; 213: 123-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR has also been found co-localized and co-precipitated with the E-cad adhesion complex (7Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Surmacz E. Guvakova M. Nolan M. Nicosia R. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mechanism of IGF-IR-stimulated E-cad-dependent cell-cell adhesion is unknown and has been investigated in this work. We discovered the following observations. 1) IGF-IR overexpression increased aggregation in E-cad-positive cells but not in E-cad-negative cells. 2) High expression of both IGF-IR and E-cad markedly improved cell aggregation in E-cad-negative cells. 3) IGF-IR-dependent cell-cell adhesion in E-cad-positive cells did not affect the expression of E-cad or α-, β-, or γ-catenins but coincided with up-regulation of ZO-1. 4) ZO-1 expression was induced by IGF-I and required IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity, and 5) high levels of ZO-1 coincided with an increased IGF-IR/α-catenin/ZO-1 binding and improved ZO-1/actin association, whereas down-regulation of ZO-1 by the expression of an anti-ZO-1 RNA inhibited IGF-IR-dependent cell-cell adhesion. We hypothesize that the mechanism or one of the mechanisms by which the activated IGF-IR stimulates cell-cell adhesion is overexpression of ZO-1 and the resultant stronger connections between the E-cad complex and the actin cytoskeleton. Very little is known about the regulation of ZO-1 by growth factors. Several growth factors (e.g. epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been demonstrated to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 in different cellular model systems (18Van Itallie C.M. Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1735-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 19Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of ZO-1 usually coincides with its departure from tight junctions into the cytoplasm and with increased permeability (18Van Itallie C.M. Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1735-1742PubMed Google Scholar, 19Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In addition, v-Src-increased ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been linked to decreased cell-cell adhesion (27Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). IGF-I, on the other hand, has been shown to stabilize ZO-1 in tight junctions and to preserve the epithelial barrier in embryonic kidney cells and in pig thyrocytes (28Sakurai H. Barros E.J. Tsukamoto T. Barasch J. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Ericson L.E. Nilsson M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the effects of IGF-I on ZO-1 expression and function in breast cancer cells have never been explored. Our findings provide the first evidence that the activation of the IGF-IR up-regulates ZO-1 mRNA and protein levels without affecting ZO-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with the results obtained in other models, we noted increased adhesion in cells overexpressing ZO-1 and reduced aggregation in cells with down-regulated ZO-1 levels. IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation was required for the stimulation of ZO-1 expression, inasmuch as the basal levels of ZO-1 were not increased in MCF-7/IGF-IR/Y3F cells expressing a dominant-negative, kinase-defective mutant of the IGF-IR. However, the putative IGF-I signaling pathways leading to ZO-1 expression have yet to be characterized. Our preliminary data with MCF-7/IRS-1 cells, in which the major IGF-IR/IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase growth/survival pathway is hyperactivated (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggested that this pathway is not involved in ZO-1 regulation (data not shown). The clinical implications of IGF-induced and ZO-1-mediated cell-cell adhesion on tumor development and progression are unknown. Until now, the data from our and other laboratories suggest that in E-cad-positive breast cancer cells IGF-IR improves cell-cell adhesion and cell survival in three-dimensional culture but at the same time reduces cell spreading (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, one consequence of IGF-IR overexpression in breast cancer could be increased growth and survival of the primary tumor but reduced cell metastasis. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the IGF-IR is a good prognostic indicator for breast cancer, as tumors with good prognosis express much higher levels of the IGF-IR than tumors with bad prognosis (1Surmacz E. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Pezzino V. Papa V. Milazzo G. Gliozzo B. Russo P. Scalia P.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Cancer. 2000; 89: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Notably, an independent study has shown that in breast tumors, E-cad and ZO-1 are co-expressed and are markers of a more differentiated phenotype (17Hoover K.B. Liao S.-Y. Bryant P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1767-17773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A formal analysis of the correlations between ZO-1 and the IGF-IR is underway in our laboratory and should help in clarifying the role of the IGF-IR in breast cancer progression. Drs. J. M. Anderson and A. S. Fanning (Yale University, New Haven, CT) generously provided the pSKZO-1 plasmid encoding the human ZO-1 cDNA. The E-cad expression vector pBAT-EM2 was a gift from Drs. M.

Myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) is specifically inhibited by the protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitor protein of 17 kDa, called CPI-17, as part of Ca2+ sensitization of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Phosphorylation of Thr38 in CPI-17 enhances inhibitory potency toward MLCP over 1000-fold. In this study we mapped regions of CPI-17 required for inhibition and investigated the mechanism using deletion and point mutants. Deletion of either the N-terminal 34 residues or C-terminal 27 residues gave no change in the IC50 of either phospho- or unphospho-CPI-17. However, further deletion to give CPI-17 proteins of 1–102, 1–89, 1–76, and 1–67, resulted in much higher IC50 values. The results indicate there is a minimal inhibitory domain between residues 35 and 120. A single Ala substitution at Tyr41 eliminated phosphorylation-dependent inhibition, and phospho-Thr38 in the Y41A protein was efficiently dephosphorylated by MLCP itself. The wild type CPI-17 expressed in fibroblast-induced bundling and contraction of actomyosin filaments, whereas expression of the Y41A protein had no obvious effects. Thus, a central domain of CPI-17(35–120) including phospho-Thr38is necessary for recognition by myosin phosphatase and Tyr41 arrests dephosphorylation, thereby producing inhibition.

Regulatory subunits bind to PP1C and tether it to intracellular loci, thereby the PP1C activity is compartmentalized for specific substrates. In addition, the interaction of regulatory subunit can induce allosteric modulation of PP1C, narrowing down specificity and activating catalysis (5Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.

The analog peptide of the glycogen targeting subunit including a RVSF sequence was co-crystalized with PP1C and seen to contact the β5/6 loop, Leu243, Phe257, and Phe293 of PP1C, some distance from the active site (5Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitor proteins also control cellular PP1 activity. Phosphorylation-dependent inhibitors, inhibitor-1, and DARPP-32 inhibit PP1C activity in response to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (7Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Hemmings H.C. Greengard P. Lim H.Y. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphorylation site, there is a KIQF sequence present as a PP1C-binding motif that is necessary for the potent inhibition of PP1C by both inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 (9Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Huang H. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shih S. Tsay H. Li H. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A synthetic 31-residue DARPP-32 peptide including both the KIQF sequence and the phosphorylation site produced phosphorylationdependent inhibition of PP1C (11Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither inhibitor-1 nor DARPP-32 inhibited activity of PP1C associated with certain regulatory subunits containing an RVXF motif. Thus, it is thought that these inhibitors and regulatory subunits compete for binding to PP1C at the site for RVXF. Inhibitor-2 and its analog inhibitor-4 interact with PP1C using sites over their entire sequences (12Yang J. Hurley T.D. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22635-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The N-terminal IKGI sequence of inhibitor-2 was suggested to contact to the β5/6 loop of PP1C near, but not identical to the RVXF peptide-binding site (15Connor J.H. Frederick D. Huang H. Yang J. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Nairn A.C. DePaoli-Roach A. Tatchell K. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18670-18675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, inhibitor-2 has little inhibitory activity against myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) that contains PP1C and a myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) (16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concept is that PP1C binds either regulatory subunits or inhibitor proteins, but not at the same time (17Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Unlike these other inhibitor proteins, CPI-17 and its analog PHI-1 (30% overall sequence identity), can inhibit the myosin phosphatase enzyme complex as potently as monomeric PP1C. This shows that binding to the RVXF site on PP1C is not required for inhibition, nor does the MYPT1 subunit bound to this site interfere with CPI-17 inhibition (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Eto M. Karginov A. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16952-16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore CPI-17 presents a new mode of interaction with PP1C, and this study set out to define the determinants for this interaction. CPI-17 is important for control of smooth muscle and is highly expressed in mammalian vascular smooth muscle (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Woodsome T.P. Eto M. Everett A. Brautigan D.L. Kitazawa T. J. Physiology. 2001; 535: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Myosin phosphatase has been identified as the dominant target for CPI-17 phosphorylated at Thr38 (22Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr38 occurs in response to stimulation of intact smooth muscle by agonists such as histamine and phenylepherine (23Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylation occurs in parallel with vasodilation that is triggered by nitric oxide production (24Etter E.F. Eto M. Wardle R.L. Brautigan D.L. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34681-34685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recombinant phospho-CPI-17 induces myosin phosphorylation and contraction of permeabilized artery strips (25Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 503: 871-881Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of artery strips by Triton X-100 treatment depletes endogenous CPI-17 and eliminates the contractile response to protein kinase C (PKC), but reconstitution with recombinant CPI-17 restores PKC-induced contraction (26Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The expression level of CPI-17 among smooth muscles correlates with sensitivity to phorbol ester-induced contraction, supporting the concept that PKC acts via CPI-17 (21Woodsome T.P. Eto M. Everett A. Brautigan D.L. Kitazawa T. J. Physiology. 2001; 535: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Experiments show several other purified kinases phosphorylate CPI-17 at Thr38, including Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase, protein kinase N, and ZIP-like kinase (27Eto M. Kitazawa T. Yazawa M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29072-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Koyama M. Ito M. Feng J. Seko T. Shiraki K. Takase K.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results suggest that CPI-17 is a hub at the center of various signaling pathways to regulate MLCP activity and control vascular tone (27Eto M. Kitazawa T. Yazawa M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29072-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here we prepared a series of deletion and point-mutated CPI-17 and tested their activity against purified MLCP and in living cells to define the structures required for potent inhibition. MLCP was prepared from porcine aorta smooth muscle (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Partially purified PKC was prepared from pig brain by a modification of the method of Kikkawa et al. (31Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), using DE32TM (Whatman) and Phenyl-CellulofineTM(Seikagaku Co.) column chromatographies. The active fragment of PKCδ was purified (27Eto M. Kitazawa T. Yazawa M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29072-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and chicken gizzard MLC20, MLCK, and calmodulin were prepared as previously described (22Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MLC20 was phosphorylated with MLCK in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin and ATP (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and sequence-grade trypsin were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Promega, respectively. Pig CPI-17 cDNA was ligated into the pET30 vector (Novagene) to produce recombinant CPI-17 fused with N-terminal His6-, plus the 44-residue S-tag sequenceTM (Novagene) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (20Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For N-terminal deletion mutants of CPI-17 a new NcoI site was generated by polymerase chain reaction at the desired sites in wild type CPI-17 cDNA using a mismatch sense primer. To create C-terminal deletion mutants a stop codon was introduced, followed by a new EcoRI site for ligation into the expression vector. Point mutations were produced by the QuickchangeTM protocol following the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene). Sequences of all cDNA inserts were confirmed by deoxy sequencing in the biomolecular core facility at the University of Virginia. Recombinant CPI-17 and mutants were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) as previously described (20Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation of CPI-17 was carried out at 37 °C using pig brain PKC and 0.1 mm ATP or 1 mm ATPγS (20Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 8 m urea (20Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and stoichiometric phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation was demonstrated by a change in migration of all the protein. For mammalian expression, the cDNA insert in pET30 vector was excised and ligated into the pcDNA3TM vector (Invitrogen) that was modified to express N-terminal FLAGTM (Sigma)-tagged fusion proteins. MLCP activity was assayed at 25 °C by measuring the initial rate of dephosphorylation of 2 µmphospho-MLC20 or phospho-CPI-17 as a substrate. Assays were performed with 0.5 nm MLCP and various concentrations of recombinant CPI-17 in the presence of 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Brij-35. Dephosphorylation was initiated by addition of phospho-MLC20 or phospho-CPI-17 to the mixture. At 5, 10, 20, and 30 min 10-µl samples were transferred into tubes containing about 10 mg of solid urea and 2 µl of 2-mercaptoethanol to terminate the reaction. The phospho- and dephospho-MLC20 or CPI-17 were separated on urea-PAGE gel (32Yoshida M. Yagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 503: 871-881Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 solution. The ratio of the band intensity of phospho/dephospho-MLC20 or CPI-17 was determined by use of a densitometer (ATTO). The time course of dephosphorylation was linear under these conditions and the rate of dephosphorylation was measured with each concentration of recombinant CPI-17 and plotted as relative MLCP activity against the activity without CPI-17, set as 100%. Limited proteolysis was performed using32P-phosphorylated H6S-CPI-17. Wild type and Y41A proteins (0.2 mg/ml) were phosphorylated for 10 min at 30 °C with the active fragment of PKCδ and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2.4 µCi/nmol). The PKC was inactivated by addition of 10 µm GF109203X (Calbiochem). Samples (19 µl) were mixed with 1 µl of trypsin solution and incubated for 30 min at 23 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of 2 mm PefablocTM (Boehringer) and 10 µl of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The tryptic fragments were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue G-250 and autoradiography. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described (16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the REF52 cells on a coverslip were transiently transfected for 24 h with 1 µg of mammalian expression vectors of FLAG-tagged CPI-17 and its mutants, using NovaFECTORTMtransfection reagent (Venn Nova, LLC., Pompano Beach, FL). After fixation and blocking, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2 clone, Sigma, 1:500), and then the primary antibody and actin microfilaments were stained with a mixed solution of Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Calbiochem) and fluorescein-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Images were acquired with a Nikon Microphot FXA/SA fluorescence microscope using a Hamamatsu C4742-95 CCD camera. The camera was controlled by Open Lab software (Improvision), and images were processed in Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe). We prepared a series of deletion and point-mutated CPI-17 as His6-tagged recombinant proteins (Fig.1). The inhibitory potency of phospho-, thiophospho-, and unphospho-forms of these proteins was tested using MLCP prepared from pig aorta. All unphosphorylated proteins had essentially the same potency as unphospho-wild type, with IC50 over 1 µm (Fig.2). Phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation at Thr38 was catalyzed by pig brain PKC. The deletion mutant (35) required longer reaction time to achieve stoichiometric phosphorylation (data not shown). Either thiophosphorylation or phosphorylation at Thr38 of wild-type CPI-17 was sufficient to produce full potency (Fig. 2, TableI), as described previously (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We tested the inhibitory potency of CPI-17 with Glu substituted for Thr38, T38E (Fig. 2). The negative charge of Glu did not mimic a phosphate group on Thr38, suggesting that a phosphate or a thiophosphate moiety on Thr38 is necessary for potent inhibition.Figure 2Inhibition of MLCP activity by CPI-17 wild type and T38E protein. MLCP activity was measured under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant CPI-17 used were: unphospho (U) (○), phospho (P) (●), and thiophospho (TP) (▴) WT, and the T38E protein (×). The 100% value indicates the MLCP activity without added CPI-17. Data from two independent assays are plotted. Inhibition curves for P- and U-CPI-17 are illustrated by dashed curves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IInhibition of MLCP activity by various forms of CPI-17CPI-17Thr-38IC50nmWTP6.2TP6.2U>10,000T38EGlu>10,000(10–147)P14(22–147)P12(35–147)P6.5(1–120)P6.5(1–102)P140(1–89)P140(1–76)P570TP460(1–67)P2,700K32AP6.3R33AP15Y41AP>5,000TP360U>5,000D42AP1,000R43AP400R44AP270MLCP activity was measured in the presence of various concentrations of phospho- (P-), thiophospho- (TP-), and unphospho- (U-) CPI-17 mutants. Data from two independent assays were displayed as in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and an IC50 value obtained from the plots. Open table in a new tab MLCP activity was measured in the presence of various concentrations of phospho- (P-), thiophospho- (TP-), and unphospho- (U-) CPI-17 mutants. Data from two independent assays were displayed as in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and an IC50 value obtained from the plots. Various N- and C-terminal deleted proteins were assayed (Fig.3). A deletion mutant (35) lacking the N-terminal 34 residues inhibited MLCP activity with IC50 of 10 nm (Fig. 3). Mutants with shorter deletions at the N terminus, (10) and (22), were essentially the same potency as wild type (Table I). The mutant protein (1), deleted 27 residues at the C terminus, had the same potency as full-length phospho-CPI-17 (Fig. 3). However, IC50 values of the shorter proteins (1) and (1–89) were increased 22-fold compared with wild type. Further deletions, giving the shorter proteins (1–76) and (1–67), abolished the inhibitory potency for MLCP. The results indicate that the region between 35 and 120 of CPI-17, that is conserved with the inhibitor protein PHI-1, is necessary for potent inhibition of MLCP. The sequence around Thr38is highly conserved between CPI-17 and PHI-1. We tested for the functions of various side chains in this region by making single Ala substitutions and assaying the mutant proteins. Consistent with results using the truncated protein (35), neither substitution of Lys32 nor Arg33 affected the IC50value of phospho-CPI-17 (Table I). On the other hand, single Ala substitutions of residues between Tyr41 and Arg44 resulted in large increases of IC50values (Table I and Fig. 4A). Especially the single residue mutant, the Y41A protein, completely lost phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of MLCP (Fig.4 B). Thiophosphorylation of Thr38 in the Y41A protein increased inhibitory activity (IC50 of 360 nm) compared with the oxo-phosphorylated version of this protein (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the IC50 value of the thiophosphorylated (1–76) protein was not much different from that of the oxo-phosphorylated form (Table I). Thiophospho residues are more stable to hydrolysis by phosphatases compared with oxophospho residues, so we suspected that the Y41A version of CPI-17 might have been dephosphorylated, accounting in part for its weak inhibitory activity. We tested whether the oxophospho-[Thr38]CPI-17 Y41A protein was dephosphorylated by MLCP during the assay. Fig.5shows phosphatase activities of MLCP against phospho-[Thr38]CPI-17 wild type, the Y41A protein, the R43A protein, and phospho-[Ser19]MLC20 as substrates. Phospho-[Thr38]CPI-17 wild type was dephosphorylated by MLCP itself, but it was over 50-fold poorer substrate compared with phospho-[Ser19]MLC20. A low concentration of okadaic acid (10 nm) had no effect on these activities, consistent with PP1 not PP2A-type activity. The results were consistent with the previous kinetic analysis that indicated mixed inhibition of MLCP by CPI-17 (22Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Ala substitution of Tyr41 greatly enhanced dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr38. Surprisingly, the phospho-[Thr38]CPI-17 Y41A protein was 1.4-fold better substrate for MLCP than even phospho-[Ser19]MLC20 (Fig.5). The R43A substituted protein also was moderately dephosphorylated by MLCP. The results suggest that side chains C-terminal to the phospho-Thr38 in CPI-17 act to prevent dephosphorylation of this phospho-residue positioned at the active site, thereby producing inhibition of MLCP. The side chain of Tyr41 is especially important in this regard because the Y41A protein of CPI-17 was so efficiently dephosphorylated as a substrate. We tested whether Ala substitution of Tyr41 perturbed the overall conformation of CPI-17. The Y41A protein was subjected to limited proteolysis as a probe of protein folding. Fig.6shows the pattern of tryptic fragments of 32P-H6S-CPI-17 wild type (left) and the Y41A protein (right). Incubation with 0.05 µg/ml trypsin cleaved only a small fraction of the total protein, and one fragment stained by Coomassie migrated the same as CPI-17 itself (marker lane). This was probably due to low yield cleavage of the fusion tag from the CPI-17. On the other hand incubation with 0.5 µg/ml trypsin digested all of the full-length fusion protein. The predominant product was a 15-kDa fragment, smaller than CPI-17 itself (left lane). This indicated that trypsin had cleaved at least one site within the CPI-17 sequence. The fragment was32P-labeled (bottom panel), therefore it contained Thr38, the site of phosphorylation. The site(s) for trypsin cleavage were displayed identically because there was no difference between wild type and Y41A proteins detected by Coomassie staining (top) and 32P-autoradiogram (bottom). Furthermore, in separate experiments the kinetics of modification of Lys residues in the Y41A protein withN-hydrosuccinimidyl rhodamine was identical compared with the wild type (not shown). Phosphorylation of wild type and Y41A proteins by PKC was not significantly different. Together, these results suggest that the overall folding of the Y41A protein was indistinguishable from wild-type CPI-17. FLAG-tagged CPI-17 proteins were expressed in REF52 cells and Fig. 7shows the resulting distribution of actin microfilaments. The wild type CPI-17 induced prominent bundling of actin microfilaments along the periphery, as previously reported (16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild type looked to have a shorter axis, consistent with the inhibition of MLCP by ectopic CPI-17 to enhance phosphorylation of myosin and contractility of microfilaments (16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 A). The bundling and contraction of microfilaments also occurred in cells expressing the deleted protein (1) that inhibited purified MLCP with the same IC50value as wild type (Fig. 7 B and Table I). The shorter fragment (1–89) of CPI-17, with lower potency against purified MLCP did not induce any changes in actin microfilaments (Fig.7 C), consistent with the IC50 value that was 22-fold higher compared with wild type (Table I). These results showed the sensitivity of the living cell assay of CPI-17 activity. The Y41A protein of CPI-17 had no effects on organization of actin microfilaments (Fig. 7 D). Equivalent levels of FLAG-protein expression for each of these proteins was confirmed by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7, E-H). The tagged CPI-17 appeared concentrated into foci near the periphery of the cell, as we previously reported (16Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both an active and an inactive truncated form of CPI-17 seemed to concentrate in the nucleus (Fig. 7, F and G), however, this did not seem to impair the ability to inhibit MLCP in situ. We concluded that wild type and (1) versions of CPI-17 but neither the (1–89) nor the Y41A mutant CPI-17 inhibited MLCP in living fibroblasts. In mammalian cells there are multiple inhibitor proteins specific for PP1, such as inhibitor-1 (33Elbrecht A. DiRenzo J. Smith R.G. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13415-13418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibitor-2 (34Park I.K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DARPP-32 (35Hemmings Jr., H.C. Girault J.A. Nairn A.C. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and inhibitor-3 (36Zhang J. Zhang L. Zhao S. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16728-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but multisubunit forms of PP1 seem resistant to the action of these inhibitor proteins. Therefore, it is generally thought that the PP1 catalytic subunit binds the inhibitor proteins after being released from regulatory subunits. Consistent with this concept, evidence indicates that inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 use a KIQF sequence to dock at the RVXF-binding site used by various PP1 regulatory subunits (9Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPI-17 has no sequence resembling RVXF and among the PP1 inhibitor proteins only CPI-17 and its analog PHI-1 inhibit the MLCP holoenzyme (18Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J.

The interaction of MYPT1 docked to PP1C via a KVKF sequence modulates the active center of PP1C to increase the specific activity against phosphomyosin LC20 (6Tanaka J. Ito M. Feng J. Ichikawa K. Hamaguchi T. Nakamura M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16697-16703Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This allosterically activated PP1C in MLCP is recognized and inhibited by phospho-CPI-17. The deleted versions of CPI-17, (1), and (35), define a minimal functional domain that inhibited MLCP about the same as wild type CPI-17, both in biochemical assays (Table I) and in living fibroblasts (Fig. 7). Deletion of C-terminal residues beyond 1–120 greatly decreased the potency of inhibition. For example, the (1–89) mutant inhibited MLCP with the same IC50 as the (1) mutant that was >20-fold higher compared with wild type. This leads us to propose a specific requirement for residues 103–120 in the inhibitory domain. Consistent with this idea, the CPI-17 sequence between 90 and 102 shows only 28% identity to PHI-1, whereas 56% of the residues are identical between positions 103 and 120. The N-terminal 67-residue fragment (1–67) showed little phosphorylation dependence for MLCP inhibition, even though it contained phospho-Thr38 and the neighboring YDRR sequence (see below). The results suggest that residues in the C-terminal region of the inhibitory domain play a role in converting CPI-17 to its high affinity form in response to Thr38 phosphorylation. Thus the two ends of the inhibitory domain (35) are required for phosphorylation-dependent inhibition by CPI-17. Unexpectedly Tyr41 was discovered to be a key residue in the inhibitory domain of CPI-17, and when mutated to Ala it converted CPI-17 from an inhibitor to a substrate of MLCP. This mutation must subtly but significantly alter interaction with the active site of PP1C. Wild-type phospho-CPI-17 was slowly dephosphorylated by MLCP, suggesting that the phospho-Thr38of CPI-17 directly interacts with the active center of MLCP as a substrate and as an inhibitor. Previous kinetic analysis showed mixed inhibition of MLCP by CPI-17 (22Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The thiophospho-Thr38-Y41A protein that should be relatively resistant to hydrolysis still was only a relatively poor inhibitor of MLCP, implying that the Tyr41 side chain has specific functions of its own required for inhibition. We propose that the side chain of Tyr41 contacts a site on PP1C to enhance affinity and also acts to protect the phospho-Thr38 from hydrolysis. We propose the mechanism of CPI-17 inhibition of MLCP is arrested catalysis. Questions remaining are: where does Tyr41 contact the surface of PP1C? How does this interaction perturb the geometry of the catalytic center to prevent hydrolysis of phospho-Thr38? A definitive answer may require solution of the three-dimensional structure of the phospho-CPI-17·PP1C complex. Nonetheless, our data indicate that the residues to the N-terminal side of the phospho-Thr38 (i.e. Lys32 and Arg33) are not critical for inhibition, whereas residues to the C-terminal side of the phosphorylated residue (i.e. Tyr41, Asp42, Arg43, and Arg44) have an important role in producing potent inhibition. The sequence YDRR in CPI-17 is critical for high affinity inhibition and for arresting dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr38. The corresponding sequence in PHI-1 is YDRK. For comparison, the sequence at the C-terminal side of phospho-Ser19 in MLC20 has no charges, but a cluster of hydrophobic residues (19SNVFAMF). The docking site of phospho-MLC20 on PP1C is still obscure, but phospho-CPI-17 may contact PP1C at the same site, because the Y41A protein of CPI-17 was dephosphorylated as well as MLC20. Thus, the difference in sequences following the phosphorylation site between CPI-17 and MLC20 seems to determine whether a phospho-protein is a substrate or an inhibitor. We imagine that the YDRR sequence of CPI-17 stabilizes the phospho-CPI-17·PP1C complex corresponding to an ES (enzyme-substrate) complex, without allowing bond scission. This scenario contrasts with results with inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32, where residues C-terminal to the phospho-Thr are dispensable but residues to the N-terminal side, including the KIQF docking motif, are critical to produce potent inhibition (9Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in structural determinants between PP1 inhibitor proteins may explain how CPI-17, but neither inhibitor-1 nor DARPP-32 can inhibit MLCP. In collaboration with Dr Kainosho's group, 2S. Ohki, M. Eto, E. Kariya, T. Hayano, Y. Hayashi, M. Yazawa, D. L. Brautigan, and M. Kainosho, unpublished data. we recently solved the solution NMR structure of the CPI-17 inhibitory domain defined here. An anti-parallel helix pair is formed between residues 46–63 and 105–115. This would explain how the 103–120 region is important for function, as shown here by deletion analysis. An N-terminal loop including phospho-Thr38 and the adjacent YDRR sequence (residues 41–44) are exposed on the surface for binding at the active site of MLCP. A direct interaction of CPI-17 with the active site, without docking at the RVXF site on PP1C, would enable it to inhibit the MLCP holoenzyme. Just as this CPI-17 structure can recognize and inhibit the exposed face of MLCP, if other PP1 inhibitor proteins recognize PP1C while associated with certain regulatory subunits (37Conner, J. H., Li, S., Hallenbeck, J. M., and Shenolikar, S. (2001) FASEB J. 15, Abstr. 2.2.Google Scholar), they could play a role in selective regulation of other individual PP1 holoenzymes."

Ona V.O. Guégan C. Chen M. Jackson-Lewis V. Andrews L.J. Olszewski A.J. Stieg P.E. Lee J.-P. Przedborski S. Friedlander R.M. Science. 2000; 288: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), it is possible that inhibition of the caspase cascade by S-nitrosylation may protect motor neurons from apoptosis. In fact, many of the biological actions of nitric oxide (NO) may be mediated through S-transnitrosation reactions in which low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols transfer NO to other low molecular weight thiols or to protein-bound free thiols (45Liu Z. Rudd M.A. Freedman J.E. Loscalzo J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1998; 284: 526-534PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that a sufficient level of low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols may be required to maintain an adequate state of S-nitrosylation of proteins involved in apoptosis. Therefore, we are interested in pathways ofS-nitrosothiol degradation that may be associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Recent evidence has suggested that a number of mutations associated with FALS may increase the openness of the active site channel, improving access to the copper active site by larger molecules (5Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that GSNO breakdown would be accelerated by these mutations, inhibiting its protective effect. Here, we show that A4V SOD and G37R SOD catalyze the breakdown of GSNO with greater efficiency than WT SOD under physiological conditions. Our data also suggest that this increased decomposition is influenced by reduction of the copper active site as well as by access of the S-nitrosothiol to the active site. This study identifies an additional, potentially toxic, gain of function of human A4V SOD and suggests thatS-nitrosothiol depletion may contribute to motor neuron death in FALS. All chemicals used were of the highest grade and purity available. Sodium nitrite, glutathione, ascorbic acid, cysteine, and cysteinyl glycine were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was treated with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) prior to use to remove trace metals. SOD was expressed and purified from yeast cells as reported previously (5Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The culture medium was supplemented with 2.5 mmCuSO4 and 0.5 mm ZnSO4. Plasmids for human WT SOD and human A4V SOD, EG-118 yeast transformed to express G37R SOD and non-transformed EG-118 yeast were the kind gifts of J. S. Valentine, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles (5Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of the isolated protein was assayed by gel electrophoresis with silver staining and Western blot. All enzymes were dialyzed against Chelex-treated PBS prior to use. The copper and zinc content of all enzymes were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and 4-pyridylazaresorcinol assay (52Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The zinc content of both mutants was equal to that of WT SOD, while of copper content of both mutants was slightly less than WT SOD. A nondenaturing 4-pyridylazaresorcinol assay was conducted on all enzymes to confirm the absence of adventitiously bound copper and zinc (52Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Crow and co-workers (52Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have established that A4V SOD has a 30-fold less binding affinity for zinc compared with WT SOD. However, it is worth noting that, to facilitate the determination of the binding constants, they incubated WT SOD and A4V SOD, expressed in Escherichia coli, at 37 °C in the presence of 2 m urea to accelerate the metal loss. This led to a half-life of zinc release by A4V SOD of 13.5 h. In the absence of a denaturant, it took more than 2 weeks to establish a zinc loss equilibrium between bovine CuZn-SOD and 2-pyridinecarboxylate at pH 6.25 (52Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Throughout the course of our preparations of WT SOD, A4V SOD, and G37R SOD, the temperature was maintained at 0–4 °C and the pH was maintained at 7.0. The entire procedure was completed within a week, and the samples were stored at −80 °C. This likely kept metal loss from WT SOD and both mutant SODs to a minimum, as reflected in the similar metallations of the enzymes. The identities of WT SOD, A4V SOD, and G37R SOD were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (W. M. Keck Biological Mass Spectrometry Center, University of Virginia) by comparison of the measured mass to the corresponding theoretical mass. For all enzymes tested, the observed mass fell within 4 atomic mass units of the predicted mass, and the difference in mass between WT SOD and each mutant agreed with the corresponding mutation. We isolated 15–70 mg of pure protein from each 10-liter culture. Commercially available GSNO andS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario) was used.S-Nitroso-bovine serum albumin (SNO-BSA),S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (NAcSNO), andS-nitroso-l-cysteine (CysNO) were synthesized according to previously published procedures (53Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2026Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). SNO-BSA was passed through a G-25 (Sigma) column to remove salts prior to use. The concentrations of all prepared S-nitrosothiols were determined as previously reported (14Jourd'heuil D. Laroux F.S. Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 40-µl reaction volumes of glutathione and S-nitrosothiol were incubated with 10 µm SOD in 10 mm PBS at 37 °C. The reductant concentration, S-nitrosothiol concentration, incubation time, and reduction time were varied. For incubations analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the reactions were quenched prior to analysis by adding 40 µl of a solution containing 1 mm neocuproine, 200 µm EDTA, and 20 µm tryptamine (used as an internal standard) dissolved in 80% formic acid (0.2%) and 20% methanol. Incubations analyzed by chemiluminescence were injected at the appropriate time for analysis. Incubations in which the concentration of SNO-BSA was measured by Saville assay (55Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar) sat for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis. All S-nitrosothiols were protected from light. For LC-MS analysis, 5 µl of the incubation sample was injected onto a Waters Symmetry C18 microbore column (1.0 × 150 mm) coupled to a Finnigan LCQ Duo mass spectrometer (Thermoquest Corp., San Jose, CA) fitted with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The samples were eluted isocratically at 50 µl/min using 90% formic acid (0.1%) and 10% methanol. The mass spectrometer was configured to isolate and monitor protonated tryptamine at m/z = 161.0 and protonated GSNO at m/z = 336.9. The peaks were integrated using the Excaliber software package (Thermoquest Corp., San Jose, CA). GSNO concentrations were determined using tryptamine as an internal standard. S-Nitrosothiol content was determined by reductive chemiluminescence as previously described (56Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. Macdonald T.L. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Potential outliers were either accepted or rejected using the Student's t test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Nonlinear regression methods (57Seber G. Wild C. Nonlinear Regression. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 325-340Google Scholar) were used for fitting models. Standard errors for the parameters in the models were computed using the covariance matrix of Zhang et al. (58Zhang J. Peddada S. Rogol A. Rao C.R. Szekeley G. Statistics for the 21st Century, Methodologies for Applications of the Future. Marcel-Dekker, New York2000Google Scholar). F-tests were used for the overall comparisons of control, WT SOD, A4V SOD, and G37R SOD. To compare the relative rates of GSNO decomposition, 7 µmGSNO (41Kluge I. Gutteck-Amsler U. Zollinger M. Do K.Q. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2599-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was incubated with 125 µm glutathione and 10 µm SOD in PBS at pH 7.4. The GSNO content was measured over the course of 80 min by both chemiluminescence (Fig.1A) and LC-MS (Fig.1 B). The samples assayed by chemiluminescence and LC-MS indicate that, compared with WT SOD, A4V SOD, and G37R SOD catabolized about two and three times as much GSNO, respectively, in relation to the no enzyme control after 80 min (p < 0.01,F 2,60 = 4.54, A4V SOD compared with WT SOD, Fig.1A; p < 0.001, F 2,60 = 31.4, G37R SOD compared with WT SOD, Fig. 1 A; p < 0.01, F 2,60 = 4.20, A4V SOD compared with WT SOD, Fig. 1 B; p < 0.001,F 2,60 = 15.8, G37R SOD compared with WT SOD, Fig. 1 B). Chemiluminescence measurements indicated that ∼2 µmGSNO remained after an 80-min incubation with A4V SOD, while analysis by LC-MS suggested the breakdown of all GSNO after 80 min. Given that chemiluminescence measures total S-nitrosothiol content while LC-MS measures only GSNO content, this discrepancy is likely due to the transnitrosation of NO from GSNO to free thiol sites of A4V SOD. The fact that the chemiluminescence signal disappeared upon removal of the protein from the incubation mixture further supported this notion (data not shown). Incubation with G37R SOD resulted in complete GSNO breakdown, as measured by chemiluminescence and LC-MS. The decomposition of GSNO by WT SOD and A4V SOD produced 3.5 µm NO over a 35-min period, as measured by chemiluminescence (data not shown), which is in agreement with the NO production results of Jourd'heuil and co-workers (14Jourd'heuil D. Laroux F.S. Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To ensure that the GSNO signal detected by LC-MS arose from GSNO that was present in the incubation mixture rather than from GSNO that formed on the column by reaction with acidified nitrite and glutathione, we injected 5 µl of a solution containing 5 µm sodium nitrite and 500 µm glutathione. The absence of a detectable signal atm/z = 336.9 indicated that any GSNO detected by LC-MS analysis had been present in the incubation mixture (data not shown). To obtain K m andV max for A4V SOD, G37R SOD, and WT SOD, we measured the initial rates of decomposition of GSNO at different GSNO concentrations in the presence 10 µm SOD and 125 µm glutathione (Fig. 2,A and B). All three enzymes obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A4V SOD and G37R SOD catalyzed GSNO breakdown about three times as efficiently as WT SOD. The kinetic parameters of WT SOD, A4V SOD, and G37R SOD are summarized in TableI. From the above studies, it is evident that both the A4V and G37R mutations enhance the catabolic activities of both enzymes.Table IEnzymek cat/K MK MV maxWT SOD26.8 ± 6.3 M−1 s−138.9 ± 6.6 µm0.63 ± 0.10 µm min−1A4V SOD72.1 ± 7.5 M−1 s−123.2 ± 2.3 µm1.02 ± 0.05 µm min−1G37R SOD87.3 ± 3.7 M−1 s−119.1 ± 3.9 µm1.04 ± 0.02 µm min−1 Open table in a new tab Given that the kinetics of GSNO breakdown of A4V SOD and G37R SOD were similar (p = 0.18, Fig. 2 B), we used A4V SOD as a model system to further characterize the differences in function between ALS mutant SODs and WT SOD. We incubated GSNO in the presence of 0 to 5 mm glutathione and either A4V SOD or WT SOD for 30 min at 37 °C and at pH 7.4 (Fig.3). The maximum GSNO decomposition by A4V SOD and WT SOD occurred between 60 and 250 µmglutathione. The GSNO breakdown curves for A4V SOD and WT SOD were markedly different throughout the range of glutathione concentrations tested (p < 0.005, F 2,77 = 5.9). Within the glutathione concentration range of 60–125 µm, A4V SOD broke down over twice the amount of GSNO as WT SOD after 30 min. Interestingly, maximum GSNO breakdown by A4V SOD occurred at 125 µm glutathione while the maximum GSNO decomposition by WT SOD occurred within a glutathione concentration range of 250–500 µm. Decreased GSNO breakdown occurred at glutathione concentrations greater than 250 µm. A similar decrease in GSNO breakdown by bovine CuZn-SOD at high glutathione concentrations was observed by Jourd'heuil and co-workers (14Jourd'heuil D. Laroux F.S. Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This study indicates that A4V SOD catabolizes GSNO significantly more efficiently than WT SOD throughout the physiologically relevant range of glutathione concentrations. Inorganic copper causes the breakdown ofS-nitrosothiols, particularly in the presence of cysteine or glutathione (56Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. Macdonald T.L. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that GSNO decomposition occurs by reaction of the S-nitrosothiol with copper embedded in the SOD subunit, we incubated 5 µm SNO-BSA with 125 µm glutathione and either 10 µm WT SOD or 10 µm A4V SOD (Fig. 4). Only slight breakdown of the S-N bond of SNO-BSA was observed after incubation with WT SOD or A4V SOD (p = 0.89), while incubation with 125 µm glutathione and 5 µmCuSO4 resulted in complete SNO-BSA breakdown (p < 0.001, when CuSO4 is compared with WT SOD, A4V SOD, and PBS incubations). Collectively, these data suggest that the observed GSNO breakdown occurs by reaction with protein-bound copper rather than free copper released from the enzyme. To compare the efficiencies of WT SOD and A4V SOD in catabolizingS-nitrosothiols of various sizes, we incubated five different S-nitrosothiol substrates with WT SOD or A4V SOD in the presence of 125 µm glutathione for 30 min (Fig.5). The values are represented as a percentage of the no-enzyme control for each S-nitrosothiol. With the exception of NAcSNO, the overall decomposition ofS-nitrosothiols increased with decreasing size. The difference in decomposition between WT SOD and A4V SOD, given as a percentage of the control, ranged from 13 to 22% for all substrates except SNO-BSA (0%). Of note, CysNO, a critical neuroprotective molecule (24Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2304) Google Scholar), was completely depleted in the presence of A4V SOD under physiological conditions. The above data: 1) show that the A4V mutation increases the ability of SOD to catalyze the breakdown of a variety ofS-nitrosothiols and 2) imply that steric considerations and access to the catalytic site may be critical to SOD-mediatedS-nitrosothiol catabolism. Next, we sought to investigate the role of copper reduction in catalyzing S-nitrosothiol breakdown. If the reduction step were an important factor in determining the difference in catalytic rates, then replacing glutathione with a different reductant should alter how WT SOD and A4V SOD break down GSNO. Therefore, we incubated GSNO with either WT SOD or A4V SOD in the presence of various concentrations of ascorbic acid, ranging from 0 to 20 mm (Fig. 6). The experiment was conducted in the same manner as the glutathione concentration dependence experiment described above. The incubation samples were analyzed by chemiluminescence. Although high ascorbic acid concentrations (up to 20 mm) did not inhibit GSNO breakdown, higher concentrations of ascorbic acid than glutathione were required to catalyze the same amount of GSNO degradation. Despite the fact that a region of increased GSNO breakdown by A4V SOD over WT SOD was observed in the ascorbic acid concentration range of 0 to 500 µm, the overall curves are not statistically different (p = 0.11). It has been established that high concentrations of ascorbic acid react with S-nitrosothiols (59Kashiba-Iwatsuki M. Yamaguchi M. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and this is evident from the no-enzyme control in Fig. 6. However, even when we account for this increased breakdown in the WT SOD and A4V SOD curves by subtracting GSNO broken down in the control (data not shown), we find that the catalytic ability of both enzymes are significantly altered when ascorbic acid is substituted for glutathione. Therefore, it is evident that S-nitrosothiol catabolism in the presence of SOD is dependent upon the reductant used. To assess the effect of reduction state of WT SOD and A4V SOD on GSNO catabolism, we pre-reduced WT SOD and A4V"

Substitution of two amino acids in the hydrophobic core of transthyretin lead to a mutant that was very prone to form amyloid. In addition, this mutant has also been shown to induce a toxic response on a neuroblastoma cell line. Renaturation of the transthyretin mutant at low temperature facilitated the isolation of an amyloid-forming intermediate state having the apparent size of a dimer. Increasing the temperature effectively enhanced the rate of interconversion from a partly denatured protein to mature amyloid. Using circular dichroism the β-sheet content of the formed mature fibrils was significantly lower than that of the native fold of transthyretin. Morphology studies using electron microscopy also indicated a temperature-dependent transformation from amorphous aggregates toward mature amyloid fibrils. In addition, 1-anilino-8-naphtalenesulfonate fluorescence studies suggested the loss of the thyroxin-binding channel within both the isolated intermediate and the mature fibrils.

Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Benson M.D. Kluve-Beckerman B. Liepnieks J.J. Murrell J.R. Hanes D. Uemichi T. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 199: 104-113PubMed Google Scholar). Through undefined mechanisms, TTR can misfold into amyloid fibrils. This property is shared with a limited set of 20 other proteins. Although detailed molecular structures are currently unavailable, amyloid fibrils share many structural and morphological characteristics, which are not foreseen in the primary, secondary, or tertiary structure of the precursor proteins (3Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Benson M.D. Tennent G.A. Pepys M.B. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The fact that all amyloid fibrils bind thioflavine-T and Congo red with specific spectroscopic characteristics indicates they have unifying physical properties. All amyloid fibrils consist of protofilaments wrapped around each other (3Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Benson M.D. Tennent G.A. Pepys M.B. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Fraser P.E. Luther P.K. Morris E.P. Sangren O. Lundgren E. Blake C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are all generally about 70–100 Å in diameter without branching points. Interestingly, fibrils are rich in β-structures that are usually arranged perpendicularly to the fibril axis (5Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Familial amyloidosis with polyneuropathy type 1 (FAP1) is a genetic disorder with dominant inheritance but with low penetrance. More than 70 independent point mutations in TTR are known, and most of these are associated with clinical manifestation of amyloidosis (6Ferlini A. Obici L. Manzati E. Biadi O. Tarantino E. Conigli P. Merlini G. D'Alessandro M. Mazzaferro V. Tassinari C.A. Salvi F. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The age of onset in FAP1 patients varies between 20 to 60 years depending on the type of mutation (7Saraiva M.J. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Saraiva M.J. Costa P.P. Birken S. Goodman D.S. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1983; 96: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutations are not a necessary requirement for amyloid formation, because even the wild type TTR can form amyloid fibrils in elderly individuals, a condition known as senile systemic amyloidosis (9Westermark P. Sletten K. Johansson B. Cornwell G.G. d. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2843-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to form amyloid is an inherent property of the polypeptide, with an increased risk of developing the disease being a result of amino acid substitutions. The folding properties of TTR are complex, because a pronounced hysteresis exists between unfolding and refolding after denaturation in chaotropic agents (10Lai Z. McCulloch J. Lashuel H.A. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10230-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that kinetic barriers intervene between the two states. In addition, upon dilution to submicromolar concentrations, wild type TTR dissociates into monomers. Because this monomer has lost its native fold (11Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), individual monomeric units are thermodynamically unstable. Partial denaturation has also been postulated as a prerequisite for amyloid formation, and in the case of TTR experimental evidence has been presented to support this theory (12Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 13McCutchen S.L. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12119-12127Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, the loss of the native fold of TTR upon amyloid formation (13McCutchen S.L. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12119-12127Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarstrom S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) suggests that the folding pathways exhibit more than one stable minimum under physiological conditions. X-ray diffraction methods, used to elucidate the native conformation of TTR, resulted in a well-defined structure showing a homotetramer were each subunit contains eight β-strands denoted A–H, each having a β-barrel sandwich fold. Two monomers associate via hydrogen bonds between the F–F′ and H–H′ interactions, whereas two dimers associate back to back (16Blake C.C. Burridge J.M. Oatley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1978; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A ribbon structure of the dimer is depicted below in Fig. 1. Interestingly, crystal structures of naturally occurring amyloidogenic mutants only reveal subtle changes in the tertiary structure compared with the wild type protein (17Hornberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence supports the theory that a tetramer dissociation precedes amyloid formation. Low pH has been shown to induce TTR amyloid (18Gustavsson A. Engstrom U. Westermark P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and formation also correlates well with a dissociation of the tetramer into monomers (12Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The tetramer dissociation rate of clinically severe mutations is also significantly increased compared with wild type TTR, which suggests a loss of stability in these mutant precursor proteins (13McCutchen S.L. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12119-12127Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Colon W. Lai Z. McCutchen S.L. Miroy G.J. Strang C. Kelly J.W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 199: 228-238PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a dilution of TTRL55P generates monomers that form protofibrils upon concentration (20Quintas A. Vaz D.C. Cardoso I. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27207-27213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Spontaneous formation of a mature amyloid under physiological conditions has not been reported for any of the TTR mutants that result in disease. However, several weeks of incubation of the TTRL55P and TTRV30M mutants at 37 °C gave rise to protofilament structures, which are likely to constitute mature amyloid structures (21Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Lashuel H.A. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17851-17864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, the slow kinetics of amyloid formation by in vivorelevant mutants makes them unsuitable as an experimental model system to search for a biochemical understanding of the amyloid phenomenon and the mechanism behind its neurotoxicity. To overcome this limitation we have developed mutants with a potential to form amyloid far beyond the ability of naturally occurring TTR mutations (14Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarstrom S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The morphology and the tinctorial properties of these fibrils are indistinguishable fromex vivo extracted amyloid. Nevertheless their physical and biochemical properties could differ from those found in nature. In the mutant design we focused on a previously identified mutational hot spot in a flexible area at the edge of the molecule (23Thylen C. Wahlqvist J. Haettner E. Sandgren O. Holmgren G. Lundgren E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Liu K. Cho H.S. Hoyt D.W. Nguyen T.N. Olds P. Kelly J.W. Wemmer D.E. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the highly amyloidogenic variant TTR-D, 2TTRG53S/E54D/L55S. clearly shows a displacement of the D-strand generating a novel β-strand interaction via hydrogen bonding in a new register (26Eneqvist T. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1207-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extend this work, the two valines located at positions 14 and 16 were exchanged for asparagine and glutamate, respectively (TTR-A). 3TTRV14N/V16E. These two valines are normally embedded in a highly hydrophobic environment within the native structure and form hydrogen bonds with the D-strand (16Blake C.C. Burridge J.M. Oatley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1978; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This TTR-A mutant has a very high tendency to aggregate into fibrillar structures. Furthermore, TTR-A amyloid also showed a cytotoxic effect on cultured neuronal cells 4K. Andersson and E. Lundgren, manuscript in preparation.and reacted with monoclonal antibodies with specificity for TTR-amyloid. These initial observations prompted us to characterize the folding pathway for this mutant. The results of this analysis are described herein. Renaturation studies identified a dimeric intermediate having a high content of random coil, which could be transformed into amyloid. The fibrils were soluble and appeared to have significantly less β-sheet structure than the native tetramer fold. Moreover, the hydrophobic channel containing the thyroxin binding site was not preserved in either the dimer or the formed fibril (Fig.1). In addition, the path from an intermediate molecule to mature amyloid were shown to be strictly controlled by temperature, and the morphology proceeded from amorphous aggregates to mature amyloid via the appearance of protofibrils in a condensation process. All chemicals used were of the highest analytical grade and generally purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Stockholm, Sweden), unless otherwise indicated. The pET3a bacterial expression system (Novagen) was the parental derivative in all constructs. Enzymes were purchased from Biolabs In Vitro AB, Stockholm, Sweden. Oligonucleotides were purchased from, Life technology, Uppsala, Sweden. The TTR-A mutant was produced using polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (14Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarstrom S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The flanking primers used contained 5′-NdeI and 3′-BamHI sites, respectively, and the sequence was 5′-GCG GCA TAT GGG ACC TAC GGG CAC CGG T-3′ and 5′-GCG GGA TCC TTA TTC CTT GGG ATT GGT GAC-3′ respectively. This generated a methionine in position −1. For the introduction of an asparagine and a glutamate in positions 14 and 16, respectively, the primer combination of 5′-CTG ATG AAC AAA GAG CTA GAT GCT-3′ and 5′-AGC ATC TAG CAC TTT GTT CAT CAG-3′ was used. The correct DNA sequence was verified using an ABI 377 sequencer. Plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 cells as previously described (14Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarstrom S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature and treated with DNase in the presence of 20 mm Mn2+ ions until the solution was no longer viscous. The TTR-A and TTR-D mutants formed inclusion bodies, which were washed three times with phosphate buffer (0.05m, pH 7.5) and three times with 2 mGdnHCl through repeated centrifugation steps at 20,000 ×g. The pellets were finally dissolved in 8 mGdnHCl, and debris was removed through centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g followed by blocking of the free thiol group in position 10 as described below. The protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 50 mmNaCl. Final purity was ∼95% as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Wild type TTR did not form inclusion bodies; this allowed the supernatant obtained after lysis of the cells to be directly purified using an anion column (MonoQ HR 10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in a NaCl gradient. 95% pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. Earlier unpublished observations for the TTR-A and TTR-D mutant have revealed a high propensity to form an undesirable intermolecular disulfide bridge involving the cysteine at position 10. To overcome this concern the proteins were solubilized in GdnHCl containing 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Addition of iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 50 mm selectively blocked the free thiol. Selectivity was routinely verified by mass spectroscopy. A 120-ml column containing Sephadex G-75 (Superdex G-75 16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to an ÄKTA-FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Umeå) was equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were completely dissolved in 8 m urea and applied onto the column in various concentrations. All gel-filtration analyses were performed at 4 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The following proteins were used as molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; IgG, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; trypsin inhibitor, 20 kDa; myoglobulin, 17 kDa; and hen egg lysozyme, 14.4 kDa. Thyroglobulin and IgG migrated outside the linear range of the column and were therefore not included in the standard curve. The correlation coefficient (r 2) between proteins of known molecular mass and their elution rates was calculated to be 0.9947. A solution of TTR-A protein was prepared in distilled water. A drop of each solution was placed for 30 s on freshly glow-discharged, 300-mesh copper grids coated with carbon. The solution was subsequently rinsed with water and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The grids were air-dried and examined using a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was employed to probe any structural changes arising both from the dissociation of the fibril or the refolding of the denatured molecule. Proteins were analyzed in 0.02 m phosphate-buffer M (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. The final protein concentration was 0.02 mg/ml. Renaturation studies were initiated through a 100-fold dilution of a 2 mg/ml protein solution containing 8m GdnHCl. A 295-nm excitation wavelength, known to be specific for tryptophan, was employed, and fluorescence emission spectra were collected between 307 and 430 nm. The wavelength shift was monitored using the integral midpoint of the curve. All measurements were performed at 20 °C in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. The slit widths for excitation and emission, respectively, were set to 3 and 5 nm. Various concentrations of ANS were prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and filtered through a 22-µm filter. The protein concentration was 1 µm, and the slit widths were set to 5 nm for the excitation and 10 nm for the emission. The temperature was maintained at 4 °C for all measurements The secondary structure was monitored using a Jobyn Yvon-Spex CD-6 spectrophotometer. The protein was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and adjusted to a final concentration of 10 µm. All spectra were recorded from 198 to 260 nm, and the temperature was adjusted in intervals using a waterbath (NESLAB Instruments, Portsmouth) with a 15-min equilibration time between each new spectrum. Expression of TTR-A in E. coli resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies. In addition, during the course of this investigation the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond involving the cysteine at position 10 was observed. In a parallel investigation, this phenomenon has been shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on amyloid maturation. 5A. Olofsson and E. Lundgren, manuscript in preparation. (Therefore, to avoid putative misinterpretation of the results the thiol group of cysteine 10 was blocked by iodoacetamide in all TTR variants used in this study.) To follow the amyloid formation pathway of TTR-A, we wanted to use a non-aggregated form of the protein from which fibril formation could be induced. Previously it was reported (21Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that the kinetics of TTR aggregation is markedly slowed by low temperature. Therefore, purified protein was dissolved in 8 m urea and loaded onto a gel filtration column previously equilibrated with a buffer of 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and held at 4 °C. Gel filtration effectively removed the urea, and the protein eluted as a rather broad peak. The main fraction of the elution volume corresponding to approximately half of the TTR tetramer size and was denoted TTR-ADIMER (Fig.2A). Protein molecular masses were determined using a standard curve based on a range of globular proteins defined under “Material and Methods.” At 4 °C, the TTR-ADIMER remained stable for 24 h with no significant aggregation as monitored by re-injection on the column (Fig. 2 C). However, we subsequently noted a temperature-dependent aggregation kinetics. Following a brief incubation of the TTR-ADIMER at 37 °C corresponding to 20 min, the protein rapidly aggregated to a molecular mass above 600 kDa (Fig. 2 D). Aggregation was essentially irreversible, because reloaded aggregated material did not dissociate to low molecular masses. From this finding, we interpret that a high free energy barrier exists between the aggregated state and its free constituents under the experimental conditions used. In addition, serial dilution of the TTR-A followed by elution on the size exclusion column revealed a concentration-dependent effect on the aggregation state. The upper limit was set by aggregation, and we could only isolate the TTR-ADIMER at the highest concentration, ∼20 µm. Interestingly, dissociation to a monomeric species could be observed at sub-micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2 B). To investigate whether or not the dimeric species was a general phenomenon concerning highly amyloidogenic TTR mutants, we also analyzed the previously described TTR-D 2TTRG53S/E54D/L55S. (14Goldsteins G. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Dacklin I. Edvinsson A. Baranov V. Sandgren O. Thylen C. Hammarstrom S. Lundgren E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Upon refolding of TTR-D on the size exclusion column, this molecule showed comparable behavior as observed for TTR-A, in particular, a dominant peak having the size of a TTR dimer around 30 kDa, which was denoted TTR-DDIMER (data not shown). The dimeric peaks from refolding of both TTR-A and TTR-D showed a broadening, indicating a range of conformations with different exclusion volumes. From our analysis of serial dilutions at 4 °C we concluded that no rapid equilibrium between the dimeric and the monomeric species exists, because the molecular mass remained constant regardless of the protein concentration. The difference in molecular mass shown in Fig. 2 B is simply just an effect of overlapping peaks. Examination of wild type TTR refolding on a size-exclusion column gave rise to three defined peaks represented by molecular masses corresponding to a tetramer, a dimer, and a monomer. The tetramer had an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa, which is in good agreement with its theoretical value. Under these conditions the dimer could only be observed and isolated in concentrations around 2 µm and showed a significant overlap with a monomeric species. This fact rendered it less suitable for further characterization. We noted that refolding at various protein concentrations significantly altered the proportions of each peak. In Fig. 2 E a serial dilution of wild type TTR, where the intensity of the peak has been normalized against the monomeric species, is shown. Upon protein dilution, the tetrameric and dimeric species notably diminished in favor of a monomer. This is in accordance with thermodynamic laws and reflects the associative forces between the molecules. Because all peaks could be seen simultaneously and no major shifts in the molecular mass were observed we conclude that only slow exchange (hours) exists between the different species under these conditions. This correlates with the results of refolding experiments involving both TTR-A and TTR-D. To elucidate structural information and to investigate the overall stability of the highly amyloidogenic mutants, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was employed during unfolding and refolding. TTR contains two tryptophans at positions 41 and 79. Denaturation curves of wild type TTR showed a red shift from 342 to 358 nm when the GdnHCl concentration was increased from 0 to 8m. The main transition was observed between 6 and 7m (Fig. 3B), indicating that one or both of the tryptophans became more solvent-exposed upon unfolding. At the same time, fluorescence intensity was also quenched to 50%, which also supports the presence of a more solvent-exposed surface (data not shown). Upon refolding of wild type TTR by reducing the initial 8 m of urea, the main transition occurred around 1 m GdnHCl (Fig. 3 A). This indicated a pronounced hysteresis between unfolding and refolding. This effect has been described, and refolding has been correlated with a re-association of the tetramer (10Lai Z. McCulloch J. Lashuel H.A. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10230-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The aggregated state of TTR-A and TTR-D showed a midpoint of the fluorescence spectra corresponding to 346 and 348 nm, respectively. These values are between the folded tetramer and unfolded protein. This implies that under non-denaturing conditions the molecules are more unfolded than native TTR. To investigate the relative stability of the TTR variants, a refolding assay against various concentrations of GdnHCl was performed. The results showed that TTR-A had a midpoint of renaturation corresponding to 0.5 m GdnHCl (Fig. 3 A), whereas TTR-D was slightly more stable, having a midpoint of refolding corresponding to 0.7 m GdnHCl. Denaturation of previously formed aggregates suggested that multiple intermolecular forces are likely to stabilize the molecule, because TTR-A had a midpoint of denaturation corresponding to 0.7 m. The hysteresis was more pronounced with TTR-D, which had a midpoint of denaturation corresponding to 2m (Fig. 3 B). It is difficult to conclude whether the unfolding also correlates with a dissociation of the formed aggregates. We observed high molecular aggregates that did not dissociate through dilution under physiological conditions. To investigate whether or not this phenomenon was also associated with a change in fold, the secondary structure was monitored using CD spectroscopy. TTR-ADIMER was subjected to a temperature scan ranging from 5 to 95 °C (Fig.4B). The CD spectra showed a significant shift from a partially structured molecule toward a molecule with a higher β-sheet content (Fig. 4 A) that reached a maximum between 55 and 60 °C (Fig. 4 B). However, at temperatures above 60 °C, a loss of β-sheet structure was seen (Fig. 4 B), and at 95 °C a high content of random coil was obtained (data not shown). Nevertheless, the highest observed β-sheet content was significantly lower than that of the native fold of wild type TTR (Fig. 4 A). We used a reversed scan between 55 and 5 °C to verify that the acquisition of β-structure was essentially irreversible (Fig. 4 B). Significantly, TTR-D displayed the same behavior whereas native wild type TTR was essentially unaffected by temperature shifts between 5 and 60 °C (data not shown). This was expected, because the native tetramer does not melt until temperatures are near the boiling point (27Shnyrov V.L. Villar E. Zhadan G.G. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Quintas A. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 88: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fluorescent dye ANS was used to identify solvent-exposed hydrophobic areas. Because these are more prevalent within partly denatured structures, the amount of bound ANS indicates the degree of unfolding. The local environment around the ANS molecule contributes to its fluorescent properties, and a hydrophobic localization gives a higher intensity and displays a blue shift compared with a solvent-exposed surface-bound molecule. In addition, it is known that two ANS molecules associate tightly to the thyroxin T4 binding site, located in the hydrophobic core of the native TTR tetramer, resulting in a strong fluorescence intensity (28Nilsson S.F. Rask L. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8554-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon mixing a constant amount of protein with various concentrations of ANS, wild type TTR gave a strong fluorescence intensity even at a low ANS/monomer ratio in clear agreement with its described occupancy of the T4 binding channel (Fig.5A). At saturation only seven ANS molecules/monomer were found, indicative of a well folded molecule (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the TTR-ADIMER exhibited a low fluorescence intensity, and an approximate linear relationship between ANS concentration and intensity was observed (Fig.5 A). Equilibrium was obtained at a ratio of ∼50 ANS per monomer (Fig. 5 A). In addition, the spectrum showed a red shift of about 10 nm compared with wild type TTR (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, the aggregated state of TTR-A obtained a saturation of ANS binding already at 20 ANS molecules/monomer (Fig. 5 A) without any detectable spectral shift (Fig. 5 B). ANS binding to wild type TTR was not affected by a preceding incubation at 55 °C (data not shown). Taken together these data support the notion that the TTR-ADIMER is highly unstructured, and the fold becomes more defined once the protein aggregates. Moreover, it seems that the hydrophobic channel is not preserved or inaccessible to ANS within the fibril. Spectroscopic analysis of the aggregates obtained from the TTR-A mutant gave a positive signal using both Congo red and thioflavine-T (data not shown). Using electron microscopy, a marked difference was observed between aggregates obtained after incubation at different temperatures. After 30 min in 25 °C only amorphous aggregates could be observed (Fig.6A). Furthermore, prolonged incubation for 24"

However, in the presence of the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC), binding of 14-3-3 proteins occurs independently of phosphorylation but still involves the YTV motif. Since FC exclusively binds to the complex consisting of both 14-3-3 homologs and the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase, the toxin was used as a tool to reveal potential protein-protein interaction sites in the enzyme's C terminus. We performed in vitro interaction studies by applying various C-terminal parts of the H+-ATPase PMA2 from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion peptides in E. coli. Interestingly, the PMA2 region encompassing residues 905–922 is implicated in FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs. Recently, part of this region has been shown to contribute to the autoinhibitory action of the PMA2 C terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids localized within this region resulted in a drastic decrease in FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins. Furthermore, by expressing the corresponding mutants of PMA2 in yeast, we observed a reduced capability of the mutant enzymes to functionally replace the endogenous H+-ATPase. Notably, the decreased activity of the mutant enzymes was accompanied by a weakened binding of yeast 14-3-3 homologs to the plasma membrane of transformed cells. Taken together, our results suggest that a section of the autoinhibitory C-terminal PMA2 region contributes to binding of activatory 14-3-3 proteins in the absence of FC.

Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the enzyme is known to act as an autoinhibitor; proteolytic removal or truncation of the C-terminal domain results in an increase in H+-ATPase activity (2Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20470-20475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been obtained for the presence of individual regulatory regions within the C terminus of both the H+-ATPase AHA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana and PMA2 from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. By use of alanine-scanning mutagenesis, residues of AHA2 were identified that when altered gave rise to an activated enzyme after heterologous expression in yeast. These residues were concentrated into a region of the N-terminal half (region I) as well as the C-terminal half (region II) of the AHA2 C terminus (Ref. 4Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). By analyzing various chimeric proteins in which the C terminus of PMA2 (residues 851–956, see Fig. 1) was progressively substituted by the corresponding sequence from PMA4, the autoinhibitory region of PMA2 was localized to a region between residues 851 and 915 in which three individual sections could be identified (5, see Fig. 1). The authors concluded that the inhibitory effect and, therefore, the region presumably interacting with the rest of the enzyme seem to be spread over a large part of the PMA2 C terminus (5Dambly S. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7017-7022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consequently, solely the extreme C-terminal residues of PMA2 (residues 916–956, see Fig. 1) appear to be uninvolved in autoregulation. The fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC)1 activates the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase by a process involving the C-terminal domain of the pump (6Johansson F. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Lanfermeijer F.C. Prins H.B.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To date it is well established that FC binds to and subsequently stabilizes a complex consisting of the enzyme's C terminus and 14-3-3 proteins (8Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T.

Members of the eukaryotic 14-3-3 family are highly conserved hydrophilic proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of diverse physiological processes by protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 11Aitken A.

Binding of 14-3-3 homologs to their target proteins appears to occur in a sequence-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner (binding motif RSXpSXP (Ref. 14Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M.

However, a novel binding site for 14-3-3 proteins within the C-terminal domain of the plant H+-ATPase has been identified that does not resemble any other 14-3-3 binding motif: 14-3-3 homologs bind to the conserved extreme C-terminal tripeptide of the enzyme (amino acids YTV), and this interaction requires phosphorylation of the penultimate threoninein vivo (YpTV; Refs. 16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, FC circumvents the need for this phosphorylation and promotes 14-3-3 binding to the unphosphorylated C-terminal domain of the H+-pump. Since binding of FC requires the 14-3-3-C terminus (H+-ATPase) complex, it is not surprising that FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs to the unphosphorylated enzyme still involves the YTV motif (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the FC binding site is identical to the part of the H+-ATPase that contributes to the 14-3-3 binding site. Furthermore, binding of activatory 14-3-3 proteins and FC seems to occur in a region that is uninvolved in autoregulation, i.e.the enzyme's extreme C-terminal end. By performing in vitro interaction studies using C-terminal residues of the N. plumbaginifolia H+-ATPase PMA2 expressed as GST fusion peptides in Escherichia coli, we identified a region within the enzyme's C terminus (comprising amino acids 905–922), which in addition to the YTV motif is required for the generation of a FC binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis point to the importance of this region for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs. Interestingly, the region overlaps with both the autoinhibitory region II identified in AHA2 (4Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the autoinhibitory section encompassing residues 895–915 in PMA2 (Ref. 5Dambly S. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7017-7022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Notably, by expressing wild-type and mutant forms of PMA2 in yeast, we provide evidence for the relevance of this C-terminal H+-ATPase region with respect to 14-3-3 binding independent of FC. E. coli was grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1.6% (w/v) tryptone, and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl) containing 100 µg ml−1 ampicillin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were grown at 30 °C either in rich medium, containing 2% (w/v) glucose or galactose, 2% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 20 mmKH2PO4, or in minimal medium, containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 20 mm KH2PO4supplemented with all amino acids and nucleotides required for growth. The medium pH was adjusted to 6.5 (KOH) or another pH when indicated.

Two mg of native protein was purified from 100 ml of transformed bacteria using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For expression of the N. plumbaginifoliaH+-ATPase C-terminal region fused to GST in E. coli M15, DNA fragments encoding peptides of different length (Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

PCR products and products of mutagenesis were verified by sequencing and subsequently cloned into the GST expression vector pGEX-4T-1. When indicated GST fusion proteins were purified from transformed bacteria using GSH-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Protein blotting onto nitrocellulose was done electrophoretically overnight (4 °C, 64 mA) or within 2 h at room temperature (200 mA) as described by Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J.

Immunodetection of GST (antiserum; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed standard procedures; the secondary antibody was conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Total protein derived from E. coli expressing GST-fused C-terminal PMA2 peptides or purified GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 2% (w/v) milk powder in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2(Tris-buffered saline). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified (His)6-tagged T14-3c isoform of N. tabacum diluted to 20 µg ml−1(corresponding to 0.7 µm 14-3-3 monomer) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgSO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, immunodetection of (His)6-tagged 14-3-3 was performed by applying the anti-RGS(His)6antibody (Qiagen; monoclonal antibody raised against the RGS(His)6 epitope encoded by the pQE vector) in combination with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and the enzyme substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.

The yeast YAK2 carries the yeast H+-ATPase pma1 gene under the control of the galactose-dependent GAL1 promoter on a centromeric plasmid and is deleted of its endogenous H+-ATPase genes. cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal peptides of the N. plumbaginifolia H+-ATPase PMA2 and carrying a specific mutation (see above) were exchanged for the wild-type DNA fragment of 2µp(PMA1)pma2. YAK2 was transformed with 2µp(PMA1)pma2 or the plasmids carrying the mutated PMA2. The resulting yeast strains were used to test the ability of wild-type or mutant PMA2 to functionally replace the yeast H+-ATPase on medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Yeast cells were first grown in 200 ml of rich medium containing 2% (w/v) galactose until their A 600 reached ∼0.6. After sedimentation and washing, the cells were used to inoculate 600 ml of rich medium containing 2% glucose (to stop expression of PMA1). When the A 600 reached ∼0.6, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold water. Membrane preparation followed the procedure described by Svennelidet al. (17Svennelid F. Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottmann C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were collected by centrifugation; resuspended in 20% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmMgSO4; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80 °C. When indicated, a solution of KCl and polyoxyethylene 8-myristyl ether (C14E8) was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 m KCl and a detergent:protein ratio of 1:5 (w/w); the sample was thoroughly mixed for 10 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. To investigate which part(s) of the N. plumbaginifoliaH+-ATPase PMA2 contribute(s) to the phosphorylation-independent, FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins, truncated forms of the C terminus of PMA2 were expressed as GST fusion peptides in E. coli (Fig.1). Bacterial proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the immobilized polypeptides were allowed to interact with purified (His)6-tagged 14-3-3 protein in the presence of FC. Protein-protein interactions were visualized by use of an antibody raised against the (His)6 epitope (14-3-3 protein overlay). To date it is well established that the extreme C-terminal tripeptide of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase (YTV) is essential for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs to the enzyme's regulatory domain (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Svennelid F. Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottmann C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the essential YTV is present in the C-terminal 28, 31, or 34 PMA2 residues, binding of FC and 14-3-3 could not be observed (GST+28aa, GST+31aa, and GST+34aa, corresponding to aa 929–956, 926–956, and 923–956, respectively; Figs. 1 and 2). The data indicate that the binding site for FC and 14-3-3 on PMA2 is complex and involves structural features other than the tripeptide motif. As evident from the analysis of several other C-terminal peptides of PMA2, binding of 14-3-3 proteins in the presence of FC is affected by the length of the PMA2 peptide (Figs. 1 and 2). As already mentioned, interaction could not be detected when the C terminus of PMA2 was truncated to less than 35 amino acid residues (aa 923–956, Fig.2). However, by lengthening the C-terminal fragment, the FC-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is enhanced in two steps. A weak, but significant interaction could be observed by applying the C-terminal 37–50 residues (corresponding to aa 920–956 and 907–956, respectively; Fig.2). Interestingly, a remarkable increase in FC-dependent 14-3-3 binding occurred when the PMA2 peptide consisting of the C-terminal 50 residues was extended by two additional amino acids, yielding GST+52aa (Fig. 2). No further increase was found by lengthening the C-terminal peptide up to 98 residues (Fig. 2, GST+52aa, corresponding to aa 905–956, through GST+98aa, corresponding to aa 859–956). Interestingly, the PMA2 region in which truncations strongly modulate the interaction (the C-terminal 35–52 amino acids, corresponding to aa 905–922) overlaps with both the autoinhibitory region II identified in AHA2 (4Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the autoinhibitory section comprising residues 895–915 in PMA2 (Ref. 5Dambly S. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7017-7022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Furthermore, this region has a high probability of forming an amphipathic α-helix, suggesting that this predicted secondary structure may be important with respect to FC-dependent 14-3-3 binding. To clarify the relevance of the PMA2 region encompassing residues 905–922 for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs, we investigated the effect of individual mutations. Four negatively charged residues were changed into alanine (E922A, E916A, E915A, and E909A; see Fig. 1). Furthermore, we changed an alanine residue into proline (A917P), the latter known to affect the bending of helices and to account for a kink in helices. GST fusion peptides comprising the C-terminal 66 amino acids of PMA2 (GST+66aa, corresponding to aa 891–956) and carrying the indicated mutations were expressed in E. coli and subsequently analyzed by means of the 14-3-3 protein overlay assay (Fig. 3). Although the exchange of Glu-915 does not show an effect, FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs to all the other mutants (GST+66aa comprising E922A, E916A, E909A, or A917P) was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type (GST+66aa, Fig. 3). The data indicate that the amino acids Glu-922, Glu-916, Glu-909, and Ala-917 are of particular importance for binding of FC and 14-3-3 to PMA2. We chose Glu-922 and Ala-917 for a more detailed analysis. The negatively charged residue Glu-922 was changed into aspartic acid, asparagine, or lysine (E922D, E922N, E922K, respectively) whereas valine, lysine and glycine were individually substituted for Ala-917 (A917V, A917K, A917G). As indicated by the overlay assay, the charge in position 922 is an important prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding in the presence of FC. In particular, a change from a negatively charged amino acid (Glu, Asp) to an uncharged (Asn) or positively charged (Lys) residue is accompanied by a gradual decrease in interaction (Fig. 3). With respect to position 917, the properties of nonpolar amino acids seem to be important; substitution of the alanine by lysine (A917K) results in a drastic decrease in FC-dependent 14-3-3 binding, whereas the nonpolar residue valine (A917V) shows no effect (Fig. 3). However, changing Ala-917 into proline or glycine reduced the interaction significantly, although these two amino acids are likewise nonpolar. Notably, both of them are known to modify the structure of helices, indicating that structural integrity or charge distribution of an amphipathic α-helix may be an important prerequisite for the generation of a FC binding site. The data reported so far provide evidence for the contribution of a second region within the C-terminal domain of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase to the generation of a FC binding site; in addition to the extreme C-terminal end (Refs. 16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar; YTV, see Fig. 1), a region that is involved in autoinhibition and which possibly forms a helix appears to be essential (Figs. 2 and 3). Since the FC binding site is composed of both the C terminus of the H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins (8Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G.

Planta. 1999; 207: 480-482Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the question arises whether the PMA2 regions contributing to the FC binding site are identical to those constituting the 14-3-3 binding site in vivo. Although the contribution of the three C-terminal H+-ATPase residues YTV to the 14-3-3 binding site has been shown unambiguously (YpTV; Refs. 16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T.

Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), nothing is known with respect to the second region. Thus, we investigated the effect of the mutations E922A, A917P, E916A, E915A, as well as E909A in the N. plumbaginifolia gene pma2 after heterologous expression in the S. cerevisiae strain YAK2. The two endogenous H+-ATPase genes are deleted from YAK2, and its survival on galactose medium is made possible by the presence of the yeast H+-ATPase gene pma1 under the control of a galactose-dependent promoter. In contrast, the plant H+-ATPase PMA2 gene is constitutively expressed (23de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and as a consequence, plant H+-ATPases can be analyzed in this strain for their ability to functionally replace the yeast enzyme on glucose medium. The wild-type plant PMA2 is able to sustain yeast growth provided that the external pH was kept above pH 5.0 (5, 23, Fig.4). Since the heterologously expressed PMA2 forms a complex with yeast 14-3-3 proteins (9Piotrowski M. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Oecking C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to activate the plant H+-ATPase (18Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) it was suggested that the ability of the plant enzyme to form such a complex explains why it is able to functionally replace the endogenous H+-ATPase. Furthermore, in yeast this interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of the C-terminal threonine residue of the plant H+-ATPase (YpTV),i.e. the domain that already has been identified as 14-3-3 binding site (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

Hence, the analysis of the mutants mentioned above may provide evidence for the physiological relevance of the second region with respect to 14-3-3 binding in vivo(independent of FC). As shown in Fig. 4, YAK2 cells expressing the PMA2 mutants were still able to grow on glucose medium. This was expected since the ability of the plant enzyme to sustain yeast growth is mainly dependent on the phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine residue (YpTV, Refs.16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S.

Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the following PMA2 mutants conferred a significant reduction of yeast growth compared with the wild-type both at pH 5.5 and pH 6.5: PMA2-E922A, PMA2-A917P, PMA2-E916A, as well as PMA2-E909A. Thus, only the growth of yeast cells expressing the PMA2-E915A mutant was unaffected. Notably, there is a correlation between the growth phenotype of transgenic yeast (Fig. 4) and the FC-dependent 14-3-3 binding to the corresponding mutants (Fig. 3). The amount of the mutated PMA2 in yeast plasma membranes was not reduced compared with the wild-type PMA2, indicating that there is no correlation between expression level and the growth phenotype of transgenic yeast cells (Fig. 5,A and B). Hence the question arises whether the impaired capability of the PMA2 mutants to allow yeast growth in the absence of the endogenous H+-ATPase is the result of a decreased phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine in vivo (YpTV). As a consequence, binding of yeast 14-3-3 homologs would not occur, resulting in a less active plant H+-ATPase. Since binding of 14-3-3 proteins in the absence of FC is a direct measure of the amount of phosphorylated H+-ATPase (17Svennelid F. Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottmann C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar), we performed an overlay assay by applying the yeast plasma membranes. As shown in Fig. 5 C, in vitro 14-3-3 binding to the PMA2 mutants in the absence of FC was unchanged compared with the wild-type, indicating that a modified phosphorylation could not be the reason for the growth phenotype of transgenic yeast. Furthermore, the amount of plasma membrane-associated yeast 14-3-3 homologs was not reduced (Fig.6). Nevertheless, by treating the membranes with high salt/low detergent, we observed a significant difference regarding the strength of association. In plasma membranes of yeast expressing the wild-type PMA2 or the PMA2-E915A mutant binding of 14-3-3s is extremely tight, i.e.dissociation during high salt/low detergent treatment does not occur (Fig. 6). This observation is in agreement with the fact that the wild-type PMA2·14-3-3 complex is stable in high salt/low detergent (18Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of 14-3-3 protein was liberated from plasma membranes derived from yeast cells expressing the other PMA2 mutants (E922A, A917P, E916A, E909A, Fig. 6). Taken together, there is a clear correlation between the growth phenotype of transgenic yeast cells and the stability of the PMA2· 14-3-3 complex, implicating that the region encompassing residues 905–922 is important for 14-3-3 binding in vivo.Figure 6High salt/low detergent treatment of plasma membrane proteins of yeast cells expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant PMA2. Purified plasma membranes (5 µg, left panel) prepared from YAK2 transformed with PMA2 or the mutants PMA2-E922A, PMA2-A917P, PMA2-E916A, PMA2-E915A, and PMA2-E909A were treated with high salt/low detergent (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subsequently centrifuged. The supernatant (middle panel, containing proteins that were released from the plasma membrane) as well as the corresponding pellet (right panel, containing proteins that were tightly bound to the plasma membrane) were electrophoretically separated and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Immunodetection of the plant H+-ATPase was done with the upper part of the nitrocellulose, whereas the lower part was used for immunodetection of yeast 14-3-3 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The H+-ATPase is the major ion pump of the plant plasma membrane and is required for nutrient uptake and plant growth (1Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The phytotoxin fusicoccin has been used as a tool to study regulatory mechanisms underlying activation of this enzyme. Activation is achieved by a direct interaction of 14-3-3 homologs with the C terminus of the H+-pump, resulting in a conformational change that abolishes the autoinhibitory action of the enzyme's C-terminal domain. FC binds to this complex of 14-3-3 protein and H+-ATPase C terminus, and, as a consequence, the complex is stabilized in an irreversible manner (8Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T.

Recently, the conserved C-terminal tripeptide of the H+-ATPase (YTV) has been identified as a binding motif for 14-3-3 proteins (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B.

Phosphorylation of the threonine (YpTV) is required for 14-3-3 binding in the absence of FC, whereas binding of 14-3-3 occurs independently of phosphorylation in the presence of FC. Nevertheless, the YTV motif still is necessary for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs to the unphosphorylated C terminus of the H+-ATPase; hence, this motif contributes to both the FC and the 14-3-3 binding site (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have identified an additional region within the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase PMA2 from N. plumbaginifolia (residues 905–922) that is required for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs. This conclusion is based on the following lines of evidence. (i) The YTV motif by itself is insufficient to allow binding of 14-3-3 homologs in the presence of FC, as evident from the lack of binding to the C-terminal residues 923–956, comprising the YTV sequence (GST+34aa, Fig. 2). (ii) With increasing length of the C-terminal sequence, there is an increase in the strength of FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs; maximal binding is achieved as soon as the C-terminal 52 residues (aa 905–956) are completely present (Fig. 2). (iii) Individual site-directed mutations located within the region encompassing residues 905–922 (E922A, A917P, E916A, E909A) result in a drastic decrease in FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 3). The identification of an additional region within the C terminus of the H+-ATPase that contributes to the FC binding site is in agreement with data obtained by Fuglsang et al. (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). FC is unable to promote binding of 14-3-3 protein to an unphosphorylated short peptide of the C terminus of the H+-ATPase AHA2 (aa 933–948), whereas this is not a problem with a longer peptide (aa 851–948). Consequently, it was suggested by the authors that the binding site for FC might be more complex than just the three C-terminal amino acids (16Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PMA2 peptide, which was purified in a complex with FC and yeast 14-3-3 homologs, consists of the C-terminal 57 residues (18Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This complex was obtained after trypsin treatment. Since four additional trypsin sites are present in the PMA2 peptide, binding of FC and 14-3-3 proteins appears to prevent access of the protease. This result confirms our data showing that at least the 52 C-terminal residues of PMA2 are required for efficient binding of FC and 14-3-3 (Fig. 2). Because the FC “receptor” is known as 14-3-3-C terminus (H+-ATPase) complex (8Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G.

Planta. 1999; 207: 480-482Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the region identified to be essential for FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 homologs may contribute to FC-independent (phosphorylation-dependent) 14-3-3 binding, too. In order to test this hypothesis, we expressed the PMA2 mutants (E922A, A917P, E916A, E915A, E909A) in the yeast strain YAK2. The wild-type PMA2 is able to functionally replace the endogenous H+-ATPase. A significant portion of the 14-3-3 protein associated with the plasma membrane of the corresponding transgenic yeast cells is attached to the C terminus of the plant H+-ATPase. The complex represents an activated state of the plant H+-ATPase. Furthermore, it is characterized by an extreme stability (9Piotrowski M. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Oecking C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); thus, dissociation during high salt/low detergent treatment does not occur (18, Fig. 6). The same applies to plasma membranes derived from yeast cells expressing the PMA2-E915A mutant (Fig. 6). Remarkably, this mutant conferred a growth phenotype comparable to the wild-type plant H+-ATPase (Fig. 4) and, in addition, showed no difference in FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins compared with the wild type (Fig. 3). In contrast, yeast expressing the PMA2 mutants E922A, A917P, E916A, or E909A (each mutation resulting in a drastic decrease in FC-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins, Fig. 3) grew only slowly on glucose medium, suggesting these mutant enzymes to be less active than the wild-type PMA2 (Fig. 4). However, the modified growth phenotype was due neither to changes in the expression level of the plant H+-ATPase (Fig. 5 B) nor to changes in the amount of phosphorylated plant H+-ATPase (Fig. 5 C). Rather, there was a clear correlation between the reduced growth of transgenic yeast and the reduced strength of 14-3-3 binding to the plasma membrane; most of the 14-3-3 protein was released from plasma membranes of the corresponding yeast cells by high salt/low detergent treatment (Fig.6). Taken together, the results indicate that the individual modifications result in a reduced stability of the PMA2·14-3-3 complex in vivo. Interestingly, the PMA2 region identified to be essential for 14-3-3 binding is known to be involved in autoinhibition (5Dambly S. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7017-7022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of activatory 14-3-3 proteins is not restricted to a PMA2 region that is uninvolved in autoregulation. Rather, a specific autoinhibitory section contributes to the 14-3-3 binding site in vivo. Hence, the PMA2 region presumably interacting with the 14-3-3 dimer seems to be spread over a large part of the C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1). Alternatively, the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase could harbor two separate and distinct binding sites for regulatory 14-3-3 proteins, both of which are situated in the C terminus and each of which is able to bind within the amphipathic groove of a 14-3-3 monomer. However, a complete structural analysis of the complex is required in order to distinguish between these possibilities as well as to analyze the formation of an amphipathic α-helix within the region comprising the PMA2 residues 905–922.

The intermediacy of free radicals in these processes has been directly demonstrated only during the interaction of peroxynitrite with erythrocytes, a particular cell type, due to its high hemoglobin content. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of peroxynitrite to a macrophage cell line (J774) led to the production of glutathionyl and protein-tyrosyl radicals. The glutathionyl radical was characterized by EPR spin-trapping experiments with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. Protein-tyrosyl radical formation was suggested by direct EPR spectroscopy and confirmed by EPR spin-trapping experiments with 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid and Western blot analysis of nitrated proteins in treated macrophages. Time dependence studies of free radical formation indicate that intracellular glutathione and unidentified proteins are the initial peroxynitrite targets in macrophages and that their derived radicals trigger radical chain reactions.

The intermediacy of free radicals in these processes has been directly demonstrated only during the interaction of peroxynitrite with red blood cells, a particular cell type, because of its high hemoglobin content (31Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a long lived hemoglobin-tyrosyl radical has been detected by EPR in incubations of peroxynitrite with erythrocytes (31Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Free radical formation during the interaction of peroxynitrite with other cell types has not been examined. Here, we demonstrate that peroxynitrite addition to a macrophage cell line (J774) led to the EPR detection of glutathionyl and protein-tyrosyl radicals. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Fisher and were analytical grade or better. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from sodium nitrite (0.6 m) and hydrogen peroxide (0.65 m) in a quenched-flow reactor. To eliminate excess hydrogen peroxide, the peroxynitrite solution was treated with manganese dioxide. Synthesized peroxynitrite contained low levels of contaminating hydrogen peroxide (<1%) and nitrite (10–30%) that were determined as previously described (32Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) by the titanyl method and by absorbance measurements at 354 nm (ε = 24.6m−1·cm−1), respectively. The concentration of peroxynitrite stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.67 × 103m−1·cm−1 (32Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Concentrations of CO2 were calculated from the added HCO3− concentrations by using pK a = 6.4 (15Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Da C. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Buffers were pretreated with Chelex-100 to remove contaminant metal ions. All solutions were prepared with distilled water purified with a Millipore Milli-Q system. The mouse macrophage cell line J774 (33Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Nature. 1975; 257: 393-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 44 mm NaHCO3, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 25 µg/ml ampicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Immediately before the experiments, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended (1 × 108 cells/ml) in modified PBS (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 50 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.39 mm MgCl2, and 0.9 mm CaCl2) and then treated with spin traps and peroxynitrite at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). In some experiments, cell cultures were pretreated for 24 h with 100 µm BSO before being collected (34Romão P.R. Fonseca S.G. Hothersall J.S. Noronha-Dutra A.A. Ferreira S.H. Cunha F.Q. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions in modified PBS (1 × 108 cells/ml) were treated with peroxynitrite and corresponding controls. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C), they were diluted 1:1 (v/v) with a trypan blue solution, and cell viability was determined from hemocytometer counts after nucleus staining. The percentage of lysed cells was determined by comparing the total number of viable plus nonviable cells with the cell number in the initial suspension. Total soluble thiol (protein and nonprotein) was measured (35Soszynski M. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1291: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to prevent protein precipitation at low pH values (36Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), which produces nitric oxide from nitrite leading to thiol depletion as confirmed by control experiments. Acid precipitation was used only to determine total nonprotein thiol (mostly GSH) in untreated cell suspensions. Detergents were not used because of the high cell density and the difficulties in solubilizing cell nuclei. Cell suspensions before and 10 min after treatment with peroxynitrite were mixed 1:2:1 (v/v/v) with 1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 5 mm DTNB. After 20 min, the suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Total soluble thiol in the supernatant was determined by absorbance measurements at 412 nm (ε = 13.6 × 103m−1·cm−1) (35Soszynski M. Bartosz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1291: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) on a Bruker ER 200 D-SRC upgraded to an EMX instrument and equipped with a high sensitivity cavity (4119HS). The incubation mixtures were transferred to a flat cell, and the spectra were recorded at room temperature 1 and 7 min after the addition of peroxynitrite. The magnetic field was calibrated with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (g = 2.0056) (15Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G. Da C. Ferreira A.M. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Computer simulation of spectra was performed using a program written by Duling (37Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Treated macrophage suspensions were washed and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 135 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin). After 20 min, the suspensions were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm (10 min, 4 °C). Solubilized proteins were precleared by treatment with protein A-agarose for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (1:100 dilution; Oxis). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose (1 h, 4 °C), washed in lysis buffer, resuspended in loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue), heated (100 °C, 5 min), and submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 12% polyacrylamide gel slabs. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrophoretically blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry system (1 h, 500 mA). After blotting, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1.5 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membranes were extensively washed (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (1:5000 dilution). After extensive washing (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Tween 20), the membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-sheep IgG (1:5000 dilution; Calbiochem). Probed membranes were washed (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Tween 20), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. The addition of 1 mm peroxynitrite to a macrophage suspension (1 × 108 cells/ml) in modified PBS containing 50 mmDMPO led to the early (1-min incubation) detection of an EPR composite spectrum of two radical adducts (Fig.1A). These adducts were identified by computer simulation of the experimental spectrum as the DMPO/⋅SG (a N = 15. 2 G; a H= 15.9 G) and DMPO/⋅OH (a N = 14.9 G;a H = 14.9 G) (38Li A.S.W. Cummings K.B. Roethling H.P. Buettner G.R. Chignell C.F. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 79: 140-142Google Scholar) radical adducts in relative yields of 76 and 24%, respectively (Fig. 1 D). These relative yields varied some in different experiments, but the DMPO/⋅SG radical adduct was always the main spectrum component. The EPR signal of the DMPO/⋅SG adduct was detectable with peroxynitrite concentrations of ≥0.25 mm and cell numbers of ≥5 × 107 cells/ml, but the signals were less intense than those shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). The initial EPR signal decayed fast, and after 7–10 min it was dominated by the DMPO/⋅SG spectrum (Fig. 1, E and H). No EPR signal was detected in the absence of macrophages (data not shown) or upon the addition of previously decomposed peroxynitrite to macrophages (Fig. 1,C and G). Depletion of macrophage GSH levels (>80%) by pretreatment with 100 µm BSO for 24 h (34Romão P.R. Fonseca S.G. Hothersall J.S. Noronha-Dutra A.A. Ferreira S.H. Cunha F.Q. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) led to a much less intense EPR signal that was dominated by the DMPO/⋅OH radical adduct spectrum (Fig. 1, B andF). The above results suggest that intracellular glutathione is an important peroxynitrite target in macrophages. Accordingly, peroxynitrite led to a concentration-dependent depletion of macrophage soluble thiol but had marginal effects upon cell viability in the time scale of the experiments (TableI). Total soluble thiol (protein and nonprotein) was measured to prevent protein precipitation at low pH values, which produces nitric oxide from nitrite (39Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), leading to thiol depletion as confirmed by control experiments. Nitrite is a peroxynitrite decomposition product at neutral pH values and a contaminant of peroxynitrite synthesis (40Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Hansert B. Bohle D.S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3465-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 41Nakao L.S. Ouchi D. Augusto O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these control experiments, total nonprotein thiol content of macrophages (mostly reduced glutathione) was determined to be 4.5 ± 0.6 nmol/106 cells. Cell viability and cell lysis were marginally affected by peroxynitrite, but some cell lysis (∼20–30%, depending on incubation time) occurred in modified PBS (Table I). Cell lysis was minimized by the addition of 5 mm glucose or by the use of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, but these media alone treated with peroxynitrite produced radicals (data not shown) and could not be used in the EPR experiments. Consequently, it became important to obtain further evidence that peroxynitrite was reacting with intracellular GSH under our experimental conditions. Cell suspensions were then treated with peroxynitrite, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and examined by EPR. As shown in Fig. 2, the EPR signal detected in the resuspended pellet 7 min after treatment (Fig. 2 B) was similar to the one detectable in the whole suspension (Fig. 2 A), indicating that most of the radical adducts were produced inside the cells. When the cells were first lysed by 30-min incubation with 1 m phosphate buffer and then treated with peroxynitrite, they showed an intense spectrum dominated by the DMPO/⋅OH adduct (Fig. 2 C). This result is similar to those previously reported in incubations of glutathione solutions with peroxynitrite in the presence of DMPO (6Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this case, DMPO/⋅OH is produced by trapping of the hydroxyl radical produced during spontaneous peroxynitrite decomposition and by the decay of the DMPO-OOH adduct. The latter is produced from the superoxide anion resulting from a chain reaction whereby the radicals produced from peroxynitrite (hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide) oxidize glutathione to the glutathionyl radical (Reactions 2, 4, and 5) (6Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The latter reacts with excess glutathione, producing the glutathione disulfide radical anion that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide anion (Reactions 6–R9) (6Augusto O. Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch.

Gatti R.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the case of macrophage suspensions where most glutathione is inside the cells, the dominant adduct was always DMPO/⋅SG (Figs. 1 and 2), and its yield was little affected by the presence of superoxide dismutase (data not shown). Moreover, the presence of 1 mmcarbon dioxide that reacts fast with peroxynitrite, greatly diminishing its half-life (from 4.1 to 0.027 s at pH 7.4, 25 °C) and its opportunity to permeate cell membranes, strongly inhibited the DMPO/⋅SG radical adduct yield (data not shown). It should be emphasized that CO2 increases thiyl radical production from the oxidation of thiol solutions by peroxynitrite at neutral pH values due to the formation of carbonate radical anion and nitrogen dioxide (Reaction 3) (15Bonini M.G.

Peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide can permeate biological membranes, but the carbonate radical anion cannot (23Romero N. Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.

In agreement, exogenous CO2 inhibited DMPO/⋅SG but increased DMPO/⋅OH adduct yield in a process that was little affected by superoxide dismutase addition (data not shown). In this case, DMPO/⋅OH is likely to be produced by the reaction of the impermeable carbonate radical anion with extracellular DMPO (42Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

The addition of 1 mm peroxynitrite to a macrophage suspension (1 × 108 cells/ml) in PBS in the absence of DMPO did not produce EPR signals detectable with a modulation amplitude of 1 G, which is the instrumental parameter usually employed for the detection of spin trap radical adducts. Using modulation amplitudes of 5 G and over, it was possible to clearly detect a one-line EPR signal in the absence of DMPO (Fig. 3). No signal was detected in the absence of peroxynitrite or macrophages or in reverse addition experiments (data not shown). There are very few biomolecule-derived radicals that can be detected by direct EPR in aerobic solutions at room temperature. Among the exceptions are protein-bound tyrosyl (31Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,43Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 194-200Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The latter has EPR parameters close to those of the one-line signal detected in peroxynitrite-treated macrophages (g = 2.005; line width = 7.4 G) (Fig. 3 A). Most of reported protein-tyrosyl radicals have g values around 2.004 and line widths higher than 20 G (45DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although one-line protein signals of about 10 G have been attributed to protein-tyrosyl radicals by parallel spin trapping experiments with nitroso compounds (31Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the presence of 20 mmDBNBS, the one-line signal detected in macrophages treated with peroxynitrite was replaced by an EPR signal that is apparently composed of those of an immobile (2a Nzz = 58.60 G) and a relatively isotropic radical adduct signal (a N = 13.51 G) (Fig. 4A). Both of these adducts have EPR parameters that are consistent with DBNBS/⋅tyrosyl radical adducts (31Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The presence of two radical adducts was also suggested by the fact that the mobile signal decreased with incubation time, whereas the immobilized signal increased (Fig. 4 D). This increase indicates the occurrence of radical chain reactions (also see below), because the added peroxynitrite should have decomposed in less than 1 min (t12 = 4.1 s in the absence of cells). The presence of two major radical adducts was also evidenced by the effects of CO2 clearly inhibiting the isotropic signal intensity and having a minor influence on the immobilized radical adduct (Fig. 4 D). Of note, CO2 also decreased the yield of the one-line signal detected by direct EPR (Fig. 3). The DBNBS/⋅tyrosyl radical adducts were not detectable in control experiments, although other, less intense, EPR signals were observed. Incubation of DBNBS with macrophages led to the detection of a highly immobilized signal that results from DBNBS addition to biomolecules such as lipids and proteins (Fig. 4, C and F) (46Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, this signal intensity was too low to become a considerable contribution to the spectra obtained in the presence of peroxynitrite on the time scale of our experiments (Fig. 4). The addition of peroxynitrite to DBNBS alone produced an isotropic radical adduct (a N= 12.60 G) (data not shown) that has been previously attributed to the DBNBS/⋅OH radical adduct (47Kohno M. Yamada M. Mitsuta K. Mizuta Y. Yoshikawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 64: 1447-1453Crossref Google Scholar).Figure 4Representative EPR spectra of DBNBS adducts obtained during the interaction of macrophages (J774) with peroxynitrite.

A, control incubation after 1 min; B, same as A in the presence of 1 mm CO2; C, macrophages treated with DBNBS after 1 min; D, same as A after 7-min incubation; E, same as B after 7-min incubation; F, same as C after 7-min incubation.

D, the appearance of hyperfine structures is labeled as ×.

The EPR results, however, cannot provide information on the proteins that are oxidized. Both the immobilized and isotropic signals (Fig. 4) may be due to tyrosine residues from different proteins, to different tyrosine residues of the same protein, or even to the same tyrosine residue of one protein in different conformations (45DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, at least three macrophage proteins (∼76, 69, and 32 kDa) are likely to be oxidized by peroxynitrite to tyrosyl radicals (24Khairutdinov R.F. Coddington J.W. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14238-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48Santos C.X.C. Bonini M.G. Augusto O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) because they were shown to be nitrated by nitrotyrosine Western blot analysis (Fig.5). It is not possible to exclude minor amounts of DBNBS-lipid radical adducts in the spectra shown in Fig. 4,A and B. This possibility appears unlikely, however, because reported DBNBS/lipid radical adducts show some hyperfine structure (46Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 49Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Kondratenko N. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in contrast with the spectra shown in Fig.4, A and B. Hyperfine structures start to appear in the spectra scanned 7 min after peroxynitrite addition (Fig. 4,D and E; labeled as X), suggesting that lipid oxidation may be a secondary event resulting from free radical chain reactions triggered by peroxynitrite. Our results demonstrate that the addition of peroxynitrite to a macrophage suspension promotes the oxidation of intracellular glutathione and proteins with the production of glutathionyl and protein-tyrosyl radicals, respectively (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5; Table I). The glutathionyl radical was identified by EPR spin-trapping experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas production of protein-tyrosyl radicals was suggested by direct EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 3) and confirmed by EPR spin-trapping experiments (Fig. 4) and Western blot analysis of nitrated proteins in treated macrophages (Fig. 5). Time dependence studies of free radical production indicate that glutathione (Fig. 1,A and E) and unidentified proteins (Figs. 3 and4, A and D) are likely to be the initial peroxynitrite targets in macrophages. The radicals produced from them trigger radical chain reactions because the yield of the immobilized DBNBS/tyrosyl-protein radical adduct (labeled as ● in Fig.4 A) keeps increasing after complete peroxynitrite decomposition (Fig. 4 D). This late process appears to be accompanied by some lipid oxidation, because hyperfine structures characteristic of DBNBS/lipid radical adducts (labeled as × in Fig. 4 D) (46Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 49Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Kondratenko N. Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) appear in spectra scanned 7 min after peroxynitrite addition to macrophages. Taken together, the results confirm and extend previous studies demonstrating that peroxynitrous acid and nitrogen dioxide produced from it (Reactions 1 and 2) readily permeate biological membranes, whereas the carbonate radical anion produced from peroxynitrite in the presence of CO2 does not (21Marla S.S. Lee J. Groves J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14243-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, CO2 inhibited the yield of glutathionyl (data not shown) and protein-tyrosyl radicals (Figs. 3 and 4) produced upon the addition of peroxynitrite to macrophages as expected from the quick reaction between peroxynitrite and CO2 that greatly decreases the half-life of the oxidant (Reaction 3). Conversely, the inhibitory effects of CO2 confirm that most of the oxidant is reacting with intracellular macrophage targets, despite some cell lysis observed under our experimental conditions (Table I). A completely different situation is expected to occur when peroxynitrite production and reaction with CO2 occur intracellularly, particularly at neutral pH values. Under these conditions, CO2 should increase glutathionyl (20Bonini M.G. Augusto O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9749-9754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and protein-tyrosyl radical (48Santos C.X.C. Bonini M.G. Augusto O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) production from peroxynitrite, as has been demonstrated to occur in homogenous solutions. Therefore, our results indicate that oxidation of biotargets to the corresponding radicals is likely to be an important result of the physiological production of peroxynitrite in most cell types. The above conclusion could be questioned, because high cell densities and high bolus peroxynitrite concentrations were used to detect free radicals by EPR during the interaction of peroxynitrite with macrophages (this work). These conditions are certainly not physiological but should reflect what occurs physiologically, because cellular thiol oxidation (28Castro L.A. Robalinho R.L. Cayota A. Meneghini R. Radi R. Arch.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) are recurrent events associated with treatment of cells with low peroxynitrite concentrations or fluxes. These processes should occur through the intermediacy of radicals, but the unequivocal EPR detection of the latter requires more drastic conditions due to the intrinsic characteristics of free radicals and EPR spectroscopy (6Augusto O.

Despite its drawbacks, EPR spectroscopy can provide unique mechanistic clues due to the characterization of important targets and their derived radicals. It is important to note that free radicals and oxidants are presently viewed as playing roles in cell homeostasis and not only in cell injury. Lack or excess of biological oxidants is likely to be deleterious, but transient rises in their concentrations trigger redox-sensitive signaling pathways (51Aslund F. Beckwith J.

https://openalex.org/W2021931130,"We have used a combination of cysteine substitution mutagenesis and site-specific labeling to characterize the structural dynamics of mouse acetylcholinesterase (mAChE). Six cysteine-substituted sites of mAChE (Leu76, Glu81, Glu84, Tyr124, Ala262, and His287) were labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore, acrylodan, and the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and inhibitor association were examined along with spectroscopic characteristics of the acrylodan-conjugated, cysteine-substituted enzymes. Residue 262, being well removed from the active center, appears unaffected by inhibitor binding. Following the binding of ligand, hypsochromic shifts in emission of acrylodan at residues 124 and 287, located near the perimeter of the gorge, reflect the exclusion of solvent and a hydrophobic environment created by the associated ligand. By contrast, the bathochromic shifts upon inhibitor binding seen for acrylodan conjugated to three omega loop (Ω loop) residues 76, 81, and 84 reveal that the acrylodan side chains at these positions are displaced from a hydrophobic environment and become exposed to solvent. The magnitude of fluorescence emission shift is largest at position 84 and smallest at position 76, indicating that a concerted movement of residues on the Ω loop accompanies gorge closure upon ligand binding. Acrylodan modification of substituted cysteine at position 84 reduces ligand binding and steady-state kinetic parameters between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, but a similar substitution at position 81 only minimally alters the kinetics.

Rapid fluctuations in residues lining the gorge walls may leave transient gaps at the fasciculin-AChE interface and may account for residual activity. The large omega loop (Ω loop), Cys69–Cys96, flanking the active site gorge in mouse AChE corresponds to the activation loop of Cys60–Cys97 in Candida rugosa lipase, a related α/β-fold hydrolase protein (15Schrag J.D. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 575-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Grochulski P. Li Y. Schrag J.D. Bouthillier F. Smith P. Harrison P. Rubin B. Cygler M. J. Biol.

Crystallographic studies of the lipase revealed that the activation loop occludes the active center in the absence of substrate but folds back in the presence of lipid substrate allowing its access. Although kinetic and structural studies of AChE have not revealed evidence for such large substrate, induced lid-like movements (18Velan B. Barak D. Ariel N. Leitner M. Bino T. Ordentlich A. Shafferman A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Faerman C. Ripoll D. Bon S. Lefeuvre Y. Morel N. Massoulie J. Sussman J. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), high catalytic turnover rates for the cholinesterases might indicate that small amplitude motions along the Ω loop allow rapid access of incoming substrate and release of reaction product (19Faerman C. Ripoll D. Bon S. Lefeuvre Y. Morel N. Massoulie J. Sussman J. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To elucidate the nature of the ligand-dependent conformational changes of AChE, we have employed cysteine substitution mutagenesis and site-directed labeling with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, acrylodan. The emission spectrum and quantum yield of the fluorophore are dependent on the effective dielectric constant and thus reflect the degree of solvent exposure and the local polarity experienced by the fluorophore (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, when acrylodan is conjugated to a cysteine lining the gorge, upon fasciculin binding, it becomes sandwiched between the fasciculin loop and wall of the gorge, thereby becoming protected from solvent (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine further the role of the Ω loop in ligand binding, we have conjugated cysteines at various positions on the Ω loop and opposing gorge wall. Six single cysteine mutants were prepared for acrylodan conjugation (Fig. 1). Three were on the Ω loop as follows: L76C near the tip of the loop and E81C and E84C on their outer surface not lining the gorge. Two residues on the opposing face of the gorge H287C and Y124C were selected, along with a distal residue A262C whose temperature coefficient (B factor) would indicate flexible movement of another disulfide loop on which it resides (5Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We examined the kinetics of substrate catalysis and inhibitor association with the modified enzymes, and we correlate these kinetic parameters with the spectroscopic changes in the conjugated acrylodan upon ligand association. Fluorescence measurements reveal changes in conformation reflected in the substituted side chains well removed from the active center gorge. The results suggest that ligand binding at the catalytic site allosterically alters the conformation of a specific segment of the Ω loop whereby gorge closure occurs and residue side chain positions distal to the binding site are affected. Acetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman’s reagent), dithiothreitol, tacrine (9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride hydrate), BW286c51, decamethonium, and edrophonium were purchased from Sigma.m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoromethylacetophenone (TFK+) and (−)-huperzine A were purchased from Calbiochem. Acrylodan was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fasciculin 2 (purified from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps) was a gift of Dr. Pascale Marchot (University of Marseille, France). Drs. Yacov Ashani and Bhupendra P. Doctor (Walter Reed Army Research Center, Washington, D. C.) kindly provided 7-[[methylethoxy)phosphinyl]-oxyl]-1-methylquinolinium iodide (MEPQ) and procainamide-linked Sepharose CL-4B resin.m-tert-Butyl trifluoromethylacetophenone (TFK0) was synthesized as described (21Nair H.K. Seravalli J. Arbuckle T. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8566-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Quinn, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Mouse AChE was produced by transfection of expression plasmid (pCDNA3, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing an encoding cDNA where the AChE sequence was terminated at position 548. The plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells. Cells were selected with G418 to obtain stable producing cell lines, and AChE was expressed as a secreted soluble enzyme in serum-free media (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated by standard mutagenesis procedures, and cassettes containing the mutation were subcloned into pCDNA 3 (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences of the cassettes were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing to ensure that spurious mutations were not introduced into the coding sequence. Affinity chromatography using (m-aminophenyl)trimethylammonium linked through a long chain to Sepharose CL-4B resin (Sigma) permitted one-step purification of AChE. From 4 to 6 liters of media, mutant and wild type enzyme were purified in quantities ranging between 5 and 25 mg, as described previously (22Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C.

Purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE and by measurements of specific activity. The spectrophotometric method of Ellman was used (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V.J. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar), and kinetic constants for acetylthiocholine hydrolysis were determined by fitting the observed rates as described (26Radic Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Titration of active sites with known concentrations of the irreversible phosphorylating agent, MEPQ, was accomplished by the method of Levy and Ashani (27Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were pretreated with 0.25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature to ensure reduction of the introduced cysteine. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by use of a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. A volume of 1 μl of acrylodan at 100 times the enzyme concentration was slowly mixed with the enzyme to achieve an ∼5-fold molar excess of acrylodan to mutant enzyme. Labeling was allowed to proceed for at least 12 h at 4 °C, and unreacted acrylodan was removed by size exclusion chromatography using Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Concentrations of acrylodan-labeled enzyme were determined from the maximal acrylodan absorbance found between 360 and 380 nm (ε ∼16,400m−1 cm−1). Stoichiometry of labeling of the various preparations, estimated from a comparison of enzyme concentration by protein (280 nm) to acrylodan (360–380 nm) absorbance, ranged as follows: L76C, 0.7–0.8; E81C, 0.79–1.0; E84C, 0.77–1.0; Y124C, 0.79–1.0; A262C, 0.69–0.85; and H287C, 0.82–0.88. Specificity of labeling was assessed by comparison of areas under the fluorescence emission curves for acrylodan-treated mutant and wild type enzymes. Specific labeling for each mutant was as follows: L76C, 70–85%; E81C, 81–91%; E84C, 85–93%; Y124C, 83–90%; A262C, 80–90%; H287C, 70–76%. Picomolar amounts of enzyme in 0.01% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were reacted with TFK+ in the absence of substrate. Inhibition was monitored by measuring residual enzyme activity by removal of aliquots during the course of the reaction. Bimolecular rate constants of inhibition were determined by nonlinear fits of the data (28Radic Z. Kirchhoff P.D. Quinn D.M. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23265-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Steady-state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon/Spex FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Instrument S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) with the excitation and emission bandwidths set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength for acrylodan was set at 359 nm, and emission was monitored between 420 and 600 nm. Equilibrium dissociation constants,Kd, for BW286c51 and edrophonium with the acrylodan-labeled enzyme were obtained by titration of a fixed quantity of labeled enzyme (54–120 nm) with various concentrations of indicated inhibitors. Kd values were obtained by monitoring the fractional decrease in the total area under the fluorescence emission curves from 420 to 600 nm for the acrylodan-labeled E84C or a limited segment of the emission between 450 and 485 nm for the acrylodan-labeled E81C. For ligands of high affinity such as BW286c51, where binding is nearly stoichiometric, data were fitted to Equation 1. ΔF=ΔFmax(Et+It+Kd−{(Et+It+Kd)2−4EtIt}0.5)(2Et)−1(Eq.1)Eq. 1 ΔF and ΔFmax are the change and maximum change in fluorescence, respectively; Et is the total enzyme concentration, and It is the total inhibitor concentration. Association of TFK+ with acrylodan-labeled E81C and E84C was assessed from the kinetics of decrease in fluorescence at 470 and 477 nm respectively, following addition of a stoichiometric excess TFK+ at several concentrations. Data were fitted to a single exponential approach to equilibrium. Association and dissociation rate constants of edrophonium and BW286c51 with E81C and E84C AChEs were determined from changes in the tryptophan fluorescence using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described previously (29Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4622-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Time-dependent decreases in tryptophan fluorescence were observed upon excitation at 276 nm by means of a 305-nm emission cut-off filter. The cysteine-substituted enzymes show kinetics of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis similar to wild type enzyme (Table I and Scheme 1) suggesting that all mutant enzymes fold correctly despite the presence of the newly introduced cysteine. The Km value of E84C shows slightly less than a 4-fold increase, whereas the change in turnover rate,kcat, is minimal. Similar changes in kinetic constants were observed previously for E84Q mAChE (28Radic Z. Kirchhoff P.D. Quinn D.M. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23265-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Since Km, in diffusion limited catalysis, depicts the initial encounter between substrate and enzyme, an increase in Km likely arises from the reduction of negative charge that electrostatically steers the cationic substrate into the active center gorge. Interestingly, a similar E81C mutation has little or no effect on substrate hydrolysis. Not all negatively charged residues around the active center appear to be involved equivalently in electrostatic steering.Table IConstants for acetylthiocholine hydrolysis by wild type and mutant mouse AChEsEnzymeKmKSSbkcatkcat/Kmμmmm105/min109/m · minWTaData are from Ref. 20.54 ± 1614 ± 50.2 ± 0.071.6 ± 0.43.0Y124CaData are from Ref. 20.65 ± 1720 ± 140.2 ± 0.091.4 ± 0.32.2H287CaData are from Ref. 20.58 ± 712 ± 60.2 ± 0.061.8 ± 0.23.1A262CaData are from Ref. 20.59 ± 411 ± 30.2 ± 0.041.6 ± 0.12.7L76C97 ± 1917 ± 10.2 ± 0.031.8 ± 0.11.9E81C57 ± 611 ± 10.2 ± 0.031.6 ± 0.12.9E84C190 ± 926 ± 20.2 ± 0.051.9 ± 0.41.0Data shown as means ± S.D. typically from three measurements.

Association and dissociation rates of fasciculin with A262C, H287C, and Y124C mutant enzymes were also found to be close to the rates with wild type enzyme (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fasciculin, at low concentrations, is also capable of associating with the mutant enzymes after acrylodan conjugation (Fig. 2). In addition, enzyme activity measurements of fasciculin-bound acrylodan conjugates show greater than 99% inhibition (data not shown). TFK+binding to cysteine-substituted enzymes, both free and modified with acrylodan, was also examined (Table II). For E81C and E84C, the association rate constants (kon) for TFK+ were obtained from measurements of enzyme activity. Although positions 81 and 84 are both spatially removed from TFK+-binding site,kon for E84C is slightly slower than that for wild type enzyme. By contrast, E81C shows no difference in the kinetic constants. Conjugation of acrylodan, a neutral naphthalene derivative, with E84C reduces kon of TFK+ 7-fold compared with unconjugated E84C, whereas conjugation of E81C with acrylodan only reduces kon of TFK+slightly. For acrylodan-labeled mutants, kon was measured from the time-dependent decrease of fluorescence signal (Fig. 3).Table IIKinetic and equilibrium constants for reaction of enzymes with TFK+, edrophonium, and BW284c51 in the presence and absence of fluorescent (acrylodan) cysteine labeling compoundEnzymeTFK+EdrophoniumBW284c51konkon WTKdKd mutantKdKd mutantkon mutantKd WTKd WT109m−1min−1nmnmWild type150 250aData are from Ref. 29.2.0aData are from Ref. 29.E81C1501 260bEquilibrium dissociation constants are derived from the ratio of koff/kon using stopped-flow measurement of tryptophan fluorescence quenching.12.6bEquilibrium dissociation constants are derived from the ratio of koff/kon using stopped-flow measurement of tryptophan fluorescence quenching.1.3E81C-acrylodan941.6 6402.66.93.5E84C931.6 550bEquilibrium dissociation constants are derived from the ratio of koff/kon using stopped-flow measurement of tryptophan fluorescence quenching.2.2 35bEquilibrium dissociation constants are derived from the ratio of koff/kon using stopped-flow measurement of tryptophan fluorescence quenching.18E84C-acrylodan131163002513065Data are shown as means from two to three measurements.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8566-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A similar trend in inhibition kinetics was seen with noncovalent active site inhibitors such as edrophonium and BW286c51 (Table II). An increase over wild type Kdof 2-fold occurs for edrophonium binding to E84C, and an 18-fold increase in Kd is observed for BW286c51 binding. Similar increases in Kd of edrophonium and BW286c51 were seen for E84Q human AChE (18Velan B. Barak D. Ariel N. Leitner M. Bino T. Ordentlich A. Shafferman A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By comparison, E81C showed no alterations in ligand binding constants. For acrylodan-labeled mutants,Kd was measured from the fluorescence signals of an equilibrium titration (Fig. 4). Acrylodan-labeled E84C shows Kd increases of 10-fold for edrophonium and 3-fold for BW286c51 compared with unreacted E84C. For acrylodan-labeled E81C, only a slight increase in Kd is seen for both ligands. The high concentration of acrylodan-labeled E81C required for equilibrium titrations precludes an accurate estimate of Kd for high affinity ligands such as BW286c51. The peptide toxin, fasciculin, inhibits AChE by tightly capping the mouth of active center gorge (Fig. 1) (11Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cerveñansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol.

There is no discernible change in fluorescence emission of acrylodan-conjugated A262C (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), consistent with the position 262 being distal to the fasciculin-binding site. The large hypsochromic shifts seen at both the 124 and 287 positions reflect solvent exclusion and an increase in hydrophobicity experienced by the fluorophores in the gorge upon fasciculin binding (20Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the Ω loop mutant, L76C, fasciculin binding produces a 40% increase in quantum yield but no change in emission maximum. Bathochromic shifts are found at both the 81 and 84 positions, with position 84 producing a shift of larger magnitude (Fig. 2 and Table III).Table IIIFluorescence emission parameters of mouse AChE mutants labeled with acrylodan in the presence of fasciculinData are shown as mean values of at least three determinations.

Changes in emission maxima of acrylodan-labeled AChE mutants in the presence of conjugating trifluoroacetophenones are shown in TableIV. The trifluoroacetophenones inhibit the enzyme by conjugating to form a hemiketal at active site serine without dissociation of leaving group (33Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Both the isosteric neutral and cationic trifluoroketones (TFK0 and TFK+) produced no discernible changes in emission spectra of acrylodan conjugated at H287C and A262C, consistent with a fluorophore position distant from gorge base and hence not in direct contact with ligand. Remarkably, both TFK0 and TFK+ produce a substantial bathochromic shift (at least 30 nm) with acrylodan-E84C. The trifluoroketones also produce spectral shift of intermediate value (20 nm) for E81C and a much smaller change (4–6 nm) for L76C. Interestingly, neutral TFK0 produces a large 22 nm of hypsochromic shift with the Y124C acrylodan conjugate.Table IVFluorescence emission parameters of mouse AChE mutants labeled with acrylodan in the presence of covalent active site inhibitorsData are shown as mean values of at least three determinations.

Steady-state ATPase measurements showed that phosphorylation did not alter the affinity for actin by more than a factor of 2 for any construct. Phosphorylation increasedVmax by a factor of 10 for construct 1 and 1.5–3 for construct 2 but had no effect for construct 3. Single turnover measurements, a better measure of slow rates inherent to unphosphorylated regulated myosins, showed that the single-headed construct 2, like construct 3 retains less than 1% of the regulatory properties of the double-headed construct 1 (300-fold activation). Therefore, a complete head cannot be down-regulated by a regulatory domain (without the motor domain) on the partner head. Two motor domains are required for regulation. This result is predicted by a structural model (Wendt, T., Taylor, D., Messier, T., Trybus, K. M., and Taylor, K. A. (1999) J.

The carboxyl-terminal half of the two heavy chains dimerize via an α-helical coiled-coil to form a long rod through which myosin can self-associate to form filaments. The amino-terminal half of the two heavy chains forms the two separate motor (catalytic) domains, which bind actin and hydrolyze ATP. Each is connected to the rod via a neck region that contains the binding site for the two light chains. The class of light chains that binds nearest to the motor domain is termed the essential light chain (ELC)1 whereas the class that binds nearest to the coiled-coil rod is termed the regulatory light chain (RLC). One ELC and one RLC together with the portion of the heavy chain to which they bind are commonly referred to as the “regulatory domain.” The motor domain and the regulatory domain together form the soluble myosin “head” termed subfragment-1 (S1). Truncation of the coiled-coil rod of myosin produces a soluble two-headed structure termed heavy meromyosin (HMM). The actin-activated MgATPase activity and motor properties of smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the RLC (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R.

The unphosphorylated forms of these regulated myosins have low ATPase activity and are unable to move actin filaments, whereas the phosphorylated forms are activated in both respects. S1 is active in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states (4Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T.

Chem. 1982; 257: 12880-12883Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas HMM is well regulated by phosphorylation (4Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-headed myosin, which lacks the motor domain and regulatory domain of one head, is not regulated by phosphorylation (8Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Konishi K. Katoh T. Morita F. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, recombinantly expressed fragments that were sufficiently truncated from the carboxyl terminus to destabilize the coiled-coil, and thus the two-headed structure, were also not regulated by phosphorylation (10Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the presence of two heads is critical for down-regulation, suggesting that head-head interaction is an important feature of the unphosphorylated state. However, these studies do not elucidate which domain interactions are critical for regulation. Recent analysis of two-dimensional crystals of smooth muscle HMM suggests a structural mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent regulation (13Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Reconstructions of images of unphosphorylated HMM showed an asymmetrical structure with an interaction between the actin-binding region of the motor domain of one head and the converter region of the motor domain of the partner head. This interaction between the motor domains was not evident in phosphorylated HMM. It is not known whether this motor-motor domain interaction is a requirement for down-regulated kinetic properties, but if it is, a prediction of the mechanism is that a myosin lacking one full head would not be regulated, which is what has been observed. However, a more constrained prediction is that a myosin with one full head and a partner head lacking just the motor domain, but retaining the regulatory domain would also not be regulated. Recently, three studies (5Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Kato K. Fujiwara K. Onishi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Li X.D. Saito J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41273-41277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have tested this prediction using various asymmetric recombinant fragments of smooth muscle HMM that contained an intact head partnered with a head that was truncated from the amino terminus. All three studies produced at least one asymmetric HMM construct whose MgATPase activity was increased 2–3-fold by RLC phosphorylation, and two of the studies found that some of these molecules required phosphorylation for the movement of actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay. However, the interpretation applied to these data differed among the three sets of authors. In general, the interpretations were not entirely consistent with the previously mentioned structural mechanism, which predicts that two motor domains are required for adoption of the “off”-state. Here we report our results for similar asymmetric molecules derived from nonmuscle HMM IIB, an HMM that is also known to be regulated by RLC phosphorylation. We analyzed each of these constructs in addition to the wild type HMM, by a single turnover ATPase assay that is not sensitive, unlike steady-state approaches used in the previously mentioned studies, to the presence of small amounts of damaged molecules that may lack proper regulatory properties (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C. J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that this single turnover assay is required, and steady-state methods are not sufficient to properly measure the down-regulated turnover rate of smooth muscle HMM and thus the extent of regulation (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these data, we draw the opposite conclusion to the three previous studies cited above. We show that the motor domain of one head partnered with the regulatory domain (without motor) of the other head is not sufficient for regulation or modulation of the ATPase. This strongly suggests that the motor domains of both heads of nonmuscle myosin IIB are required for the down-regulated kinetic behavior inherent to the unphosphorylated state of a regulated myosin. PCR using the chicken nonmuscle IIB heavy chain cDNA (GenBankTM accession number Q02015) as a template was carried out to make various amino-terminal-truncated species shown in Fig. 1A. The Motor-ER-S2 (or MHC II-B1 HMM-like) fragment was subcloned into pBlueBAC II baculotransfer vector described in detail by Pato et al. (22Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using this vector as a template, an ER-S2-DNA fragment was made using a 5′-end PCR primer upstream to the RLC binding site (amino acid residue 795) plus a BamHI restriction site and ATG start codon. The 3′-end PCR primer at the end of the HMM-like fragment (amino acid residue 1242) included a FLAG epitope, a TAG stop codon, and an EcoRI restriction site. Similarly, the S2 DNA fragment was made using a PCR primer downstream to the ELC binding site (amino acid residue 854) plus aBamHI restriction site and ATG start codon together with the same 3′-end PCR primer used for the ER-S2 fragment. Baculoviruses were produced in a manner similar to that described in Pato et al. (22Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins are diagrammed in Fig.1B. HMM was made and purified according to Pato et al. (22Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SH(ER) protein was made by co-infecting insect cells with the viruses containing the Motor-ER-S2 construct, the ER-S2 construct, and the RLC/ELC construct (22Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SH protein was made by co-infecting insect cells with the viruses containing the S1-ER-S2 construct, the S2 construct, and the RLC/ELC construct. The proteins containing only one motor domain were purified from the cell extract by FLAG affinity chromatography followed by actin selection to isolate the proteins containing motor domains. A detailed procedure is described in Wang et al. (23Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The concentrations of all samples were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using smooth muscle HMM as a standard. The concentration of some preparations of HMM was measured using ε 2800.1%= 0.63 mg cm/ml (kindly determined by Dr. Walter Stafford, Boston Biomedical Research Institute). The molecular masses in daltons of the various constructs were: HMM, 362,000; SHER, 272,000; SH, 228,000. F-actin was prepared from rabbit muscle according to the method of Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), myosin light chain kinase was from turkey gizzard (25Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and calmodulin was prepared as described (26Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Images were collected on a Hitashi 600 electron microscope operated at 75 kV. Specimens were prepared at 22 µg/ml protein in 66% glycerol, 0.5 m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmEGTA. Actin-activated MgATPase activities of the various HMM fragments were measured using the method of Pollard and Korn (27Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA at 35 °C or in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA at 25 °C in order to better mimic the conditions of the single turnover experiments. The actin concentration was varied according to the HMM being measured. HMM was either used as purified (unphosphorylated) or prephosphorylated in a similar buffer to the above, but containing additionally 0.2 mmCaCl2, 10 µm calmodulin, and 2 nmmyosin light chain kinase (MLCK), for 20 min at 25 °C prior to initiating the assay. This protocol is a modification of our previous method (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow fluorometer (Hi-Tech SF 61-DX-2) equipped with a 150-watt Hg-Xe lamp and an electronic anti-bleaching shutter designed to avoid photolysis over prolonged time courses. The excitation wavelength was 313 nm, and the excitation bandwidth was 4 nm. Emitted light was collected through a LG 370 filter (Corning). The experiment was done with 2 syringes. The first syringe contained actin at twice the final concentration, 200 µm ATP, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The second syringe contained 0.6–0.8 µm active sites in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT. Immediately prior to data collection, MgFTP (FTP equimolar to active sites, MgCl2 equal to two times the FTP concentration) was added to the second syringe. Fifty microliters were repetitively shot (approximately every min) from both syringes. These initial shots were not analyzed per se but were used only to observe when the initial fluorescence reached a maximum (indicating maximal binding of FTP to HMM, ∼3 min after FTP addition). The maximal binding time was also measured in independent binding studies (data not shown). A complete turnover was then collected from one additional shot. The decrease in fluorescence after mixing reflects the off-rate of MgFDP, which is most likely limited by phosphate release. Between 500 and 1000 data points were collected depending upon the total acquisition time. One hundred and twenty-eight points were collected in the first 2.56 s after which the shutter was activated. The shutter open time for each data point collected thereafter was 12 ms. A “no turnover” control experiment similar to that previously described (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was performed to ensure that the change in fluorescence observed was because of the binding and release of FTP/FDP from the active site, and to confirm that photolysis was not appreciable under the conditions described above. The result (not shown) showed that the fluorescence changes observed in the turnover experiment were due to binding and release of FTP/FDP from the active site. All turnover experiments reported here were completed within a week of preparing the protein, and samples were stored on ice. Older samples and samples frozen in liquid nitrogen tended to exhibit more complex kinetics, with an additional rapid phase appearing with significant amplitude. An HMM-like fragment of nonmuscle myosin IIB (Fig.1B, HMM) was expressed in Sf9 cells by coinfection with a virus producing residues 1–1242 of the heavy chain (Fig. 1A, top, Motor-ER-S2) and another virus producing both the RLC and ELC (not shown). To express different asymmetric HMM-like molecules two additional heavy chain constructs were made (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom). ER-S2 started at codon 795, which deletes the motor domain, but retains the binding sites for both ELC and RLC. S2 started at codon 854, which encodes just the S2 (subfragment-2) region. Both of these latter two constructs contain a FLAG epitope at their carboxyl terminus. The expression of asymmetric HMM molecules, which have both the RLC and ELC bound to the motorless head (Fig. 1B, SH(ER)) was achieved by co-expressing heavy chain constructs Motor-ER-S2 and ER-S2 (Fig. 1A) along with an RLC/ELC encoding construct (not shown). This molecule will be referred to as SH(ER) as previously suggested (16Sweeney H.L. Chen L.Q. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41273-41277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The expression of a single-headed protein (Fig.1B, SH) was achieved by co-expressing heavy chain constructs motor-ER-S2 and S2 along with the construct expressing the RLC/ELC. SH(ER) can be selectively purified by a combination of FLAG affinity column chromatography, which eliminates HMM, and the ability to bind to actin in an ATP-dependent manner, which eliminates (ER), the dimerized fraction containing no motor domains. A similar purification strategy is used to produce SH, which has light chains only on the head with the motor domain. The latter molecule is similar to single-headed myosins or single-headed HMM made using proteolytic methods. We attempted to produce SH(R) with only the regulatory light chain binding site on the truncated heavy chain, but this heavy chain underwent proteolysis in the RLC binding region such that a portion of the molecules would not be expected to bind the RLC. Therefore we did not further characterize SH(R). SDS gels of the three molecules used in this study are shown in Fig.2. In the case of the SH(ER), a heavy chain with an Mr of 144,000 corresponding to Motor-ER-S2 along with a lower molecular weight heavy chain (Mr of 57,000) corresponding to ER-S2 can be seen. Three methods were used to characterize the native molecules. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig.3) of two independent preparations showed that HMM migrated as a single species that co-migrated with proteolytic smooth muscle HMM (prepared as described in Ref. 17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This suggests that the expressed HMM was fully assembled. SH(ER), SH, and (ER) migrated as single species with mobilities consistent with their relative Mr. More directly, rotary-shadowed images (Fig. 4) of HMM and SH(ER) revealed that the molecules showed the appropriate shape. For comparison an image of (ER), the molecule bearing two regulatory domains but lacking both motor domains is also shown. The (ER) molecules have a smaller globular shape as expected. Finally, all constructs were native in that myosin light chain kinase could fully phosphorylate the RLC (Fig. 5).Figure 4Rotary shadowing of constructs.

After purification, all constructs were completely unphosphorylated, and treatment with myosin light chain kinase resulted in full phosphorylation (as in Fig. 5). The steady-state actin-activated MgATPase activity of the double-headed HMM was increased 9.6-fold at 25 °C and 10.6-fold at 35 °C by phosphorylation of the RLC. Most of the regulation is at the level of Vmax as opposed to KATPase, where less than a 2-fold effect is observed. The steady-state Vmax of SH(ER) is activated 1.7-fold (25 °C) and 3.0-fold (35 °C) by phosphorylation. In contrast, neither the Vmaxnor the KATPase of SH is greatly affected by phosphorylation. Interestingly, the Vmax of phosphorylated SH(ER) and phosphorylated SH was about 2-fold less than phosphorylated HMM (Table I). These data for the SH(ER) and SH are similar in magnitude to the activation of homologous constructs derived from gizzard smooth muscle myosin (5Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Kato K.

Values are the mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab To properly quantify the extent of regulation, it is necessary to accurately measure the very slow rate of the unphosphorylated proteins. It has been well documented that steady-state assays are a poor method for determining the true activity of properly regulated unphosphorylated myosins (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because the activity of unregulated molecules is so much higher than that of the regulated ones that even a small fraction of unregulated molecules in a mixture of predominately regulated molecules can mask their low activity. The steady-state assay is sufficient to properly measure the rates of the phosphorylated myosins because their activities are high and small amounts of damaged or otherwise unregulated molecules will not significantly alter the measurement. A better method for examining regulation is to use single turnover assays where each of the HMM molecules in the preparation bind and turnover a single ATP molecule (17Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem.

Data for a single population of kinetically identical molecules will give a single exponential decay whereas data for a mixed population of two kinetically nonidentical molecules will better fit a biexponential decay. Therefore, unlike the steady-state technique, the single turnover technique can identify different populations of molecules within a sample. Single turnover measurements require the use of a fluorescent ATP derivative to follow the rate of nucleotide release, which is likely to be limited by Pi release in this case. We used FTP, which decreases in fluorescence upon release from the active site, and performed the measurements at 25 °C in the presence of 50 mm NaCl. Table IIsummarizes these single turnover data in the absence of actin and at 60 µm actin for all constructs. Fig.6A shows a representative single turnover trace for unphosphorylated HMM at 40 µmactin and its fit to a single exponential model (0.00084 s−1). Under these conditions the steady-state rate was much faster at 0.016 s−1. This indicates that the preparation must be a mixture of slowly cycling molecules (>95%) detected by the single turnover experiment and a smaller portion (<5%) of rapidly cycling material (∼0.3 s−1). Close examination of the early portions of the traces reveals a faster phase with a small (∼5% or less) amplitude. However, attempts to fit these data to a double exponential yielded a spurious fit. A single exponential model was sufficient to fit traces for unphosphorylated HMM at all actin concentrations tested (Fig.7A). A Michaelis Menten fit (not shown) to the data in Fig. 7A gaveVmax = 0.00071 s−1 andKATPase = 15 ± 6 µm. The single turnover Vmax = 0.00071 s−1is in marked contrast to the steady-state Vmax = 0.022 s−1 determined at 25° and demonstrates that the true degree of regulation is much greater than the ∼10-fold determined by the steady-state methods. The true degree of regulation can be estimated by dividing the steady-stateVmax for phosphorylated HMM at 25° (0.21 s−1) by the single turnover Vmax = 0.00071 s−1 for unphosphorylated HMM which yields a 300-fold activation. It is clear that the extent of regulation calculated using the single turnover value for the unphosphorylated HMM (300-fold) is much greater than that estimated from steady-state methods (10-fold). This greater degree of regulation measured by the single turnover approach allows one to more carefully assess the significance of intermediate levels of regulation that could po"
https://openalex.org/W2113508764,"Myosin VI is expressed in a variety of cell types and is thought to play a role in membrane trafficking and endocytosis, yet its motor function and regulation are not understood. The present study clarified mammalian myosin VI motor function and regulation at a molecular level. Myosin VI ATPase activity was highly activated by actin with K actin of 9 µm. A predominant amount of myosin VI bound to actin in the presence of ATP unlike conventional myosins.K ATP was much higher than those of other known myosins, suggesting that myosin VI has a weak affinity or slow binding for ATP. On the other hand, ADP markedly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity, suggesting a high affinity for ADP. These results suggested that myosin VI is predominantly in a strong actin binding state during the ATPase cycle. p21-activated kinase 3 phosphorylated myosin VI, and the site was identified as Thr406. The phosphorylation of myosin VI significantly facilitated the actin-translocating activity of myosin VI. On the other hand, Ca2+ diminished the actin-translocating activity of myosin VI although the actin-activated ATPase activity was not affected by Ca2+. Calmodulin was not dissociated from the heavy chain at high Ca2+, suggesting that a conformational change of calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding, but not its physical dissociation, determines the inhibition of the motility activity. The present results revealed the dual regulation of myosin VI by phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding to calmodulin light chain. Myosin VI is expressed in a variety of cell types and is thought to play a role in membrane trafficking and endocytosis, yet its motor function and regulation are not understood. The present study clarified mammalian myosin VI motor function and regulation at a molecular level. Myosin VI ATPase activity was highly activated by actin with K actin of 9 µm. A predominant amount of myosin VI bound to actin in the presence of ATP unlike conventional myosins.K ATP was much higher than those of other known myosins, suggesting that myosin VI has a weak affinity or slow binding for ATP. On the other hand, ADP markedly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity, suggesting a high affinity for ADP. These results suggested that myosin VI is predominantly in a strong actin binding state during the ATPase cycle. p21-activated kinase 3 phosphorylated myosin VI, and the site was identified as Thr406. The phosphorylation of myosin VI significantly facilitated the actin-translocating activity of myosin VI. On the other hand, Ca2+ diminished the actin-translocating activity of myosin VI although the actin-activated ATPase activity was not affected by Ca2+. Calmodulin was not dissociated from the heavy chain at high Ca2+, suggesting that a conformational change of calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding, but not its physical dissociation, determines the inhibition of the motility activity. The present results revealed the dual regulation of myosin VI by phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding to calmodulin light chain. p21-activated kinase 3 p21 activated kinase 3 kinase domain polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Myosin, a motor protein that translocates actin filaments upon hydrolysis of ATP, constitutes a superfamily with 18 classes based upon phylogenetic sequence comparisons of the motor domains (1Mooseker M.S.

Class VI myosins were first identified in Drosophila melanogaster(5Kellerman K.A. Miller K.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and subsequently found in mammals (6Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J.

Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). While myosin VI is found in various tissues, its physiological significance may be felt most prominently in auditory function, where it is found that the mutation of the myosin VI gene results in auditory malfunction (7Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 8Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P.

Actually, myosin VI is found in the neuroepithelium of the cochlea of the inner ear in both the inner and outer hair cells. In these cells, myosin VI is concentrated at actin-rich stereocilia and may play a role in the rigidity of anchoring of the stereocilia (7Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 8Avraham K.B. Hasson T. Steel K.P. Kingsley D.M. Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); therefore, it has been suggested that myosin VI plays a role in the mechanical function of stereocilia (7Hasson T. Gillespie P.G.

Russell L.B. Mooseker M.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, myosin VI is associated with particles that move in a cell cycle-dependent manner (9Mermall V. McNally J.G. Miller K.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Mermall V. Miller K.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1575-1588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that myosin VI plays a role in membrane trafficking and endocytosis (11Bohrmann J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 652-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of myosin VI has been predicted based upon its amino acid sequence to be composed of a head domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a globular tail domain. The head domain is itself divided into a globular motor domain and a neck domain containing a light chain binding region. The sequence at the neck region contains a single IQ motif that is implicated as a calmodulin or myosin light chain binding consensus motif as found in a variety of calmodulin-binding proteins and myosins (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Titus M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain is present at the C-terminal side of the neck region, so it is predicted that myosin VI is a two-headed myosin. Finally, the globular tail domain is hypothesized to be a targeting domain that determines the cellular binding counterpart. There are two unique inserts in the head domain, one at the surface in the upper 50-kDa domain and the other at the junction between the converter domain and the IQ domain. Until quite recently, all myosin motors were characterized as moving toward the barbed end of actin filaments. Since unconventional myosins play a role in translocating cellular organelles along actin cables, a myosin having opposite moving directionality would be expected to have unique cellular functions. Of the 18 different classes of myosins, it was found that myosin VI moves toward the minus end of F-actin filaments (12Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). While the mechanism underlying the reverse movement of myosin VI is unclear, the unique large insertion in the myosin VI head domain between the motor domain and the light chain binding domain (lever arm) has led to the postulation (12Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) that this alters the angle of the lever arm switch movement, thus changing the direction of motility. The importance of light chains in the regulation of myosin motor function is seen in both vertebrate smooth muscle/nonmuscle myosin and invertebrate myosin, in which the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (13Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 14Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes.

Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1995; 368: 306-312Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), respectively, trigger the activation of motor activity. The role of the IQ motif and bound calmodulin serving as a regulatory component of unconventional myosins was first studied for mammalian myosins I. For both brush border myosin I (17Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Swanljung-Colling H. Colling J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1312-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and myosin Iβ (19Barylko B. Wagner M.C. Reizes O. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 490-494Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), high Ca2+ inhibits motor activity due to its binding to the calmodulin light chain. Since 1 mol of bound calmodulin dissociates from myosin I at high Ca2+, it was originally thought that this dissociation of calmodulin was responsible for the inhibition of myosin I motor activity (17Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Swanljung-Colling H. Colling J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1312-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since virtually no calmodulin dissociation is observed at pCa 6, where the motility activity is completely abolished, this view has been questioned (20Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Quite recently, a similar finding was made for myosin V (22Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). While calmodulin can be dissociated from its heavy chain at high Ca2+, the motility activity of myosin V is abolished at pCa 6, where no calmodulin dissociation takes place, suggesting that a Ca2+ binding-induced conformational change of the bound calmodulin, but not a physical dissociation, is critical for regulation. However, most calmodulin-binding myosins contain multiple calmodulin molecules at their neck domains, and it has been shown that neck-deleted myosin V containing a single bound calmodulin is unregulated by Ca2+(22Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, a remaining question is whether or not the motor activity of myosin VI, which contains a single calmodulin at its neck domain, is regulated by Ca2+. Myosin VI contains a potential phosphorylation site in a loop near the tip of the head that is in a homologous position to the amoeba myosin I phosphorylation site (24Hammer J.A. Albanessi J.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10168-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the phosphorylation of the heavy chain of amoeba myosin I at this site is necessary for the activation of both actin-activated ATPase activity and motility activity (25Albanesi J.P. Hammer J.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hypothesis is raised that myosin VI motor function might be regulated by the phosphorylation at this position by protein kinases, although no supporting data are available to date. The aim of the present study is to clarify the motor function and regulation of myosin VI. To achieve the goal, we expressed myosin VIHMM in Sf9 cells, purified and examined for motor function. The obtained results reveal a dual regulation of myosin VI motor function by Ca2+ binding and p21-activated kinase 3-catalyzed phosphorylation. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (26Spudich J.A. Watt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin from Xenopus oocyte (27Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (28Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (b): 17702-17707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mouse cDNA clones containing −150 to 2565 (B10) and 1460–3708 (B2) in pBluescript were kindly provided from Dr. K. Avraham (Tel Aviv University). B10 clone was digested byKpnI/PflM1, and the cDNA fragment of myosin VI (residues 1679–3309) obtained from the B2 clone byKpnI/PflM1 digestion was inserted into the B10 clone (B2/B10). A unique NheI site was created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon, and then the myosin VI cDNA cut byNheI/KpnI digestion was inserted into pBluebac 4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) baculovirus transfer vector at the polylinker region. A hexahistidine tag sequence with a stop codon was introduced at the 3′ side of the KpnI site. This construct (M6HMM), containing the entire coiled-coil domain, was used to produce recombinant baculovirus expressing myosin VI as described previously (29O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freedman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Thr406 of M6HMM was mutated to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis (30Yano K. Araki Y. Hales S.J. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the mutation was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. Rat PAK3 cDNA in a pGEX4T-2 vector was kindly provided by Dr. G. Cote (Queen's University, Canada). The clone was digested with BamHI/XhoI, and the obtained fragment containing the entire coding region was in-frame ligated into pFastBacHTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) baculovirus transfer vector. To produce a constitutively active form, a BamHI site was created at codon 210, and the nucleotides encoding the N-terminal 210 amino acid residues were excised by BamHI digestion. The produced construct was used to express PAK3 kinase domain (PAK3KD). The plasmids were transformed into DH10BAC E. coli. Recombinant bacmids (recombinant virus DNA) were isolated and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells. To express recombinant myosin VI, 200 ml of Sf9 cells (about 1 × 109) were coinfected with two separate viruses expressing the myosin VI heavy chain and calmodulin, respectively. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 3 days. Cells were lysed with sonication in 30 ml of lysis buffer (0.5m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm ATP). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated with 50 mm glucose and 20 units/ml hexokinase at 4 °C for 30 min to completely hydrolyze residual ATP. F-actin (0.2 mg/ml) was added to the sample and centrifuged (140,000 × g for 20 min) to co-precipitate the expressed myosin VI. The pellets were resuspended with buffer A (0.5 m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) to release myosin VI from F-actin. The supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with a 20-fold volume of buffer B (0.5 m KCl, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) and then washed with a 10-fold volume of buffer C (0.5m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). Myosin VI was eluted with buffer D (0.1 m KCl, 200 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). After SDS-PAGE analysis, fractions containing myosin VI were pooled and dialyzed against 30 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified myosin VI was stored on ice and used within 2 days. To express recombinant PAK3KD, 200 ml of Sf9 cells (about 1 × 109) were infected. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 3 days. Cells were lysed with sonication in 20 ml of lysis buffer (0.5 NaCl, 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5, 4 °C), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was mixed with 0.3 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 30 min 4 °C. The resin suspension was collected by centrifugation (500 × g for 3 min) and then suspended in buffer E (0.5m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (25 °C, pH 7.5), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). This resin suspension was loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with a 30-fold volume of buffer C. PAK3KD was eluted with buffer F (0.5m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). A peptide (12-mer) containing phospho-Thr406 with N-terminal Cys was chemically synthesized as antigen and bound to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the N-terminal cysteine residue. Antibodies were prepared by injecting two rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide. Antibodies against phospho-Thr406 were affinity-purified from the obtained serum by affinity chromatography with the peptide-conjugated resin. The purified antibodies were subjected to absorption on unphosphorylated peptide-coupled resin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa, β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). The amount of the myosin VI heavy chain and calmodulin was determined by densitometry as described previously (20Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATPase activity was determined by measuring liberated Pi at 25 °C as described previously. (32Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was also measured in the presence of 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate as a ATP regeneration system. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (33Reynard A.M. Hass L.E. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay was performed as described previously (34Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Myosin VI was attached to a coverslip. Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in successive snapshots. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. Prior to the phosphorylation reactions, PAK3KD was incubated in 75 mmNaCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 µm microcystin for 30 min at 25 °C (35Wu C. Lee S.F. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31787-31790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction was then carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmimidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 µm microcystin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (300 Ci/mol) by the addition of 4 µg of myosin VI. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for the indicated time periods. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To quantify phosphate incorporation, the myosin VI heavy chain bands of the SDS-PAGE gels were excised, and the radioactivity was quantitated by a scintillation counter. Phosphorylation of myosin VI at Thr406 was determined by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Thr406-specific antibodies. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (36Higashihara M. Young-Frado L. Craig R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5218-5225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of calmodulin to M6HMM heavy chain was determined by actin co-sedimentation assay. M6HMM was incubated in buffer containing 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.025 mg/ml F-actin, and various concentrations of CaCl2 at 25 °C for 15 min. The sample was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amounts of the co-sedimented M6HMM heavy chain and calmodulin were determined by densitometry as described previously (20Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine the binding of myosin VI with actin in the presence of ATP, M6HMM (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated in buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and various concentrations of actin in the presence of ATP regeneration system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) at 25 °C for 30 min. The samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of the co-sedimented heavy chain was determined by densitometry as described previously (20Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mouse myosin VI construct was produced and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The construct (M6HMM) contains the entire coiled-coil domain and the complete head domain along with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to aid in purification (Fig. 1). Histidine tagging at the C-terminal end of the molecule has been performed on conventional (37Li X.-D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as unconventional myosins, 2M. Ikebe, unpublished observation. and no influence on motor function has been observed. The cells were co-infected with an appropriate ratio of myosin VI-expressing virus and calmodulin-expressing virus. It should be noted that functional myosin VI was only obtained with co-infection of calmodulin virus, in contrast to myosin V in which functional protein can be obtained without calmodulin co-infection (23Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The purification process was basically two steps (i.e. F-actin co-precipitation followed by ATP-induced dissociation from F-actin and Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography using the hexahistidine tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). The former step selects the functionally active molecules, and the second step eliminates the endogenous Sf9 cell myosin and F-actin. Fig. 2shows SDS-PAGE appearance of the purified myosin VI. The purified M6HMM wild type construct was composed of a high molecular mass band and a low molecular mass band and was free from 200-kDa Sf9 conventional myosin and actin. The high molecular mass band (121 kDa) was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of M6HMM and was recognized by anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), indicating that the high molecular mass band is the expressed myosin VI heavy chain (not shown). The small subunits showed a mobility shift with a change in [Ca2+] that is characteristic of calmodulin, suggesting that the small subunits are indeed calmodulin (not shown). The identification of the small subunit was also confirmed using anti-calmodulin antibodies (not shown). The stoichiometry of calmodulinversus myosin VI heavy chain was 1.2, consistent with the single IQ motif in M6HMM. Fig. 2 also shows the SDS-PAGE appearance of the T406A mutant of M6HMM, showing that it has the same peptide composition. Based upon the sequence alignment of myosin VI with other myosins, it was noticed that mammalian myosin VI contains a potential phosphorylation site (Thr406) in a loop near the tip of the head. It has been shown that the phosphorylation at a homologous position of the amoeba myosin I catalyzed by a PAK family kinase is required for its motor activity (i.e. its actin-activated ATPase activity and motility activity) (24Hammer J.A. Albanessi J.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10168-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Albanesi J.P. Hammer J.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether myosin VI is phosphorylated at Thr406. Fig.3shows the phosphorylation of myosin VI by mammalian PAK3KD. Myosin VI heavy chain was stoichiometrically phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A). To identify the site phosphorylated by PAK3KD, the phosphorylated myosin VI was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phosphothreonine 406-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The antibodies recognized the myosin VI heavy chain only after PAK3KD-induced phosphorylation but not before the phosphorylation. The signal strength of the Western blot increased over time with PAK3KD-induced phosphorylation, and the time course of the signal increase was similar to that of the extent of32P incorporation. Furthermore, the phosphorylation (incorporation of 32P) by PAK3KD was markedly attenuated when the T406A mutant was used as a substrate (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that myosin VI heavy chain is phosphorylated by PAK3KD at Thr406. Fig.4shows the actin dependence of M6HMM ATPase activity. The ATPase activity was markedly activated by actin. The actin concentration dependence of the activity showed a single saturation curve, and a K actin of 9 µm was obtained. The value is significantly lower than those of nonprocessive conventional myosins. The actin-activated ATPase activity of M6HMM was also measured as a function of ATP concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, an extremely high concentration was required for the saturation of the steady state ATPase activity, and a K ATP value of 150 µm was obtained. The effect of the phosphorylation at Thr406 on the actin-activated ATPase activity was also studied (Figs. 4 and 5). M6HMM was phosphorylated by PAK3KD to stoichiometric level prior to the ATPase assay. The ATPase activity was not significantly affected by the phosphorylation, and similar values of Vm, K ATP, andK actin were obtained for the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated M6HMM (Table I).Figure 5ATP dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activity of M6HMM. The actin-activated ATPase activity of M6HMM (2 µg/ml) was measured in a buffer containing 30 mm KCl, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 µm F-actin, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of 2 mm EGTA (squares) or in the presence of 100 µm free Ca2+ (circles).

Radiolytically generated 1-methyl-3-carbamoyl pyridinium (MCP) radical was found to react predominantly with the heme of the enzyme with a second-order rate constant for heme reduction of 3 × 108m−1 s−1. In the calmodulin (CaM)-bound enzyme a subsequent firstorder phase was observed which had a rate constant of 1.2 × 103s−1. In the absence of CaM, this phase was absent. Kinetic difference spectra for nNOS reduction indicated that the second phase consisted of heme reoxidation accompanied by formation of a neutral flavin semiquinone, suggesting that it is heme to flavin electron transfer. Experiments with the heme proximal surface mutant, K423E, had no second phase, confirming that the mutation blocks interdomain electron transfer. With the autoinhibitory loop deletion mutant, Δ40, the slow phase was observed even in the absence of CaM consistent with the role of the loop in impeding interdomain electron transfer. The rate of heme to FMN electron transfer observed in the wild-type enzyme is ∼1000 times faster than the FMN to heme electron transfer rate predicted during catalysis from kinetic modeling, suggesting that the catalytic process is slowed by kinetic gating.

The NOS enzyme is composed of an oxygenase domain with a thiol-coordinated heme active site similar to that of cytochrome P450 (P450), and an electron transfer domain related to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase which binds FMN and FAD (8Mayer B.

Neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) require Ca2+-promoted CaM binding for activation. CaM binds tightly an amphipathic α-helical region containing 12 basic and hydrophobic residues located in the linker region between the reductase and heme domains (13Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once CaM is bound, electrons provided by NADPH are transferred in a linear sequence across the domains, first entering the flavins and then passing to the heme iron (14Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Upon reduction, NOS catalyzes an O2-dependent conversion ofl-arginine to NO and l-citrulline. Several studies have shown a role for CaM in controlling from flavin to heme interdomain electron transfer (15Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

There has been no previous report of the effect of CaM on the individual intramolecular electron transfer steps. To investigate how CaM regulates electron transfer between the cofactors of nNOS we mutated residues thought to lie in the interface between the domains (23Shimanuki T. Sato H. Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutation of a moderately conserved basic amino acid residue (Lys423) in the heme proximal site of nNOS to several neutral and acidic amino acids caused the loss of NO formation activity and a large decrease in the rate of heme reduction by NADPH via the reductase domain (23Shimanuki T. Sato H. Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of a putative autoinhibitory loop within the FMN-binding domain (Δ40 and Δ42 mutants) caused nNOS to retain activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (24Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Δ40 mutant was found to be able to pass electrons through from NADPH to the heme in the absence of CaM, whereas both Ca2+ and CaM are required for this to occur in the wild enzyme. Pulse radiolysis is a powerful tool for investigating electron transfer within proteins, often allowing an electron to be introduced rapidly and selectively into one redox center of an enzyme (25Kobayashi K.

Differences in the electron transfer reactions occurring in the wild-type, K423 mutants, and Δ40 deletion mutant are reported. We present a detailed study of backward electron transfer from heme to FMN and the factors which control its rate. Reagents were purchased from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), and were of the highest guaranteed grade and without purification. Rat nNOS cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. S. H.

The oxygenase domain of the wild-type enzyme (Wildox) was prepared as previously mentioned (32Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Purification of wild-type and mutant nNOS enzymes were carried out using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatographies as described previously (33Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification of Wildox was carried out using an Ni-NTA-agarose column, as described previously (32Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For all enzymes, purified nNOS was more than 95% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and Western blot analysis. The purified and concentrated enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 4 µm H4B, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The concentration of nNOS was determined optically from the [CO-reduced] − [reduced] difference spectrum using Δε444–467nm = 55 mm−1 cm−1. This Δε value was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen method (33Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) assuming that one heme is bound to one subunit of the enzyme. The enzyme activity was measured by the rate of NO formation, as described previously (33Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Before use, nNOS and Wildox were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). In the case of Wildox, the equilibrium buffer contained 0.2 m KCl. Solutions of nNOS contained 2 mm MCP and 0.1 m tert-butyl alcohol (for scavenging OH radicals) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and were deoxygenated in sealed cells by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon. 0.1m tert-Butyl alcohol had no effect on the enzyme activity or the optical absorption spectrum of NOS. The samples in the presence of CO were performed as follows. Solutions containing phosphate buffer, 2 mm MCP, and 0.1m tert-butyl alcohol were bubbled with CO gas for 10 min. Concentrated solutions of nNOS and Wildox were added to the solution and deoxygenated in sealed cells by evacuation and flushing with argon. Pulse radiolysis experiments were performed with an electron linear accelerator at the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University (25Kobayashi K. Une H. Hayashi K. J. Biol.

The sample was placed in a quartz cell with an optical path length of 1 or 0.3 cm. The temperature of the sample was maintained at 20 °C. The light source for the spectrophotometer was a 150 W halogen lamp or a 200 W Xe lamp. After passing through an optical path, the transmitted light intensities were analyzed and monitored by a fast spectrophotometric system composed of a Nikon monochromator, an R-928 photomultiplier, and a Unisoku data analyzing system. For each measurement, a fresh sample was used, even though the process did not cause any damage to the sample as judged by its visible absorption spectrum. The concentration of MCP radical generated by pulse radiolysis was estimated from the absorbance at 420 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 3300 m−1cm−1 (35Hill R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This concentration was adjusted by varying the dose of electron beams. Kinetic data were analyzed by plotting log ΔA versus time for absorbance changes. Reduction of nNOS and Wildox were monitored at 500 nm, an isosbestic point between the oxidized and the semiquinone forms of FMN of nNOS, and 570 nm, respectively. Second-order rate constants were determined under the condition, where ∼1 µm MCP radical was generated in a solution containing 10–80 µm enzyme. Reduction of nNOS flavin was monitored at 580 nm, which is an isosbestic point between the oxidized and the reduced forms of heme iron of nNOS. Optical absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-3000 or a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer. Pulse radiolysis experiments involve the almost instantaneous generation of the MCP radical which in turn can reduce redox center(s) within a protein. The initial transient increase in absorbance indicated the formation of the MCP radical with an absorption maximum at 420 nm (data not shown). In the absence of the enzyme, the lifetime of the MCP radical is longer than 6 ms (36Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas the lifetime decreased as the concentration of enzyme increased. Fig. 1shows the reduction of nNOS by MCP radical monitored by changes in absorbance in the visible spectrum. The observed decay fits well to a single-exponential curve and the pseudo first-order rate constant was observed to be dependent on the concentration of nNOS (Fig. 1 B). The second-order rate constant was calculated to be 3 × 108m−1 s−1. The addition of 500 µml-arginine had no obvious effect. In the presence of 70 µm nNOS, the MCP radical decayed within 100 µs (data not shown). The absorbance at 490 and 600 nm decreased and the absorbance at 460 nm increased with the decay of the MCP radical (Fig. 2). In the presence of CaM, a subsequent slower absorbance change was observed in the time range of milliseconds (Fig. 2 B). The absorbance at 490 nm consisted of a faster and a slower decrease. The initial decrease of absorbance at 600 nm and the increase at 460 nm subsequently reversed. However, no second phase was observed in the absence of CaM (Fig.2 A). Fig. 3shows the difference spectra monitored at 200 µs and 10 ms after the pulse. The spectrum at the end of the faster phase, which has a broad absorption decrease around 500 nm, is similar to that obtained in the absence of CaM. The slower phase had an absorbance decrease at 460 nm and an increase at around 580 nm, characteristic of blue flavin semiquinone formation. This suggests that the slow phase arises from the one electron reduction of the flavin of the enzyme.Figure 3Kinetic difference spectra of pulse radiolysis of wild type nNOS in the absence (A) and presence (B) of CaM monitored at 200 µs (filled circle) and 10 ms (open circle) after pulse radiolysis.Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the visible difference spectrum of nNOS is complex owing to the presence of absorption of heme iron, FAD, and FMN, a similar experiment was performed using the isolated oxygenase domain of the wild type enzyme (Wildox). After pulse radiolysis of Wildox, the absorbance at 520 and 570 nm decreased and increased, respectively, with the decay of the MCP radical (Fig. 4A). However, no subsequent absorption changes were observed, in contrast to the experiments on the holoenzyme in the presence of CaM. The kinetic difference spectrum at 500 µs after pulse radiolysis is essentially identical to the static difference spectrum of the reduced minus oxidized form of Wildox (Fig. 4 B) and, furthermore, is similar to the kinetic difference spectrum observed in the fast phase of the holoenzyme experiments (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that MCP radicals exclusively reduced the heme iron of both the holoenzyme and Wildox. The rate constant for the reduction of the heme iron of Wildox was calculated from the absorbance change at 570 nm to be 4.2 × 108m−1s−1, which is comparable to that of the heme reduction in holo-nNOS. Addition of 500 µml-arginine increased the second order rate constants for the reduction to 7.2 × 108m−1 s−1. A similar experiment was performed in the presence of CO, making it possible to follow heme reduction by measuring the build-up of the Fe2+-CO complex at 450 nm. Following the spectral changes of the heme reduction of the enzyme, an increase of absorbance at 450 nm was seen in the time range of milliseconds (Fig.5A). The kinetic difference spectrum at 10 ms after the pulse shows that CO-bound ferrous nNOS was formed. A similar CO binding process was seen in Wildox (data not shown). The rates of the reduction in both the holoenzyme and Wildox were not affected in the presence of CO at all. From these findings, it can be concluded that the heme irons of the holoenzyme and Wildox were reduced initially and, subsequently, CO binds to the ferrous heme of the enzyme. The rate constant of the slower process is comparable to that determined by flash photolysis (37Sato H. Nomura S. Sagami I. Ito O. Daff S. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The spectrum in the faster phase in Fig. 1, therefore, is consistent with the reduction of the heme iron of the enzyme. These findings confirm that the fast phase (in the presence and absence of CaM) consists of heme reduction by the MCP radical, while the slow phase, observed only in the presence of CaM, is due to reduction of FMN by the heme. The data in Fig. 1 B indicate that the faster phase is a consequence of a bimolecular reaction of MCP radicals with the heme of the enzyme. The slower absorbance change in the presence of CaM was analyzed at 580 nm, since no change was observed at this wavelength in the faster phase (data not shown) (Fig. 2), i.e. there is an isosbestic point between the oxidized and reduced forms of the nNOS heme at this wavelength. The rate constant for the slower phase was 1.2 × 103 s−1 and was independent, within experimental error, of the enzyme concentration, over a 10-fold range. Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the reduction of FMN is due to a direct electron transfer from the MCP radical. Furthermore, the slower absorbance changes were occurring 1 ms after the pulse, at which time no measurable MCP radical remains. The observed changes appear, therefore, to be due to interdomain electron transfer from the heme to the flavin (FMN) of the enzyme. The rate constant of the slow phase observed with the wild-type enzyme was not affected by the addition of l-arginine, which is consistent with the lack of a significant substrate-induced heme redox potential shift in nNOS (−239 mV, l-arginine-free; −220 mV,l-arginine-bound) (38Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In our previous report (23Shimanuki T. Sato H. Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we mutated a moderately conserved basic amino acid, Lys423 of nNOS, to several neutral and acidic amino acids to study the effect on the catalytic activity and on the rate of heme reduction by NADPH via the reductase domain. The K423E and K423M mutations appeared to impair electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme. It was of particular interest, therefore, to obtain rate constants for interdomain electron transfer in these mutants. As in the case of the wild-type enzyme, the hemes of the K423E and K423M mutants were initially reduced in the presence or absence of CaM. No subsequent changes were seen in the absence of CaM. However, in the presence of CaM, subsequent events were quite different for the mutants. In the K423M mutant, a slow absorbance decrease from 460 to 490 nm and an increase at 600 nm were observed, as the case of the wild enzyme (Fig.6A). On the other hand, in the K423E mutant, the slow process was not observed (Fig. 6 B). Fig. 7shows the difference spectra at 200 µs and 10 ms after the pulse of the K423M and K423E mutants. The difference spectra for the fast and slow phases in the K423M mutant are essentially the same as those obtained after pulse radiolysis of the CaM-bound wild-type enzyme, although the amplitude of the slow phase was smaller. The rate constant for the backward electron transfer in the K423M mutant was also found to be slower than for the wild type enzyme at 5.1 × 102 s−1. These results indicate that the interdomain (heme to FMN) electron transfer does not occur in the K423E mutant even in the presence of CaM.Figure 7Kinetic difference spectra of pulse radiolysis of the K423 m (A) and the K423E (B) mutants of nNOS in the presence of CaM at 200 µs (filled circle) and 10 ms (open circle) after pulse radiolysis.Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inducible form of NOS (iNOS) differs from the constitutive NOS isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) in the fact that it is insensitive to changes in Ca2+ concentration (39Cho H. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). One of the main structural differences between iNOS and the constitutive NOSs is that the latter contain an additional 40–50-amino acid insert in the middle of a conserved region of the FMN-binding domains. The role of the insert in controlling Ca2+/CaM sensitivity was confirmed by nNOS loop deletion mutants (Δ40, Δ42) which retained their activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (24Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interdomain electron transfer in the deletion mutant must also occur in the absence of CaM. As in the case of the wild-type enzyme, reduction of the Δ40 deletion mutant with MCP radical proceeded via two phases (Fig. 8). The initial absorbance increase at 460 nm and the decrease at 600 nm subsequently reversed. The absorption change at 490 nm consists of a faster and a slower decrease. It is noted that these changes were largely unaffected by CaM. The kinetic difference spectra of the faster and the slower phases obtained with the deletion mutant are similar to those obtained after pulse radiolysis of the CaM-bound wild-type enzyme, however, the Δ40 spectra were not affected by the presence of CaM (Fig.9). The rate constant of the interdomain electron transfer was calculated to be 8.7 × 102s−1, and independent of CaM binding. However, the difference spectra of Fig. 9 indicate other changes in addition to the reduction of the heme iron in the fast phase. The absorbance from 460 to 490 nm decreases initially, significantly more than with the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that some flavin reduction is also taking place in the fast phase.Figure 9Kinetic difference spectra of pulse radiolysis of the nNOS Δ40 deletion mutant in the absence (A) and presence (B) of CaM at 200 µs (filled circle) and 10 ms (open circle) after pulse radiolysis.Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As described in our reports (26Kobayashi K.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The NADP⋅ was found to react with the wild-type enzyme, however, the reaction product was different for the CaM-bound and CaM-free enzyme forms (Fig. 10). In the presence of CaM, the absorbance at 460 nm decreased with an increase at 600 nm (Fig. 10 B), no subsequent changes were seen. The kinetic difference spectrum of the CaM-bound enzyme (Fig.10 C) has an absorption minimum at 460 nm and a maximum at around 600 nm, characteristic of neutral (blue) flavin semiquinone formation. This indicates that NADP⋅ transfers an electron to one of the flavins of the enzyme. In the CaM-free enzyme, on the other hand, the absorbance at 460 nm increased with a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm (Fig. 10 A). The kinetic difference spectrum, which has an absorption minimum around 490 nm, is quite different from that of the CaM-bound form, but is similar to the spectrum of the initial reduction product on reaction with the MCP radical. This indicates that NADP⋅ directly reacts with heme iron of the CaM-free enzyme. Similar results were obtained with the K423M and K423E mutants (Fig.11).Figure 11Kinetic difference spectra of pulse radiolysis of the K423M mutant (A) and K423E mutant (B) of nNOS"
https://openalex.org/W2004352517,"The association of the bacteriophage T4-encoded AsiA protein with the ς70 subunit of theEscherichia coli RNA polymerase is one of the principal events governing transcription of the T4 genome. Analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR studies indicate that free AsiA is a symmetric dimer and the dimers can exchange subunits. Using NMR, the mutual recognition sites on AsiA and ς70 have been elucidated. Residues throughout the N-terminal half of AsiA are involved either directly or indirectly in binding to ς70whereas the two highly conserved C-terminal regions of ς70, denoted 4.1 and 4.2, constitute the entire AsiA binding domain. Peptides corresponding to these regions bind tightly to AsiA individually and simultaneously. Simultaneous binding promotes structural changes in AsiA that mimic interaction with the complete AsiA binding determinant of ς70. Moreover, the results suggest that a significant rearrangement of the dimer accompanies peptide binding. Thus, both conserved regions 4.1 and 4.2 are intimately involved in recognition of AsiA by ς70. The interaction of AsiA with 4.1 provides a potential explanation of the differential abilities of DNA and AsiA to bind to free ς70 and a mechanistic alternative to models of AsiA function that rely on binding to a single site on ς70."

HA [→4)-β-d-GlcUA(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAc(1→] is a prominent glycosaminoglycan that plays roles as a structural element and a recognition molecule in vertebrates (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze the production of HA, the HASs, were the first examples of glycosyltransferases capable of forming the disaccharide repeat of a glycosaminoglycan that were cloned and described at the molecular level. The initial HAS to be identified was spHAS (formerly called HasA) of the human pathogen Group A Streptococcus pyogenesbacteria. The spHAS enzyme is responsible for the polymerization of HA of the extracellular capsule (2DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spHAS protein is strongly associated with the phospholipid membrane and is predicted to possess six membrane-associated segments (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

The enzyme utilizes UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc precursors found in the cytosol and extrudes the growing HA chain out of the cell during polymerization. Based on genetic and biochemical evidence, the product of a single gene, spHAS, catalyzes the transfer both GlcUA and GlcNAc residues to the nascent HA chain (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This finding is in contrast to the widely accepted “one enzyme, one sugar transferred” dogma of glycobiology (6Hagopian A. Eylar E.H. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1968; 128: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) protein, xlHAS1, originally called DG42 (for differentially expressed ingastrulation), was the first vertebrate HAS to be cloned, but at the time, its function was not known (7Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of xlHAS1 is quite similar to that of bacterial spHAS enzyme (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

By overexpression studies utilizing mammalian hosts and expression studies utilizing a yeast host, xlHAS1 was subsequently shown to be a HAS (8Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but whether this phenomenon is abortive catalysis or a physiological function is not clear. Multiple HAS isozymes have been discovered in vertebrates (14Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the isozymes were generated by an early gene duplication event. Xenopus contains three activeHAS genes including xlHAS1 and one apparently inactive pseudogene (9Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Three distinct but similar gene products possessing ∼50% identity to xlHAS1, named HAS1,HAS2, and HAS3, were found in human and mouse (9Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The Xenopus xlHAS1 gene is an ortholog of the mammalianHAS1 based upon conservation of exon/intron boundaries (9Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).xlHAS1 is expressed in the frog's embryonic stage, whereasxlHAS2 is the main transcript in the adult (15Köprunner M. Müllegger J. Lepperdinger G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HA is essential for mammalian development because transgenic knockout mice lacking HAS2 fail to develop beyond midgestation (16Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of streptococcal HASs, vertebrate HASs, and the viral HAS possess striking similarity. In the proposed catalytic domain (4Heldermon C. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the vertebrate HASs share ∼60% identity with each other and ∼20% identity with the streptococcal and viral HASs. On the basis of the differences in primary structure and predicted topology in the membrane, at least two classes of HAS may exist. We proposed that the first three groups of enzyme should be designated Class I HASs; thus far, the Pasteurella multocida enzyme, pmHAS (17DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is the only known example of a Class II HAS (18DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Class I HASs apparently perform many functions including binding UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA precursors, catalyzing formation of glycosidic bonds, and potentially transporting the polysaccharide through the plasma membrane. Immunopurification of the spHAS (19Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Cline T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or the murine HAS1 (11Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) polypeptide indicates that a single polypeptide species is responsible for the catalytic transfer of both GlcNAc and GlcUA to the growing polymer chain. The Class II pmHAS protein was recently shown by molecular genetic means to have two active sites in one polypeptide (20Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on other known enzymes and sugar transporters, however, it would be surprising if any Class I HAS monomer, ranging in size from 418 to 588 residues (48–69 kDa), would suffice to perform all the potential HAS functions. Radiation inactivation studies of spHAS and seHAS, the homologous enzymes from Group A and C Streptococcus, respectively, have indicated that ∼16 molecules of lipid and a monomer of protein comprise the functional HA polymerization unit (21Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the past, it was speculated that other molecules or a complex in the mammalian cell is involved or required for HAS activity (11Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Mian N. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the enriched or purified murine HAS1 polypeptide has HAS activity, but it could not be determined whether this activity was due to a single polypeptide or a homo-oligomer (24Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In an effort to further characterize the vertebrate HAS, we have now employed radiation inactivation analysis to examine whether the vertebrate protein exists in a multimeric state (either homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers). The radiation inactivation technique yields information on the functional unit size of macromolecules without the requirement for prior extraction or purification. We found that the polymerization of HA polysaccharide by xlHAS1 requires a single monomer. Furthermore, we have corroborated the basic tenets of radiation inactivity theory: irradiation of proteins at low temperature restricts radiation damage to only the direct effects (no indirect effects due to free radical propagation and diffusion or other radiation products arise), and the entire polypeptide chain is randomly damaged no matter where the initial radiation interaction occurs (25Aronson D.L. Preiss J.W. Radiat. Res. 1962; 16: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Kempner E.S. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8919-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By genetic fusion, we have created a larger mass protein that still retains the original biochemical activity. Irradiation of this structure leads to a target size of the new total mass; it is the sum of the two original components. This result confirms and extends the principles already established for direct radiation damage to proteins and introduces a new parameter that can be used as an internal standard in inactivation experiments. Furthermore, it helps to clarify whether a target size corresponds to one or more polypeptides. All reagents were from Sigma or Fisher, unless noted otherwise. The construction and use of the native size xlHAS1 expression plasmid for studies in yeast have been described previously (10DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol.

Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under control of the GAL1 promoter to form pYES/DG+. Another expression construct was designed to produce a longer polypeptide consisting of a (histidine)6 tag and a monomer of the Aequorea jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused in frame to the carboxyl terminus of xlHAS1 (Fig. 1). The 833-residue fusion protein was constructed by PCR-ligation-PCR (28Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR utilizing Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used to create separate xlHAS1 (from the cDNA plasmid template, pC4202; Ref. 7Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or GFP (from the pGLO plasmid template; Bio-Rad) amplicons. The primer pairs were HAS-sense, (5′-GGAATTCATGAAAGAAAAAGCTGCAGAAACCATGG-3′) and HAS-antisense (5′-ATGGTGATGGTGGTGGTG-3′) and GFP-sense (5′-ATGGCTAGCAAAGGAGAAGAAC-3′) and GFP-antisense (5′-GCACGCGGCCGCTGCAGTTATTTGTAGAGCTCATCCATGC-3′) (Great American Gene Company). The amplicons were treated with T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs), mixed together in a 1:1 ratio, and ligated. A portion of this ligation reaction was used as the template for another round of PCR with the sense primer for xlHAS1 and the antisense primer for GFP to amplify the correctly ligated product. The final desired amplicon (2.5 kb) was purified from an agarose gel with GeneClean (Bio101). The insert was cloned into pYES2 with the aid of the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites within the outer primers. The ligation mixture was transformed intoEscherichia coli, and the resulting colonies were screened by PCR and restriction mapping. The new plasmid, called pYES/DG-GFP, was isolated and sequenced to verify the junction site. The plasmid was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast by the lithium acetate/poly(ethylene glycol) method (29Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Two different yeast hosts were employed, InvSC1 (a robust diploid strain; Invitrogen) and BJ5461 (a pleiotrophic protease-deficient strain; kindly supplied by Rebecca Contopoulou, Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA). Western blotting with anti-DG42 antibody (7Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or anti-GFP antibody (Sigma) demonstrated that the fusion protein was expressed, and HAS activity assays showed that it had similar specific activity to xlHAS1 (data not shown). Yeasts with recombinant plasmids were routinely grown to a suitable biomass in uracil-deficient synthetic media with 0.1% glucose and 5% glycerol until A 600 was 0.3. Upon induction with 1% galactose, active xlHAS1 or xlHAS1-GFP fusion accumulated in the plasma membrane fraction. Crude membranes were prepared by disruption with silica/zirconia beads (0.5 mm) in a MiniBead-Beater-8 (Biospec) and harvested by ultracentrifugation (27Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin. Protein was quantitated by the Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard. The total protein concentration of samples destined for radiation inactivation was adjusted to 5–8 mg/ml. A standard enzyme with a known target size, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH), was added to the membrane preparation (∼40 units/ml, final concentration). Two sources of enzyme were used in different experiments: 1) S. cerevisiae(dimer of two 57.5-kDa subunits or 115 kDa; Ref. 31Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 2)Leuconostoc mesenteroides (dimer of two 54.4-kDa subunits or 109 kDa; Ref. 32Lee W.T. Flynn T.G. Lyons C. Levy H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13028-13034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of identical aliquots (0.3–0.5 ml of membranes each) were frozen on dry ice and flame-sealed in 2-ml glass vials. They were kept at −80 °C or at a lower temperature throughout all procedures until assayed. Samples were irradiated at −135 °C in the gas phase of evaporating liquid nitrogen with a beam of 13-MeV electrons produced by a linear accelerator (Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Bethesda, MD). Two to four aliquots were not irradiated to serve as the zero dose control. Radiation dose was determined with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Typical exposure rates were 10–30 megarads/h. Upon opening the vials, but before thawing, nitrogen gas was used to purge any remaining ozone generated by the intense irradiation (33Harmon J.T. Nielsen T.B. Kempner E.S.

The incorporation of sugars into high molecular weight HA polysaccharide was monitored by using UDP-[14C]GlcUA (∼290 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) precursor as described previously (10DeAngelis P.L.

The membrane preparations were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to 2 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 120 or 300 µm UDP-GlcUA, and 600 or 1200 µmUDP-GlcNAc. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to 2% (w/v). Descending paper chromatography (65:35, ethanol:1 mammonium acetate, pH 5.5) was utilized to separate products from substrates; the radioactive polymers at the origin of the paper chromatogram were detected by liquid scintillation counting. To assess nonspecific incorporation, parallel control reactions without UDP-GlcNAc were used (<5% of the specific binding at all doses). Assays for quantitation of xlHAS1 or xlHAS1-GFP synthase activity were set so that <5% of the radiolabeled substrate was consumed, and the enzyme concentration was in the linear range. Both enzymes lost <5% of their original HAS activity after three freeze-thaw cycles. The G6P-DH standard enzyme activity was measured at 25 °C in 1-ml assays containing 56 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, 3.3 mm glucose-6-phosphate, and 0.5–50 µl of the irradiated membrane preparations (34Kempner E.S. Schlegel W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reaction rates were obtained by monitoring the change in A 340 over time. Reactions with the same amount of membranes but lacking the glucose-6-phosphate were used to obtain baseline reaction rates. The fraction of the surviving HAS activity (A/A 0) or the amount of xlHAS1 polypeptide (P/P 0) was plotted on a logarithmic scale as a function of radiation dosage. The data from each series of irradiated samples was fit by least squares analysis to a line that passed through 1.0 at zero dosage. The slope of the line (k) = (D 37)−1, where D 37 is the dose in megarads that reduces the activity or the amount of a protein species to 37% of the unirradiated sample. The empirical and theoretical relationship is molecular mass = (6.4 × 105 ×S t)/D 37 whereS t = 2.8 for irradiation at −135 °C (34Kempner E.S. Schlegel W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mass (in kDa) = 1792 k (35Kempner E.S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 276: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of measuring enzyme activity, the target size corresponds to the mass of the enzyme's functional unit (strictly defined as the sum of the masses of all the structures required to express activity in the assay). Many of the molecular details of HASs and of the majority of other glycosyltransferases in general are not known, except for their deduced amino acid sequence. xlHAS1 contains predicted membrane-associated segments or transmembrane helices clustered at both the amino and carboxyl termini. The predicted positioning of the membrane-associated regions in xlHAS1 and mammalian HASs is similar to that found in spHAS (4Heldermon C. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), except that there appear to be two more membrane-associated regions at the carboxyl terminus in the vertebrate enzyme. The function or potential role of these additional segments is not known. By gene fusion techniques, a new protein can be created that is an extended linear polypeptide. The fusion of the HAS gene to the GFP gene leads to the synthesis of a larger protein. It had previously been shown (25Aronson D.L. Preiss J.W. Radiat. Res. 1962; 16: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that radiation damage occurred throughout a natural polypeptide, no matter where the initial primary ionization had occurred; thus, it was anticipated that the same processes would occur in a fusion protein. A single primary ionization anywhere in the polypeptide would lead to structural damage randomly throughout that polymer. Biochemical functions associated with each of the protein domains in the fusion would be lost, as they were in thearom complex (26Kempner E.S. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8919-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and target analysis of surviving activity will yield a mass equal to that of the entire polypeptide. A polypeptide of mass i that is genetically fused to a different polypeptide will yield a polypeptide of mass i +j, where j is the mass of the fused protein together with the mass of any linker sequence. If a single polypeptide is required for expression of activity, the radiation target size will change from i in the native state to i +j in the fused form. Similarly, a requirement for multiple polypeptides will yield target sizes of n(i) orn(i + j) for the two forms. In our radiation inactivation studies, we employed two types of internal standards to calibrate and refine our target size of xlHAS1. As in many previous studies (36McIntyre J.O. Churchill P. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Kempner E.S. Miller J.H. McCreery M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we included an enzyme of known size, G6P-DH, to compare with our experimental protein. The calculated standard target size for each irradiation run is shown in TableI. In a new approach, we increased the mass of the experimental protein, xlHAS1, by fusing it to GFP. We then made a direct comparison between the native and the fusion proteins. The fusion polypeptide, xlHAS1-GFP (Fig.1), consisting of xlHAS1 and theAequorea GFP is a functional HAS. xlHAS1-GFP (predicted mass, 96 kDa) is 27 kDa larger than xlHAS1 (predicted mass, 69 kDa), with similar specific activity. The results of a representative radiation inactivation experiment are shown in Fig.2. The sizes obtained for xlHAS1 and xlHAS1-GFP from three different irradiation runs are shown in Table I. Results are given based on radiation doses determined both by dosimetry and by calculation using the G6P-DH standard. The measurement of radiation doses using an internal biological monitor, like G6P-DH, is more reliable because it identifies the dose actually delivered to the sample (33Harmon J.T. Nielsen T.B. Kempner E.S. Methods in Enzymology. 117. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1985: 65-94Google Scholar). The difference in experimental target size between xlHAS1 and the fusion protein, 25–37 kDa, corresponds to the GFP monomer. In this construct, each enzyme molecule was fused to a single GFP monomer, so that an increase in target size equivalent to one GFP structure shows that only one HAS polypeptide is required for synthase activity.Table ITarget size analysis of xlHAS1 and xlHAS1-GFPRun no.EnzymeDosimetry target sizeG6P-DH adjusted target sizePredicted sizekDakDakDa1L.m.G6P-DH105109xlHAS18582xlHAS1-GFP112107Δ Mass27252L.m.G6P-DH85109xlHAS17091xlHAS1-GFP98128Δ Mass28373S.c.G6P-DH110115xlHAS199104xlHAS1-GFP123130Δ Mass2426Average ± S.D.xlHAS185 ± 1592 ± 11691-aMonomer size predicted from the deduced DNA sequence.xlHAS1-GFP111 ± 13122 ± 13961-aMonomer size predicted from the deduced DNA sequence.Δ Mass26 ± 229 ± 727Membranes were prepared and irradiated, and the residual HAS activity was determined and graphed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of three independent irradiation experiments are presented, along with the averages and S.D.s of the three experiments.

Δ Mass equals the size obtained for xlHAS1-GFP minus that obtained for xlHAS1 and agrees with the size for GFP (predicted mass, 27 kDa). A monomer of xlHAS1 polypeptide is the HA synthase functional unit. Experimental error can sometimes becloud association of a radiation target size with the mass of either a monomer or dimer. Application of the fusion technique permits comparison of the target sizes with the two expected masses, as well as the difference of the two target sizes with the mass of the fused polypeptide. This general principle can be applied to any protein whose gene can be manipulated. These modifications enhance and reinforce the analyses possible by radiation target theory. The predicted xlHAS1 mass (69 kDa) and the experimental target size (85 ± 15 as determined by dosimetry or 92 ± 11 as determined by G6P-DH adjustment), however, are not identical. It appears there is some additional mass (∼20 kDa) in the target size that is not accounted for by the xlHAS1 polypeptide. In the case of the streptococcal HASs, this excess mass is believed to be lipid (21Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This interpretation was based on the fact that the size obtained from HAS assays performed on intact, irradiated membranes was larger than the size obtained by solubilizing the irradiated membranes, adding cardiolipin (a stimulatory phospholipid), and then performing the HAS assay. Unlike the streptococcal HASs, we have not been able to purify an active form of xlHAS1 either with or without the addition of cardiolipin or total vertebrate lipid extracts. Also, addition of lipids to membrane preparations did not alter the HAS activity (data not shown). The HAS activity of detergent-solubilized, enriched murine HAS1 was reported to be unaffected by added phospholipid (11Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). If the additional mass observed in the xlHAS1 radiation inactivation target size were due to lipid, the mass observed could correspond to ∼14 molecules of cardiolipin or ∼25 molecules of phospholipid. Work is in progress to determine whether lipid is involved in the HAS catalytic or transport mechanism.

Previous studies demonstrated that myosin-Va exhibits an unusually high affinity for F-actin in the presence of ATP and that its MgATPase activity is stimulated by micromolar Ca2+ in a highly cooperative manner. We demonstrate here that Ca2+ also induces myosin-Va binding to and cosedimentation with F-actin in the presence of ATP in a similar cooperative manner and calcium concentration range as that observed for the ATPase activity. Neither hydrolysis of ATP nor buildup of ADP was required for Ca2+-induced cosedimentation. The Ca2+-induced binding was inhibited by low temperature or by 0.6 m NaCl, but not by 1% Triton X-100. Tight binding between myosin-Va and pyrene-labeled F-actin in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ was also detected by quenching of the pyrene fluorescence. Negatively stained preparations of actomyosin-Va under Ca2+-induced binding conditions showed tightly packed F-actin bundles cross-linked by myosin-Va. Our data demonstrate that high affinity binding of myosin-Va and F-actin in the presence of ATP or 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) is induced by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. Since Ca2+ regulates both the actin binding properties and actin-activated ATPase of myosin-Va over the same concentration range, we suggest that the calcium signal may regulate the mechanism of processivity of myosin Va.

These properties are consistent with the postulated cellular functions of M-Va in organelle transport (16Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S.

Thus, high affinity for actin and processive movement would guarantee that M-Va with its cargo maintains contact with actin tracks. A troublesome difference between properties determined on the native protein versus the baculovirus-expressed constructs has been the lack of consistent results on the Ca2+ regulation of the mechanochemical events. Whereas the actin-activated ATPase of native M-Va is tightly regulated by Ca2+ (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

This apparent paradoxical effect of calcium on the ATPase activity of native M-Va in solution versus its motility as a surface-adsorbed molecule has not been satisfactorily explained, suggesting that there is much to be learned about the regulatory role of Ca2+ on the mechanochemical cycle of M-Va. The likely targets for Ca2+ are the calmodulin light chains, each with four potential Ca2+ binding sites, bound to the neck domain. There is direct evidence that calmodulin dissociates from M-Va in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ (11Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Excess calmodulin protects against the irreversible blocking of motility by calcium, although the velocity of movement is still lowered in the presence of calcium (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K.

In the experiments described here, we show that micromolar Ca2+ induces high affinity binding of native chick M-Va to actin filaments in the presence of ATP or its nonhydrolyzable derivative, ATPγS. Three distinct methods have been used to characterize the actomyosin-Va complex induced by calcium: (a) cosedimentation of M-Va with F-actin, (b) quenching of pyrene-labeled F-actin by M-Va, and (c) electron microscopy imaging of the negative-stained actomyosin-Va. The results indicate that micromolar Ca2+ can be a switch that regulates the actin binding properties of M-Va and, consequently, may participate in the mechanism underlying processivity of this myosin.

Fragment S1 from skeletal muscle myosin II was obtained by the method of Margossian and Lowey (25Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85, part B: 55-71Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The binding of M-Va to phalloidin-stabilized F-actin was assayed in buffer A (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 2 mm ATP, ADP, or ATPγS and Ca2+ concentrations as indicated. When done in the presence of the ATP-regenerating system, the reactions also contained 0.22 mm NADH, 20 units/ml lactic dehydrogenase, 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.5 mmphospho(enol)pyruvate, as described by De La Cruz (29De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A Ca-EGTA buffer was used in the assays covering a range of free [Ca2+] up to 10 µm. Free [Ca2+] was calculated using the computer program Mcalc (26Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) with the Schwartzenbach dissociation constants. Unless otherwise stated, samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (100,000 × g for 30 min) to pellet F-actin. Resulting supernatants, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantified by densitometry and analyzed by using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Fluorescence assays were performed in quartz microcuvettes using buffer P (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The concentration of pyrene-actin was fixed at 0.30 µm, and varying concentrations of M-Va or muscle myosin S1 were added as indicated. The mixtures were excited at 365 nm and the emission monitored at 405 nm using a DeltaScan fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Mammoth Junction, NJ). The data were collected on line using the computer program Felix (Photon Technology International). This instrument was on loan from Photon Technology International to the Marine Biological Laboratory. For the steady state studies, reactions were mixed 1 min before taking a reading, and for the kinetic studies, readings were initiated as quickly as possible after mixing and thereafter taken at 1–30-s intervals. The S1 fragment from skeletal muscle myosin II was used as a control. For negative staining of actin filaments decorated with M-Va, mixtures of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin (0.48–1.0 µm) and M-Va (0.1–0.48 µm) were incubated for 5–10 s in buffer A in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP or ATPγS and then immediately applied to nitrocellulose-carbon-coated copper grids for 10–20 s, rinsed, and fixed by application of buffer A containing 2% glutaraldehyde and negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate. Pyrene-actin was obtained by conjugatingN-(1–1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to purified actin as described by Kouyama and Mihashi (27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–20% linear gradient mini-gels. The concentrations of purified proteins were calculated based on the following extinction coefficients at 280 nm for 1 mg/ml solutions: 1.04 for M-Va (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E.

Several laboratories have now shown that M-Va has an unusually high affinity for F-actin in the presence of ATP, based on determinations of the activation of the MgATPase by F-actin (K ATPasevalues ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 µm) and by cosedimentation and light scattering studies of M-Va and low concentrations of F-actin in the presence of ATP (7Trybus K.M.

Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previous studies on native chick M-Va (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have shown that the ATPase activity and the percentage of M-Va that cosedimented with F-actin was significantly increased by the addition of Ca2+ at micromolar concentrations. In the experiments described here (Fig.1A), we obtained very little cosedimentation in the presence of ATP at submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and nearly 100% cosedimentation of chick M-Va with 1 µm F-actin in the presence of ∼10 µmfree [Ca2+]. The effect of Ca2+ was reversible, since the sequential addition of EGTA, after incubation with Ca2+, liberated M-Va to the supernatant (Fig.1 A). Since Ca2+ stimulates the ATP hydrolytic activity of M-Va, and since ADP has a relatively high affinity for M-Va, we considered the possibility that the Ca2+ effect is mediated by the formation of ADP and displacement of ATP at the nucleotide-binding site. However, the presence of ADP at equimolar concentration with ATP did not induce cosedimentation of M-Va and actin in the absence of Ca2+, although ADP alone clearly did (Fig. 1 A). Also, when done in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, Ca2+ still induced the cosedimentation of M-Va and actin (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the data indicate that ADP does not mediate the Ca2+ effect. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the cosedimentation (Fig.2) was highly cooperative with a maximum effect at about 3 µm Ca2+. A Hill plot of the data (not shown) suggests the involvement of about eight Ca2+-binding sites per myosin molecule. This result is strikingly similar to the activation curve of the actin-activated, MgATPase of M-Va over the same range of Ca2+ concentrations (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and, thus, suggests that calcium is affecting the ATPase activity and myosin binding to actin via a common effector. Since there are four to five calmodulin molecules bound to each neck domain of M-Va, and each calmodulin has four potential Ca2+-binding sites, the data are consistent with the involvement of at least two or more molecules of calmodulin per M-Va. The present data show that micromolar Ca2+ indeed induces reversible binding of M-Va to F-actin in the presence of ATP.Figure 2The effect of Ca2+ on the cosedimentation of M-Va and F-actin is highly cooperative in the micromolar range. The percentage of M-Va in the pellet was determined by densitometry of the M-Va heavy chain after cosedimentation assays performed as in Fig. 1, except that the free Ca2+ concentration was varied from submicromolar concentrations up to 3.5 µm. The cosedimentation of M-Va in the absence of ATP was considered to be 100%. Each data point is the average of three determinations. The line was drawn connecting the average values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Almost complete cosedimentation of M-Va was obtained at submicromolar concentrations of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ and either ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS (Fig. 3). Both nucleotides gave similar activation curves, and the joint data indicate that 50% of the M-Va cosedimented with F-actin at concentrations of ∼0.1 µm. Note that about 0.3 µm actin was capable of binding 0.3 µmM-Va, indicating that single-headed binding predominated under the conditions of this experiment. Thus, the Ca2+-induced binding shows a very high affinity for actin and does not appear to require the hydrolysis of ATP. To further characterize the Ca2+-induced cosedimentation, we tested the effects of temperature, elevated NaCl concentration, and Triton X-100. Cosedimentation experiments were normally done by mixing M-Va and F-actin from stock solutions on ice into buffered reaction mixtures at room temperature followed by incubation at 25 °C for 10 min in a water bath, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. In the experiments illustrated in Fig.4A, the reaction tubes were maintained on ice for 10 min immediately after the addition of the proteins, and either centrifuged directly or incubated at 25 °C for 1 or 10 min, followed by centrifugation. The results demonstrated that an incubation of about 10 min at 25 °C was necessary for complete cosedimentation of M-Va and actin. In Fig. 4 B, the addition of 0.6 m NaCl to the reaction mix partially inhibited the cosedimentation induced by Ca2+ in the presence of ATP, but not under rigor conditions (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the binding properties under Ca2+-induced cosedimentation are not equivalent to the rigor state. On the other hand, extraction with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 4 C) did not alter the cosedimentation whether in the presence or absence of ATP, indicating that Ca2+ induces a robust, detergent-resistant, binding state. A sensitive method for analyzing tight binding of myosin to actin is to monitor the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled F-actin (25Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85, part B: 55-71Crossref Scopus (825) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5A, increasing concentrations of M-Va promoted a decrease in the pyrene-actin fluorescence under rigor conditions or in the presence of ATP when Ca2+ was present. A single determination at 0.33 µm M-Va showed that Ca2+ was necessary for the quenching effect when ATP was present. The end point was approximately the same under either rigor or with ATP and Ca2+, although the concentration of M-Va necessary to attain 50% of the maximum quench was three times greater when ATP was present than under rigor conditions. The S1 fragment from skeletal muscle myosin also quenched pyrene-actin under rigor conditions to a similar extent, but with lower affinity, as M-Va, but not when ATP and Ca2+ were present (Fig. 5 B). Thus, M-Va is distinctive in this property. This method also allowed for a time course analysis of the effects of individual components on the myosin-actin binding. The fluorescence of pyrene-actin was first monitored with M-Va in the rigor state (Fig.6A). The addition of ATP resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence with a slower second component reaching maximum fluorescence in about 2 min. Then, the addition of Ca2+ resulted in an initial rapid drop in fluorescence, 50% of the total quenching effect occurring within about 40 s, followed by a slower component attaining fluorescent levels near those of the rigor state in about 10 min. (Note that since these experiments involved manual mixing, the exact kinetics was not determined.) Similar experiments with S1 from muscle (Fig.6 B) showed that ATP induced its disassociation from actin, but no significant quenching occurred upon Ca2+addition. The complexes formed by the addition of M-Va to F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP were examined by electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations using conditions identical to those in the cosedimentation assays of Figs. 1 and 2 (M-Va:actin at 1:10). As noted in earlier studies (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), under rigor conditions M-Va induces the formation of tight, actin bundles in both the absence (not shown) and presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7B), although “arrowhead” decoration of the filaments is not observed at these low ratios of M-Va to actin. In the presence of ATP, bundles were also seen in the presence (Fig. 7 D) but not in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7 C). These bundles, seen best at low magnification (inset to Fig. 7 D), are more curved than under rigor conditions. At saturating ratios of M-Va to actin we were unable to adequately visualize the bundles at high magnification because of the formation of uranyl phosphate precipitates. However, in the presence of Ca2+ and ATPγS, 1:1 mixtures of M-Va and actin contained tight, often highly curved bundles of actin (forming circles and figure eights) on which the M-Va cross-links could be detected (Fig. 8). In contrast to rigor conditions (20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); however, arrowhead decoration under these conditions was not observed. Since the tail domain does not bind actin (12Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these bundles are presumably formed by head-head linkages between two actin filaments.Figure 8Electron micrographs of actomyosin Va in the presence of Ca2+ and ATPγS.Mixtures of 0.24 µm phalloidin-stabilized F-actin with 0.48 µm M-Va in the presence of ATPγS and 13 µm free Ca2+ were negatively stained immediately after mixing.

This effect of Ca2+ has not been observed in any other myosin biochemically characterized to date. The similarity in the concentration range and cooperative behavior of Ca2+ on the actin-binding properties of M-Va shown here, compared with its effect on the actin-activated MgATPase activity (12Nascimento A.A.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggests that both effects result from a common site of action, most likely the specific binding of Ca2+ to multiple calmodulins associated with the elongated neck domain of this myosin. The exact mechanism that links Ca2+ binding to these effects is not known, although models for the structural interaction of light chains with the α-helical neck domain have been proposed (28Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and recent work has shown that at least two IQ motifs with bound calmodulins are sufficient to obtain Ca2+-regulated ATPase and in vitro motility activities (7Trybus K.M.

It has been demonstrated that Ca2+ induces the release of one or more calmodulins from the neck domain at micromolar concentrations (11Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E.

Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulated evidence clearly indicates that the calmodulins associated with the neck domain have a role in the Ca2+ regulation of the mechanochemical events of the motor-head domain. There is a clear, but unexplained, difference in Ca2+effects on the recombinant versus native M-Va samples. All of the recombinant proteins that express the head domain plus varying IQ and coiled-coil regions show actin-activated MgATPase activities and motility on in vitro assays more or less equivalent to the native protein, indicating that the basic, mechanochemical properties are well preserved for all of these biochemical fractions. On the other hand, quite unlike native M-Va (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), Ca2+ either has no effect or inhibits the actin-activated MgATPase of the recombinant proteins (5Wang F. Chen L.

Exogenous calmodulin can either partially or completely overcome the inhibition by Ca2+, but in no case has activation been shown. This difference was most pointedly demonstrated by directly comparing the Ca2+effects on recombinant and native murine M-Va (5Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, either the tail domain, present in the native but not in the recombinant fractions, is somehow involved in regulation of the mechanochemical events, or the functional, native light chain arrangement has not been achieved on the recombinant proteins. A third possibility, suggested by Trybus and collaborators (7Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is that the purified native protein has become “uncoupled”, perhaps due to the extraction procedure. The high sensitivity, cooperative behavior, and the reversibility of the Ca2+ effects on M-Va shown in the present study argue against this latter possibility. Recent evidence suggests that ADP release is the rate-limiting step of the mechanochemical cycle of M-Va (8De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Also, the affinity of M-Va for ADP is quite high, thus product inhibition rapidly becomes significant over short reaction times (29De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since Ca2+ also stimulates the actin-activated MgATPase of M-Va, we must consider the possibility that the effect of Ca2+ on the M-Va/F-actin affinity is indirect, via the formation of ADP and its competition for the nucleotide-binding site. The most direct evidence against this possibility, shown in Fig. 1, is the demonstration that the presence of ADP at equimolar concentration with ATP did not result in cosedimentation in the absence of Ca2+ and that even in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system the addition of Ca2+induced the cosedimentation between actin and M-Va. Furthermore, the pyrene-actin experiments, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, also address this question. Under conditions appropriate for low ATPase activity (very low actin concentration, 0.3 µm, well below theK ATPase of chick M-Va), the presence of 5 mm ATP brought the fluorescence up to free pyrene-actin levels, and in turn, the addition of Ca2+ caused an immediate, rapid drop in fluorescence, indicating the reformation of a tight actomyosin-Va complex. Finally, equivalent, high affinity binding also occurred with ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, as with ATP itself (Fig. 3); thus, the hydrolysis of ATP to form ADP was not a necessary step. Together, the evidence indicates that purified, native M-Va forms a tight complex with F-actin in the presence of ATP if Ca2+ is also present. This complex has properties unlike the rigor state, is reversibly undone by removing Ca2+, and does not require ATP hydrolysis nor the presence of ADP. The fact that Ca2+ has a dual effect on the mechanochemical properties of M-Va, activation of the actin-activated MgATPase activity and induction of high affinity binding between M-Va and F-actin, suggests that Ca2+ may participate in the mechanism of processivity of this molecular motor. There is much evidence that class V myosins associate with organelles in eukaryotes and have a role in their cellular transport (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The phenotype produced by mutations in the dilute locus in mice, whose product is M-Va, is illustrative of this role. Dilutemelanocytes are characterized by an accumulation of melanosomes at the cell center, whereas wild-type melanocytes show a polarized distribution of melanosomes toward the dendritic tips. In the latter case, this process delivers pigment to the keratinocytes and subsequently to hair and skin. Thus, M-Va has a role in the transport and/or peripheral localization of the pigment granules. A recently advanced hypothesis, coined the “cooperative/capture mechanism” (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), is based on evidence that long range transport of pigment granules occurs principally by bi-directional movement along microtubules, but a M-Va- and actin-dependent capture of the melanosomes occurs at the cell periphery where microtubules terminate and the cortical F-actin network is abundant. The mechanism of capture may involve physical restriction inherent to an isotopic actin network (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), but we also suggest, based on the biochemical properties of M-Va we have described here, that Ca2+ may act as a switch that would favor capture by increasing the M-Va and actin interaction. We would hypothesize that, under the normally low Ca2+ concentration in the cell, M-Va would be activated as a motor whenever in contact with the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, at local regions of higher Ca2+ concentration actomyosin Va would switch to a higher affinity, higher ATP turnover state, or “into an extremely low gear” as expressed by Provance and Mercer (1Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This would be a dynamic state that would tend to decrease overall motility as well as maintain localization and could be reversed by lowering Ca2+ levels. Indeed, Wu et al. (32Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and Tsakraklides et al. (33Tsakraklides V. Krogh K. Wang L. Bizario J.C. Larson R.E. Espreafico E.M. Wolenski J.S. J.

This dynamic process would confer plasticity to organelle traffic, linking melanosome distribution to signal transduction mechanisms. In fish chromatophores, increases in free Ca2+ have been seen to accompany pigment aggregation (34de Lauro Castrucci A.M. Visconti M.A. Hadley M.E. Hruby V.J. Oshima N. Fujii R. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ could trigger the accumulation mechanism at the periphery via regulation of M-Va/actin binding and induction of a dynamic anchored state at the cost of ATP cycling. We thank Domingus E.

https://openalex.org/W1977696637,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the potency and thermodynamic stability of human insulin are enhanced in concert by substitution of ThrA8 by arginine or histidine. These surface substitutions stabilize the N-terminal α-helix of the A chain, a key element of hormone-receptor recognition. Does enhanced stability necessarily imply enhanced activity? Here, we test by structure-based mutagenesis the relationship between the stability and activity of the hormone. To circumvent confounding effects of insulin self-association, A chain analogs were combined with a variant B chain (AspB10, LysB28, and ProB29 (DKP)) to create a monomeric template. Five analogs were obtained by chain combination; disulfide pairing proceeded in each case with native yield. CD and1H NMR spectra of the DKP analogs are essentially identical to those of DKP-insulin, indicating a correspondence of structures. Receptor binding affinities were determined by competitive displacement of 125I-insulin from human placental membranes. Thermodynamic stabilities were measured by CD titration; unfolding was monitored as a function of guanidine concentration. In this broader collection of analogs receptor binding affinities are uncorrelated with stability. We suggest that receptor binding affinities of A8 analogs reflect local features of the hormone-receptor interface rather than the stability of the free hormone or the intrinsic C-capping propensity of the A8 side chain. Previous studies have demonstrated that the potency and thermodynamic stability of human insulin are enhanced in concert by substitution of ThrA8 by arginine or histidine. These surface substitutions stabilize the N-terminal α-helix of the A chain, a key element of hormone-receptor recognition. Does enhanced stability necessarily imply enhanced activity? Here, we test by structure-based mutagenesis the relationship between the stability and activity of the hormone.

Biol. 1998; 279: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) has motivated examination of the relationship between the thermodynamic stability of insulin analogs and receptor binding (10Kaarsholm N.C.

Do mutations that stabilize the native insulin T state (Fig. 1) also enhance receptor binding, and if so, how can such effects be compatible with an induced fit mechanism of hormone-receptor recognition? The present study demonstrates that, contrary to a previous proposal (10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen O.H. Sorensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the activity and stability of insulin are uncorrelated among a set of A chain analogs. The substitutions affect the C-terminal residue and putative electrostatic capping box of a conserved recognition α-helix. A subset of insulin analogs with enhanced potency has been found to exhibit enhanced stability (Table Iand Ref. 10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen O.H. Sorensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This influential study focused on the substitution of ThrA8 in human insulin by alanine, histidine, or arginine. The A8 site defines one edge of the classical receptor-binding surface of insulin (1Pullen R.A. Lindsay D.G. Wood S.P. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Krail G. Brandenburg D. Zahn H. Gliemann J.

The enhanced activities of the HisA8 and ArgA8 analogs (relative to ThrA8) were ascribed to thermodynamic stabilization of this critical helix because of their higher helical propensities, including more favorable C-cap properties (11Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Chakrabartty A. Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11332-11336Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Additional stability may derive from an electrostatic interaction between the A8 side chain and the negative charge of GluA4 (a potential C-capping box; Ref. 10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen O.H. Sorensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whether a correlation between stability and activity is general or limited to these particular analogs is not known. Because this issue has functional implications in relation to the active conformation of insulin, we prepared multiple analogs, including substitutions containing negative and polar side chains at A8. In this broader collection we find that activity and stability are uncorrelated. A negatively charged GluA8 substitution, for example, stabilizes the free hormone but impairs receptor binding. The contribution of a putative [GluA4, HisA8] electrostatic capping box to the stability and activity of insulin was tested by the second site substitution GluA4 → Ala and found not to be significant.Table IPast studies of A8 analogs of human insulinAnalogPotency1-aPotency was measured by insulin-dependent stimulation of glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes.ΔGuCmid1-bCmid is defined as that molar concentration of guanidine HCl associated with 50% protein unfolding.m1-cThe m value (kcal/mol/m) is defined as the slope in plotting the unfolding free energy versus molar concentration of denaturant; this slope is often found to be proportional to the protein surface area exposed on unfolding.kcal/molMkcal/mol/MHuman insulin1-dCD studies of the unfolding of human insulin represent measurements at a protein concentration of 3 µm.1003.764.370.86HisA8 human3095.525.411.02AlaA8 human1123.924.510.87ArgA8 human3025.014.771.07Values are taken from Kaarsholm et al.

The DKP B chain is readily combined with variant A chains to provide a monomeric template (15Shoelson S.E Lu Z., X Parlautan L. Lynch C., S. Weiss M., A,. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this article we describe the synthesis and characterization of five analogs of DKP-insulin. Our results demonstrate that receptor binding is uncorrelated with either observed thermodynamic stabilities or tabulated helical capping propensities (11Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 12Chakrabartty A. Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11332-11336Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We propose a model in which the A8 side chain lies at the periphery of the insulin receptor and can thus introduce favorable or unfavorable local interactions at the edge of the receptor. Diverse side chains are readily accommodated at this edge and may be incorporated into novel analogs of therapeutic interest. 4-Methylbenzhydrylamine resin (0.6 mmol of amine/g; Star Biochemicals, Inc.) was used as solid support for synthesis of A chain analogs; (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl,O-benzyl)-threonine-phenylacetamidomethyl resin (0.56 mmol/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used as solid support for synthesis of the DKP B chain analog.N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-amino acids and derivatives were obtained from Bachem and Peninsula Laboratories;N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide andN-hydroxybenzotriazole (recrystallized from 95% ethanol) were from Fluka. Amino acid analyses of synthetic chains and insulin analogs were performed after acid hydrolysis; protein determinations were carried out by the Lowry method using native insulin as standard. Chromatography resins were preswollen microgranular carboxymethylcellulose (CM-cellulose; Whatman CM52), DE53 cellulose (Whatman), and Cellex E (Ecteola cellulose; Sigma); solvents were HPLC1 grade. The general protocol for solid phase synthesis is as described (17Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A manual double-coupling protocol was followed (18Chu Y.C. Hu S.Q. Zong L. Burke G.T. Gammeltoft S. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11278-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Asn in the synthesis of the A chain was incorporated into solid support by coupling N-tert-butoxycarbonyl Asp-α-benzyl ester with 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin. After the final deprotection the Asp residue was converted to an Asn residue. From 606 mg of GluA8 peptidyl resin, after deblocking, sulfitolysis, and chromatographic purification, ∼116 mg of purifiedS-sulfonated A chain were obtained. After analogous processing the following yields of other analogs were obtained: 125 mg of purified S-sulfonated chain from ∼602 mg of GlnA8 peptidyl resin, ∼235 mg of purified chain from 1.03 g of HisA8 peptidyl resin, ∼165 mg of purified chain from 0.8 g of [AlaA4, HisA8] peptidyl resin, and 136 mg of purified chain from 0.75 g of AlaA4 peptidyl resin. AlaA2 A chain was also prepared as a negative control (see text). From 610 mg of [AspB10, LysB28, ProB29] peptidyl resin after deblocking, sulfitolysis and chromatographic purification, ∼125 mg of purified S-sulfonated B chain was obtained. Crude S-sulfonated A chains were purified by chromatography on a Cellex E column (1.5 × 47 cm) as described (18Chu Y.C. Hu S.Q. Zong L. Burke G.T. Gammeltoft S. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F.

CrudeS-sulfonated DKP B chain was likewise purified on a cellulose DE53 column (1.5 × 47 cm), dialyzed, and lyophilized to yield the [AspB10, LysB28, ProB29] B chain S-sulfonate. Chain recombination employed S-sulfonated A chain and DKP B chain (∼2:1 by weight) in 0.1 m glycine buffer (pH 10.6) in presence of dithiothreitol. Insulin analogs were isolated from the combination mixture as described (18Chu Y.C. Hu S.Q. Zong L. Burke G.T. Gammeltoft S. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Katsoyannis P.G.

Rechromatography of this material on reverse-phase HPLC under the same conditions gave in each case a single sharp peak. The HisA8A chain was also combined with the native human B chain to obtain HisA8 human insulin as a positive control. Amino acid analyses and mass spectrometry in each case gave expected values. Radiolabeled [125I-TyrA14]human insulin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Receptor binding assays of insulin analogs were performed as described (20Cara J.F. Mirmira R.G. Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17820-17825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Human placental cell membranes were prepared (21Marshall R.N. Underwood L.E.

Membrane fragments (0.025 mg protein/tube) were incubated with radiolabeled insulin (∼30,000 cpm) in the presence of selected concentrations of unlabeled peptide for 18 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.25 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl and 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at pH 8. Subsequent to incubation, each mixture was diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer and centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed by aspiration, and the membrane pellet was counted for radioactivity. The data were corrected for nonspecific binding (amount of radioactivity remaining membrane-associated in the presence of 1 µm human insulin). Each determination was performed with three or four replicates (Table II); the values are reported as the mean and standard deviation of these multiple measurements. Binding studies of control analog HisA8 human insulin were undertaken with both placenta-derived membrane fragments at 4 °C and hepatic insulin receptor preparations at 24 °C (17Merrifield R.B.

Resonance assignment for DKP-insulin has been described (16Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol.

CD spectra of DKP-insulin analogs were obtained using an Aviv spectropolarimeter equipped with thermister temperature control and automated titration unit for guanidine denaturation studies. Denaturation studies were conducted in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 50 mmKCl. CD spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of 50 µm; the samples were diluted to 5 µm for equilibrium denaturation studies (Fig. 3,C and F). To allow comparison with the conditions used by Kaarsholm and co-workers (10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen O.H. Sorensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), guanidine denaturation CD studies were repeated for human insulin and HisA8 DKP-insulin in 10 mm Tris-perchloric acid (pH 8.0) at 25 °C. The data were fitted by nonlinear least squares to a two-state model as described (22Weiss M.A. Hua Q.X. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G.

Native and variant proteins exhibit similar m values; the conclusions are not affected by recalibration of the m value (slope) used in the linear extrapolation formalism. The values obtained herein for activity and stability in part differ from published reports because of conditions of study. Use of placental membrane preparations at 4 °C leads to lower estimates of enhanced activity than use of hepatic membrane preparations at 24 °C (18Chu Y.C. Hu S.Q. Zong L. Burke G.T. Gammeltoft S.

Diabetologia. 1994; 37 (Suppl. 2): S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Positive control studies of HisA8 human insulin yielded values of 212% ± 34 in the placental membrane assay and higher values in our hands (450–550%) in the hepatic membrane assay in accord with published values (10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J. Ludvigsen S. Olsen O.H. Sorensen A.R. Havelund S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Negative control studies of a low affinity substitution (AlaA2 DKP-insulin) in the placental membrane assay yielded values of ∼1%, which is also in accord with published values (24Kitagawa K. Ogawa H. Burke G.T. Chanley J.D. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,25Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The HisA8 substitution in the context of DKP-insulin enhances stability at 4 °C by 0.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, which is less than its reported stabilizing effect in the context of native insulin at 25 °C (ΔΔG u1.7 kcal/mol; Table I and Ref. 10Kaarsholm N.C.

To test whether this reflects a difference in experimental conditions or template context (DKP-insulinversus native insulin), we reinvestigated the stability of human insulin and HisA8 insulin relative to human insulin at 4 and 25 °C. The stabilizing effect of HisA8 at 4 °C (ΔΔGu 0.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) is similar to that in the DKP context. The higher values reported at 25 °C (10Kaarsholm N.C. Norris K. Jorgensen R.J. Mikkelsen J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10773-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are reproducible in our hands and reflect the lower relative stability of native human insulin at higher temperatures. Five analogs of DKP-insulin were prepared by total synthesis (Table II and “Experimental Procedures”). Chain combination yielded native disulfide pairing with efficiencies similar to that observed in the total synthesis of native insulin. Non-native disulfide isomers (26Hua Q.X. Gozani S.N. Chance R.E. Hoffmann J.A. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were not observed. Use of the monomeric DKP template simplifies biophysical analysis by avoiding possible confounding effects of insulin self-association (15Shoelson S.E Lu Z., X Parlautan L. Lynch C., S. Weiss M., A,. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CD spectra of the analogs exhibit similar helix contents relative to DKP-insulin as illustrated in Fig. 3 (A andD). 1H NMR spectra (pH 7 and 25 °C) are similar to those of DKP-insulin; each analog exhibits comparable nonrandom dispersion of chemical shifts characteristic of the T state structure. In addition, each spectrum retains the pattern of resonance line widths and chemical shifts diagnostic of the monomeric state (14Weiss M.A. Hua Q.X. Lynch C.S. Frank B.H. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7373-7389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional total correlation 1H NMR spectra reveal essentially identical spin systems with corresponding chemical shifts. This correspondence is illustrated for three analogs (Fig.4); the aromatic resonance of the proteins four tyrosines and three phenylalanines provide intrinsic probes of the major structural elements of the hormone. An example is provided by the chemical shifts of PheB24 and TyrA19, whose large secondary shifts reflect their distinct environments in the native hydrophobic core (Fig. 1). Such correspondence of chemical shifts provides evidence of structural similarity. GluA8 and GlnA8 analogs differ by a single functional group: a side chain carboxylate or carboxamide. The results of activity and stability measurements are given in Table II. Whereas the activity of GlnA8DKP-insulin is ∼120% (relative to human insulin), the GluA8 analog is 2-fold less active. Analysis of protein unfolding by contrast demonstrates opposing differences in thermodynamic stability (Fig. 3 F). Whereas DKP-insulin exhibits a cooperative and apparent two-state transition with ΔGu 4.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, GluA8DKP-insulin and HisA8 DKP-insulin each exhibit enhanced stability (ΔG u = 5.9 ± 0.1 and 5.2 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively; see Table II). Surprisingly, the extent of stabilization conferred by GluA8(ΔΔG u = 1.1 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) is greater than that conferred by HisA8 (ΔΔGu = 0.4 ± 0.2 kcal/mol). Substitution of the negative GluA8 charge by a neutral GlnA8 carboxamide attenuates the enhancement in stability. Although qualitative inspection of the unfolding curves strongly suggests that GlnA8 DKP-insulin is slightly more stable than DKP-insulin in accord with its greater C mid guanidine concentration (Table II), the inferred increment in stability is imprecisely determined (ΔΔG u = 0.2 ± 0.3 kcal/mol). Comparison of GluA8 and GlnA8 analogs thus demonstrates that a negative charge at A8 can be as stabilizing as was reported for a positive charge (ArgA8; Table I) but less active than a neutral isostere (GlnA8). The native DKP monomer and A8 analogs exhibit similar temperature-dependent changes in mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm in the range 4–50 °C (Fig. 3, B andE). To test whether the enhanced stability of HisA8 DKP-insulin is due to an electrostatic capping box involving GluA4, the latter side chain was substituted by alanine to yield the two analogs AlaA4 DKP-insulin and [AlaA4, HisA8] insulin. In either context the alanine substitution is destabilizing by 0.2 kcal/mol. Although this destabilizing effect is consistent with a general contribution of GluA4 to stability, our results exclude a specific r"

Pretreatment with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibited the adhesion of smooth muscle cells to fibronectin by 80%. This inhibition decreased as concentrations of fibronectin increased. In the presence of 200 µm GRGDS peptide, only 45% of PDGF-treated cells adhered to fibronectin compared with 80% of control cells. This indicates that a decrease in integrin avidity was induced by PDGF. Cell adhesion was partially restored when the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was inhibited with PD98059. The remaining inhibition of adhesion (50%) was independent of the fibronectin concentration, suggesting that the ERK pathway is involved in the decrease in integrin avidity. This was confirmed by depleting ERK protein levels by treatment with ERK antisense oligonucleotide. The adhesion of ERK control oligonucleotide-treated cells decreased by 41% when the concentration of GRGDS peptide was increased from 50 to 200 µm but only decreased by 11% in ERK antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells. Treatment with PDGF also delayed focal complex assembly and inhibited stress fiber formation. Consistent with a delay in tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, PDGF treatment caused a lag in focal complex formation, although this was not associated with any change in Src family tyrosine kinase activity. Our results indicate that PDGF inhibits smooth muscle cells adhesion by two pathways.

Cell migration involves numerous cellular processes that are spatially and temporally coordinated and occur in four steps, the formation and adhesion of protrusive structures at the leading edge, the translocation of the cell body and nucleus, and rear detachment (4Lauffenburger D.A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion appears to be a major component of cell migration. Moreover, cell migration is controlled by the strength of the interactions between the cell and the substrate. When the cells are highly adhesive they spread but do not move; however, the connections between the extracellular matrix and the cell surface must be firm enough to pull the cell forward. Maximal cell migration occurs at an intermediate level of cell-substratum adhesiveness (6DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling, called “inside-out signaling,” controls the interaction between integrins and ligands. This cell type-specific process (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) increases receptor affinity, which is brought about by a conformational change and modulation of lateral diffusion and/or receptor clustering (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Integrin affinity is defined by a dissociation constant and characterizes the interaction between integrins and soluble ligands. However, it cannot be used to characterize multivalent ligand binding. Integrin avidity characterizes this interaction and involves both affinity and receptor clustering. Affinity modulation is probably the predominant regulator of cell adhesion rather than receptor clustering (11Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Suppression of integrin activation via a Ras/Raf-signaling pathway (12Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) might modulate cell-substratum adhesiveness in growth factor-induced cell migration, but the consequences on cell adhesion are unknown. Contacts between the cell and the extracellular matrix are mediated by adhesive structures called “focal adhesions,” which are found at the end of bundles of actin filaments. Focal adhesions are composed of multiple cytoskeletal and membrane components linked to large aggregates of integrins (13Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). These structures are present in stationary cells but not in motile cells in which protrusive structures form small attachment sites called “focal complexes” (14Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). The disassembly of focal adhesions is required for cell movement (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) and is induced by growth factors that promote cell migration (16Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which they mediate their effects are not clearly established. Directed migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been proposed to involve Ras activation and the binding of both phospholipase Cγ and phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the PDGF receptor (17Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kun Kim H. Goo Rhee S. Williams L.T.

To assess the involvement of adhesion modulation in PDGF-induced cell mobility, we investigated the effects of PDGF on SMC adhesion to fibronectin. We found that PDGF inhibited SMC adhesion by two different pathways, 1) an ERK-dependent pathway, which decreases integrin avidity and adhesion when fibronectin-coating concentrations are low, and 2) an ERK-independent pathway, which decreases adhesion at all fibronectin-coating concentrations and is associated with delayed formation of focal complexes.

Primary cultures of SMC were established from media explants of pig aortas and were subsequently cultured up to seven passages in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (22Berrou E. Breton M. Deudon E. Picard J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cultures were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA for 96 h. The cells were placed into fresh medium 24 h before the experiments. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) were depleted by treating SMC with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the ERK1 and ERK2 translation initiation site. SMC were transfected 24 h after plating at 70–80% confluency with 0.4 µm ERK antisense (5′-AGC CGC CGC CGC CGC CGC CAT-3′) or control (5′-CGC GCG CTC GCA GCA CGC CCC-3′) oligonucleotides using the transfection reagent SuperFect at a ratio of 5 µl of liposome reagent per µg of oligonucleotide. SMC were incubated with the transfection complexes for 4 h in the presence of 10% serum. SMC were then incubated overnight with 10% serum, and finally, cells were made quiescent by serum starvation for 48 h. Twenty-four well plates were coated with fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific adherence was blocked by incubation with 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Quiescent SMC were harvested by limited treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Cells were washed in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (MEM) containing 0.2% BSA and 100 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and then resuspended in MEM containing 0.2% BSA. Cells were maintained in suspension in BSA-coated plates for 30 min before the addition of PDGF, incubated for 1 h, and plated out. The GRGDS peptide was added 30 min before plating. When appropriate, PD98059 was added to the suspended cells. The cells were incubated for 1 h before the addition of PDGF and then incubated for a further hour. Suspensions of control cells were incubated in PP1 inhibitor for 30 min before plating. Suspended SMC were transferred to fibronectin-coated wells at a density of 5 × 104cells/well. After 30 min at 37 °C, adherent cells were quantified by the acid phosphatase assay (23Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The absorbance was read at 405 nm, and nonspecific adhesion was determined in wells coated with 0.5% BSA. Suspended SMC were plated on fibronectin-coated wells (5 µg/ml). After 60 min at 37 °C, adherent cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet in 2% (v/v) ethanol/water for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with distilled water. Spread cells were not phase-bright, whereas unspread cells were phase-bright when viewed under a microscope. At least 1,000 cells were counted for each experimental condition. Suspended SMC were allowed to spread on fibronectin-coated coverslips (5 µg/ml) at 37 °C for different times. Adherent cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized for 30 min in 1% Triton X-100 in permeabilization buffer (300 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). Cells were then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% BSA for 1 h. Filamentous actin was visualized by use of Alexa 488-labeled phalloidin. Focal adhesions were stained with an anti-paxillin antibody and a Texas red-conjugated secondary antibody. Suspended SMC were plated out on fibronectin-coated culture dishes (5 µg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for different times. Adherent cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer, pH 7.4 (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 100 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 5 µg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined. Monoclonal antibodies directed against paxillin or polyclonal antibodies directed against the Src family tyrosine kinases, SRC2, were added to 200 µg of cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose either after the addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG or not. They were subsequently washed three times in lysis buffer without deoxycholate or SDS at 4 °C and once in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Samples were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was analyzed by immunoblotting with the PY20 monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody. Membranes were reprobed with anti-paxillin antibody to ensure that equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated. Total cell lysates from suspended cells were also analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-ERK2 polyclonal antibody. Bound primary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Src kinase activity was assessed by the enolase assay. Src immunoprecipitates were washed as described above and then twice with kinase buffer, pH 7.0 (100 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 5 µm ATP and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 5 µg of acid-denatured enolase was added as the substrate. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 to ensure that equal amounts of enolase were present in each sample. Gels were then dried, and phosphorylated enolase bands were visualized by autoradiography. We first examined the effects of fibronectin concentration on the adhesion of quiescent SMC. Ninety percent of suspended SMC rapidly adhered to fibronectin (5 µg/ml). Maximal binding occurred by 30 min. When the fibronectin-coating concentration was 0.5 µg/ml, cell attachment was 34 ± 2% of this maximal binding (Fig.1A). To examine the receptors involved in adhesion we used the GRGDS peptide, which prevents integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin. The addition of 2 mm GRGDS peptide inhibited 80% of SMC adhesion to 5 µg/ml fibronectin, whereas 2 mm inactive peptide GRADSP had no effect (data not shown). This indicates that integrins mainly mediated adhesion of SMC to fibronectin. Pretreatment with PDGF decreased SMC adhesion to fibronectin. The maximal effect occurred at low PDGF concentrations (≥0.5 ng/ml) and required a 30-min pretreatment period (data not shown). PDGF (2 ng/ml) inhibited the adhesion of SMC to 5 µg/ml fibronectin by 51 ± 9% (p < 0.002) and to 0.5 µg/ml fibronectin by 84 ± 4% (Fig. 1B). This shows that the effect of PDGF depends on the fibronectin concentration. These results show that pretreatment with PDGF inhibits SMC adhesion and suggests that PDGF modulates the integrin avidity of SMC. To determine the effects of PDGF on integrin avidity, we studied the inhibition of cell adhesion to fibronectin by the GRGDS peptide (0 to 200 µm). In the absence of PDGF, cell adhesion was slightly inhibited (19 ± 3%,p < 0.001) by 200 µm GRGDS peptide (Fig.2A). In contrast, in the presence of PDGF, cell adhesion was inhibited by 40 ± 3% by 50 µm and 55 ± 4% by 200 µm of GRGDS peptide (p < 0.001 compared with the control). PDGF-treated cells were more sensitive to the GRGDS peptide. PDGF induced a parallel increase in the inhibition of cell adhesion as the concentration of the GRGDS peptide increased (0–200 µm). However, no significant variation in cell adhesion was observed in the presence of higher concentrations of GRGDS peptide (200–1000 µm), suggesting that PDGF does not modulate integrins in the highest activation states (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PDGF regulates integrin-mediated SMC adhesion by decreasing receptor avidity. It has been reported that the Ras-linked mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediates the suppression of integrin activation (12Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) Therefore, we assessed the involvement of the ERK pathway in the inhibition of SMC adhesion by PDGF. Cells were maintained in suspension for 1 h in the presence of 0–20 µm PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation and were subsequently stimulated with PDGF (2 ng/ml) for 10 min. The phosphorylation state, which correlates with a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of ERK2, was investigated by Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ERK2. Suspended cells retained the ability to activate ERK2 in response to PDGF. PD98059 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK2 in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition at 20 µm (Fig.3A). In parallel, the effect of PD98059 on the inhibition of cell adhesion induced by PDGF was tested (Fig. 3B). In the absence of the inhibitor, cell adhesion to 0.5 µg/ml fibronectin was inhibited by 76 ± 3%. This decreased to 49 ± 4% (p < 0.001) when PD98059 (20 µm) was added. The decrease was only slight in the presence of 5 µg/ml fibronectin (from 56 ± 2% to 47 ± 2%, p < 0.05). Moreover, in the presence of PD98059, inhibition of SMC adhesion to 0.5 µg/ml and 5 µg/ml fibronectin did not differ significantly. Our results indicate that the inhibition of SMC adhesion induced by PDGF is independent of the fibronectin concentration when ERK is not activated. To establish further the involvement of the ERK signaling pathway in the decreased integrin avidity, we down-regulated the amount of ERK protein by use of an oligonucleotide that targets the ERK1 and ERK2 translation initiation sites, which are identical. Levels of the ERK proteins were decreased by 60–70% in cells treated with an ERK antisense oligonucleotide. The controls consisted of cells treated with transfectant reagent alone or with scrambled control oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). In parallel, we investigated the effect of the GRGDS peptide on the adhesion of PDGF-treated cells. Treatment with the ERK antisense oligonucleotide did not restore PDGF-treated cell adhesion in the presence of 50 µm GRGDS peptide (Fig. 4B). When concentration of GRGDS peptide was increased from 50 to 200 µm, the adhesion of cells treated with the transfectant reagent alone and with ERK control oligonucleotide decreased by 36 ± 2% and 41 ± 6%, respectively. In contrast, this decrease was reduced to 11 ± 7% (p < 0.01) when SMC were treated with the ERK antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 4C). This indicates that the decrease in ERK levels is associated with the reduced modulation of integrin avidity by PDGF and suggests that the PDGF-induced ERK pathway reduces integrin avidity. Moreover, in accordance with results obtained with PD98059 (Fig. 3B), ERK depletion partially restored the adhesion of PDGF-treated cells to 0.5 µg/ml fibronectin but did not restore the adhesion to 5 µg/ml fibronectin (Fig. 4D). Residual ERK expression (30%) might be sufficient to modulate the avidity of integrins expressed in the lowest avidity state and, thus, to induce an inhibition of cell adhesion in the presence of 50 µm GRGDS peptide. Thus, our results suggest that PDGF might modulate SMC adhesion by two distinct mechanisms, 1) the ERK-dependent mechanism, which decreases integrin avidity and adhesion at low fibronectin-coating concentrations, and 2) the ERK-independent pathway, which does not affect integrin avidity but decreases adhesion at all fibronectin concentrations. Mechanisms other than the regulation of ligand binding may also be involved in the modulation of cell adhesion. In particular, the organization of the cytoskeleton may affect the interaction between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix (8Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). We compared the spreading efficiency of control and PDGF-treated cells after plating on fibronectin for 60 min. PDGF reduced the number of spread cells (Fig.5A), from 74 ± 5 to 48 ± 7% (p < 0.001). This suggests that the ERK-independent mechanism involved in PDGF-induced inhibition of cell adhesion might affect the organization of the cytoskeleton. To investigate this hypothesis we examined the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in control and PDGF-treated cells. SMC were plated onto fibronectin and stained for F-actin and paxillin. After 30 min, F-actin was present in membrane protrusions (Fig. 5B,a). Cytoplasmic actin filaments were visualized after 60 min (Fig. 5B, b), and numerous stress fibers were present after 2 h (Fig. 5B, c). In contrast, only a few PDGF-treated cells had begun to spread by 30 min (Fig.5C, a). F-actin staining was visualized in the lamellipodia after 60 min, but cytoplasmic actin filaments were not detected (Fig. 5C, b). Moreover, few actin filaments were visible after 2 h (Fig. 5C,c). To determine whether the inhibition of stress fiber formation was accompanied by changes in focal adhesion assembly, we examined the localization of paxillin during cell spreading. Paxillin punctuated the periphery of control cells 30 min after plating (Fig. 5B,d). These structures, known as focal complexes (14Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar), increased in size, and typical focal adhesion appeared after 2 h (Fig. 5B, e and f). In PDGF-treated cells, paxillin staining was localized in focal complexes at the cell periphery after 60 min (Fig. 5C, e). Characteristic focal adhesions were visible after 2 h (Fig.5C, f), but the size and/or number of focal adhesion was lower than in the control cells. These results indicate that PDGF delays focal complex formation and inhibits stress fiber assembly. To confirm that PDGF inhibits initial focal complex formation, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of paxillin, which is known to be associated with focal adhesion assembly (24Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of paxillin followed by a Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin could be detected after 30 min and reached a maximum after 60 min (Fig.6). Pretreatment of SMC with PDGF delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, which appeared after 60 min and reached the same level as control cells after 120 min. In conclusion, pretreatment of SMC with PDGF delays tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, which correlates with the delay in focal complex formation. Different tyrosine kinases, such as focal adhesion kinase and/or Src, are activated by integrin engagement and are involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to integrin-matrix interactions. Because SMC adhesion did not induce focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation even though it is recruited at focal adhesions (results not shown), we examined the involvement of Src kinase(s) in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was completely abolished in the presence of 5 µm PP1, an Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig. 7A). We subsequently determined whether Src kinases are a target of PDGF action. Kinase activity was assessed in the presence and absence of PDGF after immunoprecipitation of Src kinases(s) followed by phosphorylation of enolase substrate. In the absence of PDGF, Src kinase activity was transient, reaching maximal levels (3–4-fold increase) after 10–15 min and then returning to basal levels by 20 min (Fig. 7B). Src kinase activity was not substantially altered by the presence of PDGF. These results suggest that the activation of the Src kinase is not dependent on focal complex formation. Delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to PDGF is not due to an inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinase activity. The adhesion of the cells to the extracellular matrix involves interactions between integrins and ligands, formation of focal adhesions, and cell spreading (8Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). We showed that PDGF inhibits the adhesion of SMC to fibronectin by interfering with these processes. PDGF dramatically inhibited SMC adhesion (80%) in low fibronectin concentrations (0.5 µg/ml). This occurred by ERK-dependent and -independent pathways, as shown by the partial restoration of adhesion in the presence of a specific inhibitor of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase) activation, PD98059. Moreover, the remaining inhibition (50%) was unaffected by the fibronectin concentration. These results suggest that ERK activation decreases integrin avidity (i.e. binding to multivalent ligand). The ability of the GRGDS peptide (0–200 µm) to prevent integrin-mediated cell adhesion was increased in cells that had been treated with PDGF, indicating a decrease in integrin avidity. Adhesion of SMC to fibronectin was inhibited by 80% in the presence of the GRGDS peptide (2 mm). This suggests that this adhesion is mainly mediated by αv and α5β1 integrins (25Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Ruoslathi E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In SMC, α5β1 integrin is the major fibronectin receptor (26Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Seki J. Koyama N. Kovach N.L. Yednock T. Clowes A.W. Harlan J.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but significant amounts of αvβ3 integrin are also present in porcine aortic SMC (26Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, consistent with previous studies (28Bilato C. Curto K.A. Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Cin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the anti-αvβ3 integrin monoclonal antibody did not affect SMC adhesion (data not shown), indicating that the αvβ3 integrin is not involved in SMC adhesion to fibronectin and suggesting that PDGF regulates the α5β1 integrin expressed in the lowest avidity states in SMCs. We confirmed that ERK is involved in the PDGF-mediated decrease in avidity of integrins by use of an oligonucleotide that targets the ERK1 and ERK2 translation initiation sites. The enhanced efficiency of the GRGDS peptide to inhibit the adhesion of PDGF-treated cells was significantly reduced after depletion of ERKs. Residual ERK protein (30%) might explain the partial restoration of integrin avidity, in particular, the inability of the antisense oligonucleotide to restore cell adhesion in the presence of 50 µm GRGDS peptide. ERK levels might be sufficient to modulate these integrins when they are in a low avidity state. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other pathways are involved. Our results suggest that growth factors can modulate integrin activation via an ERK-dependent signaling pathway in physiological conditions. The activation of integrins involves enhanced affinity and/or diffusion-regulated clustering (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), however adhesion assays cannot distinguish between these two mechanisms. Our observations are consistent with data showing that the activation of the ERK pathway suppresses the activation of the chimeric integrins expressed in Chinese hamster ovaries (12Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). They also indicate that the modulation of integrin activation might be involved in the Ras signaling pathways required for PDGF-directed migration (17Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Suppression of integrin activation by overexpressing active c-Raf inhibits matrix fibronectin assembly and results in rounded cells (12Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, in this study the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers was not examined. In our model, PDGF induces the inhibition of SMC adhesion to high fibronectin concentrations independently of the ERK pathway. Moreover, this inhibition correlates with an inhibition of focal complex formation, which was still observed after ERK inhibition by PD98059 (result not shown). These small adhesive structures are found at the periphery of the cell in the early stages of cell spreading (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 30Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and develop into large focal adhesions. Their assembly is independent of small GTPase Rac-induced lamellipodia formation (31Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and of small GTPase Rho activity (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The clustering of integrins into focal complexes induced by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 has not been characterized, but these structures contain the same protein constituents as focal adhesions (14Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms might be involved in the inhibition of focal complex assembly. First, assembly may be blocked by disruption of integrin clustering. However, adhesion was still inhibited when integrin avidity was restored by ERK depletion or ERK inhibition. Moreover, the activation (32Miranti C.K. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and focal complex localization (13Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) of Src family tyrosine kinases only require clustering of integrin. In our model, activation of Src family tyrosine kinases was not inhibited in PDGF-treated SMC. This suggests that PDGF does not inhibit integrin clustering. The second possibility is that cytoskeletal protein interactions and/or protein recruitment are inhibited. It has been proposed that focal adhesion assembly is regulated by paxillin (33Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 34Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. Mc Donald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), which is a focal adhesion adaptor protein that recruits structural and signaling molecules through its N terminus and is targeted to focal adhesions through its C terminus (33Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Associated kinases mediate the serine and threonine phosphorylation of the LIM domains of the C terminus (35Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) of paxillin. This phosphorylation modulates the focal adhesion localization rate of paxillin, which is correlated with the cell capacity to adhere to fibronectin. It remains to be determined whether PDGF can modulate the adhesion-mediated phosphorylation of LIM domains. Disassembly of focal adhesions mediated by growth factors precedes cell migration and reduces cell-substratum adhesiveness (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 36Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathway involved in this process is still controversial. Recent reports (36Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) indicate that focal adhesion disassembly induced by the epidermal growth factor is mediated by the protease calpain, which is activated by the ERK pathway. Loss of focal adhesions induced by treating SMC with degraded collagen is also mediated by calpain proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and talin (38Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe cleavage of focal adhesion kinase in PDGF-treated cells (results not shown). Finally, a Ras-dependent but ERK-independent pathway has been proposed to be involved in focal adhesion disassembly (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The effects of PDGF treatment on SMC adhesion might reflect this disorganization of focal adhesion. The small GTPase, Rho, controls focal adhesion assembly and stress fiber formation by stimulating actomyosin-based contractility (39Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Several studies show that Rho activity is down-regulated by Rac (40Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,41Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), which can be induced by PDGF (41Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Rho also controls the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 42Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar), which is not required for focal adhesion assembly (43Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and seems to be a consequence of this process (16Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In accordance with the literature (38Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 44Wilson L. Carrier M.J. Kellie S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2381-2391PubMed Google Scholar), we did not observe focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation in SMC despite its focal adhesion localization (result not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was correlated with the formation of focal adhesions in PDGF-treated SMC and was restored 2 h after plating. This suggests the involvement of a functional Rho signaling pathway. However, stress fiber formation was still inhibited. The remaining actin filaments in PDGF-treated cells might be sufficient to induce integrin aggregation and focal adhesion formation. However, their size and/or number were reduced and were not correlated with the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. This kind of discrepancy has also been observed in dominant-inhibitory Cdc42- and Rac1-expressing cells (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Several studies have found that Cdc42 is involved in the Ras-induced loss of stress fibers (45Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 46Coghlan M.P. Chou M.M. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and its downstream effector, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family, N-WASP, were recently shown to be activated by PDGF (47Jiménez C. Portela R.A. Mellado M. Rodrı́guez-Frade J.M. Collard J. Serrano A. Martı́nez-A C. Avila J. Carrera A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway depends on the p85 α regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is required for PDGF-induced NIH3T3 cell migration on collagen. Moreover, this pathway also mediates the disassembly of stress fiber and the reduction of focal adhesions. Consistent with our results, the formation of actin stress fibers induced by a constitutively active mutant, v-Rho, was inhibited by the expression of p85α. In summary we have shown that PDGF might regulate the adhesion of SMC to fibronectin, a process required for cell migration. PDGF regulates two of the steps involved in cell adhesion, integrin-matrix interaction, by decreasing integrin avidity, and the formation of focal complexes."

Factor VIIa is also an important therapeutic agent for hemophilia where its function may include TF-independent as well as TF-dependent mechanisms. This study compared the activity of wild type factor VIIa (WT-VIIa) with that of a mutant with elevated affinity for membrane (P10Q/Q32E, QE-VIIa). Phospholipid and cell-based assays showed the mutant to have up to 40-fold higher function than WT-VIIa in both TF-dependent and TF-independent reactions. Tissue factor-dependent reactions displayed the maximum enhancement when binding had reached equilibrium in competition with another TF-binding protein. In liposome-based assays, the association rate of WT-VIIa with TF occurred at a physical maximum and could not be improved by site-directed mutagenesis. A practical consequence was identical function of WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa in assays that depended entirely on assembly kinetics. Thus, factor VIIa mutants provided unique reagents for probing the mechanism of factor VIIa action. They may also offer superior agents for therapy.

This Gla domain provides the membrane binding site of factor VII. The activated form of factor VII, factor VIIa, in combination with tissue factor (TF), an integral membrane protein, provides the initial step of the blood coagulation cascade. Assembly of VIIa with membrane-associated tissue factor may consist of VIIa·TF plus VIIa-membrane contacts, generating a ternary complex with very high affinity. The VIIa·TF complex can activate factor IX to IXa and factor X to Xa and can autoactivate VII to VIIa (reviewed in Ref.1Nelsestuen G.L. Shah A.M. Harvey S.B. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 355-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two major types of hemophilia disease, A and B, are associated with deficiency of blood clotting factors VIII or IX, respectively. Factor VIII serves as a cofactor during factor IXa activation of factor X. Thus, the disease of hemophilia establishes that activation of factor X by TF-VIIa is insufficient for normal coagulation. A significant fraction of hemophilia patients develop inhibitors that prevent therapy with VIII or IX. Recently, factor VIIa has been found to be an alternative treatment (2Hedner U. Glazer S. Falch J. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1993; 7: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Hedner U. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, only about 1% of the 10 nm factor VII in plasma is present as WT-VIIa (4Morrissey J.H. Macik B.G. Neuenschwander P.F. Comp P.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 734-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The therapeutic dose of factor VIIa (90 µg/kg or about 50 nm in plasma (3Hedner U. Haemostasis. 1996; 26: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar)) is far above this level, and its mechanism of action is not understood. It is possible that factor VIIa displaces zymogen VII from TF, thereby increasing coagulation activity. Alternatively, high levels may act in a tissue factor-independent manner. That is, factor VIIa has a low enzyme activity in the absence of TF and also binds to activated platelets with low affinity. This weak activity may be the basis for therapy by high dose (5Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Oliver J.A. Roberts H.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Specific mutations of the Gla domain of factor VII (P10Q/K32E) increase its membrane-binding affinity (6Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the mutant (QE-VIIa) showed higher activity than wild type factor VIIa (WT-VIIa) in several assays, the magnitude differed with assay type. Furthermore, the behavior of the therapeutic agent, factor VIIa, was not thoroughly investigated. As a membrane-associated enzyme-catalyzed process, blood coagulation offers the prospect of large particles with many enzymes or receptors, conditions that favor reaction at the rate of diffusion (or particle transport) through solution. In vitro reproduction of particle-based enzyme behavior offers many challenges. These include replication of large particle size and large numbers of sites per particle. Of the few in vivo models available, dramatic outcomes of diffusion-limited events dominate such diverse biological phenomena as the regulation of neurotransmission (7Land B.R. Salpeter E.E. Salpeter M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7200-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and several aspects of bacterial physiology (8Martinez M.B. Flickinger M. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although discussed and illustrated with in vitro models (9Andree H.A.M. Contino P.B. Repke D. Gentry R. Nemerson Y.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8201-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), practical impacts of this behavior on blood coagulation are not fully developed. The present study was designed to improve the understanding of the mechanism of enhanced function by QE-VIIa. This mutant expressed 1- to 40-fold higher function than WT-VIIa. Maximum enhancement was observed in TF-dependent as well as TF-independent reactions. In liposome-based assays, WT-VIIa assembled with TF at a physical maximum, eliminating any benefit of the mutant in those assays that were limited by assembly rate. Enhanced function of QE-VIIa was found in circumstances where dissociation of the complex contributed to function. These results imply important features of normal blood coagulation and the conditions under which QE-VIIa may offer improved approaches to therapy. The mutant form of factor VIIa (P10Q/K32E, QE-VII) was described earlier, as were sources of soluble tissue factor (sTF), human brain thromboplastin, and the method for preparation of large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles from pure individual phospholipids (6Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mouse brain thromboplastin was generated from mouse brain acetone powder (Sigma Chemical Co.) by standard methods (13Quick A.J. Hemorrhagic Diseases. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1959: 376-379Google Scholar). Factor VIIa was a commercial recombinant protein from Novo Nordisc (Princeton, NJ). Pure, reconstituted tissue factor was a trademark product, Innovin (a purified, reconstituted source of TF provided by the Dade company, Miami, FL). The active form of QE-VII (QE-VIIa) was created by autoactivation during incubation with phospholipid vesicles (1.2 g of lipid per g of protein) at 37 °C in Tris buffer containing 5 mm calcium. Unless indicated, the Tris buffer used throughout this study was 0.05 m (pH 7.5) and contained 0.1 m NaCl. Maximum activation was achieved in about 45 min. QE-VIIa was separated from phospholipid by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose 4B in buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. The phospholipids eluted at the exclusion volume of the column, well separated from QE-VIIa. WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa concentrations were determined from enzyme activity toward S2288 substrate (0.24 mm, Chromogenix) at room temperature in Tris buffer containing 100 nm soluble tissue factor, 5 mm calcium, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 g/liter). Factor VIIa and sTF were allowed to assemble for 15 s, S2288 (0.24 mm) was added, and absorbance change was measured. The standard used for calculating enzyme concentration was the commercial, recombinant WT-VIIa. When compared on the basis of total protein, determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), QE-VIIa had about 80% the specific activity of WT-VIIa. Active site-blocked enzymes were produced by reaction of QE-VIIa or WT-VIIa (2.2–11 µm) with a 5-fold molar excess of phenylalanylprolylarginyl chloromethylketone (FPRck, Calbiochem) in Tris buffer containing 5 mm calcium for 2 h at room temperature. Amidolytic and coagulation activities were reduced to a non-detectable levels (<0.1% of the original activity). Inactive enzymes (VIIai and QE-VIIai) were separated from reagent by extensive dialysis against Tris buffer. WT-VIIai concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as the standard. J82 cells express abundant TF on their surface (14Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol.

This cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown to confluency in modified Eagle's media (Sigma Chemical Co.) containing 18 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmglutamine, and Pen/Strep (100 mg/liter). The monolayer was rinsed with 12 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 137 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl. The cells were detached by incubation with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml)-EDTA (0.53 mm) in phosphate buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with media containing fetal calf serum to inactivate the trypsin, and washed two times with standard Tris buffer containing BSA (1 g/liter). They were dispersed to a concentration of 3 × 107 cells per ml and stored on ice for 24–72 h. This treatment maximized TF expression on the cell membrane surface. Fresh or outdated platelet-rich plasma was obtained from the Memorial Blood Center, Minneapolis, MN. Platelets were purified by a standard protocol consisting of centrifugation onto a BSA cushion and gel filtration to obtain monomeric platelets (15Timmons S. Hawiger J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The buffer used for platelet isolation and storage was 3.0 mm phosphate-3.5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and BSA (3.5 g/liter). All coagulation assays were performed in 150 µl of total volume containing 37.5 µl of factor VII-deficient plasma (Sigma). For assays at equilibrium and without added VIIai, VIIa and TF (1.0 µl of Innovin per assay) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 112.5 µl of Tris buffer containing 6.7 mm Ca2+ and BSA (1 g/liter). Fifteen minutes was sufficient to reach maximum activity. Factor VII-deficient plasma (37.5 µl) was added to start the coagulation reaction. For competition reactions, factor VIIa, factor VIIai, and TF were incubated for 60 min, followed by addition of plasma to start coagulation. Incubations for up to 2 h had insignificant further impact on the result. Equilibrium was assured by varying the sequence of reagent addition. In one, VIIa was first assembled with TF and VIIai was added as the second reagent. In the other, VIIai was added to TF and assembly completed before VIIa was added. These mixtures reached the same coagulation activity within 30 min at 37 °C. For coagulation assays without pre-equilibrium of VIIa and TF, plasma, factor VIIa, and buffer were mixed (112.5 µl) and coagulation was initiated by addition of 37.5 µl of solution containing Innovin (1.0 µl/assay) in 20 mm calcium. In all cases, coagulation time was determined by the manual hand-tilt method. Evaluation of protein efficacy by competition with another (factors VIIa and VIIai) for the same site (TF), at equilibrium, relies on the ratio of the equilibrium binding constants for the two ligands (Equation 1), where VIIa·TF and VIIai·TF are the respective ligand complexes with TF. KDVIIa/KDVIIai=([VIIa][TF]/[VIIa·TF])/([VIIai][TF]/[VIIai·TF])Equation 1 An important requirement of Equation 1 was the use of [VIIai]free and [VIIa]free. Total protein concentration was known, and conditions were established where total protein approximated free protein. Generally, this involved use of low binding site concentration (TF) and high competing protein concentrations (VIIa and VIIai). Nonspecific interactions can also impact on the comparison so that validity was tested. The theoretical basis for an appropriate test was provided by rearrangement of Equation 1 to a Hill-type relationship (Equation 2). In this case, the competitor (VIIai) is part of the constant term.Log[VIIa]=log[VIIa·TF]/[VIIai·TF]+Equation 2 log((KDVIIa/KDVIIai)[VIIai]) A plot of log[VIIa·TF]/[VIIai·TF] versuslog[VIIa] takes the form of a Hill plot [log(y/(1 −y)) versus log(titrant)]. In this case,y is the fraction of TF bound by titrant (VIIa) and 1 − y is the fraction bound by a competitor (VIIai). The concentration of active enzyme (VIIa·TF) was estimated from the level of factor Xa formed by the reaction mixture (see below) and quantitated by comparison to standard factor Xa. Ideal behavior was tested by varying [TF] and [VIIai]. Equation 2 predicts that these plots will have a slope of 1.0, be unchanged due to altered [TF], but will shift in proportion to log[VIIai]. The activity of VIIa or VIIa·TF was also detected by factor X activation. Reactions contained VIIa, a source of phospholipid, with or without TF, and factor X (200 nm, Enzyme Research Laboratory, South Bend, IN). These were mixed in 250 µl of Tris buffer containing 5 mmcalcium plus BSA (1 g/liter). After a specified incubation time (1–5 min) the reaction was stopped by addition of excess EDTA (8.3 µl of 0.3 m EDTA per 250 µl of solution). Factor Xa concentration was determined from absorbance change at 405 nm after addition of 0.32 mm chromogenic substrate (S-2222, Chromogenix). Very low background values in samples containing factor X alone or factor VIIa·TF alone were subtracted, and factor Xa concentration was determined by comparison to the activity of pure factor Xa. For competition assays, VIIa, VIIai, and TF were incubated for 60 min in calcium-containing buffer before factor X was added. Data are plotted by Equation 2. The fraction of TF as VIIa·TF was obtained from the relationship in Equation 3. [(Xa activity without VIIai)−(Xa activity with VIIai)]/Xa without VIIaiEquation 3 The fraction of TF as VIIai·TF was equal to 1.0 minus the fraction of TF as VIIa·TF. Competitive assembly of VIIa and VIIai with sTF (17.5 nm, described earlier (6Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) was measured in 0.25 ml of Tris buffer containing 5 mmcalcium and BSA. Factor VIIa was added at saturating levels (100 nm) along with varying concentrations of VIIai. The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C followed by 30 min at room temperature. Chromogenic substrate, S-2288 (0.24 mm) was added, and absorbance change at 405 nm was determined. A small background from unbound VIIa was subtracted. For data analysis, Equation 2 was rearranged to Equation 4. Log([VIIai]/[VIIa])=log[VIIai·sTF]/[VIIa·sTF]+Equation 4 log(KDVIIai/KDVIIa)In this case, the sTF concentration was significant so that total VIIa and VIIai concentrations were corrected to their respective free concentrations. Bound protein equaled total sTF (17.5 nm) throughout the titration but was distributed between VIIai·sTF and VIIa·sTF. The concentration of VIIa·TF was estimated from absorbance change at 405 nm, compared with that at zero VIIai (where [VIIa·TF] equaled [TF]total, 17.5 nm). The plot provided an intercept related to the ratio of VIIa and VIIai affinities, log(K DVIIai/K DVIIa). Graphs displaying error bars represent the average and standard deviation for at least three measurements. For determinations showing no error bars, S.D. was less than the size of the symbol. Plots that do not show error bars provide individual measurements with duplicate determinations. All linear analysis represented the best-fit result made by the program Kaleidagraph. For titrations with factor VIIa, ideal behavior with 1–5 µl of Innovin per assay occurred at [VIIai] > 0.5 nm. QE-VIIa has an altered membrane contact site. If the mutations do not impact on interaction with TF, QE-VIIa and WT-VIIa should show identical interaction with soluble TF. This was shown by competition binding of QE-VIIai, WT-VIIai, and WT-VIIa to sTF (Fig.1A). Displacement of VIIa from sTF by WT-VIIai and QE-VIIai was measured by activity toward chromogenic substrate. The value of log(VIIai/VIIa) at the intercept (−0.87) suggested that WT-VIIai had about 7-fold higher affinity for sTF than did the competing WT-VIIa. The higher affinity of WT-VIIai for TF has been reported previously (14Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19875-19879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although QE-VIIai also displayed higher affinity than WT-VIIa, it was slightly less effective than WT-VIIai. This small difference could arise from impurities or inactive protein in the QE-VIIai preparation. The difference could result in underestimation of the advantage of QE-VIIa. Because the difference was small compared with those shown below, this aspect of QE-VIIai was not pursued further. The major observation was the near identity of WT-VIIai and QE-VIIai in a membrane-free state. This suggested that protein·protein interactions were generally unaltered by the mutations in QE-VIIa. Little difference between QE-VIIa and WT-VIIa was found in two types of TF-dependent reactions. In one, factor VIIa and TF were allowed to reach equilibrium in calcium-containing buffer. Factor VII-deficient plasma was then added to start the reaction (Fig.1 B). Similar outcome was consistent with the high affinity of WT-VIIa for membrane-bound TF. For example, the titrations approached saturation at log[VIIa] = 1.25 (18 pm factor VIIa). The K D for WT-VIIa and membrane-bound TF is well below this concentration (e.g. K D = 3–7 pm (17Waxman E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17467-17472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), providing quantitative binding of WT-VIIa and eliminating a benefit from the higher affinity of QE-VIIa. The similarity of WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa under equilibrium binding conditions was substantiated by measurement of factor X activation (Fig. 1 B, inset). As for the coagulation assay, the proteins gave similar titration curves that approached saturation at 15–20 pm factor VIIa. A second condition giving similar activity of WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa involved addition of TF and calcium as the last components of the assay (Fig. 1 B). These conditions required higher WT-VIIa concentrations than those that involved equilibrium binding, suggesting that the reaction was at least partially limited by the rate of WT-VIIa assembly with TF. Thus, identity of WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa in this assay implied identical association rate constants for these proteins. Assembly rates were rapid and could not be accurately determined by the methods used. However, approximate assembly rates were suggested by two assays. In a coagulation assay, 20 pm WT-VIIa was incubated with 18 pm TF for 20 s. Factor VIIai (2 nm) and factor VII-deficient plasma were added to start the coagulation reaction. The former blocked further assembly of WT-VIIa·TF and the latter initiated coagulation. The clotting time was 32 s. This compared with a clotting time of 28 s after maximum assembly of factor VIIa and TF and 58 s with no pre-assembly (Fig. 1). Thus, a substantial portion of the factor VIIa·TF complex had assembled in the 20-s preincubation. Factor X activation assays suggested a similar rapid assembly. WT-VIIa (5 pm) plus the TF concentration used in Fig. 1 B(18 pm) were incubated in calcium-containing buffer for 0 s, 30 s, or 15 min. Factor X (200 nm) was added. After one additional minute, excess EDTA stopped each reaction. The amount of factor Xa formed in the reaction with no preincubation was 15% of that formed in the reaction with a 15-min preincubation time. The Xa formed in the reaction that was preincubated for 30 s was 58% of that formed in the reaction with a preincubation time of 15 min. This suggested that about half of the factor VIIa·TF complex was assembled in a 30-s preincubation time. If the results of either the coagulation experiment or the factor Xa generation experiment were treated as a bimolecular association reaction (v =k[VIIa][TF]), k would be ∼109m−1 s−1. As discussed below, this analysis must be modified if the reaction occurred at the diffusion limit and on multisite particles. Nevertheless, the result was sufficient to show that assembly was very fast relative to nearly all other protein·protein interactions. A similar outcome for WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa for all conditions in Fig. 1suggested identical behaviors in many aspects. These included the kinetics of VIIa assembly with TF, the binding of substrate protein (factor X) and the catalytic reaction rate. Similar comparisons and conclusions were obtained when a preparation of crude human brain thromboplastin was used as the tissue factor source (data not shown). The superior activity of QE-VIIa was observed at equilibrium in reactions containing a competing protein, WT-VIIai. Fig.2A shows a plot of log(clotting time) versus log(VIIa) for reactions containing 2 nm WT-VIIai. The curves for QE-VIIa and WT-VIIa were displaced by ∼40-fold. Comparison in factor X activation assay showed approximately a 25-fold advantage for QE-VIIa (Fig. 2 B). The validity of this comparison was tested by its response to changes in factor VIIai concentration. Equation 2 predicts that the titration curves will change in proportion to log[VIIai]. Indeed, for both WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa, the titration curves shifted by the value of log(8/2) for titrations at 8 nm versus 2 nmfactor VIIai. Furthermore, the slopes of the lines were identical and ∼1.0 (Fig. 2 B). Similar shifts in coagulation titrations were obtained as factor VIIai was altered. Overall, ideal behavior predicted by Equation 2 was observed at factor VIIai > 0.5 nm and low TF concentrations (<20 pmTF). Membrane composition and concentration are important variables that influence the outcome of coagulation. The TF used in Figs. 1 and 2 was reconstituted in liposomes of purified phospholipids. A second source of TF, crude human brain thromboplastin, provided outcomes that were similar to those in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Although the phospholipids of crude brain thromboplastin are of biological origin, the organic solvent extraction may have major impacts on activity. A different source of TF was provided by J82 cell membranes. With intact cells, most TF is encrypted or present in an inactive form (20Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bach R.R. Moldow C.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 3270-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity becomes de-encrypted by a number of cell treatments, including those leading to cell death. The J82 cells were harvested and stored at 0 °C for 24 h to maximize TF de-encryption. The TF activity in the J82 cell preparations remained associated with large particles that were pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge. Comparison of WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa on this membrane source (Fig.3) gave similar outcome to that observed with pure, reconstituted TF (Fig. 2). Thus, although it is likely that the various membranes used in this study had substantially different affinities for the vitamin K-dependent proteins, the impact of the membrane may be similar for each protein so that the difference between WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa remained the same in all assays. Factor VIIa has a low enzyme activity without TF. This has been observed on vesicles and on activated platelets (5Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Oliver J.A. Roberts H.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 22Rao L.V.M. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1990; 75: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles of several compositions were tested, and typical results are shown in Fig.4A. In this assay, the QE-VIIa mutant gave ∼16-fold higher activity than WT-VIIa. As pointed out previously (6Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the difference between WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa will depend on the phospholipid concentration in the reaction. High phospholipid, with a corresponding high binding site concentration, will shift more WT-VIIa to the bound state, lowering the benefit derived from the higher affinity of QE-VIIa. Thus, the 16-fold difference in Fig.4 A may underestimate the difference in binding constants. The biological milieu contains other proteins that bind to exposed membrane. These may displace WT-VIIa and have the same impact as lowering the membrane concentration. In both cases, the number of available WT-VIIa binding sites is reduced. To test this effect, the experiment of Fig. 4 A was conducted in the presence of 2 µm prothrombin fragment 1, approximately the plasma concentration of prothrombin. Factor Xa production by WT-VIIa was reduced by 75%, probably due to displacement of VIIa and X from the membrane. QE-VIIa was inhibited to a lesser degree so the overall difference between WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa was 23-fold (data not shown). The reaction was also conducted at high factor X (2 µm). In this case, the substrate would force the enzyme from the membrane, giving lower total activity. QE-VIIa was 35-fold more effective than WT-VIIa under these conditions (data not shown). Thus, the enhanced activity of QE-VIIa was most evident under conditions of low phospholipid concentration and/or in the presence of other membrane-binding proteins. Both of these conditions should apply to the biological situation. Factor X activation by factor VIIa was also examined on activated platelets. As expected, the amount of Xa produced was dependent on the individual platelet preparation. WT-VIIa (50 nm) generated about 1 nm factor Xa in 60 min with 2 × 108 platelets per milliliter (Fig. 4 B). This was about half of the Xa production observed by others (5Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Oliver J.A. Roberts H.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). A second platelet preparation gave about 50% the Xa production shown in Fig.4 B. That reaction rates differed with platelet preparation was expected, because Xa production depended on the quality of membrane exposed during platelet activation, a property that is likely to differ with the individual. In any case, QE-VIIa was much more active than WT-VIIa in all assays involving platelets. The example in Fig. 4 B showed 25-fold higher activity. Rabbit tissue factor is used in some commercial thromboplastin reagents such as a product of the Sigma Chemical Co. It is adequate for standard assays. Indeed, titrations such as those shown in Fig. 2 A but with the commercial source of rabbit brain thromboplastin gave results similar to those in Fig. 2 A (data not shown). TF from the mouse is much more species-specific and interacts poorly with human factor VIIa (13Quick A.J. Hemorrhagic Diseases. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1959: 376-379Google Scholar). This low affinity presented the opportunity to compare WT-VIIa and QE-VIIa in the absence of a competing protein. Low affinity was indicated by the high total VIIa concentrations used. Total VIIa (Fig. 5) should approximate free VIIa. The cu"

For example, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme),1 the phage T4 DNA polymerase, and mammalian DNA polymerase δ all require auxiliary subunits and ATP hydrolysis.The E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is widely studied as a prototypical replicative complex. It contains three functional units: a polymerase core (pol III), a sliding clamp processivity factor (β2), and a clamp assembly apparatus (DnaX complex). The pol III subassembly consists of the α subunit, which contains the DNA polymerase activity; the ε subunit, which provides a 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity; and the θ subunit, the function of which is not yet well understood (1Gefter M.L.

Despite the import of the clamp loader, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of δ and δ′. We do know that δ′ interacts with both δ and DnaX, holding them together within the DnaX complex (26Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The δ subunit has a positive synergistic effect on DnaX-δ′ binding (27Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this subunit also interacts with the processivity factor β, facilitating its binding to primed DNA (28Naktinis V.

The δ′ subunit is a C-shaped molecule comprised of three structural domains determined by x-ray crystallography (31Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of δ′ is known, the function of δ′ domains within the holoenzyme have not been elucidated.As a first step toward deepening our understanding of the mechanism of clamp loading, we generated fusion proteins corresponding to different δ′ domains. In this article, we report the use of these reagents to map the portion of the δ′ subunit responsible for binding the δ subunit. Using surface plasmon resonance, we identified domain III (COOH-terminal 127 amino acids) as the δ subunit-binding domain of δ′. A panel of domain-specific mAbs was used to corroborate the assignment of domain III as the δ binding portion of δ′.RESULTSExpression and Purification of the Fusion Proteins of δ′ Lacking Specific DomainsVariants of δ′ proteins lacking specific domains were designed based on its crystal structure, which was determined by Guentheret al. (31Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification, detection, and immobilization, these reagents were expressed as fusion proteins tagged, on either the amino or carboxyl terminus, with hexahistidine and biotinylation sequences (Fig. 2). As defined under “Experimental Procedures,” and diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 2, the panel of δ′ fusion proteins employed in this study consisted of δ′N (40.8 kDa), δ′C(40.8 kDa), IC (22.1 kDa), I + IIC (26.1 kDa), II + IIIN (22.2 kDa), and IIIC (18.2 kDa). The levels of separately expressed δ′N, δ′C, IC, and II + IIIN, were each ∼1% of total cell protein as determined by densitometric scans of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). In contrast, the expression levels of I + IIC and IIIC were significantly lower (<0.1% each), and not distinguishable on Coomassie-stained gels of cell extracts. However, the biotin blot of these fusion proteins confirmed the induced signal of IIIC and I + IIC, respectively (data not shown). Separately expressed δ′ fusion proteins lacking specific domains were soluble, and were purified by Ni2+-NTA metal-chelating column chromatography (Figs. 3and 4). Biotin blots were used to evaluate individual elution fractions for the presence of the desired fusion proteins. δ′N, δ′C, IC, I + IIC, II + IIIN, and IIIC were the only biotinylated proteins observed in the corresponding eluted fractions (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the biotinylated δ′ fusion proteins were presumed to be the only proteins captured onto the Biacore sensor chip during the immobilization step. Most of fusion proteins of δ′ were purified to greater than 80–95% purity after Ni2+-NTA chromatography (Fig.4). IIIC, which was expressed at a low level, required further purification using MonoQ ion exchange chromatography, yielding preparations of about 70–75% purity (Fig. 4, Table II). Activities of δ′ proteins lacking specific domains were determined by a holoenzyme reconstitution assay. Both δ′N and δ′C had specific activities of 5.5 × 107 and 5.1 × 107 units/mg, respectively, comparable to that of native δ′ (1.0 × 108 units/mg)(Table II). However, none of the other constructs, each lacking either domain I or domain III of δ′ provided the holoenzyme activity (Table II), even when included at a 100-fold molar excess, or with increased incubation times (5–20 min at 30 °C). These data indicate that the deletion constructs (IC, I + IIC, IIIC, or II + IIIN) are not capable of supporting enzymatic activity at levels detectable with our assay system, and suggest that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the δ′ subunit are required for holoenzyme activity. However, misfolded fusion proteins would also be expected to yield negative results in reconstitution assays. We used Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography to determine the Stokes′ radii of IC, I + IIC, IIIC, or II + IIIN as an indication of whether they were properly folded (Fig. 5). Globular proteins with known Stokes' radii as well as native δ′ were used as standards. Three of the fusion proteins, IC, I + IIC, and IIIC, eluted in positions near the standard proteins of similar molecular weights. A plot of the determined Stokes' radii of these three proteins versus their calculated molecular weights gave a correlation similar to that of the standard proteins (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the δ′ fusion proteins corresponding to domain I, domain I-II, or domain III were globular, and presumably properly folded. One of the fusion proteins, II + IIIN, exhibited an unexpectedly large Stokes radius (Fig.5). Given that IIIC appeared to be properly folded (Fig.5), it seems reasonable to presume that the aberrant Stokes' radius obtained with II + IIIN was likely due to a partially unfolded domain II.Figure 4Purified δ′ fusion proteins lacking specific domains.A, 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the purified δ′ fusion proteins.

Open table in a new tab Binding Analyses of Native δ and δ′Biochemical studies show that δ′ binds both δ and DnaX (26Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The δ-δ′ interaction is necessary for recruiting δ into the DnaX complex (DnaX3δδ′χψ). Prior to evaluating the binding of δ′ fusion proteins to δ, we characterized the interaction of the native proteins via two techniques, surface plasmon resonance and equilibrium sedimentation. These experiments were performed for two reasons. First, the KD values obtained for the interaction of the native proteins serve as baselines for interpretation of results obtained using the fusion proteins. Second, we wanted to evaluate whether the KD value of δ-δ′ interaction obtained using surface plasmon resonance approximated that determined using equilibrium sedimentation. Surface plasmon resonance provides a rapid means of surveying interactions and binding kinetics, but it is not a true equilibrium method. Thus, we sought an experimental confirmation of the KDdetermined using surface plasmon resonance by a rigorous method, equilibrium sedimentation.Surface Plasmon ResonanceThe interaction between native δ′ and δ was first characterized via Biacore methodology. δ′ was immobilized onto a sensor chip by using the amine coupling method. Varying concentrations of δ were passed over the immobilized δ′, and binding was monitored (Fig. 6). Data obtained using subsaturating levels of δ were used to calculate the association rate constants. To preclude artifacts arising from reassociation (47Nieba L. Krebber A. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), off-rates were determined after saturating δ′ with δ. Data from several experiments were combined to calculate aKD(koff/kon) of 0.86 ± 0.07 µm for the binding of δ and immobilized δ′ (Table III).Figure 6Interaction of δ and δ′ by surface plasmon resonance.Samples containing different concentrations of δ (0.5, 1, or 2 µm) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmMg(OAc)2, and 5 mm DTT, with 0.005% BIA surfactant were injected over the immobilized native δ′ on a CM5 sensor chip. Binding signals are shown as RU. Arrows show the injection start point and stop point of δ. The association rate (kon) and dissociation rate(koff) were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the δ-δ′ interaction, followed by the calculation of the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD =koff/kon).

Open table in a new tab Equilibrium SedimentationBefore studying the binding of δ and δ′ via equilibrium sedimentation, we first needed to determine the oligomerization status, and then the partial specific volume, of each of these subunits alone. Different concentrations (1, 2, and 4 µm) of native δ (Fig.7A) or δ′ (Fig.7B) were evaluated in this first set of sedimentation equilibrium experiments. In each experiment, equilibrium boundary scans were taken every 4 h at rotor speeds of 14,000, 18,000, and 22,000 rpm, and the scans used for analysis were taken when repeated scans were invariant (Fig. 7A for δ, and Fig. 7B for δ′). Preliminary analyses of 9 data sets obtained for each of the δ and δ′ subunits were fit into the model of homomeric monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively. In both cases, the δ and δ′ subunits behaved as ideally sedimenting monomeric species. Only the models assuming monomeric forms fit the data from the equilibrium sedimentation of δ (Fig. 7A) or δ′ (Fig. 7B), with very low residuals distributed around the theoretical curve (<± 0.02 A280 units in both cases). These data indicate that δ and δ′ are monomeric when free in solution, confirming the previously reported findings based on gel filtration and other methods (26Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 7Interaction of δ and δ′ by equilibrium sedimentation.Equilibrium sedimentation studies of the δ and δ′ subunits were performed using an analytical ultracentrifuge. Representative data, curve fits, and residual plots are shown. A, sedimentation equilibrium analysis of δ. This profile was obtained after sedimentation of the purified δ subunit (4 µm by ε280) at 18,000 rpm for 40 h. B, sedimentation equilibrium analysis of δ′. Data for the purified δ′ subunit (2 µm by ε280) were obtained after centrifugation at 22,000 rpm for 40 h. For both δ and δ′, data obtained in separate experiments employing three different speeds (14,000, 18,000, or 22,000 rpm) and protein concentrations (1, 2, or 4 µm) were fit to Equation 2. C, sedimentation equilibrium of the δ-δ′ complex. Representative data, curve fits, and residual plots are shown for the δ-δ′ complex (2 µm) sedimented at 18,000 rpm for 40 h. Data obtained at the three speeds noted at two different concentrations of the δ-δ′ complex (2 µm or 4 µm) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, were fit to Equation 3. Residuals are expressed in absorbance units (280 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is important to note that the ν value of a given protein varies depending on the degree of hydration of residues in the globular protein versus free amino acids (44Perkins K.K. Furneaux H.M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the value of ν is normally calculated based on the amino acid composition of the protein and values for amino acid partial specific volume in water, there is greater uncertainty in this value than in the calculated monomer molecular weight (45Lewis M.S. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11571-11577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the sedimentation equilibrium data were then fit to Equation 2 in order to determine the partial specific volumes (ν) of δ and δ′ experimentally. Our determined ν value for δ (νδ) was 0.738 ± 0.001 cm3/g, and that for δ′(νδ′) was 0.758 ± 0.001 cm3/g. These values differed from the calculated numbers by 2 to 3%; the calculated values for νδ and νδ′ are 0.746 and 0.741, respectively. We used the experimentally determined values of νδ and νδ′ to analyze the sedimentation equilibrium profile of the δ-δ′ complex in order to calculate theKD (Fig. 7C). Using Equation 4, an equilibrium KD of 0.57 ± 0.03 µmwas calculated for the interaction of δ and δ′ under the conditions employed in this study. 2The KD of the δ-δ′ complex was 0.57 µm in the buffer employed in the equilibrium sedimentation study detailed in this report. This buffer consisted of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mmpotassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. However, we have also found that binding affinity is decreased at elevated salt levels in sedimentation equilibrium studies (data not shown). For example, the KD of the δ-δ′ interaction was 3.05 µm in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 3.48 µm in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. The averageKD value obtained in surface plasmon resonance experiments (0.86 ± 0.07 µm) was marginally greater, but reasonably close, to this value. In both cases, the standard deviation was acceptable for our purposes, although somewhat better agreement was obtained using sedimentation equilibrium (±5.2%), than surface plasmon resonance (±8.1%). The sedimentation equilibrium data for the δ-δ′ complex was fit to models assuming heterodimeric, -trimeric, and -tetrameric forms. Only the heterodimeric model fit the sedimentation equilibrium data. A lower ratio of δ to δ′ (1 to 0.6) was calculated based on the surface plasmon resonance data (Table IV). This lower stoichiometry may have been due to the immobilization of δ′ to the sensor chip surface via chemical cross-linking; some of the δ′ molecules are likely positioned in a binding-incompetent orientation. However, despite this limitation, the close agreement betweenKD values obtained in sedimentation equilibrium experiments versus Biacore-based analyses indicate that the latter is useful for comparing the relative binding of δ to δ′ fusion proteins.Table IVCharacterizing the binding of δ and δ′ fusion proteins lacking specific domainsδ′ formAnalyteAnalysis methodAssociation rate constant, konDissociation rate constant,koff4-akoff was calculated by injection of saturating amounts of δ over δ′ derivatives.Dissociation constant,KD4-bResults are the average of at least two separate experiments.Stoichiometry4-cThe apparent stoichiometry of δ to δ′ by Biacore was estimated by Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”).(ratio of δ to δ′)m−1s−1s−1µmδ′δUltracentrifugationNA4-dNA, not applicable.NA4-dNA, not applicable.0.57 ± 0.031δ′δBiacore2.0 × 1031.4 × 10−30.86 ± 0.070.6δ′CδBiacore1.1 × 1044.5 × 10−30.42 ± 0.070.67δ′NδBiacore2.3 × 1047.5 × 10−30.33 ± 0.040.41ICδBiacoreNo detectable bindingI + IICδBiacoreNo detectable bindingII + IIINδBiacore3.3 × 1048.9 × 10−30.27 ± 0.050.71IIICδBiacore1.8 × 1046.7 × 10−30.37 ± 0.080.434-a koff was calculated by injection of saturating amounts of δ over δ′ derivatives.4-b Results are the average of at least two separate experiments.4-c The apparent stoichiometry of δ to δ′ by Biacore was estimated by Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”).4-d NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Mapping the δ-binding Domain of δ′The panel of δ′ proteins lacking specific domains was employed to localize the δ-binding domain of δ′ via Biacore methodology. The interaction between δ and recombinant proteins corresponding to full-length δ′ with either an amino- or carboxyl-terminal tag was first assessed. Streptavidin was chemically coupled to a CM5 sensor chip, and δ′N or δ′C was immobilized via biotin-streptavidin interaction. Varying concentrations of δ were injected over and bound to the immobilized δ′N or δ′C, and the rate constants were obtained as described under “Binding Analyses of Native δ′ and δ.” SimilarKD values were calculated for the binding of δ to immobilized δ′N (0.33 ± 0.04 µm) or δ′C (0.42 ± 0.07 µm). These values were comparable to those obtained for the binding of native δ′ and δ (Table IV). Thus, including the tag at either end of δ′ did not appear to interfere with δ binding. Both δ′N and δ′C had specific activities comparable to that of δ′ in a holoenzyme reconstitution assay (Table II), further suggesting that the tag does not grossly compromise this subunits function.The interaction between II + IIIN and δ was characterized by a KD of 0.27 ± 0.05 µm, similar to that observed for δ′N-δ binding (Table IV). This indicates that residues sufficient for specific binding to the δ subunit lie within the second and/or third domains of δ′. In separate experiments, the other fusion proteins"

Although in some cases the protein-folding mechanism has been found to be highly cooperative, partially structured species have also played an important role during early stages of refolding prior to the formation of the native state. A number of reports and reviews have already suggested that the folding intermediate could have extensive native-like structural elements even in the absence of tertiary structural data, which are known as molten globular states (4Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 197-202Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Ptitsyn O.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct.

Biochem. Sensory Funct. 1976; 197: 235-242Google Scholar, 8Morris J.A. Cagan R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Native monellin consists of two separate polypeptide chains, a 45-residue A-chain and a 50-residue B-chain. Two-chain monellin is ∼70,000 times sweeter than sucrose and 300 times sweeter than the dipeptide sweetener aspartame (9Brouwer J.N. Hellekant G. Kasahara Y. van der Wel H. Zotterman Y. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 89: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Hough C.A.M. Edwardson J.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of two-chain monellin showed that the two chains are packed closely by both intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (11Ogata C. Hatada M. Tomlinson G. Shin W.C. Kim S.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies of two-chain monellin indicated that the A-chain can convert from β-sheet to α-helix in 50% ethanol and 50% trifluoroethanol solution. They also suggested that the molten globule state of monellin could exist in a solution of ethanol and trifluoroethanol mixture (12Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, a conformational study for both native and mutant monellin by a non-peptide analogue demonstrated that the three-dimensional structures of monellin and two thiol proteinase inhibitors, cystatin and stefin B, are very similar (13Murzin A.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that monellin might have some other biological role besides its sweet activity. An engineered single-chain monellin (SCM),1 constructed by fusing the two chains without disrupting its topology and sweet activity, has been proven more stable and sweet than the two-chain monellin under both high temperature and acidic conditions (14Kim S.H. Kang C.H. Kim R. Cho J.M. Lee Y.B. Lee T.K. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).We reported (15Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that engineered SCM exists as a monomer conformation in solution state, and the NMR data revealed that a long helix was folded into the concave side of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, showing that the residues responsible for sweet activity are mostly solvent-exposed. Interestingly, most of the residues involved in the sweet taste were found on the same surface of the molecule. In addition, the structure suggested that the relative orientation of the long α-helix is important to stabilize the global topology of SCM (15Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Sung Y.H. Shin J. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19624-19630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether the folding stability of SCM is important for its activity or not, even though it is suggested that the relative orientation of receptor-binding sites is responsible for sweet receptor binding, resulting in sweet activity.For folding studies of the engineered protein, SCM could be used as an excellent model for the following two reasons. First, it consists of two regular structural elements (α-helix and β-sheet) assembled perpendicularly. Second, as an engineered fusion protein of two molecules, SCM can provide the engineering effects of two separate units during the folding process. We report that the equilibrium unfolding pathways and stability of the engineered SCM proteins were studied by fluorescence, circular dichroism, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, and gel filtration chromatography. The detailed structural characterization of the folding intermediate in the unfolding process will be presented by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we will discuss the stabilizing effect of each residue important for the engineered protein based on mutagenesis and spectroscopic techniques. Understanding the fundamental folding mechanism for three-dimensional protein structures is considered as one of the most challenging areas in structural biology research. In recent years, studies of the refolding of chemically denatured proteins in vitro have provided insight into the fundamental nature of the folding process (1Shakhnovidh E. Fersht A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-67Crossref Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. Int. Edit. 1998; 37: 868-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 3Samuel D. Kumar T.K. Srimathi T. Hsieh H. Yu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34968-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although in some cases the protein-folding mechanism has been found to be highly cooperative, partially structured species have also played an important role during early stages of refolding prior to the formation of the native state. A number of reports and reviews have already suggested that the folding intermediate could have extensive native-like structural elements even in the absence of tertiary structural data, which are known as molten globular states (4Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 197-202Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Ptitsyn O.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sweet protein, monellin, was originally isolated from the berries of the west African plant Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii (7van der Wel H. Biochem. Sensory Funct. 1976; 197: 235-242Google Scholar, 8Morris J.A. Cagan R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Native monellin consists of two separate polypeptide chains, a 45-residue A-chain and a 50-residue B-chain. Two-chain monellin is ∼70,000 times sweeter than sucrose and 300 times sweeter than the dipeptide sweetener aspartame (9Brouwer J.N. Hellekant G. Kasahara Y. van der Wel H. Zotterman Y. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 89: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Hough C.A.M. Edwardson J.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of two-chain monellin showed that the two chains are packed closely by both intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (11Ogata C. Hatada M. Tomlinson G. Shin W.C. Kim S.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies of two-chain monellin indicated that the A-chain can convert from β-sheet to α-helix in 50% ethanol and 50% trifluoroethanol solution. They also suggested that the molten globule state of monellin could exist in a solution of ethanol and trifluoroethanol mixture (12Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, a conformational study for both native and mutant monellin by a non-peptide analogue demonstrated that the three-dimensional structures of monellin and two thiol proteinase inhibitors, cystatin and stefin B, are very similar (13Murzin A.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that monellin might have some other biological role besides its sweet activity. An engineered single-chain monellin (SCM),1 constructed by fusing the two chains without disrupting its topology and sweet activity, has been proven more stable and sweet than the two-chain monellin under both high temperature and acidic conditions (14Kim S.H. Kang C.H. Kim R. Cho J.M. Lee Y.B. Lee T.K. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We reported (15Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that engineered SCM exists as a monomer conformation in solution state, and the NMR data revealed that a long helix was folded into the concave side of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, showing that the residues responsible for sweet activity are mostly solvent-exposed. Interestingly, most of the residues involved in the sweet taste were found on the same surface of the molecule. In addition, the structure suggested that the relative orientation of the long α-helix is important to stabilize the global topology of SCM (15Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Sung Y.H. Shin J. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19624-19630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether the folding stability of SCM is important for its activity or not, even though it is suggested that the relative orientation of receptor-binding sites is responsible for sweet receptor binding, resulting in sweet activity. For folding studies of the engineered protein, SCM could be used as an excellent model for the following two reasons. First, it consists of two regular structural elements (α-helix and β-sheet) assembled perpendicularly. Second, as an engineered fusion protein of two molecules, SCM can provide the engineering effects of two separate units during the folding process. We report that the equilibrium unfolding pathways and stability of the engineered SCM proteins were studied by fluorescence, circular dichroism, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, and gel filtration chromatography. The detailed structural characterization of the folding intermediate in the unfolding process will be presented by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we will discuss the stabilizing effect of each residue important for the engineered protein based on mutagenesis and spectroscopic techniques."

This reaction is associated to the deactivation pathway of both soluble and lipid second messengers involved in Ca2+ signaling, proliferation, growth factor-mediated events, and apoptosis. In mammalian cells, this family of isoenzymes contains a series of distinct genes and splice variants (1Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol.

This enzyme, purified from many mammalian tissues (e.g. platelet, brain, liver), is now referred to as type I Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase (5Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecocq R.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Type I 5-phosphatase is unable to use the phosphoinositides as substrates and is therefore a quite different enzyme as compared with type II isoforms (also called type II, III, and IV; see Ref. 1Majerus P.W.

Type II, III, and IV 5-phosphatases can use both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate as substrates, and for some members of this family soluble inositol phosphate could also be substrates in vitro. Nine distinct isoenzymes (Type II, III, and IV) and multiple splice variants are known: INPP5P or inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase II (7Matzaris M. O'Malley C.J. Badger A. Speed C.J. Bird P.I.

The critical role of type I inositol 5-phosphatase in controlling the Ca2+ response and the Ca2+ oscillations in intact cells has been supported by the construction of mutants and their transfection in CHO-K1 cells stimulated by ATP. The pattern of Ca2+ oscillations in cells transfected with a phosphatase mutant that could not be prenylated remains unchanged in contrast to cells transfected with the wild type enzyme where the Ca2+oscillations were totally abolished (16De Smedt F.

Underexpression of the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase in rat kidney cells provoked an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 levels as well as in basal intracellular calcium concentration (17Speed C.J. Little P.J. Hayman J.A. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

De Smedt F. Moreau C. Rider M. Communi D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two groups reported that the enzyme can be activated by interaction with PKC-phosphorylated pleckstrin or with another platelet protein, i.e.14-3-3-ξ, in vitro (20Auethavekiat V.

It has been previously reported that Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activities of the isoenzymes A and B are sensitive to the Ca2+/CaM complex (22Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G.

In intact cells, the two isoforms are phosphorylated and activated by Ca2+/CaM kinase II (for isoform A, see Ref. 26Communi D. Vanweyenberg V. Erneux C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or by PKC and Ca2+/CaM kinase II (for isoform B, see Ref. 27Communi D. Dewaste V. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14734-14742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report for the first time that the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase is the target of a regulatory mechanism involving Ca2+/CaM kinase II-mediated phosphorylation both in vitro and in intact cells in response to Ca2+-raising agents. This effect appears quite general; indeed, treatment of rat brain cortical astrocytes, human astrocytoma 1321N1 cell line, and rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell line with carbachol provoked a transient increase in the phosphorylation of the 43-kDa isoform and a corresponding decrease in enzymic activity. An immune serum recognizing a 16-amino acid peptide (i.e.MALHCQEFGGKNYEAS) corresponding to amino acids 49–64 of human 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (28De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) coupled to hemocyanine has been generated in rabbits. It was verified that the antibodies (dilution 1:1000) immunodetected and immunoprecipitated recombinant type I 5-phosphatase. An aliquot of 2 µl of crude immune serum was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. For competition studies, 5 µg of the corresponding peptide were added for 1 h to the diluted serum before immunodetection. Primary cultures of rat cerebral cortex astrocytes were established using dissociated rat cerebral tissue at 2 or 3 days after birth, according to methods previously described (29McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected cortical tissue was washed and then dissociated by gentle repeated pipetting in modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% fungizone. Cells were decanted by gravity for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. Cells were diluted in complemented cell medium and plated in 10-cm-diameter or 22 × 22-cm-square dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO2. When astrocytes were adherent, dishes were agitated overnight, and the medium was changed after two washes. Astrocytes reached confluence after 7 days in culture and could be trypsinized 3 to 4 times (27Communi D. Dewaste V. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14734-14742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human astrocytoma 1321N1 and rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell lines were grown in the same complemented modified Eagle's medium. CHO-K1 cells were grown as reported before (28De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium, dishes, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing the human type I 5-phosphatase were obtained as previously reported (28De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When the different cell types were ∼80% confluent (7–8 × 106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium), they were washed twice with 2 ml of prewarmed KRH medium (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.45 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4). An aliquot of 2 ml of the same prewarmed medium containing the agent(s) was pipetted onto each culture dish. Cell incubations were terminated by aspirating the incubation medium before rapidly rinsing the cells twice with KRH medium. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman in 200 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, 5 µm leupeptin, and 15 µg/ml calpain inhibitors I and II). Final cell lysates were obtained by three successive cycles of freeze (in liquid nitrogen)/thaw. Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase activities were measured at 10 and 5 µm substrate, respectively (5Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecocq R. Vanweyenberg V. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Km values for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were estimated by measuring initial velocities in the presence of 0.1–50 µm substrate and by using a nonlinear least squares curve fitting of substrate-velocity relationships (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm). Sensitivity of the enzyme to magnesium ions was measured by assaying enzymic activity at 10 µm Ins(1,4,5)P3 and increasing concentrations of MgCl2 (0–50 mm). Okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, NaF, ATP, UTP, carbachol, histamine, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), Nonidet P-40, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Pefabloc was from Pentapharm. Calpain inhibitors I and II were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. KN-93, KN-92, KN-62, calphostin C, and forskolin were from Calbiochem. KN-04 was from U. S. Biological. [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were from NEN-PerkinElmer Life Sciences. SDS/PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection were performed as described previously (23Takazawa K. Lemos M. Delvaux A. Lejeune C. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When cells were ∼80% confluent in 6-cm-diameter culture dishes, they were washed two times and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's pyrophosphate-free medium supplemented with carrier-freeortho-[32P]phosphate (1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were subsequently washed in prewarmed KRH medium, and an aliquot of 2 ml of this medium containing the agent(s) was pipetted onto each culture dish for an incubation with agonist. Crude cell extracts were prepared as described above. Type I 5-phosphatase was immunoprecipitated using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled to anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-human brain type I 5-phosphatase antibodies. An aliquot of 90 µl of cell extract (∼600 µg of protein) was immunoprecipitated in the presence of 25 µl of pretreated protein A-Sepharose and 2 µl of immune serum. Immune complexes were separated by SDS/PAGE and detected by autoradiography using a Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposed for 24–32 h. Recombinant human brain type I 5-phosphatase was affinity-purified by metal chelation as described previously (30Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11676-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of purified recombinant human brain type I 5-phosphatase by Ca2+/CaM kinase II was performed at 37 °C for 5 min in Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 µg of 5-phosphatase in the presence or absence of 25 ng of rat brain Ca2+/CaM kinase II (Calbiochem), 2 µm CaM, and 10 µm free Ca2+ (if not otherwise indicated) in a final volume of 50 µl. Enzyme phosphorylation by rat brain PKC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was carried out in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 µg of 5-phosphatase in the presence or absence of 100 ng of PKC, 10 µm free Ca2+, 0.25 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 20 µg/ml 1,2-diacylglycerol (Sigma) at 37 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 50 µl. Phosphorylation samples were stopped at 4 °C and directly diluted in ice-cold enzyme dilution buffer before assay. In the case of radioactive phosphorylation, reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity ∼50 µCi/ml) instead of 1 mm ATP and stopped in SDS sample buffer before SDS/PAGE. To measure Ca2+/CaM kinase II-provoked 32P incorporation into 5-phosphatase, enzyme (2 µg) was phosphorylated in the presence of 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP (final activity ∼200 µCi/ml) for various times (0–10 min) with 2 µm CaM and 10 µm free Ca2+. After each incubation time, the sample was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose (Whatman), precipitated, and washed in the presence of 75 mmphosphoric acid before counting radioactivity (31Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The excised Coomassie Blue-stained gel band was treated as previously described (32Gevaert K. Demol H. Puype M. Broekaert D. De Boeck S. Houthaeve T. Vandekerckhove J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except that the protein was denatured in 8 m urea/Tris 0.1m, pH 8.5, and diluted to 2 m urea before tryptic digestion in 50% H2180 to label the C-terminal carboxyl moiety of the generated peptides. Tryptic digestion was performed overnight in the presence of 500 ng of modified trypsin (Promega). Adsorption onto Poros R2 beads (PerSeptive Biosystems) as well as mass spectrometry experiments for peptide mapping and sequence analysis by PSD on a Bruker Reflex III Instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH) were performed as previously reported (33Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried peptide-bound beads were mixed with 0.7 µl of 4 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.8 mg of 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After air-drying onto the MALDI target, MALDI mass spectra were recorded after ionization, achieved using a 337-nm nitrogen laser (attenuation between 15 and 25). In the reflectron mode, positive (monocharged) ions were accelerated to a total voltage of 26.3 kV. After selection of the interesting peptide, PSD spectra were acquired in segments, with a 15% decrease in reflectron voltage for each. PeptideSearch algorithm was used to search the non-redundant protein data base for direct peptide monoisotopic mass fingerprinting and PSD-derived sequence tag search. The Mascot algorithm (available at www.matrixscience.com) was also used for protein identification using peptide mass fingerprints and peptide fragmentation spectra. A 43-kDa band was observed after immunodetection with anti-type I 5-phosphatase antibodies in human astrocytic 1321N1 cells, rat brain cortical astrocytes, and RBL-2H3 cells (Fig.1A). The presence of the initial immunogenic peptide with the same immune serum during the immunodetection abolished the signal at 43 kDa (data not shown). After immunoprecipitation from a crude homogenate of 1321N1 cells and colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B), the protein was excised from the gel and digested in the presence of trypsin, and the generated peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Direct mass fingerprinting and sequence data obtained by PSD showed that the excised 43-kDa protein corresponded to the type I 5-phosphatase (Table I). In the supernatant obtained after immunoprecipitation from both cell types, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase activities were decreased by at least 90% as compared with unprecipitated enzyme (data not shown).Table IIdentification of Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P45-phosphatase from astrocytic 1321N1 cells by mass spectrometryPeptide mappingaExperimentally measured massTheoretically calculated massResiduesTheoretical sequenceDaDa1074.491074.52116–123NIYQFDFK1477.691477.70285–295LFDYFNQEVFR1497.701497.71225–236VSYFVFGDFNFR1605.77*1605.80284–295KLFDYFNQEVFR2040.032040.02296–313DNNGTALLEFDKELSVFK2241.122241.0997–115SQEHFTALGSFYFLHESLK2262.132262.05316–334LYELDISFPPSYPYSEDARPSD-based sequence verification of NH2-KLFDYFNQEVFR-COOH1-bThe peptide with an experimental monoisotopic mass of 1605.777 Da has been selected as a parent ion for fragmentation by PSD generating the typical C-terminal 18O-labeled y-ion series.

Incubation of rat brain cortical astrocytes and RBL-2H3 cells with carbachol provoked a transient decrease in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase activities,i.e. 40–50% as compared with basal activity after 15–30 s of incubation with the agonist (TablesII andIII). Maximal enzyme inactivation was achieved at 10–30 µm carbachol (Table II). The same results were obtained when stimulating the 1321N1 cells by carbachol (data not shown). Preincubation of rat brain cortical astrocytes and RBL-2H3 cells with okadaic acid for 30 min before receptor activation provided a maximal and more sustained inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase,i.e. 70–85% (Tables II and III). Long time incubation with the agonist did not allow the detection of any inhibition of enzymic activity. In each cell system, inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase was related to a decrease in Vmax but not to a change in the apparent Km value for Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4(Km = 9 ± 2 µm and 1.5 ± 0.3, respectively).Table IIEffect of Ca2+-raising agonists and okadaic acid on Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity in rat brain cortical astrocytes and RBL-2H3 cellsIncubation conditionsIns(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activityRat brain cortical astrocytesRBL-2H3 cells%No agent100 ± 9100 ± 12Carbachol, 0.1 µm (30 s)98 ± 4103 ± 4Carbachol, 1 µm62 ± 566 ± 13Carbachol, 5 µm47 ± 1047 ± 8Carbachol, 10 µm41 ± 647 ± 6Carbachol, 100 µm43 ± 545 ± 3UTP, 0.1 µm (30 s)105 ± 11UTP, 1 µm69 ± 9UTP, 10 µm51 ± 12UTP, 100 µm40 ± 12O.A.
