https://openalex.org/W1990734628,"A group of hydrolytic enzymes, including phosphatases and nucleases, is selectively released from E. coli and certain other Gram-negative bacteria by a process designated as osmotic shock. This procedure involves exposure of the cells to ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) in 0.5 molar sucrose followed by a sudden osmotic transition to cold, dilute MgCl2. Osmotic shock also results in an alteration of the permeability barrier of the bacterial cell and a depletion of the pool of acid-soluble nucleotides, but there is no loss of viability. On being restored to growth medium, the shocked cells recover after a lag period. Formation of spheroplasts by treatment with EDTA and lysozyme leads to selective release of the same group of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1598549227,"Abstract The hydroxylysine-containing glycopeptides from collagenase-Pronase digests of bovine tendon collagen were found to have glucose and galactose as their monosaccharide components. The ratio of galactose to glucose in these glycopeptides was greater than unity and after alkaline hydrolysis both glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylhydroxylysine were found. In order to determine the content of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine, galactosylhydroxylysine, and unsubstituted hydroxylysine present in tendon collagen as well as in several other collagens, analyses for these components were performed on the amino acid analyzer after alkaline hydrolysis. The other collagens studied were obtained from rat skin, rat tail tendon, carp swim bladder, rabbit sclera, and corneas from rabbits and calves. From most of these sources both the citrate-soluble and citrate-insoluble collagens were studied. In all of the proteins studied both glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylhydroxylysine were found, with the galactosylhydroxylysine making up from 46% of the total hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrate units in calf skin citrate-soluble collagen to 11% in carp swim bladder citrate-insoluble collagen. The citrate-insoluble collagens tended to contain a greater percentage of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine units than the citrate-soluble collagens from the same source. The percentage of the total hydroxylysine residues substituted by the glycosidic linkages of these units varied from 5% in rat tail tendon citrate-soluble collagen (0.4 carbohydrate unit/1000 amino acid residues) to 56% in the rabbit cornea citrate-insoluble collagen (5.8 carbohydrate units/1000 amino acid residues). All these collagens were shown to contain markedly fewer hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrate units than basement membranes, suggesting that higher levels of hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrate are reflected in lower degrees of morphological organization as seen under the electron microscope. The glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine and galactosylhydroxylysine obtained from the alkaline hydrolyses of the various collagens had the same migration on paper and ion exchange chromatography as the 2-O-α-d-glucosyl-O-β-d-galactosylhydroxylysine and O-β-d-galactosylhydroxylysine previously isolated from the bovine renal glomerular basement membrane. For structural studies glycopeptides containing the disaccharide units were obtained from the collagenase-Pronase digest of ichthyocol. The preferential release of glucose during graded acid hydrolysis of these glycopeptides and the isolation of a disaccharide with galactose on the reducing end indicated a glucosylgalactose sequence in these carbohydrate units. The disaccharide was split by α-glucosidase but was resistant to the action of β-glucosidase. Periodate oxidation, galactose oxidase treatment, and methylation of the glycopeptides indicated that the glucose is linked glycosidically to carbon-2 of the galactose. These results are consistent with a structure for the disaccharide of 2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-galactose, which is identical with that found for the glomerular basement membrane. In addition to glucose and galactose, the collagens contained small amounts of other sugar components including mannose, fucose, hexosamines, and sialic acids. In the collagenase-Pronase digests of ichthyocol and tendon collagen, glycopeptides containing these sugars could be separated from most of the hydroxylysine-containing glycopeptides by gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1564950588,"Abstract The FAD prosthetic group of milk xanthine oxidase has been removed by treatment with high concentrations of CaCl2. This agent has been shown to promote the hydrolysis of FAD to FMN. The deflavoenzyme has been shown to be devoid of xanthine oxygen reductase activity, and can be reconstituted by a short incubation with FAD. Reconstitution of xanthine oxygen reductase activity was also obtained with FMN; however, high concentrations were required. The absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the deflavoenzyme are similar to those of the simple iron-sulfur proteins such as the ferredoxins. Rapid reaction studies have shown that the deflavoenzyme is rapidly reduced by xanthine and glycolaldehyde, and that the loss of xanthine oxygen reductase activity is due to the fact that the reduced deflavoenzyme has a negligible reoxidation rate with O2. Consistent with these findings, the deflavoenzyme is catalytically active in the oxidation of xanthine with acceptors such as ferricyanide and cytochrome c. On the basis of these results, and of inhibition studies with cyanide, pathways of electron transfer in the reaction of xanthine oxidase with various hydrogen donors and acceptors are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2023228887,"The hydroxamic acid bond occurs in products from fungi, yeast, bacteria, and plants. The -CON(OH)-bond arises by oxidation of a free or bound amino group in a unit structure which is often closely related to conventional amino acids. Products are known with one, two, or three hydroxamic acid groups per molecule. The chemistry of the ferrichrome type compounds, which are ferric trihydroxamate-containing peptides, has been worked out in detail and includes a complete crystallographic analysis of the ferrichrome A molecule. The trihydroxamates form potent complexes with ferric ion, called siderochromes, and these are believed to play a role in the metabolism of the metal ion in microorganisms. The actual physiological activity observed ranges from that of growth factor, antibiotic, antibiotic antagonist, tumor inhibitor or cell-division factor. The precise molecular mechanism whereby these substances exert their potent beological activity remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1530055571,"The binding of pyrophosphate to myosin, heavy meromyosin, and Subfragment 1 was studied by an equilibrium dialysis technique. Myosin binds approximately 2 (1.82) moles/5 × 105 g of protein, K = 2.07 × 106. Identical results were obtained with myosin prepared by the ammonium sulfate precipitation procedure with or without LiCl and the dilution method. Red and white skeletal muscle myosin bound the same number of moles of pyrophosphate, and variation of the ionic strength up to 0.6 did not affect either the binding number or the binding constant. No selective blocking of any of the sites could be achieved with N-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzoate. Heavy meromyosin bound 1.83 moles of pyrophosphate per 3.6 × 105 g, and Subfragment 1 with a molecular weight of 9.74 × 104 to 1.19 × 105 bound 0.85 mole/105 g, K = 3.67 × 106. Natural actomyosin bound only 1 mole of pyrophosphate per 5 × 105 g of myosin. The addition of actin to myosin reduced both the number of binding sites and the affinity constant. The effect of actin on the pyrophosphate binding of heavy meromyosin was greater than on myosin and led to essentially complete suppression of binding. When heavy meromyosin was digested with trypsin (heavy meromyosin to trypsin, 16:1) at 23°, there was no alteration in the potassium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate activation or the calcium-activated ATPase activity. Isolated Subfragment 1 had a specific potassium-EDTA-activated ATPase activity which was 1.86 times higher than that of heavy meromyosin and a calcium-activated ATPase activity which was 2.60 times higher. After a 10-min tryptic digestion of heavy meromyosin, 25 to 45% of the total nitrogen was nonprecipitable with 6% trichloracetic acid. Disc electrophoresis of Subfragment 1 isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 contained two major bands and several minor ones in the leading edge of the peak, while the trailing edge contained only one major band and a few minor bands. The simplest explanation of these results is that tryptic digestion of heavy meromyosin produces two subfragments, each of which binds pyrophosphate, hydrolyzes ATP, and has the ability to combine with actin."

https://openalex.org/W2095062470,"Dormin (abscisin II), inhibits growth of Lemna minor cultures. At 1 part per million (3.8 × 10-6M), the culture appears nearly completely dormant but can be revived readily by transferring it to fresh medium free of dormin. The cytokinin benzyladenine, but not auxin or gibberellin, will counteract the dormin effect. Quantitative restoration of normal growth by cytokinin, however, can be achieved only if the dormin concentration does not exceed a critical level. Separation, after phenol-detergent extraction, of nucleic acids on methylated albumin kieselguhr columns showed suppression of nucleic acid synthesis by dormin in all fractions. Inhibition of the synthesis of the DNA fraction seems to precede that of RNA. Cytokinins reverse the process. They promote synthesis of all nucleic acid fractions, but again DNA seems to lead. Further work on the interaction of dormin with growth-promoting hormones might be facilitated by adopting the Monod model of allosteric transition, with, for example, DNA polymerase as the protein, dormin as the inhibitor, and cytokinin or other growth promoters as activators."

https://openalex.org/W1600959691,"Abstract Insulin did not stimulate glucose utilization or inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue cells previously incubated with trypsin. The acceleration of glucose oxidation by insulin was also reduced by prior incubation of cells with chymotrypsin, papain, or ficin, but not with purified collagenases or an acidic proteinase of Clostridium histolyticum. The loss of insulin effects was not due to destruction of the hormone. Furthermore, it appeared that trypsin did not digest cells nonspecifically since the treated tissue retained (a) a substantial lipolytic activity that was still responsive to epinephrine and adrenocorticotropin, (b) the capacity to oxidize glucose rapidly when sugar transport was stimulated by a high glucose concentration in the incubation medium, (c) a cell membrane that was not leaky to fat, glucose, or lactate dehydrogenase, and (d) a stereospecific sugar transport mechanism. These results suggest that a site (or sites) on the cell surface containing peptide components is necessary for the action of insulin on glucose transport and lipolysis. The site is probably distinct from the elements involved directly in glucose transport, lipolysis, and turnover of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1829054842,"The first reaction in protein biosynthesis has been presumed to be the interaction of ATP, amino acid, and enzyme (amino acid-activating enzyme, aminoacyl transfer RNA ligase, tRNA synthetase) to form an enzyme-bound aminoacyl adenylic anhydride. Such aminoacyl anhydrides could react forward with hydroxylamine or with tRNA or backward with [32P]-PPi. Experiments, primarily involving inhibitors, cast serious doubt on the existence of such a common intermediate in the enzyme-catalyzed formation of amino acid hydroxamate or [32P]-ATP from amino acid, ATP, and hydroxylamine, or [32P]-PPi, respectively. Studies with several enzymes indicate the probability of a general base-stimulated concerted reaction in which amino acid hydroxamate, AMP, and PPi are formed with no discrete intermediates. The esterification of tRNA resembles hydroxamate formation more than it resembles ATP-PPi exchange, strengthening the argument that the physiologically significant reaction does not involve an enzyme-bound aminoacyl adenylate. When tRNA is esterified in the absence of other bases, it is probable that one of the terminal ribose hydroxyls serves as a general base while the other is being acylated."
https://openalex.org/W1520161755,"Abstract A study has been made of the carbohydrate units present in the anterior and posterior portions of the lens capsules of calf and cow eyes. Digestion of the capsules with purified collagenase resulted in the solubilization of more than 90% of the carbohydrate and peptide portions. Further digestion with Pronase was employed to obtain the carbohydrate units in the form of glycopeptides with a minimum number of amino acids attached. Fractionation of the collagenase-Pronase digests by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography permitted the isolation of glycopeptides containing a glucosylgalactose disaccharide linked to hydroxylysine, glycopeptides containing heteropolysaccharide units, and some incompletely digested material believed to contain both of these types of carbohydrate units. Chemical (periodate oxidation, methylation, and graded acid hydrolysis) and enzymatic characterization of the glycopeptides containing glucose and galactose, as well as of the disaccharide isolated from them by partial acid hydrolysis, indicated that the structure of the disaccharide unit is 2-O-α-d-glucosyl-d-galactose and that it is linked by a β-glycosidic bond to the hydroxyl group of hydroxylysine. Measurement of the number of such disaccharide units was achieved on the amino acid analyzer as glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine after alkaline hydrolysis of the lens capsules. The migration of the glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine from the lens capsules was identical, both by ion exchange and paper chromatography, with that of the glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine previously obtained from the gomerular basement membrane. The lens capsules were found to have a large number of hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide units (37 per 1000 amino acid residues for the calf anterior capsule and 45 per 1000 for cow anterior capsule). All of the glucose and a large portion of the galactose of the lens capsule was accounted for in the form of this disaccharide unit. Approximately 85% of the hydroxylysine residues of the capsules were involved in these carbohydrate linkages. The glycopeptides containing the heteropolysaccharide units were excluded from Sephadex G-25, penetrated Sephadex G-50, and contained galactose, mannose, hexosamines, sialic acids, and fucose. Their composition and behavior during gel filtration was similar to the glycopeptides containing the heteropolysaccharide unit from the gomerular basement membrane. The ratio, on a weight basis, of disaccharide units to heteropolysaccharide units varied with age and position in the capsule, being 69:31 for the calf anterior capsule, 63:37 for the calf posterior capsule, 85:15 for the cow anterior capsule, and 77:23 for the cow posterior capsule."
https://openalex.org/W1596579902,"Abstract Cyclic 3',5'-AMP stimulates the rate of tryptophanase synthesis in Escherichia coli treated with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and induced with tryptophan. A maximal effect occurs at 4 x 10-4 m cyclic 3',5'-AMP and a half-maximal response at 1.5 x 10-4 m. The action of cyclic 3',5'-AMP is specific for tryptophanase since the over-all rate of protein and RNA synthesis and the synthesis of the biosynthetic enzyme tryptophan synthetase are unaffected. One site of cyclic 3',5'-AMP action appears to be after the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA since increased enzyme synthesis is observed in induced cells in which cyclic 3',5'-AMP is added after messenger RNA synthesis is arrested by actinomycin D, proflavine, or inducer removal. The half-life of the messenger RNA for tryptophanase is 3 min and is unaffected by cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP also fails to stimulate the conversion of tryptophanase precursor into active enzyme. Thus cyclic 3',5'-AMP appears to act at the level of the polysome to increase the rate of polypeptide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1663025195,"Abstract Iron analysis and titration data show that each mole of ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum reduces 2 moles of ferricyanide. The midpoint reduction potentials of the first and second reducing equivalents of this bacterial ferredoxin are found to be -0.367 and -0.398 volt, respectively. In aqueous solutions at pH 7.4 under helium, the oxidized ferredoxin is photoreduced by glutathione in the presence of hematoporphyrin. After the illumination, the reaction system slowly returns in the dark to its original condition in the absence of oxygen. Calculations based on the present data and the literature value of the midpoint potential of glutathione show that 3.2 kcal of light energy are stored per mole of electrons transferred from glutathione to ferredoxin in the final reaction mixture. The spectrometric and electron spin resonance data show that in this reaction the excited hematoporphyrin first captures an electron from glutathione to form a porphyrin radical, which then transfers its extra electron to ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1514714711,"Abstract Uridine diphosphogalactose 4-epimerase of Escherichia coli had previously been shown to have a molecular weight of 7.9 x 104 and to contain 1 molecule of tightly bound DPN (Wilson, D. B., and Hogness, D. S., J. Biol. Chem., 239, 2469 (1964)). This enzyme is further characterized here with regard to (a) amino acid composition, (b) number of tryptic peptides, (c) amino-terminal residues, and (d) molecular weight in guanidine hydrochloride. The number of tryptic peptides indicates that an amino acid sequence of 360 residues is represented twice within the native enzyme. The finding of only one pair of amino-terminal residues (aspartic acid) per enzyme molecule and the reduction of the molecular weight by a factor of 2 in guanidine hydrochloride are consistent with the simplest conclusion that the sequence of 360 residues is contained within a single polypeptide. Uridine diphosphogalactose 4-epimerase therefore appears to be a complex consisting of two identical polypeptides and one molecule of DPN held together by noncovalent bonds. Some implications regarding the size of the structural gene for this enzyme and the nature of the binding sites for DPN are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1534918773,"Abstract The metabolism of l-lactate and pyruvate, labeled uniformly with 14C, by epididymal fat pad tissue of fasted and fasted-refed rats was studied. In tissue of fasted-refed rats, pyruvate and l-lactate were utilized at equal rates. l-Lactate was nearly all converted into CO2 and fatty acids, and pyruvate into CO2, fatty acids, and l-lactate. The incorporation of 14C into glycerol was very low. l-Lactate was a better precursor of fatty acids than pyruvate. In tissue of fasted rats, pyruvate utilization was depressed, but still proceeded at an appreciable rate, and pyruvate carbon was incorporated into fatty acids and glycerol. The utilization of l-lactate by tissue of fasted rats was very low, and there was insignificant incorporation into lipids. Addition of unlabeled pyruvate or glucose to tissue of fasted rats metabolizing uniformly labeled l-lactate-14C increased 14C incorporation into CO2 and very markedly into lipid, but there was no net uptake of l-lactate. The 14C yields reflect exchange between labeled l-lactate and unlabeled pyruvate. Addition of malate, aspartate, α-ketoglutarate, and glutamate did not increase the utilization of uniformly labeled l-lactate-14C by tissue of fasted rats, but aspartate and α-ketoglutarate when added together stimulated l-lactate uptake, and incorporation of 14C into CO2 and lipids. Addition of oxalacetate and propionate increased to some extent 14C incorporation into CO2 and lipid, without appreciably stimulating l-lactate uptake. Addition of α-ketobutyrate or acetoacetate stimulated incorporation of l-lactate carbon into CO2 and lipids and net utilization of l-lactate by tissue of fasted rats. There was accumulation of α-hydroxybutyrate but not of β-hydroxybutyrate. Addition of acetate or β-hydroxybutyric acid was without effect. We conclude that in adipose tissue of rats there is no transfer of hydrogen equivalents from cytoplasm to mitochondria. When lipogenesis is pronounced, cytoplasmic hydrogen equivalents are all used in reductive biosynthesis; in the fasted state DPNH accumulates in the absence of lipogenesis, hydrogen equivalents from l-lactate oxidation cannot be utilized, and no l-lactate oxidation to pyruvate can occur."

https://openalex.org/W60230853,"Abstract The malate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli is controlled by DPNH in an allosteric manner. This is concluded from kinetic studies in which oxalacetate (in the forward direction) and malate (in the reverse direction) are, individually, the variable substrates and DPNH is the inhibitor. With oxalacetate as the variable substrate the initial velocity plots at very low (0.013 mm) and very high (0.65 mm) concentrations of DPNH are hyperbolic but become sigmoidal at intermediate ranges. Similarly, when malate is the variable substrate, the hyperbolic rate concentration plots in the absence of DPNH become sigmoidal in its presence. It has shown that ATP, ADP, and AMP also inhibit the enzyme in an allosteric manner, possibly by binding at the DPNH site. From a consideration of the kinetic data it is proposed that there is an active and an allosteric site for DPNH on the enzyme surface with only the active site releasing a product. The cooperativity of the rate concentration plots is explained on the basis of the development of alternate pathways for substrate binding and product release in the presence of DPNH. The physiological importance of inhibition of malate dehydrogenase (and other enzymes) by DPNH is considered and the conclusion is reached that this inhibition is necessitated in bacteria because of the absence of rigid, compartmentation controls and the desirability of preventing gluconeogenetic channels from functioning when growth is occurring on glucose."

https://openalex.org/W1482820663,"Abstract Rat liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase has been shown to possess two further catalytic activities: the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate and a pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activity. Physiological concentrations of bicarbonate ion (10 to 50 mm) have been found to inhibit all three activities. A detailed kinetic analysis of the nature and extent of this inhibition has been carried out, with both fresh and deoxycholate-treated microsomes. The effect of pH on the degree of inhibition, at constant bicarbonate ion levels, suggests that bicarbonate ion rather than carbon dioxide is the inhibitory species. The inhibition by bicarbonate ion has been found to be competitive with respect to phosphate substrate and noncompetitive with respect to glucose. Measurements at varied substrate levels, when plotted according to the method of Dixon, show that 1/v is a linear function of [I], suggesting that bicarbonate ion is binding at the catalytic active site. The Ki values calculated for the three activities (≅20 mm) show close agreement, providing further support for the belief that a common active site, and possibly a common enzyme-phosphoryl intermediate, is involved in all three activities. It is suggested that the observed inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase by bicarbonate ion may explain the observation of Hastings and Longmore that increased bicarbonate-carbon dioxide levels result in increased glycogen accumulation in rat liver slices."

The structure of the major glycopeptide was studied with sequential hydrolysis with β-galactosidase, β-acetylglucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase, as well as by oxidation with periodate. Evidence for a glycosylamine type linkage between aspartic acid and acetylglucosamine was provided by isolation of 2-acetamido-1-β-(l-β-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxy-d-glucose (β-aspartyl acetylglucosaminylamine). The major glycopeptide contained 4 moles of galactose, 3 of mannose, 6 of acetylglucosamine, and 1 each of aspartic acid and threonine. The molecular weight of the glycopeptide was 2540 by vapor pressure osmometry and 2840 as measured by forming the trinitrophenyl derivative. Four moles of galactose followed by 4 moles of acetylglucosamine were released per mole of glycopeptide when it was treated sequentially with highly purified β-galactosidase from Phaseolus vulgaris and β-acetylglucosaminidase from bovine liver. This treatment resulted in the exposure of an containing 3 moles of mannose and 2 of acetylglucosamine per mole of aspartic acid. Two moles of mannose and 1 mole of acetylglucosamine were split from the of the oligosaccharide with a crude α-mannosidase preparation from ivory nut, with or without added purified α-acetylglucosaminidase from bovine liver. The intact glycopeptide and its inner core were oxidized with sodium periodate. The results from the oxidation and enzymatic studies revealed that the acetylglucosamine linked to asparagine served as a branch point to 2 mannose residues. The likely structure of the glycopeptide is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1561905465,"Abstract Adenosine triphosphate has a dual effect on the incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into myosin at low ionic strength: free ATP increases the incorporation, whereas magnesium-chelated ATP decreases it. Most of the reagent was incorporated into the smallest active fragment isolated from the stepwise digestion of the modified myosin with trypsin. Free ITP, GTP, CTP, UTP, ADP, PPPi, and PPi were equally as effective as ATP in increasing the incorporation, whereas Pi was less effective and AMP had no effect. The protecting effect of MgATP2- on the incorporation could only be duplicated by MgCTP2- or MgUTP2-. The increased incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into myosin in the presence of free ATP and PPPi was the result of a greater reactivity of cysteine and tyrosine (and some lysine) residues in myosin. In the presence of Mg-ATP2-, the reactivity of cysteine and tyrosine (and some lysine) residues of myosin was decreased. Actin also protected myosin from the incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at low ionic strength. This protection similarly was localized in the smallest active fragment of myosin. Combination with actin promoted a change in the conformation of myosin in which no enhancement of incorporation was produced by substances that otherwise increased the incorporation into myosin alone. Tyrosine groups of myosin were less accessible to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in the presence of actin than in its absence. During the interaction of myosin with F-actin and MgATP2- at low ionic strength, certain groups of myosin became available for reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene."

The specific activity of the final preparation was 408. It was free of phosphatase and alkaline ribonuclease, and almost free of nonspecific phosphodiesterase, acid ribonuclease, and adenosine triphosphatase. Chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose prior to heating caused the bulk of the deoxyribonuclease to be eluted early, in a symmetrical peak containing phosphodiesterase (orthophosphoric diester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.1). After the crude preparation was heated at 60°, the symmetrical peak disappeared and was replaced by separate phosphodiesterase and deoxyribonuclease peaks. Repeated chromatography of the unheated preparation or mild heating (37°, with or without 2-mercaptoethanol) of the symmetrical peak caused changes similar to those seen after heat treatment of the crude preparation. The chromatographic data, heat inactivation, pH optimum, and activity on a number of phosphodiesters support the contention that the phosphodiesterase and deoxyribonuclease activities of the unheated preparation are on separate proteins."

Dispersion curves of two distinct types were observed depending on the initial mode of solubilization of hematin a. Type I hematin solution exhibited a complex ORD spectrum for the oxidized form (amplitude in molar rotation per dm, 14,000°; apparent cross-over point, 410 mµ) but a relatively simple Cotton effect for the reduced (amplitude, 59,000°; cross-over point, 397 mµ). Analysis of the experimental dispersion curves showed that the oxidized form is composed of at least four Cotton effects and the reduced, three Cotton effects. Type II hematin solution gave complex ORD profiles for both the oxidized and reduced forms. The magnitude of rotation was several-fold greater than that of type I. The ORD of the carbon monoxide compound showed a broad unsymmetrical Cotton effect with molar amplitude of 27,000° and a cross-over point at 442.5 mµ for the type I solution; a molar amplitude of 32,000° and a cross-over point at 435 mµ for type II. Results from sedimentation experiments showed that type II was in much larger aggregated form than type I. In both types, the concentration of hematin a did not significantly affect the amplitude of the observed Soret-Cotton effect of the oxidized form whereas, in the reduced form, the amplitude was found to be greatly dependent upon the concentration. No optical activity was observed in the oxidized, reduced, and carbon monoxide-treated reduced form of protohematin."
https://openalex.org/W1505977125,"Abstract The sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity of Neisseria meningitidis could be significantly repressed by a glucose concentration of 5.5 x 10-4 m, and a half-maximal repression was seen with 1.5 x 10-3 m glucose under the experimental conditions used. This restraint was independent of the Pi concentration, did not require Mg++, Mn++ Fe+++, Na+, K+, or NH4+, and exhibited no correlation with the low pH attained during glucose metabolism. Glucose did not appear to induce any other system (systems) in order to exert its repressive effect on the sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase. Enzyme formation, enzyme destruction, or inhibition of its catalytic activity did not occur on the addition of glucose to the culture medium. No evidence was observed for the presence of a mobilizable inhibitor or activator of the previously existing enzyme activity in cells cultured in the presence or absence of glucose, respectively. The elevation of the enzyme activity in the absence of glucose did not require an inducer or cellular growth, but oxidative energy-forming reactions were necessary. In contrast to puromycin and chloromycetin, actinomycin D or 8-azaguanine did not cause an inhibition of this enzyme increase. It is suggested that the translation rather than the transcription level of the protein biosynthetic process may be more important as a rate-limiting step in the elevation of the number of enzyme molecules. Evidence indicates that the primary effect of glucose, or metabolite (metabolites) of glucose, may be to prevent the association of the enzyme molecules (which have left the polysomal surface) with the membrane systems. These free unassociated enzyme molecules, but not the bound molecules, may then, secondarily, prevent their own enzyme-forming process at the translation level by a feedback control mechanism. This system would apparently be unique in that feedback inhibition in turn would display feedback repression, since the inhibition is exerted on a protein biosynthetic process. That a similar type of control mechanism might be applicable to the formation of other structural entities is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1587231477,"Abstract Optical rotatory dispersion spectra of oxidized and reduced FMN and FAD are presented from 600 to 210 mµ and of riboflavin from 600 to 340 mµ. Optical rotatory dispersion behavior of soluble DPNH dehydrogenase was studied between 600 and 185 mµ with respect to the oxidation state of the enzyme. The optical rotatory dispersion spectra were analyzed and the extrinsic Cotton effects were resolved from the protein backbone rotations. Shechter-Blout's A' parameters were computed: A'193 = 147 and A'225 = -278° for the oxidized enzyme, and A'193 = 32 and A'225 = -210° for the reduced. The centers of the resolved extrinsic Cotton effects due to nonprotein chromophores were 437 mµ and 350 mµ for the oxidized and 436 mµ and 346 mµ for the reduced enzyme. The rotational strength, amplitude, and band width of these Cotton effects were dependent upon the oxidation state of the enzyme. In addition, anomalous rotations in the region of 550 mµ were also observed but were too small for accurate analysis. These observations indicate that the interactions between the chromophores and the protein are dependent upon the oxidation state of the dehydrogenase. This dependence may be due to changes in geometrical relationships within the system and in the conformation of the protein moiety which is also determined by the oxidation state of the prosthetic groups. These changes may in turn play an intrinsic role in the physiological action of the enzyme for electron transfer in the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W1514960448,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) of the oxidized, reduced, and CO-reduced hematin a were affected by sodium chloride, pH of the medium, Emasol-1130, organic solvents, and pyridine in aqueous phosphate buffer. Increased concentration of NaCl transformed the ORD of hematin a from type I to type II; this effect paralleled the induced aggregation observed for NaCl. The ORD profile as a function of pH likewise indicated formation of larger aggregates as the pH was lowered. At pH 5.9, the ORD of all the three forms resembled that of type II. In the pH range of 8.5 to 11.5, the ORD of hematin a showed three isorotatory points: 431, 358, and 312 mµ; the dispersion curves for all the three forms did not vary significantly in this pH region. Organic solvents abolished the optical activity of hematin a. However, in the presence of a small amount of pyridine (0.01 to 0.75 m), heme a in aqueous medium not only showed a distinct hemochrome type spectrum with absorption maxima at 589 mµ and 442 mµ, but also exhibited anomalous optical rotations in both of the absorption regions. The Soret-Cotton effect exhibited a peak at 447.5 mµ and troughs at 425 and 480 mµ, respectively. The amplitude was 290,000 ± 30,000°. The corresponding circular dichroic spectrum showed a positive peak at 437.5 mµ and negative peaks at 410 and 460 mµ, respectively. The optical rotation under these conditions was still somewhat dependent on concentration; extrapolation to zero concentration gave a molar rotation of about 280,000°. Ultracentrifuge experiments did not detect any sedimenting species; i.e. the sedimentation coefficient was less than 0.8 S. Therefore, heme a existed in a much smaller aggregated form approaching the monomeric state. It is suggested that, under these conditions, the observed ORD in the presence of a limited amount of pyridine is a reflection of the stereochemistry and conformation of the molecule with heme-iron as the center of dissymmetry."
