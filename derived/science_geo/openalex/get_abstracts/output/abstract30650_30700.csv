https://openalex.org/W1964846497,"The feline c-fms proto-oncogene product is a 170 kd glycoprotein with associated tyrosine kinase activity. This glycoprotein was expressed on mature cat macrophages from peritoneal inflammatory exudates and spleen. Similarly, the receptor for the murine colony-stimulating factor, CSF-1, is restricted to cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage and is a 165 kd glycoprotein with an associated tyrosine kinase. Rabbit antisera to a recombinant v-fms-coded polypeptide precipitated the feline c-fms product and specifically cross-reacted with a 165 kd glycoprotein from mouse macrophages. This putative product of the murine c-fms gene exhibited an associated tyrosine kinase activity in immune complexes, specifically bound murine CSF-1, and, in the presence of the growth factor, was phosphorylated on tyrosine in membrane preparations. The murine c-fms proto-oncogene product and the CSF-1 receptor are therefore related, and possibly identical, molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2061095488,Partial degradation products of sodium hyaluronate produced by the action of testicular hyaluronidase induced an angiogenic response (formation of new blood vessels) on the chick chlorioallantoic membrane. Neither macromolecular hyaluronate nor exhaustively digested material had any angiogenic potential. Fractionation of the digestion products established that the activity was restricted to hyaluronate fragments between 4 and 25 disaccharides in length.

https://openalex.org/W2062604592,Supernatants from cultures of human monocytes that had been stimulated with endotoxin or silica induced the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The lymphokine mediating these effects on the cells of the blood vessel wall was identified as interleukin-1; interferons and interleukin-2 were inactive. Interleukin-1-induced prostacyclin synthesis represents a new aspect of the interaction between the immune system (as well as other tissues) and the vessel wall and may serve as a basis for the development of new strategies in antithrombotic therapy.
https://openalex.org/W1992999474,"Protective immunity against malaria can be obtained by vaccination with irradiated sporozoites. The protective antigens known as circumsporozoite (CS) proteins, are polypeptides that cover the surface membrane of the parasite. The CS proteins contain species-specific immunodominant epitopes formed by tandem repeated sequences of amino acids. Here it is shown that the dominant epitope of Plasmodium falciparum is contained in the synthetic dodecapeptide Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro-Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro or (NANP)3. Monoclonal antibodies and most or all polyclonal human antibodies to the sporozoites react with (NANP)3, and polyclonal antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide (NANP)3 react with the surface of the parasite and neutralize its infectivity. Since (NANP)3 repeats are present in CS proteins of P. falciparum from many parts of the world, this epitope is a logical target for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2008295169,"Resting B lymphocytes can be activated and induced to proliferate by antibodies against their antigen receptors (anti-lg). We demonstrate an early increase in the level of [3H]inositol trisphosphate in [3H]inositol-labeled murine B cells, which suggests breakdown of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by phospholipase C. In line with this, the level of [3H]1,2-diacylglycerol was also elevated after incubation of [3H]arachidonic-acid-labeled B cells with anti-Ig. Anti-lg also caused a rapid increase in the level of cytosolic Ca2+ in B cells. In contrast, two other polyclonal B cell activators, lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate, failed to induce any of these effects. Our results suggest that anti-lg may induce B cell growth via phosphoinositide degradation and Ca2+ mobilization, and that phorbol myristate acetate, and possibly lipopolysaccharide, bypass these initial events."
https://openalex.org/W2064846053,"Vanadate has been shown to inhibit phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from phosphotyrosine in cell-free systems. Addition of vanadate to the culture medium of NRK-1 cells resulted in a maximal 40-fold increase in the level of phosphotyrosine in cell protein. Also, vanadate induced transformation as evidenced by four criteria: generation of a highly refractile morphology, decreased density-dependent growth inhibition, increased rates of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, and growth in the absence of a solid support. The effects were dose-dependent and reversible, and similar effects were seen in two other cell lines and in secondary mouse embryo fibroblasts. Vanadate did not appear to induce increased rates of phosphatidylinositol turnover in exponentially growing transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051194600,"Purified precursor RNA containing the L3 polyadenylation site of late adenovirus 2 mRNA is accurately cleaved and polyadenylated when incubated with nuclear extract from HeLa cells. The reaction is very efficient; 75% of the precursor is correctly processed. Cleavage is rapidly followed by polymerization of an initial poly(A) tract of approximately 130 nucleotides. Additional adenosine residues are added during further incubation. In the presence of the ATP analog alpha-beta-methylene-adenosine 5' triphosphate, the precursor RNA is cleaved but not polyadenylated, suggesting that processing is not coupled to the synthesis of the initial poly(A) tract. In the absence of free Mg2+, a small RNA of approximately 46 nucleotides is stabilized against degradation. Fingerprint analysis suggests this RNA is produced by endonucleolytic cleavage at the L3 site. Like the in vitro splicing reaction, the in vitro polyadenylation reaction is inhibited by adding antiserum against the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle containing U1 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2069480630,"The 55 codons upstream of the gene sequence encoding the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are called the pre-S(2) region. It has been proposed that polypeptides of high molecular weight that contain the pre-S(2) region should be included in future hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines. The pre-S(2) region and the S gene product [25 kilodalton (kD)] together compose a polypeptide of high molecular weight (33 kD). As an initial attempt to determine the relevance of the 33-kD polypeptide to development of an HBV vaccine, the murine immune response to pre-S(2)-encoded determinants as compared to S-encoded determinants on the same polypeptide was examined. The results indicate (i) the pre-S(2) region is significantly more immunogenic than the S region of HBsAg, (ii) the 26 amino acid residues at the NH2-terminus of the 33-kD polypeptide represent a dominant antibody binding site on the pre-S(2) region, (iii) the immune response to the pre-S(2) region is regulated by H-2-linked genes distinct from those that regulate the response to the S region, and (iv) immunization of an S region nonresponder strain with HBV envelope particles that contain both the pre-S(2) and S regions can circumvent nonresponsiveness to the S region."
https://openalex.org/W1558941855,"We have used Sarkosyl to study the events comprising specific transcription initiation in vitro by HeLa RNA polymerase II. On the basis of different sensitivities to the Sarkosyl concentration, we have defined three functional steps in initiation at the adenovirus major late promoter: 1. a template commitment step that occurs in the presence of 0.015% Sarkosyl; 2. a nucleotide-independent conversion of the committed to a start complex capable of initiating an RNA chain, a step blocked by 0.015% Sarkosyl; and 3. a step that requires nucleoside triphosphates, converts the rapid start to a stably initiated complex, and is sensitive to Sarkosyl concentrations greater than 0.05%. The subsequent elongation of the initiated RNA chain is resistant to Sarkosyl, except that Sarkosyl causes pausing or premature termination at a specific site about 186 nucleotides downstream of the major late cap site. Using this assay, we have further characterized these steps and the resulting intermediate complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2080687464,"Post-infectious or post-vaccinal demyelinating encephalomyelitis and neuritis may be due to immunological cross-reactions evoked by specific viral antigenic determinants (epitopes) that are homologous to regions in the target myelins of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Such homologies have been found by computer searches in which decapeptides in two human myelin proteins were compared with proteins of viruses known to infect humans. These viruses include measles, Epstein-Barr, influenza A and B, and others that cause upper respiratory infections. Several regions identified in myelin basic protein and P2 protein can be related to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or neuritis in laboratory animals."
https://openalex.org/W2064908744,"The functional organization of the mammalian myelinated nerve fiber is complex and elegant. In contrast to nonmyelinated axons, whose membranes have a relatively uniform structure, the mammalian myelinated axon exhibits a high degree of regional specialization that extends to the location of voltage-dependent ion channels within the axon membrane. Sodium and potassium channels are segregated into complementary membrane domains, with a distribution reflecting that of the overlying Schwann or glial cells. This complexity of organization has important implications for physiology and pathophysiology, particularly with respect to the development of myelinated fibers."
https://openalex.org/W4252172071,"In addition to nerve growth factor (NGF), many proteins present in soluble tissue extracts and in the extracellular matrix influence the survival and development of cultured neurons. The structure, synthesis, and mechanism of action of NGF as a neurotrophic factor are considered along with the experiments on the new putative trophic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2031557479,"Cold-sensitive mutations in the SPB genes (spb1-spb7) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suppress the inhibition of translation initiation resulting from deletion of the poly(A)-binding protein gene (PAB1). The SPB4 protein belongs to a family of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicases. The aberrant production of 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurring in spb4-1 mutants or the deletion of SPB2 (RPL46) permits the deletion of PAB1. These data suggest that mutations affecting different steps of 60S subunit formation can allow PAB-independent translation, and they indicate that further characterization of the spb mutations could lend insight into the biogenesis of the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2014594852,"Crude fractions of urine from pregnant women are immunosuppressive in vitro. An 85-kilodalton immunosuppressive glycoprotein purified to homogeneity from such urine inhibited in vitro assays of human T-cell and monocyte activity at concentrations of 10(-9) to 10(-11) molar. This material was nontoxic and blocked early events required for normal T-cell proliferation in vitro. On the basis of its tissue source and its in vitro activity, the name ""uromodulin"" is proposed for this glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2056797843,"A series of clones of human natural killer (NK) cells was characterized with respect to expression of the Ti alpha and Ti beta genes of the T-cell receptor. T11+T3+ NK clones contained Ti alpha and Ti beta RNA transcripts and expressed disulfide-linked heterodimers, demonstrating the presence of a functional T-cell receptor. In contrast, T11+T3- NK clones expressed only 1.0-kilobase truncated Ti beta transcripts, without a Ti alpha transcript and no detectable surface Ti protein. Since previous studies demonstrated that Ti beta gene activation precedes Ti alpha gene activation in thymic ontogeny, the T11+T3- NK cells appear to be derived from T-lineage precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1557237548,"The globular domain of type IV collagen from bovine glomerular basement membrane was isolated under nondenaturing conditions. It was shown to exist in a hexameric form comprising monomeric and dimeric subunits, with the Goodpasture antigen residing in monomer M2 and dimer D2 as previously described (Butkowski, R. J., Wieslander, J., Wisdom, B. J., Barr, J. F., Noelken, M. E., and Hudson, B. G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3739-3747). The epitope, however, is sequestered inside the hexamer, but becomes exposed and binds with the Goodpasture antibody upon dissociation of the hexamer into its subunits after treatment with concentrated guanidine HC1 or dilute acetic acid (pH less than 3.0). The process is completely reversible even from the denatured state. Circular dichroism studies show that the conformation of each subunit is unusually resistant to change in 6 M guanidine HC1 at 25 degrees C. This suggests that exposure of the epitope by dissociation requires minimal or no unfolding of subunits. The results provide additional evidence for localization of the Goodpasture antigen to the globular domain of type IV collagen. Moreover, these studies extend the conclusion (Weber, H., Engel, J., Wiedemann, H., Glanville, R., and Timpl, R. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 139, 401-410) about a tumor basement membrane, to an authentic physiological membrane, that the globular domain is a major cross-linking site in the type IV collagen matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2040027631,"The kalilo variants of Neurospora contain a cytoplasmic genetic factor that causes senescence. This factor is a 9.0 kb transposable element (kalDNA) that lacks nucleotide sequence homology with mtDNA and is inserted into the mitochondrial chromosome, often at sites located within the open reading frame in the intron-DNA of the mitochondrial 25S-rRNA gene. Genomes containing the ""foreign"" DNA insert accumulate during growth, and death occurs as the cells become deficient in functional large and small subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes. The kalDNA transposon may be an ""activator"" element that causes breaks in mtDNA. Nonsenescing [+] strains of Neurospora do not contain kalDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2141567692,"A cytochemical method was developed to differentially stain cellular DNA, RNA, and proteins with fluorochromes Hoechst 33342, pyronin Y, and fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively. The fluorescence intensities, reflecting the DNA, RNA, and protein content of individual cells, were measured in a flow cytometer after sequential excitation by three lasers tuned to different excitation wavelengths. The method offers rapid analysis of changes in the cellular content of RNA and protein as well as in the RNA-protein, RNA-DNA, and protein-DNA ratios in relation to cell cycle position for large cell populations. An analysis of cycling cell populations (exponentially growing CHO cultures) and noncycling CHO cells arrested in the G1 phase by growth in isoleucine-free medium demonstrated the potential of the technique."
https://openalex.org/W1583855854,"We have previously reported the isolation of a 35-kDa protein from A-431 cells that, in the presence of Ca2+, is an excellent in vitro substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/kinase present in membrane preparations (Fava, R. A., and Cohen, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2636-2645). In this communication we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein is markedly enhanced in intact, 32P-labeled, A-431 cells following exposure of the cells to EGF. The 35-kDa protein immunoprecipitated from cells treated with EGF is phosphorylated to a 20-120-fold greater extent than comparable preparations from control cells. Both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues are detected in the protein after treatment of the cells with EGF. EGF-dependent phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein is barely detected unless the intact cells are exposed to EGF for periods greater than 5 min. We suggest that endosomes containing internalized EGF X receptor/kinase complexes are primarily responsible for the observed phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022313625,"Several immunologically distinct isozymes of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have been purified from bovine brain. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were found to express PLC-gamma, but the expression of PLC-beta was barely detectable by radioimmunoassay or protein immunoblot. A mixture of monoclonal antibodies was identified that neutralizes the biological activity of both endogenous and injected purified PLC-gamma. When co-injected with oncogenic Ras protein or PLC-gamma, this mixture of antibodies inhibited the induction of DNA synthesis that characteristically results from the injection of these proteins into quiescent 3T3 cells. However, when oncogenic Ras protein or PLC-gamma was co-injected with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to Ras, only the DNA synthesis induced by the Ras protein was inhibited--that induced by PLC was unaffected. These results suggest that the Ras protein is an upstream effector of PLC activity in phosphoinositide-specific signal transduction and that PLC-gamma activity is necessary for Ras-mediated induction of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1552732575,"The refined crystal structure of deoxyhemoglobin S (Padlan, E. A., and Love, W. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8272-8279) was used to analyze in detail the molecular interactions between hemoglobin tetramers in the crystal. The analysis confirms the close similarity and also the nonequivalence of the molecular interactions involving the two independent tetramers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The residue at the site of the hemoglobin S mutation, beta 6, is intimately involved in the lateral contacts between adjacent molecules. The molecular contacts in the crystals of deoxyhemoglobin S, deoxyhemoglobin A, and deoxyhemoglobin F were compared; some contacts involve the same regions of the molecule although the details of the interactions are very different. The effect of introducing an R state tetramer into the deoxyhemoglobin S strands was investigated using the known structure of carbon monoxyhemoglobin A. It was found that substituting a molecule of carbon monoxyhemoglobin A for one of the deoxyhemoglobin S tetramers results in extensive molecular interpenetration."

https://openalex.org/W1557183242,"Platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa form a Ca2+-dependent heterodimer complex that contains binding sites for fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin following platelet stimulation. We have studied the effect of Ca2+ on the stability of the IIb-IIIa complex using a IIb-IIIa complex-specific monoclonal antibody A2A9 to detect the presence of the complexes. Soluble IIb and IIIa interacted with A2A9-Sepharose only in the presence of Ca2+ with 50% IIb-IIIa binding requiring 0.4 microM Ca2+. In contrast, at 25 degrees C 125I-A2A9 binding to intact unstimulated platelets suspended in buffers containing EDTA or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid was independent of the presence of Ca2+. However, the effect of Ca2+ chelators on 125I-A2A9 binding varied with temperature. At 37 degrees C, 125I-A2A9 binding to intact platelets became Ca2+-dependent with 50% binding requiring 0.4 microM Ca2+. This effect of temperature was not due to a change in platelet membrane fluidity because enrichment or depletion of platelet membrane cholesterol did not influence antibody binding. But, 125I-A2A9 binding to intact platelets at 25 degrees C did become Ca2+-dependent when the pH was increased above 7.4. Thus, at 1 nM Ca2+ and 25 degrees C, 50% antibody binding occurred at pH 9.0. Our studies demonstrate that Ca2+-dependent IIb-IIIa complexes are present on unstimulated platelets and that the Ca2+ binding sites responsible for the stability of these complexes are located on the external platelet surface. Our experiments also suggest that changes in platelet cytosolic Ca2+ do not regulate the formation of IIb-IIIa complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2040562485,"We report that TFIIIA, the positive transcription factor of the 5S RNA gene, induces DNA gyration in Xenopus oocyte extracts. The reaction uses one molecule of TFIIIA per molecule of DNA and is highly specific for 5S DNA plasmids. DNA gyration also requires the oocyte supernatant, ATP, and Mg2+, and is inhibited by novobiocin, suggesting that it is catalyzed by a type II DNA topoisomerase. The chromatin assembled with TFIIIA is dynamic and rapidly relaxed by novobiocin; the chromatin assembled without TFIIIA is static and unaffected by novobiocin. The torsionally strained DNA is produced in a novel concerted reaction: all of the 5S DNA molecules gyrate at TFIIIA-5S DNA ratios equal to or above 1, and none of them gyrate at TFIIIA-5S DNA ratios below 1. We discuss the biological implications of this eukaryotic DNA gyration."
https://openalex.org/W2081911678,Inward movement of calcium through voltage-dependent channels in muscle is thought to initiate the action potential and trigger contraction. Calcium-activated potassium channels carry large outward potassium currents that may be responsible for membrane repolarization. Calcium and calcium-activated potassium currents were identified in enzymatically isolated mammalian gastric myocytes. These currents were blocked by cadmium and nifedipine but were not substantially affected by diltiazem or D600. No evidence for a tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current or an inwardly rectifying potassium current was found.
https://openalex.org/W1593158248,"The secretion of a type IV collagen-specific proteinase is stimulated in cultured human skin fibroblasts by the phorbol ester tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and during cell proliferation. Exposure of the cells at the late log phase of growth to 10(-9) to 10(-6) M TPA resulted in the secretion of type IV collagenase activity to the medium, this effect being reversible. Incubation of intact type IV procollagen with TPA-induced fibroblast medium protein produced six peptides, four of which corresponded in size to the fragments produced by a type IV collagen-specific collagenase (Fessler, L., Duncan, K., Fessler, J., Salo, T., and Tryggvason (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9783-9789). The TPA-induced type IV collagen-degrading enzyme could be activated by trypsin, was inhibited by EDTA, but was not affected by soybean trypsin inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide, aprotinin, or cysteine. Therefore, in human skin fibroblasts, TPA can induce a type IV collagen-specific, metal-dependent collagenase as was previously described in some invasive tumor cells. Furthermore, another metalloprotease is apparently secreted under the same conditions of TPA exposure. The production of metal-dependent, type IV collagen-degrading activity was also studied at different stages of cellular proliferation. In early log phase, a significant amount of enzyme activity was observed in the control cell medium; this activity disappeared during both late log and stationary growth phases. This activity could be markedly increased by the addition of 10(-8) M TPA to the culture medium. The production of matrix-degrading proteinases is therefore likely to be associated with rapid cell proliferation in both transformed and untransformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W1565936007,"An ATP-dependent calcium transport component from rat liver plasma membranes was solubilized by cholate and reconstituted into egg lecithin vesicles by a cholate dialysis procedure. The uptake of Ca2+ into the reconstituted vesicles was ATP-dependent and the trapped Ca2+ could be released by A23187. Nucleotides, including ADP, UTP, GTP, CTP, GDP, AMP, and adenyl-5'-yl beta, gamma-imidophosphate, and p-nitrophenylphosphate did not substitute for ATP. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximal stimulation of Ca2+ uptake into the reconstituted vesicles was 6.2 microM. Magnesium was required for calcium uptake. Inhibitors of mitochondrial calcium-sequestering activities, i.e. oligomycin, sodium azide, ruthenium red, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and valinomycin did not affect the uptake of Ca2+ into the vesicles. In addition, strophanthidin and p-chloromercuribenzoate did not affect the transport. Calcium transport, however, was inhibited by vanadate in a concentration-dependent fashion with a K0.5 of 10 microM. A calcium-stimulated, vanadate-inhibitable phosphoprotein was demonstrated in the reconstituted vesicles with an apparent molecular weight of 118,000 +/- 1,300. These properties of Ca2+ transport by vesicles reconstituted from liver plasma membranes suggest that this ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport component is different from the high affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase found in the same membrane preparation (Lotersztajn, S., Hanoune, J. and Pecker, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11209-11215; Lin, S.-H., and Fain, J.N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3016-3020). When the entire reconstituted vesicle population was treated with ATP and 45Ca in a buffer containing oxalate, the vesicles with Ca2+ transport activity could be separated from other vesicles by centrifugation in a density gradient and the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport component was purified approximately 9-fold. This indicates that transport-specific fractionation may be used to isolate the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport component from liver plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1519015484,"Primer extension has been employed to locate sites of cleavage made in apolipoprotein II (apo-II) mRNA by structure-specific nucleases. This approach permits structural analysis of specific mRNAs within a complex population. Electrophoretic analysis of cDNAs synthesized from T1 RNase-treated and mock-treated apo-II mRNA revealed that most cleavage sites can be mapped with single nucleotide accuracy. However, some T1 RNase-dependent cDNAs demonstrated mobilities corresponding to one nucleotide longer than the mRNA template, suggesting that reverse transcriptase can add a single nucleotide to full-length cDNAs in a template-independent reaction. This approach has been used to map double-stranded and single-stranded accessible domains of the 3' noncoding region of apo-II mRNA with cobra venom, T1, and S1 ribonucleases. Cleavage profiles of apo-II mRNA renatured under a variety of buffer and temperature conditions were identical and in no case was overlap observed between sites of cleavage by double strand- and single strand-specific enzymes. These results suggest that apo-II mRNA possesses a predominant, stable secondary structure. A computer-generated structure model, consistent with these nuclease cleavage data, is presented. In addition to the analysis of mRNA higher order structure in mixed RNA populations, this approach also appears suitable for the analysis of protein-mRNA interactions. Termination sites of incomplete cDNAs produced when untreated or mock-treated RNA is used as a template for primer extension were also mapped. This analysis revealed an over-representation of termination at the dinucleotides CA and CU, suggesting that termination of some incomplete apo-II cDNAs is related to primary and not secondary structure. Such sequence dependence could reflect in vivo degradation by an endogenous cytidine-specific nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2010015728,"A murine monoclonal antibody, SLOW-1, was selected, which inhibits the locomotion of chick embryo fibroblasts (the immunizing cells) in tissue culture. The antibody, an IgM, cross-reacts in locomotion assays with a number of tumor and untransformed cells, and on fixed and permeabilized cells binds 1-5 X 10(5) target sites with an affinity of 10(-8) M. The antigen can be extracted from cells with isotonic buffers containing EGTA, binds to Concanavalin A, and when analyzed on SDS gels by immunoblotting, two major antigenic glycoproteins are detected at 57 kd (isoelectric point, 5.1) and at 44 kd (isoelectric point, 5.4). The antigenic site involves galactosyl or mannosyl residues, or both, within a complex, N-linked carbohydrate tree. The possible contribution of the SLOW-1 antigen to a common control system of locomotion operating over the cell surface is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2055335988,"The idea that pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion can occur in a nonparallel manner has been controversial because of its presumed incompatibility with the exocytosis secretory mechanism. Correlation and regression analysis of enzyme output by the rabbit pancreas after it is stimulated with cholecystokinin and chymodenin revealed that digestive enzymes are secreted in a highly linked fashion, compatible with exocytosis and with nonparallel secretion. Thus, exocytosis and nonparallel secretion are not contradictory processes, but rather nonparallel secretion is due to exocytosis from heterogeneous sources within the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1542779221,"Na+ fluxes were measured in toad bladder microsomes. Under favorable conditions, 60-90% of the tracer uptake was blocked by amiloride (Ki = 2.3 X 10(-8) M), i.e. mediated by the apical Na+-specific channels. Vesicles derived from cells maintained at 0 degrees C exhibited relatively small amiloride-sensitive fluxes. However, incubating the scraped cells at 25 degrees C prior to homogenization induced a nearly 5-fold increase of the amiloride-blockable flux in vesicles. This activation was fairly slow (t 1/2 = 5-10 min), irreversible, and strongly dependent on the incubation temperature. On the other hand, the Na+-specific apical conductance measured in mounted bladders was only slightly affected by the incubation temperature. The above activation process could be observed only in Ca2+-free EGTA-containing solutions. Adding Ca2+ (1 mM) to the cell suspension and subsequently removing it before homogenization blocked almost completely the amiloride-sensitive tracer uptake in the vesicles. The data are compatible with the model that the epithelial Na+ channels are down-regulated by a Ca2+-dependent reaction. The incubation of scraped, somewhat permeabilized cells in a Ca2+-free solution releases channels from this down-regulation and increases the Na+ conductance in a temperature-dependent process. The regulation of channels appears to involve a cytoplasmic factor which induces a stable modification of the apical membrane, preserved by the isolated vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1600092335,"Protein P1, the interferon-induced protein phosphorylated in the presence of dsRNA in human amnion U-cells, was covalently labeled with [alpha-32P]ATP following ultraviolet irradiation. The photoaffinity labeling of protein P1 was dependent upon double-stranded RNA. Antibody prepared against phosphorylated protein P1 immunoprecipitated the double-stranded RNA-dependent photoaffinity-labeled product. The extent of photoaffinity labeling was significantly decreased by the addition of unlabeled ATP, GTP, or AMP; adenosine had little effect on the photoaffinity labeling of protein P1. These results suggest that protein P1 possesses a site capable of binding an adenine nucleotide in a double-stranded RNA-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2081112285,The concentration in plasma of the female protein (FP) of the golden Syrian hamster is regulated by sex steroids and by mediators of the acute-phase response to tissue injury or inflammation. A complementary DNA (cDNA) clone corresponding to FP was isolated from a hamster liver cDNA library and used to determine the nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of native FP. The primary sequence of FP is 69 percent identical to human serum amyloid P component and 50 percent identical to human C-reactive protein. Evidence showed that sex-limited and acute-phase control of the FP gene is pretranslational. The FP protein is thus a useful model for investigating dual regulation of expression of a single gene.

Five fragments, resulting from BglII digestion of this amplified DNA, were cloned into vectors and utilized as probes to examine mRNA in these organisms. Four mRNA species which hybridize to the amplified DNA sequences were found in both resistant and wild-type Leishmania, but were about 40-fold more abundant in the drug-resistant cells. Three of the four mRNAs are transcribed from the same strand of DNA, are clustered, and appear to have partial overlapping sequences. The thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase gene was localized to a specific region of the amplified unit of DNA by hybridization with mouse cDNA containing thymidylate synthase sequences and with a synthetic oligonucleotide 41 nucleotides in length, prepared on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the Leishmania enzyme. Furthermore, mRNA hybrid-selected using a plasmid containing sequences of the putative gene was shown to direct in vitro synthesis of the bifunctional protein."
https://openalex.org/W2010656435,"Multiple copies of a gene that encodes human U1 small nuclear RNA were introduced into mouse C127 cells with bovine papilloma virus as the vector. For some recombinant constructions, the human U1 gene copies were maintained extrachromosomally on the viral episome in an unrearranged fashion. The relative abundance of human and mouse U1 small nuclear RNA varied from one cell line to another, but in some lines human U1 RNA accounted for as much as one-third of the total U1. Regardless of the level of human U1 expression, the total amount of U1 RNA (both mouse and human) in each cell line was nearly the same relative to endogenous mouse 5S or U2 RNA. This result was obtained whether measurements were made of total cellular U1 or of only the U1 in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles that could be precipitated with antibody directed against the Sm antigen. The data suggest that the multigene families encoding mammalian U1 RNA are subject to some form of dosage compensation."

https://openalex.org/W1595660123,The precise points of in vivo transcription initiation and termination in the leader region of the ilvGEDA operon of Escherichia coli K12 have been determined. Leader RNA transcription products from either side of the attenuator have been identified and quantitated by T1 fingerprint analyses under growth conditions which affect operon expression. The results provide in vivo confirmation of the ilvGEDA attenuation model. Previous DNA sequence and in vitro transcription analyses have demonstrated that this operon is preceded by two strong in vitro promotors. The studies reported here show that transcription is initiated in vivo only from the downstream promotor and that no detectable in vivo expression from the upstream promotor is observed under conditions which affect operon regulation.
https://openalex.org/W1544185264,"Ferric bleomycin was tested for its ability to catalyze a set of six oxidative reactions characteristic of the heme-containing proteins, cytochrome P-450 and chloroperoxidase. These reactions included peroxyacid decarboxylation and aliphatic hydroxylation as typical cytochrome P-450 chemistries. Peroxyacid-supported oxygen evolution and hydrogen peroxide-mediated chlorination were utilized as characteristic chloroperoxidase reactivities. A typical peroxidative reaction and heteroatom dealkylation, common to both O2 activating enzymes, were also studied. Bleomycin was found to catalyze peroxidation of o-dianisidine. The ferric drug complex was found competent in carrying out N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline when peroxides or peroxyacids or iodosobenzene were used as the oxidants. N-Demethylation was not achieved when N,N-dimethylaniline-N-oxide was substituted as the oxidant under similar conditions. Hydroxylation of cumene and decarboxylation of phenylperacetic acid were not found to be catalyzed by bleomycin. Oxygen evolution from m-chloroperbenzoic acid and chlorination of monochlorodimedone from chloride ion and hydrogen peroxide were found to be catalyzed by bleomycin. Cytochrome P-450cam was also evaluated for O2 evolution, and halogenation activity and was found not to demonstrate such reactivities. The results of this initial survey, along with those of previous studies, appear to indicate that the chemical reactivity of bleomycin can be more closely aligned with the reactivities demonstrated by chloroperoxidase than those of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1545988079,"A monoclonal antibody described previously by us (Edwards, D. P., Weigel, N. L., Schrader, W. T., O'Malley, B. W., and McGuire, W. L. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 4427-4435) was used to study progesterone receptor B subunits of chick and hen oviduct. We find that the antibody does not recognize the form of receptor B able to bind [3H]progesterone in vitro. Rather, it reacts exclusively with a homologous protein of the same molecular weight, termed B antigen. The antigen is present in both immature estrogen-treated chicks and in egg-laying hens. This antigen is indistinguishable from the hormone-binding receptor species (termed receptor B) as shown by peptide mapping techniques using either Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or trypsin. The B antigen and the hormone binder can be resolved by ion-exchange chromatography. Sedimentation velocity data show that the two proteins are present in distinct, separable cytosolic entities. The functional relationship between the two proteins has not been established."
https://openalex.org/W1520944136,"The functional domains of the avian retrovirus polymerase gene are at least tripartite in nature. Three enzymatic domains exist; the RNase H and DNA polymerase activities are located on the alpha subunit while the DNA endonuclease is located on the pp32 moiety. Virus mutants possessing deletions in the pp32 region demonstrated that this region encodes function(s) essential for replication of the virus while separate point mutations generated near the NH2 terminus of pp32 resulted in decreased replication and cell transformation. Molecular analysis of various steps in the virus replication cycle demonstrated that the synthesis of linear viral DNA, transport of viral DNA to the nucleus, and its subsequent circularization and integration into cellular DNA are apparently not affected in these point mutants. However, the synthesis of viral RNA from the integrated provirus of these point mutants appears less than that observed in wild type virus-infected cells. What role the mutated pp32 protein might have on viral transcription is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488561907,"Chloroquine, a weak base which raises the pH in acidic cellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes, counteracts the induction by interferon of the antiviral state but not that of the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in three different types of cell lines (MDBK, WISH, and L929). Active interferon is recovered in crude extracts of cells which have been treated with interferon and chloroquine together, but not in extracts of cells treated with interferon alone, indicating that chloroquine has inhibited the intralysosomal proteolysis of interferon. A low pH-dependent event in the intracellular fate of interferon (perhaps its intralysosomal degradation) is, therefore, necessary for the establishment of the antiviral state but not for the induction of the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W7862216,"Periodate-oxidized ADP, if left in aqueous solution, loses its phosphates by beta-elimination. This dephosphorylated dialdehyde compound caused rapid and irreversible inhibition of membrane-bound spinach chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1). Inhibition was 2.5 times faster in the light than in the dark. A high concentration of uncoupler eliminated the light stimulation. Light could be replaced by an acid-base transition. Therefore, the dialdehyde reacts with a site or sites on CF1 that become exposed by a high-energy state-induced conformational change. The substrate nucleotides ADP, ATP, GDP, and GTP protected against inhibition while Pi and the non-substrate nucleotides AMP, GMP, CTP, and UTP did not. The protection by GTP was competitive and magnesium-dependent, suggesting that the dialdehyde binds to a nucleotide-binding site. However, the corresponding UDP and CDP dialdehyde derivatives also inhibited CF1 and showed the light-stimulation effect, indicating that the adenine is not important for the binding. These derivatives could be binding to a nucleotide-binding site or to another reactive site that becomes exposed during the light-induced conformational change. In the latter case the protection by substrate nucleotides would be due to prevention of the energy-dependent conformational change."
