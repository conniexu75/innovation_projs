https://openalex.org/W1982744028,"Mutations in the APETALA3 (AP3) gene of A. thaliana result in homeotic transformations of petals to sepals and stamens to carpels. We have cloned the AP3 gene from Arabidopsis based on its homology to the homeotic flower gene deficiens (DEFA) from the distantly related plant Antirrhinum majus. The sequence of four ap3 mutant alleles and genetic mapping analysis prove that the DEFA homolog is AP3. Like several other plant homeotic genes, the AP3 gene contains a MADS box and likely acts as a transcription factor. The region-specific spatial expression pattern of AP3 rules out certain types of sequential models of flower development and argues in favor of a spatial model based on positional information. Since DEFA and AP3 have very similar protein products, mutant phenotypes, and spatial expression patterns, it is likely that these genes are cognate homologs."
https://openalex.org/W2087667366,"The recent discovery that the neurotransmitter glutamate can trigger actively propagating Ca2+ waves in the cytoplasm of cultured astrocytes suggests the possibility that synaptically released glutamate may trigger similar Ca2+ waves in brain astrocytes in situ. To explore this possibility, we used confocal microscopy and the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 to study organotypically cultured slices of rat hippocampus, where astrocytic and neuronal networks are intermingled in their normal tissue relationships. We find that astrocytic Ca2+ waves are present under these circumstances and that these waves can be triggered by the firing of glutamatergic neuronal afferents with latencies as short as 2 s. The Ca2+ waves closely resemble those previously observed in cultured astrocytes: they propagate both within and between astrocytes at velocities of 7-27 microns/s at 21 degrees C. The ability of tissue astrocyte networks to respond to neuronal network activity suggests that astrocytes may have a much more dynamic and active role in brain function than has been generally recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2028146382,"An indefinite survival of cardiac allografts between fully incompatible mice strains was observed when monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) were simultaneously administered after the transplantation for 6 days. Mice with long-term surviving cardiac allografts accepted skin grafts from the donor-strain but rejected skin grafts from a third-party strain. Because MAbs to ICAM-1 or LFA-1 alone were insufficient for prolonged tolerance, the two MAbs probably acted synergistically to induce specific unresponsiveness. Thus, ICAM-1----LFA-1 adhesion participates in the induction of allograft rejection and MAbs may be useful as therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2076149108,"Drug resistance in human cancer is associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene, which confers cross-resistance to hydrophobic natural product cytotoxic drugs. Expression of the MDR1 gene can occur de novo in human cancers in the absence of drug treatment. The promoter of the human MDR1 gene was shown to be a target for the c-Ha-Ras-1 oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene products, both of which are associated with tumor progression. The stimulatory effect of c-Ha-Ras-1 was not specific for the MDR1 promoter alone, whereas a mutant p53 specifically stimulated the MDR1 promoter and wild-type p53 exerted specific repression. These results imply that the MDR1 gene could be activated during tumor progression associated with mutations in Ras and p53."

https://openalex.org/W2170734806,"Drug-resistant tumor cells actively extrude a variety of chemotherapeutic agents by the action of the multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene product, the plasma membrane P-glycoprotein. In this report we show that the expression of the human MDR1 gene in cultured Sf9 insect cells via a baculovirus vector generates a high activity vanadate-sensitive membrane ATPase. This ATPase is markedly stimulated by drugs known to interact with the P-glycoprotein, such as vinblastine and verapamil, and the ability of the various drugs to stimulate the ATPase corresponds to their previously observed affinity for this transporter. The drug-stimulated ATPase is not present in uninfected or mock-infected Sf9 cells, and its appearance correlates with the appearance of the MDR1 gene product detected with a monoclonal anti-MDR protein antibody and by labeling with 8-azido-ATP. The drug-induced ATPase requires magnesium ions, does not utilize ADP or AMP as substrates, exhibits a half-maximal activation at about 0.5 mM MgATP, and its maximal activity (about 3-5 mumol/mg MDR protein/min) approaches that of the well characterized ion transport ATPases. These results provide the first direct demonstration of a high capacity drug-stimulated ATPase activity of the human multidrug resistance protein and offer a new and simple assay for the investigation of functional interactions of various drugs with this clinically important enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2043888927,"The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter attains a phased array of six nucleosomes when introduced into rodent cells. This architecture excludes nuclear factor 1/CCAAT transcription factor (NF1/CTF) from the promoter before glucocorticoid treatment and hormone-dependent access of nucleolytic agents to promoter DNA. In contrast, when the promoter was transiently introduced into cells, NF1/CTF was bound constitutively and nucleolytic attack was hormone-independent. Thus, induction at this promoter was a bimodal process involving receptor-dependent remodeling of chromatin that allows NF1/CTF loading and direct receptor-mediated recruitment of additional transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2033897148,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an extensively studied model of synaptic plasticity, in part because it is a plausible biological correlate for the Hebbian synaptic modification that forms the basis for theoretical models of neural development, learning, and memory. Although these models must incorporate algorithms that constrain synaptic weight changes, physiological evidence for such mechanisms is limited. Examination of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus revealed that the threshold for LTP induction was not fixed but could be strongly influenced by the recent history of synaptic activity. This effect was transient, synapse-specific, and dependent on postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. These results suggest that the threshold for LTP induction may be continually adjusted according to the recent history of NMDA receptor activation and provide a physiological mechanism by which LTP can be transiently inhibited."

https://openalex.org/W2042490889,"A novel mouse homeobox-containing gene, Nkx-2.2, has been isolated. Nkx-2.2 is a member of a family of genes whose homeodomains are homologous to that of the Drosophila NK-2 gene. Nkx-2.2 transcripts are found in localized domains of the brain during mouse embryogenesis. Nkx-2.2 expression in the brain abuts and partially overlaps with the expression domains of two other related homeobox-containing genes, TTF-1 and Dlx. The expression domains of the three genes in the developing prosencephalon coincide with anatomical boundaries, particularly apparent in the diencephalon. This result raises the possibility that these genes may specify regional differentiation of the developing diencephalon into its anatomically and functionally defined subregions. Nkx-2.2 may be involved in specifying diencephalic neuromeric boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2003492314,"Hormones inhibit synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in most cells via receptors coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Mutationally activated alpha subunits of Gi2 (alpha i2) constitutively inhibit cAMP accumulation when transfected into cells. Cells have now been transfected with mutant alpha subunits of four other G proteins--Gz, a PTX-insensitive G protein of unknown function, and Gi1, Gi3, and G(o), which are PTX-sensitive. Mutant alpha z, alpha i1, and alpha i3 inhibited cAMP accumulation but alpha o did not. Moreover, expression of wild-type alpha z produced cells in which PTX did not block hormonal inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Thus, Gz can trigger an effector pathway in response to hormone receptors that ordinarily interact with PTX-sensitive Gi proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2095296119,"Cytochrome b2 reaches the intermembrane space of mitochondria by transport into the matrix followed by export across the inner membrane. While in the matrix, the protein interacts with hsp60, which arrests its folding prior to export. The bacterial-type export sequence in pre-cytochrome b2 functions by inhibiting the ATP-dependent release of the protein from hsp60. Release for export apparently requires, in addition to ATP, the interaction of the signal sequence with a component of the export machinery in the inner membrane. Export can occur before import is complete provided that a critical length of the polypeptide chain has been translocated into the matrix. Thus, hsp60 combines two activities: catalysis of folding of proteins destined for the matrix, and maintaining proteins in an unfolded state to facilitate their channeling between the machineries for import and export across the inner membrane. Antifolding signals such as the hydrophobic export sequence in cytochrome b2 may act as switches between these two activities."
https://openalex.org/W1790807154,"The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis and malonyl-CoA production, can be regulated by several mechanisms, including multisite covalent phosphorylation, both in vitro and in intact cells. Evidence has been presented by others to indicate that a 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is likely the major regulatory kinase active on ACC. While insulin is known to activate ACC in several cell types, accompanied by changes in ACC phosphorylation, the mechanism underlying this activation has been obscure. In the present study, we have examined, in Fao hepatoma cells, the effects of insulin on ACC and AMPK activity, the latter measured with a synthetic peptide corresponding to one of the phosphorylation sites on ACC for AMPK. Our results show that insulin leads to inhibition of kinase activity prior to the onset of ACC activation; the peak of maximal kinase inhibition (approximately 35% at 10 min) is seen to precede the onset of ACC activation (20 min). The inhibition of kinase activity due to insulin is observed both in the absence and presence of varying stimulating concentrations of added 5'-AMP. Both kinase inhibition and ACC activation display similar insulin sensitivity (A50 0.3 nM). Preservation of this insulin-induced kinase inhibition requires the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors in the cell lysis buffer, suggesting that AMPK itself might be regulated by insulin-stimulated changes in kinase phosphorylation. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase is a regulated component of the insulin signal transduction pathway and may be the major target for insulin regulation of ACC."

When beta 2M-/- mice were infected with LCMV, many died from LCMV disease and produced a specific response to LCMV mediated by CD4+ CTLs that were class II-restricted. In these mice, CD4+ CTLs may compensate for the lack of CD8+ CTLs."
https://openalex.org/W1584907674,"A cDNA (DPCR1) specific for human intestinal dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) has been isolated. This 1.7-kilobase cDNA, together with a previously published partial sequence, covers the entire open reading frame of human DPP IV plus 67 base pairs of the 3'-untranslated end. Human DPP IV is a 766-amino acid polypeptide with a high degree of homology with the rat liver protein. The characterization of this molecular probe allowed us to definitively confirm the identity of DPP IV with CD 26, a mouse thymocyte activation antigen, a conclusion strengthened by the fact that we observed identical patterns on Southern blot of human genomic DNA hybridized either with human DPP IV or mouse CD 26 cDNA probe. Using this new tool, we have investigated the expression of DPP IV during the onset of enterocytic differentiation of two cultured human colon cancer cell lines, HT-29 and Caco-2. Whatever the cell line and the culture conditions, DPP IV expression strictly correlates with the presence of a differentiated phenotype, as shown by enzyme activity and the steady state amount of the protein measured by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot. Accordingly, DPP IV biosynthesis exclusively increases in cells that display an enterocytic differentiation. Neither the glycosylation nor the stability of the protein appear to be dependent on the state of enterocytic differentiation. The DPP IV mRNA level remains very low in undifferentiated cell populations and specifically increases in cells that undergo an enterocytic differentiation. These results strongly suggest that DPP IV gene expression is controlled at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level during intestinal differentiation."

Moreover GroEL can bind, with a positive cooperativity, more than two molecules of nonfolded protein rhodanese. The role of the cooperative mechanism in the functioning of GroEL is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1993110102,"Synaptic plasticity can be triggered by calcium flux into neurons through synaptically activated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. The amplitude and time course of the resulting intracellular calcium transient depend on the number of open NMDA receptor channels and the kinetics of their activation. Short applications of L-glutamate to outside-out patches from hippocampal neurons in the presence and absence of MK-801 revealed that about 30 percent of L-glutamate-bound channels are open at the peak of the current. This high probability of opening suggests that very few channels are required to guarantee a large, localized postsynaptic calcium transient."
https://openalex.org/W1996177900,"Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins are required for intracellular vesicular transport. Mastoparan is a peptide component of wasp venom that increases nucleotide exchange in some classes of G alpha subunits of regulatory heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Mastoparan and other compounds that increase nucleotide exchange by G proteins inhibited endosome fusion in vitro and reversed the effects of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Addition of beta gamma subunits of G proteins to the fusion assay antagonized the stimulatory effect of GTP-gamma-S, confirming the participation of G proteins. These results indicate that GTP-binding proteins are required for endosome fusion and in particular that a G protein is involved. Given the function of G proteins in signal transduction, these findings may provide insight into the mechanism by which endosomal vesicles become competent for fusion after their formation at the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1494925286,"Transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) was originally identified as an activator of the cytochrome c gene and subsequently found to stimulate transcription through specific sites in other nuclear genes whose products function in the mitochondria. These include subunits of the cytochrome oxidase and reductase complexes and a component of the mitochondrial DNA replication machinery. Here we establish that a functional recognition site for NRF-1 is present in the ATP synthase gamma-subunit gene extending the proposed respiratory role of NRF-1 to complex V. In addition, biologically active NRF-1 sites are found in genes encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha-subunit and tyrosine aminotransferase, both of which participate in the rate-limiting step of their respective pathways of protein biosynthesis and tyrosine catabolism. The recognition sites from each of these genes form identical complexes with NRF-1 as established by competition binding assays, methylation interference footprinting, and UV-induced DNA cross-linking. Cloned oligomers of each NRF-1 binding site also stimulate the activity of a truncated cytochrome c promoter in transfected cells. The NRF-1 binding activities for the various target sites copurified approximately 33,000-fold and resided in a single protein of 68 kDa. These observations further support a role for NRF-1 in the expression of nuclear respiratory genes and suggest it may help coordinate respiratory metabolism with other biosynthetic and degradative pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2054968530,"I-POU, a POU domain nuclear protein that lacks two conserved basic amino acids of the POU homeodomain is coexpressed in the developing Drosophila nervous system with a second POU domain transcription factor, Cf1-a. I-POU does not bind to DNA but forms a POU domain-mediated, high affinity heterodimer with Cf1-a, inhibiting its ability to bind and activate the dopa decarboxylase gene. The I-POU/Cf1-a dimerization interface encompasses only the N-terminal basic region and helices 1 and 2 of the POU homeodomains with precise amino acid and α-helical requirements. twin of I-POU, an alternatively spliced transcript of the I-POU gene, encodes a protein containing the two basic amino acid residues absent in I-POU. Twin of I-POU is incapable of dimerizing with Cf1-a, but can act as a positive transcription factor on targets distinct from those regulated by Cf1-a. These findings suggest that the I-POU genomic locus simultaneously generates both a specific activator and inhibitor of gene transcription, capable of modulating two distinct regulatory programs during neural development."
https://openalex.org/W1599323243,"The effect of overexpression of the heat shock chaperone genes dnaK and groESL on heterologous protein production in Escherichia coli was examined, using a set of related human procollagenase proteins. A diverse range of effects on protein solubility, secretion, and accumulation was observed, and these effects were highly dependent on the particular chaperone/procollagenase pairing involved. Both chaperones caused a large increase in the apparent solubility of a fusion of the LamB signal peptide to procollagenase. GroESL had no effect on the accumulation of mature (secreted) procollagenase, while DnaK suppressed secretion considerably. In the absence of a signal peptide, overexpression of either chaperone resulted in a dramatic increase in both solubility and accumulation of procollagenase. The 10-fold increase in accumulation was associated with an increase in in vivo protein half-life."
https://openalex.org/W1974900363,"We have studied the control of adrenal chromaffin cell development by glucocorticoids (GCs), in a reconstituted in vitro system. The development of the chromaffin phenotype involves two sequential, GC-dependent events: the decision not to become a sympathetic neuron, and the decision to express the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT). Both decisions appear to be mediated by the type II GC receptor. Competence to express PNMT develops on a schedule in vitro which parallels that seen in vivo, but only in progenitors that have first failed to undergo neuronal differentiation. The schedule of PNMT induction is thus controlled by the time of appearance of neither the inducing signal nor its receptor, as previously suggested, but rather by a cell-intrinsic timed process in chromaffin precursors. The two effects of GCs are pharmacologically distinct, suggesting that the GC receptor may interact differently with different genes in the same cell, in a manner that changes with development."
https://openalex.org/W1586315068,"Individually purified subunits have been used to reconstitute the action of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) at a replication fork formed in the presence of the primosome, the single-stranded DNA binding protein, and a tailed form II DNA template. Complete activity, indistinguishable from that of the intact DNA Pol III HE, could be reproduced with a combination of the DNA polymerase III core (Pol III core), the gamma.delta complex, and the beta subunit. Experiments where the Pol III core in reaction mixtures containing active replication forks was diluted suggested that the lagging-strand Pol III core remained associated continuously with the replication fork through multiple cycles of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Since the lagging-strand Pol III core must dissociate from the 3' end of the completed Okazaki fragment, this suggests that its association with the fork is via protein-protein interactions, lending credence to the idea that it forms a dimeric complex with the leading-strand Pol III core. An asymmetry in the action of the subunits was revealed under conditions (high ionic strength) that were presumably destabilizing to the integrity of the replication fork. Under these conditions, tau acted to stimulate DNA synthesis only when the primase was present (i.e. when lagging-strand DNA synthesis was ongoing). This stimulation was reflected by an inhibition of the formation of small Okazaki fragments, suggesting that, within the context of the model developed to account for the temporal order of steps during a cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis, the presence of tau accelerated the transit of the lagging-strand Pol III core from the 3' end of the completed Okazaki fragment to the 3' end of the new primer."
https://openalex.org/W1543971100,"Two ATP-binding domains are found in members of the family of ATP-dependent transport proteins, which includes P-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. To investigate the involvement of the two ATP-binding domains in the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, full-length and the 5'-half of human MDR1 cDNA, which encodes P-glycoprotein, were fused with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene and expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitated full-length P-glycoprotein beta-galactosidase showed ATPase activity with apparent specific activity of 180 nmol/mg/min, a value higher than previously reported, in the presence of phospholipids, suggesting that stabilization of the transmembrane domains is necessary for ATP hydrolysis. N-terminal half P-glycoprotein-beta-galactosidase also showed ability to hydrolyze ATP but with slightly lower specific activity. Both ATPase activities showed similar characteristics when the effect of several inhibitors was analyzed, indicating that the N-terminal ATP-binding domain contains all residues necessary to hydrolyze ATP without interacting with the C-terminal ATP-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1562625592,"The HER2/neu gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly homologous to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of the receptor in mammary and ovarian carcinoma correlates with poor patient prognosis. To determine how the overexpression of a normal receptor leads to the generation of an oncogenic signal, we compared the patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor-derived human cell lines expressing high levels of p185HER2/neu. In intact SKBR3 cells, basal phosphorylation of p185HER2/neu was not detected. However, pretreatment of cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, led to the detection of phosphotyrosine on phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), GTPase-activating protein but not on the RAF-1 kinase. Strikingly, PLC-gamma was detected in a complex which contained multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. This complex was detected only in cytoplasmic fractions and had a distinct composition in different p185HER2/neu-overexpressing cell lines. Although GTPase-activating protein has been found previously in association with proteins of 190 and 62 kDa in fibroblasts, in SKBR3 cells it was found associated with multiple additional tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. These experiments show that SKBR3 cells possess high levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase that can act upon p185HER2/neu. Moreover, they reveal, for the first time, the presence of PLC-gamma and GTPase-activating protein in cytosolic complexes containing a variety of other tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. These observations suggest novel possibilities for the specific definition of receptor-generated signals in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572204645,"Acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) of Penicillium chrysogenum was purified to homogeneity (745-fold) from fungal cultures grown a chemically defined medium containing acetate as the main carbon source. The enzyme showed maximal rate of catalysis when incubated 50 mM HCl-Tris buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, ACS showed hyperbolic behavior against acetate, CoA, and ATP; the Km values calculated for these substrates were 6.8, 0.18, and 17 mM, respectively. ACS recognized as substrates not only acetate but also several fatty acids ranging between C2 and C8 and some aromatic molecules (phenylacetic, 2-thiopheneacetic, and 3-thiopheneacetic acids). ATP can be replaced by ADP although, this case, a lower activity was observed (37%). ACS inhibited by some thiol reagents (5,5'-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate) and divalent cations (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+), whereas it was stimulated when the reaction mixtures contained 1 mM dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, or 2-mercaptoethanol. The calculated molecular mass of ACS was 139 +/- 1 kDa, and the native enzyme is composed of two apparent identical subunits (70 kDa) an alpha 2 oligomeric structure. ACS activity was regulated in vivo by carbon catabolite inactivation when glucose was taken up by cells which the enzyme had been previously induced. This enzyme can be coupled in vitro to acyl-CoA:6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase from P. chrysogenum, thus allowing the reconstitution of the functional enzymatic system which catalyzes the two latter reactions responsible for the biosynthesis of different penicillins. The ACS from Aspergillus nidulans can also be coupled to 6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase to synthesize penicillins. These results strongly indicate that this enzyme can catalyze the activation (to their CoA thioesters) of some of the side-chain precursors required these two fungi for the production of several penicillins. All these data are reported here for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W1592393366,"In polarized epithelial cells aminopeptidase N is targeted to the apical membrane. The aim of this study was to determine whether a sorting signal is necessary for its correct transport to the apical membrane and, if so, to localize this sorting signal to one of the domains of the transmembrane protein. Anchor-minus aminopeptidase N, consisting of the hemagglutinin signal peptide including its cleavage site, and the ectoplasmic domain of human aminopeptidase N were stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured on polycarbonate filters. By measurement of the enzymatic activity it was found that the anchor-minus aminopeptidase N was secreted in a polarized manner to the apical side. As a reference the secretion of the secretory granule protein, cystatin C, was likewise studied. Cystatin C was found to be secreted in a nonpolarized manner to both domains. Our data thus show that human aminopeptidase N carries an apical sorting signal and that it is localized on the ectodomain of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1518845984,"Abstract Patients with leukocyte adhesion molecule (CD11/CD18, beta 2 integrins) deficiency have structural defects in the common beta subunit (CD18), which prevent heterodimer formation and normal cell surface expression of these receptors, leading to life-threatening bacterial infections. To elucidate the nature of these defects in a patient with partial (type II) deficiency, abnormal CD18 cDNA clones were isolated, using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the patient's B cell-derived cDNAs. Sequence analysis revealed two mutant alleles. cDNA clones, representing a maternal allele, contained both a 12-base pair insertion resulting in an in-frame addition of four amino acids between P247 and E248 and a C1756----T nucleotide transition, resulting in an R586----W substitution in the normal CD18 protein. The inframe insertion arose by a single nucleotide C----A transversion in the 3' terminus of an intron, generating aberrant splice acceptor site. Other cDNA clones contained an A1052----G nucleotide transition not present in either parent which resulted in an N351----S substitution. To determine the functional importance of these changes, cDNA encoding a normal alpha chain (CD11b) was cotransfected into COS with CD18 cDNAs encoding for wild-type, maternal mutant allele, or CD18 containing N351----S substitution. Immunostaining of transfectants with anti-CD18 monoclonal antibodies revealed no cell surface expression of the maternal mutant CD18, and 22% surface expression of N351----S CD18. Both the insertion and the N351----S mutations occurred in a 250 amino acid extracellular region of CD18 that is highly conserved among beta integrins supporting a role for this region in heterodimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1553481145,"CAD is a multidomain protein that catalyzes the first three steps in mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The 243-kDa polypeptide consists of four functional domains; glutamine amidotransferase (GLNase), carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase). Controlled proteolysis of hamster CAD was found to cleave the molecule into 18 fragments which successively accumulate and disappear during the course of digestion. Each fragment was isolated and partially sequenced to determine its location in the polypeptide chain. Proteolysis was found to usually occur at the junctions between the domains and sub-domains identified by sequence homology. All proteases of low to moderate specificity cleaved the molecule in a similar fashion. The rate of proteolysis widely varied and the interdomain regions were not always accessible to proteases. Each of the major functional domains is postulated to consist of subdomains. The duplicated halves of the CPSase domain (116 kDa) have a homologous structure consisting of 11-, 25-26-, and 21-22-kDa subdomains. Prolonged digestion cleaved the DHOase domain (36.6 kDa) into two stable species suggesting that this region is comprised of 11.5- and 15.0-kDa subdomains. Similarly, proteolysis of the 21-kDa catalytic subdomain of the GLNase domain (40 kDa) indicated a bilobal structure consisting of 12.3- and 8.5-kDa chain segments. The connecting region between the two ATCase subdomains (16.4 and 18 kDa) was not cleaved. Copurification of many of the domains showed that they remain associated by noncovalent interactions even after the connecting segments have been cleaved. The chain segments, the linkers, which connect the domains and subdomains were conserved in length but not in sequence, were predicted to be relatively hydrophilic and flexible but did not show a tendency to assume a particular secondary structure. These studies provide a more detailed map of the structural organization of the CAD polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1498877979,"Abstract Somatostatin (SST) receptors activate potassium channels, stimulate protein phosphatases, inhibit adenylate cyclase and close calcium channels. These multiple effects are controlled by guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi and Go types. In the present study we have identified the G proteins coupling with brain SST receptors. To this end, brain SST receptors were solubilized in G-protein coupled form. Binding of the SST analogue MK 678 to the solubilized receptor was completely inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (IC50 = 100 nM), reflecting decreased receptor affinity for agonist following uncoupling of the receptor and G protein(s). Antibodies raised against specific COOH-terminal peptides of the G proteins Gi(1-3), Go, and Gz were used to probe for SST receptor-G protein coupling in this system. Antibodies binding to the COOH-terminal regions of Gi1 and Gi2 (antibody AS) and Gi3 (antibody EC) inhibited binding of 125I-MK 678 (75 pM) by 57 +/- 4% and 48 +/- 5%, respectively. The effects of these antibodies were concentration-dependent and additive, such that in combination AS and EC completely inhibited binding. Antibodies binding to the COOH-terminal region of Go (GO) and Gz (QN) did not affect binding of 125I-MK 678, indicating that neither Go nor Gz are associated with the brain SST receptor. Prelabeling of the receptor with 125I-MK 678 prior to addition of antibody induced the formation of a locked conformation of the agonist-bound receptor-G protein complex which was insensitive to antibody. In conclusion, Gi1 and/or Gi2 and Gi3 are coupled in approximately equal proportions to the brain 125I-MK 678-binding SST receptor, accounting for all of the G protein coupling of this receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1491979452,"To gain insight into the mechanisms which control the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), we have partially purified and characterized several intracellular proteins which are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Partial purification was achieved by immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Antisera generated against the partially purified proteins were used to identify at least five novel EGFR putative substrates, designated, on the basis of their apparent molecular weight, p97, p68, p61, p56, and p23. All of these proteins became specifically phosphorylated on tyrosine after EGF treatment of intact cells, as assessed by phosphoamino acid analysis, and none of them represented an EGFR degradation product. The phosphorylation of these proteins appeared to be relatively specific for the EGFR. In particular, an EGFR-related kinase, erbB-2 was much less efficient than EGFR at phosphorylating p97, p56, and p23 and incapable of phosphorylating p68. The identification of these novel EGFR putative substrates should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the specificity of EGFR-mediated mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1511153971,"Polar amino acids in the (putative) distal site are well conserved in P450s. For example, Glu318 for P450d is well conserved as either Glu or Asp for P450s, and Thr319 for P450d is also conserved for P450s. We have studied how mutations at Glu318 and Thr319 of P450d influence the catalytic activity toward methanol associated with the activation of O2. Catalytic activities of Glu318Asp, Glu318Ala, and Thr319Ala mutants toward methanol were 60, 25, and 38%, respectively, compared with that of the wild type. O2 consumption and NADPH oxidation rates of each mutants varied corresponding to the catalytic activities. However, surprisingly, efficiency (16-40%) of incorporated O to the substrate vs. consumed O2 for the Glu318Ala and Thr319Ala mutants were higher than that (9%) of the wild type. In addition, H2O2, which is produced from uncoupling for the wild-type P450d, was not observed for reaction of the Glu318Ala and Thr319Ala mutants. It seemed that consumed O2 was partially reduced to 2 mol of H2O by 4-electron transfer from NADPH for the wild-type and Thr319Ala mutant. However, for the two Glu318 mutants, it appeared that the consumed O2 was not reduced in the same way. It was thus suggested that the conserved Glu318 and Thr319 of P450d are not essential for the activation of O2 in the methanol oxidation. Role of the water molecule or the methanol molecule in the catalytic function was implied."
https://openalex.org/W1597112024,"Soluble luminal proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are known to be retained by a tetrapeptide retention signal, KDEL. We report in this communication that the KDEL sequence when appended to the carboxy terminus of a cell surface membrane protein, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), resulted in its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Selective surface biotinylation revealed that about 90-95% of the expressed DPPIV was retained in the ER. Appendance of the sequence KDEV did not, however, result in ER retention, illustrating the functional specificity of the retention signal. The ER retention was not due to misfolding of the mutant protein, as the mutant proteins remained enzymatically active. Our data suggest that the KDEL receptor is able to recognize and recycle type II membrane proteins containing a carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence and postulates the existence of such yet to be identified endogenous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1549048350,"Two site-specifically mutated human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases (His-452----Gln and Glu-457----Gln) were expressed in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deletion mutant Escherichia coli JRG1342. The expressed mutant E3s were purified to near homogeneity using DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxyapatite columns. The initial velocity measurements in the absence of products for the Gln-452 mutant E3 in the direction of NAD+ reduction showed parallel lines in double-reciprocal plots, indicating that the mutant E3, like wild-type enzyme, catalyzed E3 reaction via a ping-pong mechanism. The specific activity of the Gln-452 mutant E3 was about 0.2% of that of wild-type enzyme. Its Km for dihydrolipoamide was dramatically increased by 63-fold. The substitution of His-452 to Gln resulted in a destabilization of the transition state of human E3 catalysis by about 6.4 kcal mol-1. The Gln-457 mutant E3, unlike wild-type enzyme, catalyzed E3 reaction via a sequential mechanism in the direction of NAD+ reduction based on the intersecting lines shown on double-reciprocal plots. Its specific activity decreased to 28% of that of wild-type enzyme. Its Km for dihydrolipoamide increased about 4.3-fold. The substitution of Glu-457 to Gln resulted in a destabilization of the transition state by about 1.7 kcal mol-1. These results indicate that His-452, which is a possible proton acceptor/donor in human E3 reaction, is critical to human E3 catalysis and that the local environment around His-452 and Glu-457, which are suggested to be hydrogen-bonded, is important in the binding of dihydrolipoamide to the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1597906870,"A glycosphingolipid that reacted positively to anti-stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) antiserum accumulated in human lens in association with aging and senile cataract formation. Since this antiserum recognizes Lewis(x) (Le(x)) structure, Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc-, which is a typical tumor-associated and differentiation-related saccharide chain, the lens glycolipid was predicted to be a Lex antigen. The glycolipid purified from cataractous lens tissues was indeed a Lex glycolipid, Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1- 4Glc beta 1-1 ceramide. Enhanced expression of the Lex glycolipid may affect the organization of lens plasma membranes through Le(x)-Le(x) interactions, as suggested for compaction in mouse preimplantation embryos and embryonic teratocarcinomas, resulting in lens opacification, namely cataract."

https://openalex.org/W1481268245,"We report that the sterol-mediated suppression of the mRNA levels of three cholesterogenic enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthetase is partially overcome by the calcium ionophore A23187. Addition of A23187 to the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 in the presence of fetal calf serum led to rapid increases in mRNA concentration of up to 40-fold for HMG-CoA synthase and 15-fold for HMG-CoA reductase with little or no change in FPP synthetase mRNA levels. Treatment of HepG2 cells with A23187 resulted in approximately 2-4-fold increases in the mRNA levels for these three enzymes. The increases in HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs were maximal after treatment of THP-1 cells with 10 micrograms/ml A23187 for 3 h. The stimulation was blocked by actinomycin D but not by cycloheximide treatment. Ionophore treatment had no effect on the half-lives of the mRNAs for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Surprisingly, the addition of A23187 to THP-1 cells incubated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid also led to significant increases in the mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Finally, the stimulation of these mRNA levels by A23187 was reduced in cells in which protein kinase C had been inactivated by preincubation of the cells with a phorbol ester. Taken together, these data suggest that A23187 treatment results in increased transcription of HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and, in some cell types, FPP synthetase by a mechanism that does not involve de novo protein synthesis. We speculate that A23187 treatment results in the modification of a trans-acting factor(s) which is common for the transcription of all these genes."
