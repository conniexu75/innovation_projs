https://openalex.org/W2728365508,"The results of a phase I trial assessing a personal neoantigen multi-peptide vaccine in patients with melanoma, showing feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity. Neoantigens have long been considered optimal targets for anti-tumour vaccines, and recent mutation coding and prediction techniques have aimed to streamline their identification and selection. Two papers in this issue report results from personalized neoantigen vaccine trials in patients with cancer. Catherine Wu and colleagues report the results of a phase I trial of a personalized cancer vaccine that targets up to 20 patient neoantigens. The vaccine was safe and induced tumour-antigen-specific immune responses. Four out of six patients treated showed no recurrence at 25 months, and progressing patients responded to further therapy with checkpoint inhibitor. Ugur Sahin and colleagues report the first-in-human application of a personalized neoantigen vaccine in patients with melanoma. Their vaccination strategy includes sequencing and computational identification of neoantigens from patients, and design and manufacture of a poly-antigen RNA vaccine for treatment. In 13 patients, the vaccine boosted immunity against some of the selected tumour antigens from the individual patients, and two patients showed infiltration of tumour-reactive T cells. These results suggest that personalized vaccines could be refined and tailored to provide clinical benefit as cancer immunotherapies. Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens1, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune response2, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies."

https://openalex.org/W2727929522,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are no mechanism-based therapies. The disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments, whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4–3.5 A resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer’s disease. Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306–378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a range of neurodegenerative diseases. High-resolution structures of tau filaments shed light on the ultrastructure of neurofibrillary lesions in Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer's disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. The lesions are made of paired helical and straight tau filaments (PHFs and SFs, respectively). Different tau filaments characterize other neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that molecular conformers of aggregated tau underlie human tauopathies. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are currently available. Here, Sjors Scheres and colleagues present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.5 A resolution and corresponding atomic models of PHFs and SFs from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease. Their results show that cryo-EM enables atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material and could be used to study a range of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2727828415,"Plasticity of the cell state has been proposed to drive resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapies, thereby limiting their effectiveness. A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGFβ-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin. We identify vulnerability to ferroptic cell death induced by inhibition of a lipid peroxidase pathway as a feature of therapy-resistant cancer cells across diverse mesenchymal cell-state contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2729726531,"Crystal structures of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) bound to the agonists AM11542 and AM841 reveal notable structural rearrangements upon receptor activation, and this flexibility may be a common feature among other G-protein-coupled receptors. The human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the main target of the plant cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannbinol (Δ9-THC), the key psychoactive compound in Cannabis sativa. CB1 is activated by endocannabinoids and is a therapeutic target for pain management, epilepsy and obesity, among others, although an active receptor structure is still lacking. Here, Zhi-Jie Liu and colleagues report the crystal structure of CB1 activated by two potent Δ9-THC derivatives, AM11542 and AM841. Both of these agonists have a gem-dimethyl group on their alkyl chain which leads to significant enhancement in their potency and efficacy. Receptor activation involves large-scale structural rearrangements on both extracellular and cytoplasmic sides and a significant reduction in the size of the binding pocket. These conformational changes involve a novel molecular 'twin toggle switch', the synergistic movement of two key residues during activation, which the authors suggest may be common to other G-protein-coupled receptors. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the principal target of the psychoactive constituent of marijuana, the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC)1. Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841) at 2.80 A and 2.95 A resolution, respectively. The two CB1–agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure, relative to the antagonist-bound state2, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G-protein-binding region. In addition, a ‘twin toggle switch’ of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (superscripts denote Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering3) is experimentally observed and appears to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G-protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties."
https://openalex.org/W2727119164,"Glioblastoma is a universally lethal cancer with a median survival time of approximately 15 months. Despite substantial efforts to define druggable targets, there are no therapeutic options that notably extend the lifespan of patients with glioblastoma. While previous work has largely focused on in vitro cellular models, here we demonstrate a more physiologically relevant approach to target discovery in glioblastoma. We adapted pooled RNA interference (RNAi) screening technology for use in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models, creating a high-throughput negative-selection screening platform in a functional in vivo tumour microenvironment. Using this approach, we performed parallel in vivo and in vitro screens and discovered that the chromatin and transcriptional regulators needed for cell survival in vivo are non-overlapping with those required in vitro. We identified transcription pause-release and elongation factors as one set of in vivo-specific cancer dependencies, and determined that these factors are necessary for enhancer-mediated transcriptional adaptations that enable cells to survive the tumour microenvironment. Our lead hit, JMJD6, mediates the upregulation of in vivo stress and stimulus response pathways through enhancer-mediated transcriptional pause-release, promoting cell survival specifically in vivo. Targeting JMJD6 or other identified elongation factors extends survival in orthotopic xenograft mouse models, suggesting that targeting transcription elongation machinery may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma. More broadly, this study demonstrates the power of in vivo phenotypic screening to identify new classes of 'cancer dependencies' not identified by previous in vitro approaches, and could supply new opportunities for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2731543976,"The lifestyle of intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, is intimately connected to that of their host, primarily for nutrient supply. Nutrients act not only as primary sources of energy but also as regulators of gene expression, metabolism and growth, through various signalling networks that enable cells to sense and adapt to varying environmental conditions. Canonical nutrient-sensing pathways are presumed to be absent from the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, thus raising the question of whether these parasites can sense and cope with fluctuations in host nutrient levels. Here we show that Plasmodium blood-stage parasites actively respond to host dietary calorie alterations through rearrangement of their transcriptome accompanied by substantial adjustment of their multiplication rate. A kinome analysis combined with chemical and genetic approaches identified KIN as a critical regulator that mediates sensing of nutrients and controls a transcriptional response to the host nutritional status. KIN shares homology with SNF1/AMPKα, and yeast complementation studies suggest that it is part of a functionally conserved cellular energy-sensing pathway. Overall, these findings reveal a key parasite nutrient-sensing mechanism that is critical for modulating parasite replication and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2727010309,"Cytokines are potent immune modulating agents but are not ideal medicines in their natural form due to their short half-life and pleiotropic systemic effects. NKTR-214 is a clinical-stage biologic that comprises interleukin-2 (IL2) protein bound by multiple releasable polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. In this highly PEG-bound form, the IL2 is inactive; therefore, NKTR-214 is a biologic prodrug. When administered in vivo, the PEG chains slowly release, creating a cascade of increasingly active IL2 protein conjugates bound by fewer PEG chains. The 1-PEG-IL2 and 2-PEG-IL2 species derived from NKTR-214 are the most active conjugated-IL2 species. Free-IL2 protein is undetectable in vivo as it is eliminated faster than formed. The PEG chains on NKTR-214 are located at the region of IL2 that contacts the alpha (α) subunit of the heterotrimeric IL2 receptor complex, IL2Rαβγ, reducing its ability to bind and activate the heterotrimer. The IL2Rαβγ complex is constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therefore, without the use of mutations, PEGylation reduces the affinity for IL2Rαβγ to a greater extent than for IL2Rβγ, the receptor complex predominant on CD8 T cells. NKTR-214 treatment in vivo favors activation of CD8 T cells over Tregs in the tumor microenvironment to provide anti-tumor efficacy in multiple syngeneic models. Mechanistic modeling based on in vitro and in vivo kinetic data provides insight into the mechanism of NKTR-214 pharmacology. The model reveals that conjugated-IL2 protein derived from NKTR-214 occupy IL-2Rβγ to a greater extent compared to free-IL2 protein. The model accurately describes the sustained in vivo signaling observed after a single dose of NKTR-214 and explains how the properties of NKTR-214 impart a unique kinetically-controlled immunological mechanism of action."

https://openalex.org/W2728571679,"Sorafenib (Nexavar) is a broad-spectrum multikinase inhibitor that proves effective in treating advanced renal-cell carcinoma and liver cancer. Despite its well-characterized mechanism of action on several established cancer-related protein kinases, sorafenib causes variable responses among human tumors, although the cause for this variation is unknown. In an unbiased screening of an oncology drug library, we found that sorafenib activates recruitment of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin to damaged mitochondria. We show that sorafenib inhibits the activity of both complex II/III of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. Dual inhibition of these complexes, but not inhibition of each individual complex, stabilizes the serine-threonine protein kinase PINK1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane and activates Parkin. Unlike the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which activates the mitophagy response, sorafenib treatment triggers PINK1/Parkin-dependent cellular apoptosis, which is attenuated upon Bcl-2 overexpression. In summary, our results reveal a new mechanism of action for sorafenib as a mitocan and suggest that high Parkin activity levels could make tumor cells more sensitive to sorafenib's actions, providing one possible explanation why Parkin may be a tumor suppressor gene. These insights could be useful in developing new rationally designed combination therapies with sorafenib."
https://openalex.org/W2733439154,"Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths in older adults. Even when no injury occurs, about half of all older adults who fall are unable to get up without assistance. The extended period of lying on the floor often leads to medical complications, including muscle damage, dehydration, anxiety and fear of falling. Wearable sensor systems incorporating accelerometers and/or gyroscopes are designed to prevent long lies by automatically detecting and alerting care providers to the occurrence of a fall. Research groups have reported up to 100% accuracy in detecting falls in experimental settings. However, there is a lack of studies examining accuracy in the real-world setting. In this study, we examined the accuracy of a fall detection system based on real-world fall and non-fall data sets. Five young adults and 19 older adults went about their daily activities while wearing tri-axial accelerometers. Older adults experienced 10 unanticipated falls during the data collection. Approximately 400 hours of activities of daily living were recorded. We employed a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to identify falls and non-fall events. We found that our system was able to detect 8 out of the 10 falls in older adults using signals from a single accelerometer (waist or sternum). Furthermore, our system did not report any false alarm during approximately 28.5 hours of recorded data from young adults. However, with older adults, the false positive rate among individuals ranged from 0 to 0.3 false alarms per hour. While our system showed higher fall detection and substantially lower false positive rate than the existing fall detection systems, there is a need for continuous efforts to collect real-world data within the target population to perform fall validation studies for fall detection systems on bigger real-world fall and non-fall datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2726185788,"A new disease in farmed rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) was described in Norway in 2013. The disease mainly affected the heart and resembled heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). HSMI is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and a search for a similar virus in the diseased rainbow trout led to detection of a sequence with 85% similarity to PRV. This finding called for a targeted effort to assess the risk the new PRV-variant pose on farmed rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon by studying infection and disease pathogenesis, aiming to provide more diagnostic knowledge. Based on the genetic relationship to PRV, the novel virus is referred to as PRV-Oncorhynchus mykiss (PRV-Om) in contrast to PRV-Salmo salar (PRV-Ss). In experimental trials, intraperitoneally injected PRV-Om was shown to replicate in blood in both salmonid species, but more effectively in rainbow trout. In rainbow trout, the virus levels peaked in blood and heart of cohabitants 6 weeks post challenge, along with increased expression of antiviral genes (Mx and viperin) in the spleen, with 80-100% of the cohabitants infected. Heart inflammation was diagnosed in all cohabitants examined 8 weeks post challenge. In contrast, less than 50% of the Atlantic salmon cohabitants were infected between 8 and 16 weeks post challenge and the antiviral response in these fish was very low. From 12 weeks post challenge and onwards, mild focal myocarditis was demonstrated in a few virus-positive salmon. In conclusion, PRV-Om infects both salmonid species, but faster transmission, more notable antiviral response and more prominent heart pathology were observed in rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W2731611291,"CD6 is associated with T-cell modulation and is implicated in several autoimmune diseases. We previously demonstrated that Itolizumab, a CD6 domain 1 (CD6D1) specific humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibited the proliferation and cytokine production by T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody or when co-stimulated with ALCAM. Aberrant IL-17 producing CD4+ helper T-cells (Th17) have been identified as pivotal for the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory autoimmune disorders, including psoriasis. Itolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in human diseases known to have an IL-17 driven pathogenesis. Here, in in vitro experiments we show that by day 3 of human PBMC activation using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 co-stimulation in a Th17 polarizing milieu, 15–35% of CD4+ T-cells overexpress CD6 and there is an establishment of differentiated Th17 cells. Addition of Itolizumab reduces the activation and differentiation of T cells to Th17 cells and decreases production of IL-17. These effects are associated with the reduction of key transcription factors pSTAT3 and RORγT. Further, transcription analysis studies in these conditions indicate that Itolizumab suppressed T cell activation by primarily reducing cell cycle, DNA transcription and translation associated genes. To understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we evaluated the effect of this anti-human CD6D1 mAb on ALCAM-CD6 as well as TCR-mediated T cell activation. We show that Itolizumab but not its F(ab’)2 fragment directly inhibits CD6 receptor hyper-phosphorylation and leads to subsequent decrease in associated ZAP70 kinase and docking protein SLP76. Since Itolizumab binds to CD6 expressed only on human and chimpanzee, we developed an antibody binding specifically to mouse CD6D1. This antibody successfully ameliorated the incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalitis in the mice model. These results position CD6 as a key molecule in sustaining the activation and differentiation of T cells and an important target for modulating autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2730538690,"Knowledge of black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) spatial ecology is surprisingly limited despite their vital ecological roles. Fine-scale assessments of space use patterns and resource selection are particularly lacking, although development of tracking technologies has allowed data collection at finer temporal and spatial resolution. Objectives of this study were to conduct the first assessment of monthly home range and core area sizes of resident black and turkey vultures with consideration to sex, as well as elucidate differences in monthly, seasonal, and annual activity patterns based on fine-scale movement data analyses. We collected 2.8-million locations for 9 black and 9 turkey vultures from June 2013 –August 2015 using solar-powered GSM/GPS transmitters. We quantified home ranges and core areas using the dynamic Brownian bridge movement model and evaluated differences as a function of species, sex, and month. Mean monthly home ranges for turkey vultures were ~50% larger than those of black vultures, although mean core area sizes did not differ between species. Turkey vulture home ranges varied little across months, with exception to a notable reduction in space-use in May, which corresponds with timing of chick-rearing activities. Black vulture home ranges and core areas as well as turkey vulture core areas were larger in breeding season months (January–April). Comparison of space use between male and female vultures was only possible for black vultures, and space use was only slightly larger for females during breeding months (February–May). Analysis of activity patterns revealed turkey vultures spend more time in flight and switch motion states (between flight and stationary) more frequently than black vultures across temporal scales. This study reveals substantive variability in space use and activity rates between sympatric black and turkey vultures, providing insights into potential behavioral mechanisms contributing to niche differentiation between these species."
https://openalex.org/W2727510930,"More than 93 percent of parents place high importance on sex education in both middle and high school. Sex education in middle and high school is widely supported by parents regardless of their political affiliation. Using data from a large diverse sample of 1,633 parents of children aged 9 to 21 years, we examined whether views on sex education differed by parents’ political affiliation. More than 89 percent of parents that identified as Republicans or Democrats support including a wide range of topics in sex education including puberty, healthy relationships, abstinence, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and birth control in high school. In middle school, 78 percent or more of both parents that identified as Republicans and Democrats support the inclusion of those topics. Controlling for key demographic factors, parents that identified as Democrats are more likely than those that identified as Republicans to support the inclusion of the topics of healthy relationships, birth control, STDs, and sexual orientation in both middle and high school. However, a strong majority of Republican parents want all these topics included in sex education. Sex education which includes a broad set of topics represents an area of strong agreement between parents of both political parties."

The hand axe found with the body of the Alpine Iceman is one of the rare copper objects that is firmly dated to the early Copper Age because of the radiocarbon dating of the axe wooden shaft. Here we report the measurement of the lead isotope ratios of the copper blade. The results unambiguously indicate that the source of the metal is the ore-rich area of Southern Tuscany, despite ample evidence that Alpine copper ore sources were known and exploited at the time. The experimental results are discussed within the framework of all the available coeval archaeometallurgical data in Central-Southern Europe: they show that the Alps were a neat cultural barrier separating distinct metal circuits. The direct evidence of raw metal or object movement between Central Italy and the Alps is surprising and provides a new perspective on long-distance relocation of goods and relationships between the early Copper Age cultures in the area. The result is in line with the recent investigations re-evaluating the timing and extent of copper production in Central Italy in the 4th millennium BC."
https://openalex.org/W2734213403,"The PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP), which catalyzes the committed step for the synthesis of triacylglycerol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exerts a negative regulatory effect on the level of phosphatidate used for the de novo synthesis of membrane phospholipids. This raises the question whether PAP thereby affects the expression and activity of enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis. Here, we examined the PAP-mediated regulation of CHO1-encoded phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS), which catalyzes the committed step for the synthesis of major phospholipids via the CDP–diacylglycerol pathway. The lack of PAP in the pah1Δ mutant highly elevated PSS activity, exhibiting a growth-dependent up-regulation from the exponential to the stationary phase of growth. Immunoblot analysis showed that the elevation of PSS activity results from an increase in the level of the enzyme encoded by CHO1. Truncation analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the CHO1 promoter indicated that Cho1 expression in the pah1Δ mutant is induced through the inositol-sensitive upstream activation sequence (UASINO), a cis-acting element for the phosphatidate-controlled Henry (Ino2–Ino4/Opi1) regulatory circuit. The abrogation of Cho1 induction and PSS activity by a CHO1 UASINO mutation suppressed pah1Δ effects on lipid synthesis, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane morphology, and lipid droplet formation, but not on growth at elevated temperature. Loss of the DGK1-encoded diacylglycerol kinase, which converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidate, partially suppressed the pah1Δ-mediated induction of Cho1 and PSS activity. Collectively, these data showed that PAP activity controls the expression of PSS for membrane phospholipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2729364438,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are ubiquitous lipid kinases that activate signaling cascades controlling cell survival, proliferation, protein synthesis, and vesicle trafficking. PI3Ks have dual kinase specificity: a lipid kinase activity that phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl of phosphoinositides and a protein-kinase activity that includes autophosphorylation. Despite the wealth of biochemical and structural information on PI3Kα, little is known about the identity and roles of individual active-site residues in catalysis. To close this gap, we explored the roles of residues of the catalytic domain and the regulatory subunit of human PI3Kα in lipid and protein phosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic assays, and quantitative mass spectrometry, we precisely mapped key residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis by PI3Kα. Our results revealed that Lys-776, located in the P-loop of PI3Kα, is essential for the recognition of lipid and ATP substrates and also plays an important role in PI3Kα autophosphorylation. Replacement of the residues His-936 and His-917 in the activation and catalytic loops, respectively, with alanine dramatically changed PI3Kα kinetics. Although H936A inactivated the lipid kinase activity without affecting autophosphorylation, H917A abolished both the lipid and protein kinase activities of PI3Kα.

The p85α subunit also contains five domains: an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP-like or BH) domain, and two Src homology 2, N-terminal SH2 (nSH2) and C-terminal SH2 (cSH2) (SH2 and cSH2) domains separated by an inter-SH2 domain (iSH2) that binds to p110α (Fig. 1A). PIK3CA, the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, is somatically mutated in diverse tumor types. The majority of mutations in solid tumors (>80%) are in the conserved regions of the helical and kinase domains (7.Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H. Gazdar A.

In addition to its lipid kinase activity, PI3Kα displays a protein kinase activity that results in the autophosphorylation of the p85α subunit (22.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M.

Differences in the preparation of the protein may account for the conflicting results; the latter work used recombinant protein, whereas the former used immunoprecipitated enzyme. In contrast to the vast knowledge of the biological significance of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity in cell signaling, the physiological relevance of the protein kinase activity of PI3Kα is still not well characterized (27.Thomas D.

Structural studies on PI3Ks have revealed many features of the kinase domain including the presence of the phosphate-binding loop/P-loop and of the catalytic and activation loops described in the well-characterized protein kinases (29.Walker E.H.

In the previously published structure of PI3Kα with diC4-PIP2 (PDB ID 4OVV), we determined that the PIP2 substrate binds in a groove formed by the P-loop (p110α residues 772–778), the activation loop of the kinase domain (p110α residues 935–958), and the iSH2 coiled-coil (31.Miller M.S. Schmidt-Kittler O. Bolduc D.M. Brower E.T. Chaves-Moreira D. Allaire M. Kinzler K.W. Jennings I.G. Thompson P.E. Cole P.A. Amzel L.M. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Structural basis of nSH2 regulation and lipid binding in PI3Kα.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 5198-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Modeling of bound ATP shows that the 3′ hydroxyl group of diC4-PIP2 is oriented toward the γ-phosphate of the ATP (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the short-chain lipid substrate is in a position accessible to the membrane, which would allow the C-18 and C-20 hydrophobic tails of the physiological PIP2 substrate to be buried into the membrane. Being negatively charged, its placement in the structure makes it well-suited to interact with the basic residues on the surface of the iSH2 domain and those of the loops of the C2 and kinase domains as originally proposed in a model of the lipid membrane interaction with the p110α/niSH2 heterodimer (30.Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Schmidt-Kittler O. Samuels Y. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. The structure of a human p110α/p85α complex elucidates the effects of oncogenic PI3Kα mutations.Science. 2007; 318: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Despite the favorable orientation of the PIP2 substrate, the structure of this complex represents an inactive conformation of PI3Kα, as the reactive 3-OH of the PIP2 is too far (∼6 Å) from the γ-phosphate of the ATP for a productive phosphoryl transfer. An additional characteristic suggesting that this is an inactive enzyme conformation is a salt bridge between Lys-948 of the activation loop and Glu-342 of the nSH2 domain, which locks the kinase domain and prevents the nSH2 domain from binding to effectors (31.Miller M.S. Schmidt-Kittler O. Bolduc D.M. Brower E.T. Chaves-Moreira D. Allaire M. Kinzler K.W. Jennings I.G. Thompson P.E. Cole P.A. Amzel L.M. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Structural basis of nSH2 regulation and lipid binding in PI3Kα.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 5198-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, unlike in most of the previous p110 structures, in the PI3Kα–PIP2 complex structure the activation loop is ordered; it is nested near the iSH2 and nSH2 domains of p85α and positioned in a way that allows communication between p85α and the kinase domain of p110α. Previous biochemical studies on PI3Ks have reported that Lys-802 in p110α (Lys-833 in p110γ) is involved in phosphate transfer reaction (29.Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the activation loop of p110α is a determinant of lipid substrate specificity and not protein kinase activity and that Lys-942 and Lys-949 within the activation loop of p110α (Lys-973 and Ar-980, respectively, in the activation loop of p110γ) are required for lipid substrate recognition (33.Pirola L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the conserved DRHXXN motif of the catalytic loop, Asp-731 and Asn-736 of Vps34p (Class III PI3K) and Arg-916 of p110α are essential for the kinase activity of PI3Ks (23.Dhand R.

Despite the wealth of information on the PI3Kα active site, the identity and role of many of the individual residues in lipid and protein phosphorylation remain largely unknown. To answer these fundamental questions, we used the structure of the PI3Kα–PIP2 complex as a template and selected residues that lie within 9 Å of the catalytic PIP2-binding site for analyzing the effect of substitutions on these residues. Six p110α mutants, H917A-p110α/p85α, H936A-p110α/p85α, K776E-p110α/p85α, R777E-p110α/p85α, E722A-p110α/p85α, and K724E-p110α/p85α, and two p85α mutants, p110α/R461E-p85α and p110α/R465E-p85α, were expressed and studied (Fig. 1, A and B). Kinetic characterization, quantitative mass spectrometry, and analysis of the structure of PI3Kα–PIP2 complex provided insights into the binding sites for lipid, ATP, and protein substrates and the catalytic mechanisms involved in lipid and protein phosphorylation by PI3Kα. All proteins (wild-type (WT) PI3Kα (p110α/p85α)) and mutants (H917A-p110α/p85α, H936A-p110α/p85α, K776E-p110α/p85α, R777E-p110α/p85α, E722A-p110α/p85α, K724E-p110α/p85α, p110α/R461E-p85α, p110α/R465E-p85α) were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The resulting proteins were ∼85–95% pure (Fig. 2A), and the yield was ∼2–3 mg per 4 liters of Sf9 cell culture. To confirm that the mutations do not disrupt the quaternary structure and structural integrity of PI3Kα, we performed gel-filtration chromatography and compared the chromatograms of the WT enzyme with those of the mutants. The mutants eluted as a single, symmetrical peak with the same retention volume as the WT enzyme, indicating that the single-point mutations do not disrupt PI3Kα folding or oligomerization (Fig. 2B). The kinetics of the lipid kinase activity of WT PI3Kα and the mutants were studied using a fluorescence polarization assay. The Km of WT PI3Kα was 1.77 ± 0.03 μm for PIP2 and 2.0 ± 0.5 μm for ATP with a Vmax of 1.78 ± 0.06 pmol/min (Table 1). Of the eight PI3Kα mutants, three showed a dramatic change in their kinetic parameters when compared with those of the WT enzyme (Table 1, Fig. 2, C and D). K776E-p110α/p85α showed a very high Km for both ATP and PIP2 substrates (Table 1), suggesting a role of Lys-776 in the recognition of both substrates. H917A-p110α/p85α and H936A-p110α/p85α of the catalytic and activation loops, respectively, showed a ∼50–100× reduction in their maximal activity compared with WT PI3Kα (Table 1), indicating that these residues play a role in catalysis. In the structure of the PI3Kα complex with PIP2, these two histidine residues do not make a direct interaction with either of the substrates and are too far to act as catalytic bases, but conformational changes during the catalytic cycle may bring these residues closer to a catalytically competent position as has been shown for protein kinases (35.Taylor S.S.

Glu-722 of p110α, located on the N-lobe, is close to a second PIP2-binding site identified in the PI3Kα–PIP2 complex structure (31.Miller M.S. Schmidt-Kittler O. Bolduc D.M. Brower E.T. Chaves-Moreira D. Allaire M. Kinzler K.W. Jennings I.G. Thompson P.E. Cole P.A. Amzel L.M. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Structural basis of nSH2 regulation and lipid binding in PI3Kα.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 5198-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although kinetic analysis shows that it is not involved in the recognition of the catalytic PIP2, this assay, performed with soluble PIP2, does not rule out that it may interact with the second lipid-binding site, as seen in the crystal structure. If, as suggested, this second site aids in anchoring PI3Kα to the plasma membrane, this mutation may have an effect on the in vivo activity. Lys-724 of p110α, also present on the N-lobe, is closer than Glu-722 to the PIP2 in the active site of the enzyme, and being positively charged, it could have a role in stabilizing the negative charge of PIP2; however, the kinetic analysis presented here suggests that it does not. Arg-777 in the P-loop of p110α is not involved in substrate recognition, in contrast to its neighboring residue, Lys-776. The lack of conservation of this arginine in the P-loop of protein kinases suggests that it does not play a role in the recognition of ATP. On the other hand, the lack of effect on the catalytic activity of the p85α mutants (p110α/R461E-p85α and p110α/R465E-p85α) argues against a role of these arginine residues in compensating the negative charge of the phosphates at positions 4 and 5 on the inositol ring of PIP2 but does not rule out the possibility of their participation in hydrogen bonding to PIP2. The kinetic mechanism of the wild-type enzyme was elucidated with initial velocity studies analyzed using double-reciprocal plots. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of velocities with varying concentrations of ATP at different fixed concentrations of PIP2 displayed convergence of a set of lines in the second quadrant (Fig. 3A). A similar analysis of rate data with varying concentrations of PIP2 at different fixed concentrations of ATP yielded a set of lines intersecting on the 1/v axis (Fig. 3B). This pattern of intersecting lines on the vertical axis is indicative of an ordered sequential mechanism involving the formation of a ternary complex (37.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior, and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 320-329Google Scholar). The dissociation constants, Ka for ATP and Kb for PIP2, were determined from the global fit of the data by nonlinear regression analysis to the ordered bisubstrate kinetic model. The dissociation constants Ka and Kb for the WT PI3Kα were 10.45 ± 0.25 μm and 2.49 ± 0.21 μm, respectively. The values of Ka and Kb for the K776E-p110α/p85α mutant were 146.23 ± 2.62 μm and 11.0 ± 0.01 μm, respectively. The high dissociation constants for K776E-p110α/p85α mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme are in agreement with the low affinity of this mutant for both the substrates, as observed in the lipid kinase assays described above. In addition to PIP2 phosphorylation, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, p110α, phosphorylates Ser-608 of its regulatory subunit, p85α. This phosphorylation has been proposed to have a regulatory effect on the activity of PI3K (23.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. PI 3-kinase is a dual specificity enzyme: autoregulation by an intrinsic protein-serine kinase activity.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To assess autophosphorylation, we used radioactive γ-32P-labeled ATP in the PI3Kα kinase reaction. We separated the proteins by SDS-PAGE and visualized the radioactive bands by autoradiography. The reaction carried out with WT PI3Kα displayed a strong signal for p85α, clearly indicating its autophosphorylation (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the PI3Kα mutants H917A-p110α/p85α and K776E-p110α/p85α lack protein kinase activity (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with our lipid kinase assays that showed H917A-p110α/p85α was inactive for lipid kinase activity and K776E-p110α/p85α showed a very low-binding affinity for ATP. The other mutants (H936A-p110α/p85α, R777E-p110α/p85α, E722A-p110α/p85α, and K724E-p110α/p85α) displayed a signal for p85α phosphorylation comparable with that of the WT, suggesting that these residues do not play a role in the substrate-binding and catalytic mechanism of protein kinase activity of PI3Kα. Interestingly, in the presence of lipid substrate PIP2, the autophosphorylation activity of the wild-type enzyme was almost negligible compared with the reaction in the absence of PIP2 (Fig. 4B). The high PIP2 concentration (50 μm) may compete with the protein substrate for the catalytic site of the enzyme, suggesting that the PIP2 substrate site and the protein substrate site overlap at least partially. To assess the extent of phosphorylation of Ser-608 of the p85α subunit of PI3Kα in cells, we purified the enzymes from infected Sf9 insect cells and mapped the phosphorylated sites in the recombinant WT PI3Kα enzyme and mutants by phospho-amino acid analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry. For this, we differentially labeled WT PI3Kα and mutants with isobaric tandem mass tags that release specific reporter ions upon fragmentation. Reporter ion intensities obtained by MS/MS were used to quantify the phosphorylated peptides in WT PI3Kα and mutants. We compared the ratios of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated Ser-608 for the WT and mutants. Three mutants (H936A-p110α/p85α, K776E-p110α/p85α, and H917A-p1"
https://openalex.org/W2733964076,"In recent years, use of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) as cleaner-fish to remove sea-lice have been chosen by many salmon farmers in Europe and Canada as an alternative to medical treatment, which has led to large scale production of lumpfish. At present, there is limited knowledge of how lumpfish respond upon anaesthesia, which anaesthetics and concentrations that are efficient and conditions for euthanasia. We have therefore tested and developed protocols for bath immersion for three commonly used anaesthetics metacaine (Finquel, buffered tricaine methanesulfonate, MS-222 and Tricaine Pharmaq), benzocaine (Benzoak vet) and isoeugenol (Aqui-S), determined concentration for normal and fast anaesthesia and evaluated safety margin for each condition. Also, a behavioral matrix has been developed. We have examined the effect of fish size (10–20 g, 200–400 g and 600–1300 g) and sea water temperature (6°C and 12°C). We found that 200 mg L-1 metacaine is an efficient dose for deep narcosis independently for fish size and temperature due to good safety margins with regards to both exposure times and doses. However, for many tasks lighter anaesthesia is sufficient, and then 100 mg L-1 metacaine can be used. Benzocaine is less efficient than metacaine, but can be used as anaesthetic of fish < 400 g. The optimal doses of benzocaine were 100–200 mg L-1 for small fish (10–20 g) and 200 mg L-1 for medium sized fish (200–400 g). For larger fish (> 600 g), benzocaine is not suitable. Isoeugenol cannot be recommended for full anesthesia of lumpfish. The conditions for lethal doses varied with chosen anaesthetic, fish size and temperature. For small fish (10–20 g), exposure to 1600 mgL-1 of metacaine in 10 minutes it lethal. Guided protocols for non-lethal anaesthesia will contribute to ensure safe treatment of lumpfish according to an ethical standard for good fish welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2730989719,"We carried out a study to compare the performance, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, of the new SD BIOLINE® HAT rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) for diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Participants were enrolled actively by four mobile teams, and passively at four health facilities in three provinces. Consenting participants were tested concurrently with the RDT and CATT on whole blood. Those found positive by either test were tested with CATT on serial dilutions of plasma, and with a parasitological composite reference standard (CRS). Cases were only the individuals found positive by the CRS, while controls were negative by both CATT and RDT, as well as those that were positive by CATT or RDT, but were negative by the CRS, and had no history of HAT. Over five months, 131 cases and 13,527 controls were enrolled. The sensitivity of the RDT was 92.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 86.1-95.5), which was significantly higher than CATT (sensitivity 69.1%; 95% CI = 60.7-76.4). The sensitivity of CATT on plasma at a dilution of 1:8 was 59.0% (95% CI = 50.2-67.2). The specificity of the RDT was 97.1% (95% CIs = 96.8-97.4) while that of CATT was 98.0% (95% CIs = 97.8, 98.2) and specificities of algorithms involving CATT at 1:8 dilution were 99.6% (95% CI = 99.5-99.7). Reproducibility of results was excellent. We concluded that an algorithm in which the SD BIOLINE® HAT RDT is used for screening is optimal for case detection in both passive and active screening settings. However, the lower specificity of the RDT compared to that of CATT would result in a larger number of false positive individuals undergoing confirmatory testing."

We find that the distribution of “shares” for the Facebook posts rescale in the same manner to the very same curve with scientific citations. This finding suggests that citations are subjected to the same growth mechanism with Facebook popularity measures, being influenced by a statistically similar social environment and selection mechanism. In a simple master-equation approach the exponential growth of the number of publications and a preferential selection mechanism leads to a Tsallis-Pareto distribution offering an excellent description for the observed statistics. Based on our model and on the data derived from PubMed we predict that according to the present trend the average citations per scientific publications exponentially relaxes to about 4."

This study aimed to: 1) ascertain the presence of Gb3 deposits in skin samples, by an immunofluorescence method collected from FD patients with classical GLA mutations or late-onset FD variants or GLA polymorphisms; 2) correlate skin GB3 deposits with skin innervation. Methods we studied 52 genetically-defined FD patients (32 with classical GLA mutations and 20 with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms), 15 patients with SFN associated with a specific cause and 22 healthy controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy to evaluate Gb3 deposits and epi-dermal innervation. Results Skin Gb3 deposits were found in all FD patients with classical GLA mutations but never in FD patients with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms or in patients with SFN and healthy controls. Abnormal deposits were found inside different skin structures but never inside axons. FD patients with GB3 deposits showed lower skin innervation than FD patients with late-onset variants or polymorphisms. Conclusions 1) Skin Gb3 deposits are specific to FD patients with classical GLA mutations; 2) Gb3 deposits were associated with lower skin innervation but they were not found inside axons, suggesting an indirect damage on peripheral small fibre innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2732707845,"Kif5A is a neuronally-enriched isoform of the Kinesin-1 family of cellular transport motors. 23 separate mutations in the motor domain of Kif5A have been identified in patients with the complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We performed in vitro assays on dimeric recombinant Kif5A with HSP-causing mutations in the Switch I domain, which participates in the coordination and hydrolysis of ATP by kinesin. We observed a variety of significantly reduced catalytic and mechanical activities as a result of each mutation, with the shared phenotype from each that motility was significantly reduced. Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ in our reaction buffers provides a dose-dependent rescue in both the catalytic and ensemble mechanical properties of the S203C mutant. This work provides mechanistic insight into the cause of HSP in patients with these mutations and points to future experiments to further dissect the root cause of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2724780495,"This study provides new insights into the relationships between social media sentiments and the stock market in China. Based on machine learning, we classify microblogs posted on Sina Weibo, a Twitter's variant in China into five detailed sentiments of anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness. Using wavelet analysis, we find close positive linkages between sentiments and the stock return, which have both frequency and time-varying features. Five detailed sentiments are positively related to the stock return for certain periods, particularly since October 2014 at medium to high frequencies of less than ten trading days, when the stock return is undergoing significant fluctuations. Sadness appears to have a closer relationship with the stock return than the other four sentiments. As to the lead-lag relationships, the stock return causes Weibo sentiments rather than reverse for most of the periods with significant linkages. Compared with polarity sentiments (negative vs. positive), detailed sentiments provide more information regarding relationships between Weibo sentiments and the stock market. The stock market exerts positive effects on bullishness and agreement of microblogs. Meanwhile, agreement leads the stock return in-phase at the frequency of approximately 40 trading days, indicating that less disagreement improves certainty about the stock market."
https://openalex.org/W2730116194,"The degree of gene flow within and among populations, i.e. genetic population connectivity, may closely track demographic population connectivity. Alternatively, the rate of gene flow may change relative to the rate of dispersal. In this study, we explored the relationship between genetic and demographic population connectivity using the Scandinavian brown bear as model species, due to its pronounced male dispersal and female philopatry. Thus, we expected that females would shape genetic structure locally, whereas males would act as genetic mediators among regions. To test this, we used eight validated microsatellite markers on 1531 individuals sampled noninvasively during country-wide genetic population monitoring in Sweden and Norway from 2006 to 2013. First, we determined sex-specific genetic structure and substructure across the study area. Second, we compared genetic differentiation, migration/gene flow patterns, and spatial autocorrelation results between the sexes both within and among genetic clusters and geographic regions. Our results indicated that demographic connectivity was not a reliable indicator of genetic connectivity. Among regions, we found no consistent difference in long-term gene flow and estimated current migration rates between males and females. Within regions/genetic clusters, only females consistently displayed significant positive spatial autocorrelation, indicating male-biased small-scale dispersal. In one cluster, however, males showed a dispersal pattern similar to females. The Scandinavian brown bear population has experienced substantial recovery over the last decades; however, our results did not show any changes in its large-scale population structure compared to previous studies, suggesting that an increase in population size and dispersal of individuals does not necessary lead to increased genetic connectivity. Thus, we conclude that both genetic and demographic connectivity should be estimated, so as not to make false assumptions about the reality of wildlife populations."
https://openalex.org/W2732078531,"Objective Though the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been established in Western population, little is known about the risk in Chinese people with RA. Our objective was to estimate the risk of CVD in Chinese people with RA using hospital medical records data. Methods The inpatients medical record database 2005–2015 of Sichuan provincial people’s hospital was examined. All individuals with a primary diagnosis of RA were included as cases, and those of osteoarthritis (OA) were included as controls, which consisted of the unmatched dataset. Then, RA cases and OA controls were matched by sex and age at 1:1 ratio, forming the matched dataset. The morbidity of CVD (including ischemia heart disease (IHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), et al), stroke and arthrosclerosis were extracted from the database, so as the demographic data and comorbidities related to CVD. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of CVD in RA adjusted for demographics and comorbidities using the unmatched dataset. Sensitivity analysis was conducted 1) considering interaction terms between RA and comorbidities, and 2) using multivariable conditional logistic regression for the matched dataset. Results The unmatched dataset comprised of 1824RA cases and 1995 OA controls and the matched dataset comprised of 1022 pairs of sex and age matched RA and OA patients. RA exhibited increased odds of prevalent CVD compared with OA, and the adjusted ORs (95%CIs) for CVD, stroke, IHD, CHF, and atherosclerosis were1.86(1.42–2.43), 1.11(0.71–1.74), 1.47(0.97–2.24), 2.09(1.03–4.22), and 2.49 (1.97–3.13), respectively, and was 2.26 (1.29–3.96)for IHD further adjusted for interaction term. The matched dataset analysis found similar results. Conclusions Chinese people with RA were approximated 2 times more likely to have CVD, IHD, CHF and atherosclerosis compared with those with OA. The findings justified the need of further longitudinal study to establish the causal-relationship between RA and CVD and to estimate the precise risk in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2673714956,"Streptococcus mutans is the most significant pathogenic bacterium implicated in the formation of dental caries and, both directly and indirectly, has been associated with severe conditions such as multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease. Polymers able to selectively bind S. mutans and/or inhibit its adhesion to oral tissue in a non-lethal manner would offer possibilities for addressing pathogenicity without selecting for populations resistant against bactericidal agents. In the present work two libraries of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (pDMAEMA)-based polymers were synthesized with various proportions of either N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium cationic- or sulfobetaine zwitterionic groups. These copolymers where initially tested as potential macromolecular ligands for S. mutans NCTC 10449, whilst Escherichia coli MG1655 was used as Gram-negative control bacteria. pDMAEMA-derived materials with high proportions of zwitterionic repeating units were found to be selective for S. mutans, in both isolated and S. mutans–E. coli mixed bacterial cultures. Fully sulfobetainized pDMAEMA was subsequently found to bind/cluster preferentially Gram-positive S. mutans and S. aureus compared to Gram negative E. coli and V. harveyi. A key initial stage of S. mutans pathogenesis involves a lectin-mediated adhesion to the tooth surface, thus the range of potential macromolecular ligands was further expanded by investigating two glycopolymers bearing α-mannopyranoside and β-galactopyranoside pendant units. Results with these polymers indicated that preferential binding to either S. mutans or E. coli can be obtained by modulating the glycosylation pattern of the chosen multivalent ligands without incurring unacceptable cytotoxicity in a model gastrointestinal cell line. Overall, our results allowed to identify a structure–property relationship for the potential antimicrobial polymers investigated, and suggest that preferential binding to Gram-positive S. mutans could be achieved by fine-tuning of the recognition elements in the polymer ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2727303614,"Brain lipids are integral components of brain structure and function. However, only recent advancements of chromatographic techniques together with mass spectrometry allow comprehensive identification of lipid species in complex brain tissue. Lipid composition varies between the individual areas and the majority of previous reports was focusing on individual lipids rather than a lipidome. Herein, a mass spectrometry-based approach was used to evaluate age-related changes in the lipidome of the rat amygdala obtained from young (3 months) and old (20 months) males of the Sprague-Dawley rat strain. A total number of 70 lipid species with significantly changed levels between the two animal groups were identified spanning four main lipid classes, i.e. glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sterol lipids. These included phospholipids with pleiotropic brain function, such as derivatives of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The analysis also revealed significant level changes of phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, sphingomyelin and ceramide that directly represent lipid signaling and affect amygdala neuronal activity. The amygdala is a crucial brain region for cognitive functions and former studies on rats and humans showed that this region changes its activity during normal aging. As the information on amygdala lipidome is very limited the results obtained in the present study represent a significant novelty and may contribute to further studies on the role of lipid molecules in age-associated changes of amygdala function."

https://openalex.org/W2730771532,"Introduction The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of rapid HIV self-testing (RHST) among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods During 2006–2009, a sample of 500 MSM was recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling for an HIV prevalence/incidence study. Attitude toward RHST was explored among HIV negative MSM. Data were weighted prior to analyses. Results Participants reported they were likely to buy RHST (74%), test themselves more frequently than they currently do (77%), and that the procedure would simplify testing (70%). Furthermore, 71% reported they would probably use it alone, 66% would use it with a steady partner, and 56% with a friend/partner. While a majority acknowledged that RHST use would deprive them of receiving counseling (61%), 74% declared they would go for help if they tested positive; 57% would use an RHST in order to avoid condoms. Probability of use surpassed 70% among gay and non-gay identified MSM as well as those with and without a previous HIV test. Those likely to buy RHST were older (p = 0.025) and more likely to identify as gay (p = 0.036). A total of 17% said they would think about killing themselves and 9% would attempt suicide if they tested positive. These MSM were more likely to be younger (p<0.001), with lower mood level (p<0.001) and greater feelings of loneliness (p = 0.026). Conclusions The high acceptability of RHST found among MSM should encourage the authorities to consider the possibility of offering it for self-testing, as it can improve early diagnosis and prevention of future transmissions. However, further research is needed to understand how to best disseminate RHST among MSM who wish to use it and to offer support and linkage to care for those who test HIV-positive."

This study collected 107 strains of V. parahaemolyticus during active surveillance of diarrheal diseases in hospitals in Zhoushan during 2013 to 2014 and investigated their serotypes, virulence genes (tdh, trh, and orf8), antimicrobial resistance, and genotypes. The dominant serotypes of the 107 clinical strains were O3:K6, O4:K8, and O4:KUT with 87.9% and 3.7% of the strains carrying the virulence genes tdh and trh, respectively. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated divergence among the clinical strains. Most isolates were sensitive to the common antimicrobial agents used against the Vibrio species except ampicillin. We conclude that continuous surveillance of V. parahaemolyticus in diarrhea patients is a public health priority and is useful for conducting risk assessment of foodborne illnesses caused by V. parahaemolyticus."
https://openalex.org/W2727117131,"The cutaneous microbiota of amphibians can be defined as a biological component of protection, since it can be composed of bacteria that produce antimicrobial compounds. Several factors influence skin microbial structure and it is possible that environmental variations are among one of these factors, perhaps through physical-chemical variations in the skin. This community, therefore, is likely modified in habitats in which some ecophysiological parameters are altered, as in fragmented forests. Our research goal was to compare the skin bacterial community of four anuran species of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil in landscapes from two different environments: continuous forest and fragmented forest. The guiding hypotheses were: 1) microbial communities of anuran skin vary among sympatric frog species of the Atlantic forest; 2) the degree to which forested areas are intact affects the cutaneous bacterial community of amphibians. If the external environment influences the skin microbiota, and if such influences affect microorganisms capable of inhibiting the colonization of pathogens, we expect consequences for the protection of host individuals. We compared bacterial communities based on richness and density of colony forming units; investigated the antimicrobial potential of isolated strains; and did the taxonomic identification of isolated morphotypes. We collected 188 individual frogs belonging to the species Proceratophrys boiei, Dendropsophus minutus, Aplastodiscus leucopygius and Phyllomedusa distincta, and isolated 221 bacterial morphotypes. Our results demonstrate variation in the skin microbiota of sympatric amphibians, but only one frog species exhibited differences in the bacterial communities between populations from fragmented and continuous forest. Therefore, the variation we observed is probably derived from both intrinsic aspects of the host amphibian species and extrinsic aspects of the environment occupied by the host. Finally, we detected antimicrobial activity in 27 morphotypes of bacteria isolated from all four amphibian species."
https://openalex.org/W2732943211,"Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) can be viewed as disintegrated patterns of information transmission by action potential across the communication network consisting of nodes linked by functional connectivity. To test the hypothesis that ablation of persistent AF is associated with improvement in both local and global connectivity within the communication networks, we analyzed multi-electrode basket catheter electrograms of 22 consecutive patients (63.5 ± 9.7 years, 78% male) during persistent AF before and after the focal impulse and rotor modulation-guided ablation. Eight patients (36%) developed recurrence within 6 months after ablation. We defined communication networks of AF by nodes (cardiac tissue adjacent to each electrode) and edges (mutual information between pairs of nodes). To evaluate patient-specific parameters of communication, thresholds of mutual information were applied to preserve 10% to 30% of the strongest edges. There was no significant difference in network parameters between both atria at baseline. Ablation effectively rewired the communication network of persistent AF to improve the overall connectivity. In addition, successful ablation improved local connectivity by increasing the average clustering coefficient, and also improved global connectivity by decreasing the characteristic path length. As a result, successful ablation improved the efficiency and robustness of the communication network by increasing the small-world index. These changes were not observed in patients with AF recurrence. Furthermore, a significant increase in the small-world index after ablation was associated with synchronization of the rhythm by acute AF termination. In conclusion, successful ablation rewires communication networks during persistent AF, making it more robust, efficient, and easier to synchronize. Quantitative analysis of communication networks provides not only a mechanistic insight that AF may be sustained by spatially localized sources and global connectivity, but also patient-specific metrics that could serve as a valid endpoint for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2727779952,"Tooth enamel is mineralized through the differentiation of multiple dental epithelia including ameloblasts and the stratum intermedium (SI), and this differentiation is controlled by several signaling pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator Mediator 1 (MED1) plays a critical role in enamel formation. For instance, conditional ablation of Med1 in dental epithelia causes functional changes in incisor-specific dental epithelial stem cells, resulting in mineralization defects in the adult incisors. However, the molecular mechanism by which Med1 deficiency causes these abnormalities is not clear. Here, we demonstrated that Med1 ablation causes early SI differentiation defects resulting in enamel hypoplasia of the Med1-deficient molars. Med1 deletion prevented Notch1-mediated differentiation of the SI cells resulting in decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), which is essential for mineralization. However, it does not affect the ability of ameloblasts to produce enamel matrix proteins. Using the dental epithelial SF2 cell line, we demonstrated that MED1 directly activates transcription of the Alpl gene through the stimulation of Notch1 signaling by forming a complex with cleaved Notch1-RBP-Jk on the Alpl promoter. These results suggest that MED1 may be essential for enamel matrix mineralization by serving as a coactivator for Notch1 signaling regulating transcription of the Alpl gene."
https://openalex.org/W2728275869,"The European beaver (Castor fiber L.) is an important free-living rodent that inhabits Eurasian temperate forests. Beavers are often referred to as ecosystem engineers because they create or change existing habitats, enhance biodiversity and prepare the environment for diverse plant and animal species. Beavers are protected in most European Union countries, but their genomic background remains unknown. In this study, gene expression patterns in beaver testes and the variations in genetic expression in breeding and non-breeding seasons were determined by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. Paired-end sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer produced a total of 373.06 million of high-quality reads. De novo assembly of contigs yielded 130,741 unigenes with an average length of 1,369.3 nt, N50 value of 1,734, and average GC content of 46.51%. A comprehensive analysis of the testicular transcriptome revealed more than 26,000 highly expressed unigenes which exhibited the highest homology with Rattus norvegicus and Ictidomys tridecemlineatus genomes. More than 8,000 highly expressed genes were found to be involved in fundamental biological processes, cellular components or molecular pathways. The study also revealed 42 genes whose regulation differed between breeding and non-breeding seasons. During the non-breeding period, the expression of 37 genes was up-regulated, and the expression of 5 genes was down-regulated relative to the breeding season. The identified genes encode molecules which are involved in signaling transduction, DNA repair, stress responses, inflammatory processes, metabolism and steroidogenesis. Our results pave the way for further research into season-dependent variations in beaver testes."
https://openalex.org/W2730616034,"Objectives To identify specific clinical and epidemiological parameters for clinical diagnosis of SFTSV infection with relatively higher accuracy. Methods 231 suspected cases of SFTS were reported by various medical institutions from 2011 to 2013 in Jiangsu Province, China. They were followed with SFTSV diagnosis tests and interview-administered questionnaires about demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and epidemiological exposure factors. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to examine the diagnostic value of these parameters. Results SFTSV infection occurred only from April to October annually and usually in hilly areas of specific regions. Three prediction models of SFTSV infection were constructed. Model 3 with clinical and epidemiological parameters combined the benefits of both Model 1and Model 2, which was optimal and had an overall accuracy of 80.2%. Independent indicators for clinical diagnosis of SFTSV infection in Model 3 were as follows: lymphadenopathy (P = 0.01), leucopenia (P<0.01), age >50 years (P = 0.01), tick bites (P<0.01), raising domestic animals in the residential areas (P<0.01) and farming (P = 0.03). Conclusions Our results show that using a combination of clinical and epidemiological parameters may be a feasible strategy to provide preliminary fast diagnosis as differentiating SFTSV infection from SFTS-like diseases, thus reducing the risk of misdiagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2727123762,"Syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles (STBEVs) are placenta derived particles that are released into the maternal circulation during pregnancy. Abnormal levels of STBEVs have been proposed to affect maternal vascular function. The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a multi-ligand scavenger receptor. Increased LOX-1 expression and activation has been proposed to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. As LOX-1 has various ligands, we hypothesized that, being essentially packages of lipoproteins, STBEVs are able to activate the LOX-1 receptor thereby impairing vascular function via the production of superoxide and decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Uterine arteries were obtained in late gestation from Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated for 24h with or without human STBEVs (derived from a normal pregnant placenta) in the absence or presence of a LOX-1 blocking antibody. Vascular function was assessed using wire myography. Endothelium-dependent maximal vasodilation to methylcholine was impaired by STBEVs (MCh Emax: 57.7±5.9% in STBEV-incubated arteries vs. 77.8±2.9% in controls, p<0.05). This was prevented by co-incubation of STBEV-incubated arteries with LOX-1 blocking antibodies (MCh Emax: 78.8±4.3%, p<0.05). Pre-incubation of the vessels with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) demonstrated that the STBEV-induced impairment in vasodilation was due to decreased nitric oxide contribution (ΔAUC 12.2±11.7 in STBEV-arteries vs. 86.5±20 in controls, p<0.05), which was abolished by LOX-1 blocking antibody (ΔAUC 98.9±17, p<0.05). In STBEV-incubated vessels, LOX-1 inhibition resulted in an increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression (p<0.05), to a level similar to control vessels. The oxidant scavenger, superoxide dismutase, did not improve this impairment, nor were vascular superoxide levels altered. Our data support an important role for STBEVs in impairment of vascular function via activation of LOX-1 and reduced nitric oxide mediated vasodilation. Moreover, we postulate that the LOX-1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in pathologies associated with vascular dysfunction during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2727967845,"Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs play important roles in endometrium development during the menstrual cycle in humans and many other animals. Our previous data indicated that miR-182 levels increase 15.55-fold and pleiotrophin (PTN) levels decrease 20.97-fold in the receptive endometrium (RE, D15) compared with the pre-receptive endometrium (PE, D5) in dairy goats. The present study shows that miR-182 is widely expressed in different tissues of dairy goats and that its expression levels are regulated by E2 and P4 in endometrial epithelium cells (EECs). We confirmed that PTN is a target of miR-182 and that miR-182 regulates the protein levels of AKT, Bcl-2, FAS, MAPK, Caspase-3 and SP1 in EECs. Furthermore, miR-182 up-regulates or maintains the expression levels of osteopontin (OPN), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) in EECs, suggesting that miR-182 is an important regulatory factor in the construction of endometrial receptivity in dairy goats. In conclusion, miR-182 participates in the development of endometrial receptivity by down-regulating PTN and affecting the expression of select apoptosis-related genes and increasing or maintaining the expression levels of OPN, COX-2 and PRLR in the EECs of dairy goats."

Based on the theory of circular economy, integration of different resources by polygeneration is one of the solutions to improve energy efficiency and to reduce environmental impact. In this study, three modes of bioethanol production were selected to evaluate the life cycle energy efficiency and environmental impact of sweet potato-based bioethanol. The results showed that, the net energy ratio was greater than 1 and the value of net energy gain was positive in the three production modes, in which the maximum value appeared in the circular economy mode (CEM). The environment emission mainly occurred to bioethanol conversion unit in the conventional production mode (CPM) and the cogeneration mode (CGM), and eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) were the most significant environmental impact category. While compared with CPM and CGM, the environmental impact of CEM significantly declined due to increasing recycling, and plant cultivation unit mainly contributed to EP and GWP. And the comprehensive evaluation score of environmental impact decreased by 73.46% and 23.36%. This study showed that CEM was effective in improving energy efficiency, especially in reducing the environmental impact, and it provides a new method for bioethanol production."
https://openalex.org/W2732328757,"Channelization for navigation and flood control has altered the hydrology and bathymetry of many large rivers with unknown consequences for fish species that undergo riverine migrations. In this study, we investigated whether altered flow distributions and bathymetry associated with channelization attracted migrating Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) into commercial navigation channels, potentially increasing their exposure to ship strikes. To address this question, we quantified and compared Lake Sturgeon selection for navigation channels vs. alternative pathways in two multi-channel rivers differentially affected by channelization, but free of barriers to sturgeon movement. Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify Lake Sturgeon movements. Under the assumption that Lake Sturgeon navigate by following primary flow paths, acoustic-tagged Lake Sturgeon in the more-channelized lower Detroit River were expected to choose navigation channels over alternative pathways and to exhibit greater selection for navigation channels than conspecifics in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River. Consistent with these predictions, acoustic-tagged Lake Sturgeon in the more-channelized lower Detroit River selected the higher-flow and deeper navigation channels over alternative migration pathways, whereas in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River, individuals primarily used pathways alternative to navigation channels. Lake Sturgeon selection for navigation channels as migratory pathways also was significantly higher in the more-channelized lower Detroit River than in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River. We speculated that use of navigation channels over alternative pathways would increase the spatial overlap of commercial vessels and migrating Lake Sturgeon, potentially enhancing their vulnerability to ship strikes. Results of our study thus demonstrated an association between channelization and the path use of migrating Lake Sturgeon that could prove important for predicting sturgeon-vessel interactions in navigable rivers as well as for understanding how fish interact with their habitat in landscapes altered by human activity."

However, manual scoring of videos has numerous limitations, underscoring the need for an automated approach. Here, we propose a novel automated method for acoustic detection of mouse scratching. Using this approach, we show that chloroquine-induced scratching behavior in C57BL/6 mice can be quantified with reasonable accuracy (85% sensitivity, 75% positive predictive value). This report is the first method to apply supervised learning techniques to automate acoustic scratch detection."
https://openalex.org/W2727980213,"Luciferase is the key component of light production in bioluminescence process. Extensive and advantageous application of this enzyme in biotechnology is restricted due to its low thermal stability. Here we report the effect of heating up above Tm on the structure and dynamical properties of luciferase enzyme compared to temperature at 298 K. In this way we demonstrate that the number of hydrogen bonds between N- and C-domain is increased for the free enzyme at 325 K. Increased inter domain hydrogen bonds by three at 325 K suggests that inter domain contact is strengthened. The appearance of simultaneous strong salt bridge and hydrogen bond between K529 and D422 and increased existence probability between R533 and E389 could mechanistically explain stronger contact between N- and C-domain. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated the importance of K529 and D422 experimentally. Also the significant reduction in SASA for experimentally important residues K529, D422 and T343 which are involved in active site region was observed. Principle component analysis (PCA) in our study shows that the dynamical behavior of the enzyme is changed upon heating up which mainly originated from the change of motion modes and associated extent of those motions with respect to 298 K. These findings could explain why heating up of the enzyme or thermal fluctuation of protein conformation reduces luciferase activity in course of time as a possible mechanism of thermal functional inactivation. According to these results we proposed two strategies to improve thermal stability of functional luciferase."
https://openalex.org/W2732803594,"The main objective of the study was to assess whether augmented renal clearance was a risk factor for mortality in a cohort of patients with Enterobacteriaceae sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock that all received appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 12 hours. Using a retrospective cohort from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,250-bed teaching hospital, we collected data on individuals with Enterobacteriaceae sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock who received appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy between June 2009 and December 2013. Clinical outcomes were compared according to renal clearance, as assessed by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas, sepsis classification, demographics, severity of illness, and comorbidities. We identified 510 patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia and sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Sixty-seven patients (13.1%) were nonsurvivors. Augmented renal clearance was uncommon (5.1% of patients by MDRD and 3.0% by CKD-EPI) and was not associated with increased mortality. Our results are limited by the absence of prospective determination of augmented renal clearance. However, in this small cohort, augmented renal clearance as assessed by MDRD and CKD-EPI does not seem to be a risk factor for mortality in patients with Enterobacteriaceae sepsis. Future studies should assess this finding prospectively."
https://openalex.org/W2727119367,"We evaluated if two sigmodontine rodent taxa (Abrothrix olivacea and Phyllotis darwini) from the Andes and Coastal mountaintops of central Chile, experienced distributional shifts due to altitudinal movements of habitat and climate change during and after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We tested the hypothesis that during LGM populations of both species experienced altitudinal shifts from the Andes to the lowlands and the coastal Cordillera, and then range retractions during interglacial towards higher elevations in the Andes. These distributional shifts may have left remnants populations on the mountaintops. We evaluated the occurrence of intraspecific lineages for each species, to construct distribution models at LGM and at present, as extreme climatic conditions for each lineage. Differences in distribution between extreme climatic conditions were interpreted as post-glacial distributional shifts. Abrothrix olivacea displayed a lineage with shared sequences between both mountain systems, whereas a second lineage was restricted to the Andes. A similar scenario of panmictic unit in the past was recovered for A. olivacea in the Andes, along with an additional unit that included localities from the rest of its distribution. For P. darwini, both lineages recovered were distributed in coastal and Andean mountain ranges at present as well, and structuring analyses for this species recovered coastal and Andean localities as panmictic units in the past. Niche modeling depicted differential postglacial expansions in the recovered lineages. Results suggest that historical events such as LGM triggered the descending of populations to Andean refuge areas (one of the A. olivacea’s lineages), to the lowlands, and to the coastal Cordillera. Backward movements of populations after glacial retreats may have left isolates on mountaintops of the coastal Cordillera, suggesting that current species distribution would be the outcome of climate change and habitat reconfiguration after LGM."
https://openalex.org/W2372163419,"The receptive language measure information-carrying word (ICW) level, is used extensively by speech and language therapists in the UK and Ireland. Despite this it has never been validated via its relationship to any other relevant measures. This study aims to validate the ICW measure by investigating the relationship between the receptive ICW score of children with specific language impairment (SLI) and their performance on standardized memory and language assessments. Twenty-seven children with SLI, aged between 5;07 and 8;11, completed a sentence comprehension task in which the instructions gradually increased in number of ICWs. The children also completed subtests from The Working Memory Test Battery for children and The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals- 4. Results showed that there was a significant positive relationship between both language and memory measures and children's ICW score. While both receptive and expressive language were significant in their contribution to children's ICW score, the contribution of memory was solely determined by children's working memory ability. ICW score is in fact a valid measure of the language ability of children with SLI. However therapists should also be cognisant of its strong association with working memory when using this construct in assessment or intervention methods."
https://openalex.org/W2726042507,"Our study looked at out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest events in the City of Toronto. These are relatively rare events, yet present a serious global clinical and public health problem. We report on the application of spatial methods and tools that, although relatively well known to geographers and natural resource scientists, need to become better known and used more frequently by health care researchers.Our data came from the population-based Rescu Epistry cardiac arrest database. We limited it to the residents of the City of Toronto who experienced sudden arrest in 2010. The data was aggregated at the Dissemination Area level, and population rates were calculated. Poisson kriging was carried out on one year of data using three different spatial weights. Kriging estimates were then compared in Hot Spot analyses.Spatial analysis revealed that Poisson kriging can yield reliable rates using limited data of high quality. We observed the highest rates of sudden arrests in the north and central parts of Etobicoke, western parts of North York as well as the central and southwestern parts of Scarborough while the lowest rates were found in north and eastern parts of Scarborough, downtown Toronto, and East York as well as east central parts of North York. Influence of spatial neighbours on the results did not extend past two rings of adjacent units.Poisson kriging has the potential to be applied to a wide range of healthcare research, particularly on rare events. This approach can be successfully combined with other spatial methods. More applied research, is needed to establish a wider acceptance for this method, especially among healthcare researchers and epidemiologists."
https://openalex.org/W2726358523,"Targeted inhibition of the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 fusion protein using the ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has become standard therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), with most patients reaching total and durable remission. However, a significant fraction of patients develop resistance, commonly due to mutated ABL1 kinase domains. This motivated development of second-generation drugs with broadened or altered protein kinase selectivity profiles, including dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib-resistant patients undergoing treatment with second-line drugs typically develop resistance to them, but dynamic and clonal properties of this response differ. Shared, however, is the observation of clonal competition, reflected in patterns of successive dominance of individual clones. We present three deterministic mathematical models to study the origins of clinically observed dynamics. Each model is a system of coupled first-order differential equations, considering populations of three mutated active stem cell strains and three associated pools of differentiated cells; two models allow for activation of quiescent stem cells. Each approach is distinguished by the way proliferation rates of the primary stem cell reservoir are modulated. Previous studies have concentrated on simulating the response of wild-type leukemic cells to imatinib administration; our focus is on modelling the time dependence of imatinib-resistant clones upon subsequent exposure to dasatinib or nilotinib. Performance of the three computational schemes to reproduce selected CML patient profiles is assessed. While some simple cases can be approximated by a basic design that does not invoke quiescence, others are more complex and require involvement of non-cycling stem cells for reproduction. We implement a new feedback mechanism for regulation of coupling between cycling and non-cycling stem cell reservoirs that depends on total cell populations. A bifurcation landscape analysis is also performed for solutions to the basic ansatz. Computational models reproducing patient data illustrate potential dynamic mechanisms that may guide optimization of therapy of drug resistant CML."
https://openalex.org/W2728319960,"Hematopoietic recovery is considered to be associated with the number of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as observed in functional assays involving stem cell transplantation. However, there is little evidence related to hematopoietic recovery in non-transplantation settings, which is accomplished by endogenous hematopoietic cells. A recent study suggested that progenitors are the main contributors during this steady-state hematopoiesis, which differs from exogenous transplantation. We hypothesized that endogenous progenitor support post-chemotherapy hematopoietic recovery. To investigate the potential impact of these progenitor cell percentage on hematopoietic recovery, we retrospectively analyzed the percentage of CD34+CD38+CD117+HLA-DR+CD13+CD33+ cells (P cells) and hematopoietic recovery in 223 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients during two courses of consolidation chemotherapy after complete remission. We found that a lower P cell percentage was significantly associated with prolonged neutropenia recovery time after the first and second courses of consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.001; p = 0.045, respectively). We also observed similar results with regard to platelet recovery time after the first course of consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.000). Univariate analysis showed that P cell percentage and consolidation chemotherapy regimens, and not gender, age, induction chemotherapy regimens, infection grade, WHO classification and NCCN risk category, were associated with neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that P cell percentage is an independent factor affecting neutrophil recovery capacity for both the first and second courses (p = 0.008; p = 0.032, respectively). Our results indicate that CD34+CD38+CD117+HLA-DR+CD13+CD33+ cells before each course of chemotherapy is independently associated with chemotherapy-related hematopoietic reconstitution capacity. These findings may help modify future chemotherapy regimens based on progenitor cell percentages."
