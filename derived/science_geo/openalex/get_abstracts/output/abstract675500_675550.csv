https://openalex.org/W3170984838,"Japan’s government has taken a number of measures, including declaring a state of emergency, to combat the spread COVID-19. We examine the mechanisms through which the government’s policies have led to changes in people’s behavior. Using smartphone location data, we construct a daily prefecture-level stay-at-home measure to identify the following two effects: (1) the effect that citizens refrained from going out in line with the government’s request, and (2) the effect that government announcements reinforced awareness with regard to the seriousness of the pandemic and people voluntarily refrained from going out. Our main findings are as follows. First, the declaration of the state of emergency reduced the number of people leaving their homes by 8.5% through the first channel, which is of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for lockdowns in the United States. Second, a 1% increase in new infections in a prefecture reduces people’s outings in that prefecture by 0.027%. Third, the government’s requests are responsible for about one quarter of the decrease in outings in Tokyo, while the remaining three quarters are the result of citizens obtaining new information through government announcements and the daily release of the number of infections. The findings suggest that what mattered for containing the spread of COVID-19 was not strong, legally binding measures but the provision of appropriate information that encouraged people to change their behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3170609530,"Introduction Despite its alarming spread throughout the world, no effective drug and vaccine is discovered for COVID-19 so far. According to WHO, the recovery time from COVID-19 was estimated to be 2 weeks for patients with mild infection, and 3 to 6 weeks for those with serious illnesses. A studies regarding the median recovery time and its predictors are limited globally and specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the median time to recovery from COVID-19 and its predictors among COVID-19 cases admitted to WURH, Western Ethiopian. Methods This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study conducted among 263 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in WURH treatment center from March 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted to determine factors associated with recovery time. A variable with P-value ≤ 0.25 at bivariable Cox regression analysis were selected for multivariable Cox proportional model. Multivariable Cox regression model with 95% CI and Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) was used to identify a significant predictor of time to recovery from COVID-19 at P-value &lt; 0.05. Results The mean age of patient was 36.8 (SD± 10.68) years. At the end of follow up, two hundred twenty seven observations were developed an event (recovered) with median time to recovery of 18 days with IQR of 10–27 days. The overall incidence rate of recovery was of 4.38 per 100 (95% CI: 3.84, 4.99) person-days observations. Being older age (AHR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.49), presence of fever on admission (AHR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.62), and comorbidity (AHR = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.34, 0.90) were found to have statistically significant association with recovery time. Conclusion and recommendations In general, the median recovery time of patients with COVID-19 cases was long, and factors such as older age group, presence of fever, and comorbidity was an independent predictors of delayed recovery from COVID-19. Intervention to further reduce recovery time at treatment center has to focus on patients those shows symptoms and with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3108273432,"Since May 2020, several COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in the German meat industry despite various protective measures, and temperature and ventilation conditions were considered as possible high-risk factors. This cross-sectional study examined meat and poultry plants to examine possible risk factors. Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an effect for ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the effect of the ventilation rate did not change. Increasing room temperatures resulted in a lower chance of obtaining a positive COVID-19 test result (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99), and a 0.1% greater chance of a positive COVID-19 test for the interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003). Our results further indicate that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the ventilation rate."
https://openalex.org/W3171389793,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables agents to make decisions based on a well-designed reward function that suites a particular environment without any prior knowledge related to a given environment. The adaptation of hyperparameters has a great impact on the overall learning process and the learning processing times. Hyperparameters should be accurately estimated while training DRL algorithms, which is one of the key challenges that we attempt to address. This paper employs a swarm-based optimization algorithm, namely the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), for optimizing the hyperparameters of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to achieve the optimum control strategy in an autonomous driving control problem. DDPG is capable of handling complex environments, which contain continuous spaces for actions. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, the Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS), a realistic autonomous driving simulation environment, was chosen to its ease of design and implementation. Using TORCS, the DDPG agent with optimized hyperparameters was compared with a DDPG agent with reference hyperparameters. The experimental results showed that the DDPG's hyperparameters optimization leads to maximizing the total rewards, along with testing episodes and maintaining a stable driving policy."
https://openalex.org/W3172431794,"Sulawesi, an island located in a biogeographical transition zone between Indomalaya and Australasia, is famous for its high levels of endemism. Ricefishes (family Adrianichthyidae) are an example of taxa that have uniquely diversified on this island. It was demonstrated that habitat fragmentation due to the Pliocene juxtaposition among tectonic subdivisions of this island was the primary factor that promoted their divergence; however, it is also equally probable that habitat fusions and resultant admixtures between phylogenetically distant species may have frequently occurred. Previous studies revealed that some individuals of Oryzias sarasinorum endemic to a tectonic lake in central Sulawesi have mitochondrial haplotypes that are similar to the haplotypes of O. eversi, which is a phylogenetically related but geologically distant (ca. 190 km apart) adrianichthyid endemic to a small fountain. In this study, we tested if this reflects ancient admixture of O. eversi and O. sarasinorum. Population genomic analyses of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that O. eversi and O. sarasinorum are substantially reproductively isolated from each other. Comparison of demographic models revealed that the models assuming ancient admixture from O. eversi to O. sarasinorum was more supported than the models assuming no admixture; this supported the idea that the O. eversi-like mitochondrial haplotype in O. sarasinorum was introgressed from O. eversi. This study is the first to demonstrate ancient admixture of lacustrine or pond organisms in Sulawesi beyond 100 km. The complex geological history of this island enabled such island-wide admixture of lacustrine organisms, which usually experience limited migration."
https://openalex.org/W3168584123,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify prognostic markers for patients undergoing curative resection of CRC. The detection of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood is a promising approach to identify high-risk patients with disseminated disease in colorectal cancer. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic relevance of preoperative CTCs using the Cellsearch® system (CS) in patients, who underwent resection with curative intent of different stages (UICC I-IV) of colorectal cancer. Out of 91 Patients who underwent colorectal resection, 68 patients were included in this study. CTC analysis was performed in patients with CRC UICC stages I-IV immediately before surgery. Data were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcomes. One or more CTCs/7.5 mL were detected in 45.6% (31/68) of patients. CTCs were detected in all stages of the Union of International Cancer Control (UICC), in stage I (1/4, 25%), in stage II (4/12, 33.3%), in stage III (5/19, 26.3%) and in stage IV (21/33, 63.6%). The detection of ≥ 1 CTCs/ 7.5ml correlated to the presence of distant overt metastases (p = 0.014) as well as with shorter progression-free (p = 0.008) and overall survival (p = 0.008). Multivariate analyses showed that the detection of ≥ 1 CTCs/ 7.5ml is an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival (HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.18-8.32; p = 0.021). The detection of CTCs is an independent and strong prognostic factor in CRC, which might improve the identification of high-risk patients in future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3172668757,"Upon infection of Pseudomonas cells, jumbo phages 201Φ2-1, ΦPA3, and ΦKZ assemble a phage nucleus. Viral DNA is enclosed within the phage-encoded proteinaceous shell along with proteins associated with DNA replication, recombination and transcription. Ribosomes and proteins involved in metabolic processes are excluded from the nucleus. RNA synthesis occurs inside the phage nucleus and messenger RNA is presumably transported into the cytoplasm to be translated. Newly synthesized proteins either remain in the cytoplasm or specifically translocate into the nucleus. The molecular mechanisms governing selective protein sorting and nuclear import in these phage infection systems are currently unclear. To gain insight into this process, we studied the localization of five reporter fluorescent proteins (GFP+, sfGFP, GFPmut1, mCherry, CFP). During infection with ΦPA3 or 201Φ2-1, all five fluorescent proteins were excluded from the nucleus as expected; however, we have discovered an anomaly with the ΦKZ nuclear transport system. The fluorescent protein GFPmut1, expressed by itself, was transported into the ΦKZ phage nucleus. We identified the amino acid residues on the surface of GFPmut1 required for nuclear targeting. Fusing GFPmut1 to any protein, including proteins that normally reside in the cytoplasm, resulted in transport of the fusion into the nucleus. Although the mechanism of transport is still unknown, we demonstrate that GFPmut1 is a useful tool that can be used for fluorescent labelling and targeting of proteins into the ΦKZ phage nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W3166555548,"Since March 2020, the United States has lost over 580,000 lives to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics. This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes. 753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.8% - 4.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1.7% (90% Credible Interval: 0.27% - 3.3%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48, 95% CI: 4–600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 7.2, 95% CI: 2.6–19). Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporation’s staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact tracing, face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses."
https://openalex.org/W3170531845,"Modern health services utilization in developing countries has continued low. Financial shortage to access health-care services might be averted by stirring from out-of-pocket payment for health care at the time of use. The government of Ethiopia; depend greatly on foreign aid (50%) and out-of-pocket payments (34%) to fund health services for its population. This study was aimed to identify factors associated with households' enrollment to CBHI scheme membership.Case-control study design was conducted from May 18-July 27, 2019 among 332 participants (166 enrolled and 166 non-enrolled to CBHI scheme). Simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model were fitted to identify factors associated with enrollment to community based health insurance. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI was used to report association and significance was declared at P<0.05.A total of 332 (100% response rate) were involved in the study. Educational status (College and above, AOR = 3.90, 95%CI; 1.19, 12.75), good awareness about CBHI scheme (AOR = 21.595, 95% CI; 7.561, 61.681), affordability of premium payment (AOR = 3.403, 95% CI; 5.638-4.152), wealth index {(Poor, AOR = 2.59, 95%CI; 1.08, 6.20), (Middle, AOR = 4.13, 95%CI; 1.11, 15.32)} perceived health status (AOR = 5.536; 95% CI; 1.403-21.845), perceived quality of care (AOR: 21.014 95%CI; 4.178, 105.686) and treatment choice (AOR = 2.94, 95%CI; 1.47, 5.87) were factors significantly associated with enrollment to CBHI.Enrolment to CBHI schemes is influenced by educational level, awareness level, affordability of premium, wealth index, perceived health status, perceived quality of care and treatment choice. Implementation strategies aimed at raising community awareness, setting affordable premium, and providing quality healthcare would help in increasing enrollment of all eligible community groups to the CBHI scheme."
https://openalex.org/W3171584213,"Research efforts in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on the actual and potential impacts on societies, economies, sectors, and governments. Less attention was paid to the experiences of individuals and less still to the impact of COVID-19 on an individual’s wellbeing. This research addresses this gap by utilising a holistic wellbeing framework to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the overall wellbeing of individuals in the Australian state of South Australia through an online survey. The research framework for the survey comprises six dimensions: psychological and emotional health, physical health, living standards, family and community vitality, governance, and ecological diversity and resilience. The results show that most respondents (71%) were able to maintain overall wellbeing during the pandemic. However, more than a half of the respondents could not maintain wellbeing in psychological and emotional health. Further examination of the drivers of inability to maintain overall wellbeing reveals that low-income individuals, younger respondents (aged 18–24) and women suffer disproportionate hardships. Defining poverty in terms of multi-dimensional deprivations in wellbeing enables a nuanced analysis of the unequal impacts of COVID-19 mitigation policies that can be used to improve policymaking."
https://openalex.org/W3172424555,"Introduction Health care professionals are at higher risk of developing stress-related problems during outbreaks, due to the overwhelming clinical workload, fear of contagion, and inadequate protective gears. So, in order to monitoring mental health issues and to understand the factors evidence-based interventions is important. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess perceived stress and associated factors among health care professionals working in the context of COVID-19, Southern Ethiopia. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 health care professionals from the 1 st May to 1 st June 2020. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique after allocating a proportion to each health institute based on the size of health care professionals. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire using KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. A total score of &gt;20 points was considered as the cut off for experiencing perceived stress based on perceived stress scale. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify associated factors. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression. Result Nearly two-thirds 61.8% (95% CI: 58.4%, 65.2%) of HCPs had perceived stress. Not having COVID-19 updated information (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.43), not at all confident on coping with stress (AOR = 9.94, 95% CI:3.74, 26.41), somewhat confident in coping with stress (AOR = 4.69, 95% CI:2.81, 7.84), moderately confident on coping with stress (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46, 3.82), and not getting along well with people (AOR = 4.88, 95% CI: 1.42, 16.72) were positively association with perceived stress. However, feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life (AOR = 0.52 95% CI: 0.35, 0.77) and worrying about what other people think about them (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.81) were negatively associated with perceived stress. Conclusion COVID-19 update, confidence in coping with stress, getting along with people, worrying about what other people think about them, and feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life were factors significantly associated with perceived stress. The provision of COVID-19 update to HCPs along with wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing is vital."
https://openalex.org/W3167088580,"Despite the widespread use of oral contraceptives (OCs), and the well-documented influence of estrogens, notably 17β-estradiol (E2), on cognition, research relating OCs to working memory is limited and mixed. Two factors may contribute to these mixed findings: 1) pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives, which drive fluctuations in synthetic hormone levels; and 2) genetic polymorphisms related to dopamine degradation and working memory, which interact with E2. This research investigated whether the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives, in concert with the single nucleotide polymorphism (Val158Met; rs4680) of the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (COMT), influence working memory performance.University-age women taking and not taking OCs were tested for working memory and genotyped for COMT. If they were not taking OCs (n = 62), sessions occurred in the early follicular (low E2) and late follicular (high E2) phase. If they were taking OCs (n = 52), sessions occurred 1-2 hours after (high ethinyl estradiol, EE) and ~24 hours after (low EE) pill ingestion. Working memory was tested using the N-back, AX-CPT, Digit Span, and Digit Ordering Tasks. Data were analyzed using multilevel models with estrogen condition, COMT, and group as predictors, controlling for mood and practice effects.For women taking OCs, time of pill ingestion did not influence performance. However, the subgroup with COMT val/val (low dopamine) were less accurate on 2-back lure trials than those with COMT met/met (high dopamine). For women not taking OCs, cycle phase moderated COMT's influence on lure accuracy. When compared, women taking OCs had higher AX-CPT proactive control indices than those not taking OCs.These findings suggest that oral contraceptives are not detrimental for young women's working memory and that they may increase proactive control. The more pronounced effects of COMT in women taking OCs suggests that, in women taking OCs, suppressed endogenous E2-not fluctuating EE levels-may be more relevant for working memory. Future studies are needed to differentiate effects of endogenous versus synthetic estrogens on working memory."
https://openalex.org/W3169814075,"The P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2RX7) mediates inflammatory microglial responses and is implicated in neuroimmune mechanisms of depression and neurodegenerative disorders. A number of studies suggest that psychosocial stress may precipitate depression through immune activation. Genetic association studies of P2RX7 variants with depression have been inconclusive. However, nearly all studies have focused on only one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and have not considered interaction with psychosocial stress. We investigated the effect of several variations in P2RX7 gene using a clumping method in interaction with early adversities and recent stress on depression severity. 1752 subjects provided information on childhood adversities, recent life events, and current depression severity. Participants were genotyped for 681 SNPs in the P2RX7 gene, 335 of them passed quality control and were entered into linear regression models followed by a clumping procedure for main effect and interactions. No significant main effect was observed. Rs74892325 emerged as a top SNP for interaction with childhood adversities and rs61953400 for interaction with recent life events. Our study is the first to investigate several variants in the P2RX7 gene and in interaction with two types of stress, extending our understanding of neuroinflammation in depression, and supporting that the majority of genes influence depression by enhancing sensitivity to stressors."

In this study, we collected 132 V. inaequalis isolates from Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and the U.K. and analyzed their genetic diversity by using 13 microsatellite markers. Cluster analysis based on population structure and genetic distances suggested high similarity among the four regions. Population differentiation values ranged from 0.044 to 0.155, indicating there is a high level of kinship among the four regions. All isolates could be divided into 5 lineages with a 0.76 similarity coefficient. Among the four regions, Shaanxi had only one lineage, Group II; Gansu had four lineages, Group I, Group II, Group IV, and Group V; Xinjiang had all five lineages, Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V; and the U.K. had three lineages, Group I, Group II and Group IV. High molecular variance was detected for populations in the four regions, with 91% of the variance occurring within the populations and 9% among the populations. Structure analysis there are three common ancestors of these four regions. The results of the present study shed light on the genetic diversity of V. inaequalis in Shaanxi, Gansu and Xinjiang, which will lead to the development of more effective management strategies and new resistant apple cultivars through molecular marker-assisted selection."
https://openalex.org/W3171657895,"Previous studies have shown that approximately 20% of hospital readmissions can be medication-related and 70% of these readmissions are possibly preventable. This retrospective medical records study aimed to find risk factors associated with medication-related readmissions to hospital within 30 days of discharge in older adults (≥65 years).30-day readmissions (n = 360) were assessed as being either possibly or unlikely medication-related after which selected variables were used to individually compare the two groups to a comparison group (n = 360). The aim was to find individual risk factors of possibly medication-related readmissions focusing on living arrangements, polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medication therapy, and changes made to medication regimens at initial discharge.A total of 143 of the 360 readmissions (40%) were assessed as being possibly medication-related. Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.5-1.25), excessive polypharmacy (OR 1.74, 95%CI 1.07-2.81), having adjustments made to medication dosages at initial discharge (OR 1.63, 95%CI 1.03-2.58) and living in your own home, alone, were variables identified as risk factors of such readmissions. Living in your own home, alone, increased the odds of a possibly medication-related readmission 1.69 times compared to living in your own home with someone (p-value 0.025) and 2.22 times compared to living in a nursing home (p-value 0.037).Possibly medication-related readmissions within 30 days of discharge, in patients 65 years and older, are common. The odds of such readmissions increase in comorbid, highly medicated patients living in their own home, alone, and if having medication dosages adjusted at initial discharge. These results indicate that care planning before discharge and the provision of help with, for example, managing medications after discharge, are factors especially important if aiming to reduce the amount of medication-related readmissions among this population. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3170595827,"To improve our knowledge of the migration pathway of a highly threatened fish species along the Mekong River, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) and 18 trace element concentrations were measured in the water and in the otoliths of an anadromous catfish, Pangasius krempfi, to infer its natal origin and potential migration pathways. Water was sampled at 18 locations along the mainstream, tributaries and distributaries of the Mekong River. To check for accuracy and precision, measurements of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios and trace element concentrations were then compared in two laboratories that use different analytical methods. Differences in trace element concentrations between locations were not significant and could not, therefore, be used to discriminate between migration pathways. However, the Mekong mainstream, tributaries and distributaries could all be discriminated using Sr isotopes. The 87Sr/86Sr profiles recorded in P. krempfi otoliths showed that there were three contingents with obligate freshwater hatching and variable spawning sites along the Mekong mainstream, from Phnom Penh (Cambodia) to Nong Khai (Thailand) or further. After hatching, the fish migrated more or less rapidly to the Mekong Delta and then settled for most of their lifetime in brackish water. Spawning habitats and migration routes may be threatened by habitat shifts and the increasing number of hydropower dams along the river, especially the contingents born above Khone Falls (Laos). The conservation of P. krempfi, as well as other migratory fish in the Mekong River, requires agreements, common actions and management by all countries along the Mekong River. This study highlighted the importance of using both Sr/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios to understand life history of anadromous fishes as the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the water was shown to be less effective than the Sr/Ca ratio in identifying movements between different saline areas."
https://openalex.org/W3171435163,"RRM1 is functionally associated with DNA replication and DNA damage repair. However, the biological activity of RRM1 in pancreatic cancer remains undetermined.To determine relationships between RRM1 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, and to explore RRM1 function in cancer biology, we investigated RRM1 expression levels in 121 pancreatic cancer patients by immunohistochemical staining and performed in vitro experiments to analyze the functional consequences of RRM1 expression.Patients with high RRM1 expression had significantly poorer clinical outcomes (overall survival; p = 0.006, disease-free survival; p = 0.0491). In particular, high RRM1 expression was also associated with poorer overall survival on adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.008). We found that RRM1 expression was increased 24 hours after exposure to gemcitabine and could be suppressed by histone acetyltransferase inhibition. RRM1 activation in response to gemcitabine exposure was induced mainly in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic RRM1 activation was related to cancer cell viability. In contrast, cancer cells lacking cytoplasmic RRM1 activation were confirmed to show severe DNA damage. RRM1 inhibition with specific siRNA or hydroxyurea enhanced the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer cells.Cytoplasmic RRM1 activation is involved in biological processes related to drug resistance in response to gemcitabine exposure and could be a potential target for pancreatic cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3167650582,"Introduction Myocardial ischemia (MI) is a top ranked cause of death among diabetic patients, yet it is mostly asymptomatic or “silent”. There is a need for summary epidemiologic measures on this highly lethal and unnoticeable complication of diabetes. The proposed systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate of the global prevalence of silent MI among diabetic patients. Methods and analysis This protocol was prepared according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. The systematic review will include all observational studies published until March 23, 2021 and reporting on the prevalence of silent MI in diabetic patients. Electronic sources including MEDLINE(PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science will be searched for potentially eligible studies, restricted to only studies published in English. Two investigators will select studies and use a pre-pilot tested form to extract data. Further, they will independently perform a qualitative assessment of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected studies, followed by a quantitative assessment using funnel plots and Egger’s tests. The heterogeneity between studies will be assessed with the Cochrane’s Q statistic, and the I 2 statistic will measure the percentage of variation across studies that is due to their heterogeneity rather than chance; it will decide if a meta-analysis can be conducted. In case a meta-analysis cannot be conducted, a descriptive analysis will be performed. Otherwise, study-specific estimates will be pooled using either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model depending on the value of the I 2 statistic. Subgroup and random effects meta-regression analyses will be used to further investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity. Finally, sensitivity analyses will be performed to measure the impact of low-quality studies on the results of the meta-analysis, and power calculations will determine the probability that we will detect a true effect if it does exist. Strengths and limitations of this study The intended review will provide an up-to-date summary of the global prevalence of silent MI in diabetic patients. We will conduct a thorough literature search for eligible studies, and we will use robust meta-analysis tools to provide reliable estimates of the global prevalence of silent MI in diabetic patients. Two major limitations could be: the predominance of clinical trials that might limit the generalizability of the findings, given that the strict inclusion criteria of these studies might have excluded other patients; the risk of type 1 error emanating from the high number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

We assessed the utility of serum inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies (Diazyme, Poway, CA). In controls, non-hospitalized subjects, and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n = 278), median IgG levels in arbitrary units (AU)/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects, 14.83 in positive outpatients, and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients ( P &lt;0.0001). Neutralizing antibody levels correlated significantly with IgG (r = 0.875; P &lt;0.0001). Having combined values of IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL and CRP ≥10 mg/L occurred in 97.7% of inpatients versus 1.8% of outpatients (odds ratio 3,861, C statistic 0.976, P = 1.00 x 10 −12 ). Antibody or ferritin levels did not add significantly to predicting hospitalization. Antibody testing in family members and contacts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n = 759) was invaluable for case finding. Persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic COVID-19 symptoms. In 81,624 screened subjects, IgG levels were positive (≥1.0 AU/mL) in 5.21%, while IgM levels were positive in 2.96% of subjects. In positive subjects median IgG levels in AU/mL were 3.14 if &lt;30 years of age, 4.38 if 30–44 years of age, 7.89 if 45–54 years of age, 9.52 if 55–64 years of age, and 10.64 if ≥65 years of age ( P = 2.96 x 10 −38 ). Our data indicate that: 1) combined IL-6 ≥10 pg/mL and CRP ≥10 mg/L identify SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects requiring hospitalization; 2) IgG levels were significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels with a wide range of responses; 3) IgG levels have significant utility for case finding in exposed subjects; 4) persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic symptoms; and 5) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects than their younger counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W3170458974,"Background Healthcare professionals may have certain psychological characteristics which contribute to increasing the quality of their professional performance. Objective Study the effect that humanization of care and communication have on the burnout syndrome in nursing personal. Methods The sample included a total of 330 Spanish nurses. Analytical instruments used were the Health Professional’s Humanization Scale (HUMAS), Communication Styles Inventory Revised (CSI-R) and Brief Burnout Questionnaire Revised (CBB-R). Results Two broad nursing profiles could be differentiated by their level of humanization (those with scores over the mean and those with scores below it in optimistic disposition, openness to sociability, emotional understanding, self-efficacy, and affection), where the largest group had the high scores. A communication repertoire based on verbal aggressiveness impacted indirectly on the effect of humanization on burnout, mainly in the personal impact component. We observed the relation of humanization profiles in nursing staff with the job dissatisfaction and burnout components. Besides that, some communication styles, verbal aggressiveness and questioningness, have an indirect effect on the relationship between humanization profiles and job dissatisfaction. Conclusions The results on the relationship between communication styles and burnout, and the mediator effect of communication styles on the relationship between humanization of care and burnout in nursing personnel are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3170623218,"Mechanical thrombectomy using the stent-retriever in conjunction with the distal access catheter may improve the rates of successful revascularization and clinical outcomes in patients with acute stroke. We aimed to compare two different thrombectomy techniques, according to the position of the distal access catheter tip in the combined stent-retriever and aspiration approach.In this retrospective study, patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion treated with the combined technique were divided into two groups based on the tip position of the distal access catheter: distal group (catheter placed adjacent to the thrombus) and proximal group (catheter placed in the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery below the ophthalmic artery). Baseline characteristics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were compared.Eighty-three patients (distal group, n = 45; proximal group, n = 38) were included. Higher complete reperfusion was observed in the distal group (unweighted analysis: 66.7% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.025; weighted analysis: 74.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.002). In the multivariate analysis, the distal tip position was independently associated with complete reperfusion (unweighted analysis: aOR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.40-11.98; p = 0.01; weighted analysis: aOR, 5.20; 95% CI, 1.72-15.78; p = 0.004). The distal group also showed more favorable clinical outcomes and early neurological improvement (unweighted analysis: 62.2% vs. 55.3%; p = 0.521, 60% vs. 50%; p = 0.361, respectively; weighted analysis: 62.7% vs. 61.1%; p = 0.877, 66% vs. 45.7%; p = 0.062, respectively). However, more arterial dissections were observed in the distal group (8.9%, n = 4 vs. 2.6%, n = 1; p = 0.36). In the distal group, one patient with vascular injury died due to complications. No cases of emboli in new territory were observed.Distal tip position of the distal access catheter has a significant impact on reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, there was also a higher rate of vascular injury as the catheter was advanced further. If advancement to the target lesion is too difficult, placing it in the cavernous internal carotid artery may be a viable method without complications."
https://openalex.org/W3170672986,"Resistance to Tuberculosis drugs has become a major threat to the control of tuberculosis (TB) globally. We conducted the first nation-wide drug resistance survey to investigate the level and pattern of resistance to first-line TB drugs among newly and previously treated sputum smear-positive TB cases. We also evaluated associations between potential risk factors and TB drug resistance. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on conducting national TB surveys, we selected study participants from 33 health facilities from across the country, grouped into 29 clusters, and included them into the survey. Between April 2016 and June 2017, a total of 927 patients (859 new and 68 previously treated) were enrolled in the survey. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates were successfully cultured from 598 (65.5%) patient samples and underwent DST, 550 from newly diagnosed and 48 from previously treated patients. The proportion of patients who showed resistance to any of the TB drugs tested was 25.2% (95% CI; 21.8-28.9). The most frequent resistance was to Streptomycin (STR) (12.3%), followed by Isoniazid (INH) (10.4%), with Rifampicin (RIF), showing the least resistance of 2.4%. Resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin (multi-drug resistance) was found in 19 (3.2%; 95% CI: 1.9-4.9) isolates. Prevalence of multidrug resistance was 7 (1.3%; 95% CI: 0.5-2.6) among newly diagnosed and 12 (25.0%; 95% CI: 13.6-39.6) among previously treated patients. At both univariate and multivariate analysis, MDR-TB was positively associated with previous history of TB treatment (OR = 5.09, 95% CI: 1.75-14.75, p = 0.003); (OR = 5.41, 95% CI: 1.69-17.30, p = 0.004). The higher levels of MDR-TB and overall resistance to any TB drug among previously treated patients raises concerns about adherence to treatment. This calls for strengthening existing TB programme measures to ensure a system for adequately testing and monitoring TB drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3171835261,"Sarcasm is the main reason behind the faulty classification of tweets. It brings a challenge in natural language processing (NLP) as it hampers the method of finding people's actual sentiment. Various feature engineering techniques are being investigated for the automatic detection of sarcasm. However, most related techniques have always concentrated only on the content-based features in sarcastic expression, leaving the contextual information in isolation. This leads to a loss of the semantics of words in the sarcastic expression. Another drawback is the sparsity of the training data. Due to the word limit of microblog, the feature vector's values for each sample constructed by BoW produces null features. To address the above-named problems, a Multi-feature Fusion Framework is proposed using two classification stages. The first stage classification is constructed with the lexical feature only, extracted using the BoW technique, and trained using five standard classifiers, including SVM, DT, KNN, LR, and RF, to predict the sarcastic tendency. In stage two, the constructed lexical sarcastic tendency feature is fused with eight other proposed features for modelling a context to obtain a final prediction. The effectiveness of the developed framework is tested with various experimental analysis to obtain classifiers' performance. The evaluation shows that our constructed classification models based on the developed novel feature fusion obtained results with a precision of 0.947 using a Random Forest classifier. Finally, the obtained results were compared with the results of three baseline approaches. The comparison outcome shows the significance of the proposed framework."
https://openalex.org/W3172963890,"Peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) is a common complication in meningioma and disruption of the tumor-brain barrier in meningioma is crucial for PTBE formation. To evaluate the association between meningioma size and PTBE, we measured meningioma volumes using the 3D slicer in patients with convexity and parasagittal meningiomas.Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off meningioma volume values for predicting PTBE occurrence. Logistic regressions were used to estimate the odds ratios for PTBE occurrence in patients with convexity and parasagittal meningiomas according to several predictive factors.A total of 205 convexity or parasagittal meningioma patients with no other brain disease who underwent one or more contrast-enhanced brain MRIs were enrolled in this 10-year analysis in two hospitals. The optimal cut-off meningioma volume value for prediction of PTBE in all study patients was 13.953 cc (sensitivity = 76.1%; specificity = 92.5%). If a meningioma is assumed to be a complete sphere, 13.953 cc is about 2.987 cm in diameter.Our study suggests a cut-off value of 3 cm meningioma diameter for prediction of PTBE in patients with convexity and parasagittal meningiomas. We believe that we have revealed why the meningioma diameter of 3 cm is clinically meaningful."
https://openalex.org/W3168235571,"For displaced distal radius fracture, this trial aimed to compare an above-elbow (AE) and below-elbow (BE) cast at the end of a 24-week follow-up using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire as a primary outcome.This is a clinical trial with parallel groups (1:1) and a blinded evaluator. There are two non-surgical interventions: AE and BE. A total of 128 adult patients with acute (up to 7 days) displaced distal radius fracture of type A2-3, C1-3 by the AO classification were included. The follow-up was 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the DASH questionnaire at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the maintenance of reduction by the evaluation of radiographic parameters, pain measured by VAS, PRWE, objective functional evaluation and rate of adverse effects.The difference between the two groups in the DASH score at 24 weeks was not significant, with the mean (95% CI) DASH score being AE: 9.44 (2.70 to 16.17) vs. BE: 9.88 (3.19 to 16.57) (p = 0.895). The above-elbow group had a significantly greater worsening of the mean DASH score from baseline to 2 weeks (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in any of the other follow-up assessments. Objective functional evaluation, PRWE, radiographical measures and rates of reduction loss were similar between groups. Above-elbow casting resulted in more adverse effects (mostly shoulder pain; 19 events vs. 9 events); RR = 0.39 (0.19-0.94); p = 0.033 at the end of six-month follow-up.This study did not demonstrate a difference between above-elbow and below-elbow cast in terms of DASH outcome at 6 months in non-surgical treatment of deviated distal radius fractures. However, below-elbow casting is less debilitating during the treatment period, has comparable performance in maintaining the reduction, and is related to fewer minor adverse effects than above-elbow casting."
https://openalex.org/W3169977605,"Liquid manure (slurry) from livestock releases methane (CH4) that contributes significantly to global warming. Existing models for slurry CH4 production-used for mitigation and inventories-include effects of organic matter loading, temperature, and retention time but cannot predict important effects of management, or adequately capture essential temperature-driven dynamics. Here we present a new model that includes multiple methanogenic groups whose relative abundance shifts in response to changes in temperature or other environmental conditions. By default, the temperature responses of five groups correspond to those of four methanogenic species and one uncultured methanogen, although any number of groups could be defined. We argue that this simple mechanistic approach is able to describe both short- and long-term responses to temperature where other existing approaches fall short. The model is available in the open-source R package ABM (https://github.com/sashahafner/ABM) as a single flexible function that can include effects of slurry management (e.g., removal frequency and treatment methods) and changes in environmental conditions over time. Model simulations suggest that the reduction of CH4 emission by frequent emptying of slurry pits is due to washout of active methanogens. Application of the model to represent a full-scale slurry storage tank showed it can reproduce important trends, including a delayed response to temperature changes. However, the magnitude of predicted emission is uncertain, primarily as a result of sensitivity to the hydrolysis rate constant, due to a wide range in reported values. Results indicated that with additional work-particularly on the magnitude of hydrolysis rate-the model could be a tool for estimation of CH4 emissions for inventories."
https://openalex.org/W3170173230,"Good adherence of antihypertensives is recommended for the accomplishment of hypertension therapy. The number of medications and characteristics contributing to medication regimen complexity, such as dosage forms and dosing frequency, are known to influence medication adherence. However, the effect of medication regimen complexity on the therapeutic efficacy of medicines remains to be clarified. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the effect of number of medications and medication regimen complexity on medication adherence and therapeutic efficacy in patients with hypertension.According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 1,057 patients, who were on medications including antihypertensives on admission at the Mie University Hospital between July 2018 and December 2018, were enrolled in this study. Poor blood pressure management was defined if the systolic or diastolic blood pressure were ≥140 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg. Medication regimen complexity was quantified using the medication regimen complexity index (MRCI) score.Among 1,057 patients, 164 and 893 patients were categorized into poor and good adherence groups, respectively. The multivariate analyses revealed that age ≥ 71 years and oral MRCI score ≥ 19.5 but not number of oral medications were extracted as risk factors for poor medication adherence. Medication adherence and blood pressure management were poor in the group with oral MRCI score ≥ 19.5, regardless of the age. The rate of readmission was similar.Our study is the first to demonstrate that medication regimen complexity rather than number of medications is closely related to medication adherence and blood pressure management. Hence, physicians and/or pharmacists should consider the complexity of medication regimens while modifying them."
https://openalex.org/W3166574405,"Sirodesmin, the major secondary metabolite produced by the plant pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans in vitro, has been linked to disease on Brassica species since the 1970s, and yet its role has remained ambiguous. Re-examination of gene expression data revealed that all previously described genes and two newly identified genes within the sir gene cluster in the genome are down-regulated during the crucial early establishment stages of blackleg disease on Brassica napus. To test if this is a strategy employed by the fungus to avoid damage to and then detection by the host plant during the L. maculans asymptomatic biotrophic phase, sirodesmin was produced constitutively by overexpressing the sirZ gene encoding the transcription factor that coordinates the regulation of the other genes in the sir cluster. The sirZ over-expression strains had a major reduction in pathogenicity. Mutation of the over-expression construct restored pathogenicity. However, mutation of two genes, sirP and sirG, required for specific steps in the sirodesmin biosynthesis pathway, in the sirZ over-expression background resulted in strains that were unable to synthesize sirodesmin, yet were still non-pathogenic. Elucidating the basis for this pathogenicity defect or finding ways to overexpress sirZ during disease may provide new strategies for the control of blackleg disease."
https://openalex.org/W3168729791,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has substantial morbidity in young calves, and closely parallels human RSV in infants. We performed a randomized controlled trial in five to six-week-old Holstein calves (Bos taurus). comparing fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) singly and in combination at three and five days after experimental BRSV infection. Thirty-six calves received one of six treatments; Ibuprofen started on day 3, Ibuprofen started on day 5, FPI started on day 5, FPI and Ibuprofen started on day 3, FPI and Ibuprofen started on day 5, or placebo. We have previously reported significant clinical benefits when combined FPI and NSAID treatment was started at three and five days after bovine RSV infection. Necropsy was performed on Day 10 following infection and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on sections from each lobe. Histology was described using a four-point scale. We performed canonical discrimination analysis (CDA) to determine the structural level where differences between treatments occurred and mixed effects regression to estimate effect sizes. Separation from placebo was maximal for dual therapy at the levels of the alveolus, septum, and bronchus in CDA. We found that the clinical benefits of combined FPI and NSAID treatment of BRSV extend at least partially from histopathological changes in the lung when treatment was started three days after infection. We found decreased lung injury when ibuprofen was started as monotherapy on day 3, but not day 5 following infection. Combined therapy with both an FPI and ibuprofen was always better than ibuprofen alone. We did not prove that the clinical benefits seen starting FPI and ibuprofen five days after infection can be solely explained by histopathological differences as identified on H&E staining."
https://openalex.org/W3172915147,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an implant-based therapy applied to patients with a specific heart failure (HF) profile. The identification of patients that may benefit from CRT is a challenging task and the application of current guidelines still induce a non-responder rate of about 30%. Several studies have shown that the assessment of left ventricular (LV) mechanics by speckle tracking echocardiography can provide useful information for CRT patient selection. A comprehensive evaluation of LV mechanics is normally performed using three different echocardioraphic views: 4, 3 or 2-chamber views. The aim of this study is to estimate the relative importance of strain-based features extracted from these three views, for the estimation of CRT response. Several features were extracted from the longitudinal strain curves of 130 patients and different methods of feature selection (out-of-bag random forest, wrapping and filtering) have been applied. Results show that more than 50% of the 20 most important features are calculated from the 4-chamber view. Although features from the 2- and 3-chamber views are less represented in the most important features, some of the former have been identified to provide complementary information. A thorough analysis and interpretation of the most informative features is also provided, as a first step towards the construction of a machine-learning chain for an improved selection of CRT candidates."

We aim to phenotype the regulatory immune response during natural HW infection and its evolution after treatment.Twenty hookworm infected (HW+) and 14 non-infected subjects HW-from endemic area in the periphery of Ho Chi Minh City were included. Blood and feces samples were obtained before, 2 and 4 weeks after treatment with Albendazole 400mg. Additional samples were obtained at 3 and 12 months in the HW+ group. Hematological parameters, Treg (CD4+CD25hiFoxP3hi) and surface molecules (CD39, CD62L, ICOS, PD-1, CD45RA) were measured as well as inflammatory and lymphocytes differentiation cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, IL-4, IL-17, IL-10, IL-2 and TGFβ.HW+ subjects showed higher Treg, TregICOS+, Treg PD1-, TregCD62L+ and CD45RA+FoxP3lo resting Treg (rTreg). CD45RA-FoxP3lo non-suppressive Treg cells were also increased. No preferential Th1/Th2 orientation was observed, nor difference for IL-10 between two groups. After treatment, Treg, TregICOS+, TregCD62L+, Treg PD1- and rTreg decreased while IL-4 and IL-6 cytokines increased.During HW infection, Treg are increased and characterized by a heterogeneous population: a highly suppressive as well as a non-suppressive T cells phenotype.

POPs are transferred from dams to offspring and the high sensitivity of neonates to endocrine disturbances may be caused by underdeveloped systems of metabolism and excretion. The present study aimed to characterize the effect of in utero and lactational exposure to a human relevant mixture of POPs on the female mammary gland, ovarian folliculogenesis and liver function in CD-1 offspring mice. Dams were exposed to the mixture through the diet at Control, Low or High doses (representing 0x, 5000x and 100 000x human estimated daily intake levels, respectively) from weaning and throughout mating, gestation, and lactation. Perinatally exposed female offspring exhibited altered mammary gland development and a suppressed ovarian follicle maturation. Increased hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymatic activities indirectly indicated activation of nuclear receptors and potential generation of reactive products. Hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed from weaning until 30 weeks of age and could potentially lead to hepatotoxicity. Further studies should investigate the effects of human relevant mixtures of POPs on several hormones combined with female reproductive ability and liver function."

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a promising non-invasive method to measure tumor burden, define prognosis and monitor disease status in many solid cancers. In this pilot study, we investigated if unique tumor-specific DNA junctions can be used to detect ctDNA levels in patients with endometrial cancer.Chromosomal rearrangements in primary tumors of eleven patients with high-grade or advanced stage endometrial cancer were determined by whole-genome Mate-Pair sequencing. Identified unique tumor-specific junctions were evaluated in pre- and six-week post-surgery patient plasma using individualized quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. The relationship between clinicopathological features and detection of ctDNA was investigated.CtDNA was detected in 60% (6/10) of cases pre-surgery and in 27% (3/11) post-surgery. The detection of ctDNA pre-surgery was consistent with clinical indicators of aggressive disease such as advanced stage (80% - 4/5), lymphatic spread of disease (100% - 3/3), serous histology (80% - 4/5), deep myometrial invasion (100% - 3/3), lympho-vascular space invasion (75% - 3/4). All patients in which ctDNA was detected post-surgically had type II endometrial cancer.This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using personalized tumor-specific junction panels for detecting ctDNA in the plasma of endometrial cancer patients. Larger studies and longer follow-up are needed to validate the potential association between pre-surgical ctDNA detection and the presence of cancers with aggressive pathologic tumor characteristics or advanced stage observed in this study."

Although guidelines for thorough organicity investigations (OI) exist, their dissemination appears scarce in nonacademic healthcare facilities and some rare disorders remain undiagnosed, many of them presenting without easily recognized phenotypes. This study aims to understand the challenges underlying the implementation of OI in non-academic facilities by practitioners trained in expert centers.Sixteen psychiatrists working at French non-academic facilities were interviewed about their use of OI for adolescents suspected of early psychosis. Interviews were analyzed with Grounded Theory.Organicity investigations were found to be useful in rationalizing psychiatric care for the young patient all the while building trust between the doctor and the patient's parents. They also are reassuring for psychiatrists confronted with uncertainty about psychosis onset and the consequences of a psychiatric label. However, they commonly find themselves facing the challenges of implementation alone and thus enter a renunciation pathway: from idealistic missionaries, they become torn between their professional ethics and the non-academic work culture. Ultimately, they abandon the use of OI or delegate it to expert centers.Specific hindrances to OI implementation must be addressed."

A cross sectional study was conducted in people diagnosed with schizophrenia (cases) and a control population between 2016 and 2019. In this study, 252 people were participated. Ink and paper method was used to evaluate the difference of fingerprints palm prints between patients with schizophrenia and participants in control group.93 participants were analyzed in schizophrenic group and 142 participants were investigated in the control group. The percentage of arches on the right ring finger was significantly different between the schizophrenic patient group and control group ( p = 0 . 011 ). The whorl pattern type (U-W-U-W-W-W-W-U-W-U) was dominantly observed in both of the schizophrenic patient group and control group. A-B ridge count in schizophrenic patient group and control group produced a markedly significant difference ( p&lt;0 . 05 ). Interestingly, a strong significant difference was produced in comparing of A-B ridge count in catatonic schizophrenia group with residual schizophrenia group ( p&lt;0 . 005 ). In comparison, index of pattern intensity in control group was slightly higher than that in schizophrenic patient group. Taking together, these results showed that the dermatoglypic characteristics might be a valuable tool to describe the nature of schizophrenia and its clinical subtypes and further studies are needed in clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W3168066908,"In previous studies, measuring the levels of calprotectin in patients with pleural effusion (PE) was an exceptionally accurate way to predict malignancy. Here, we evaluated a rapid method for the measurement of calprotectin levels as a useful parameter in the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in order to minimise invasive diagnostic tests. Calprotectin levels were measured with Quantum Blue® sCAL (QB®sCAL) and compared with the gold standard reference ELISA method. Calprotectin levels in patients with benign pleural effusion (BPE) were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than for MPE patients. We measured the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for a cut-off value of ≤ 14,150 ng/mL; the diagnostic accuracy was 64%. The odds ratio for PE calprotectin levels was 10.938 (95% CI [4.133 - 28.947]). The diagnostic performance of calprotectin concentration was better for predicting MPE compared to other individual parameters. Comparison of two assays showed a slope of 1.084, an intercept of 329.7, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.798. The Bland-Altman test showed a positive bias for the QB®sCAL method compared to ELISA fCAL®. Clinical concordance between both these methods was 88.5% with a Cohen kappa index of 0.76 (95% CI [0.68 - 0.84]). We concluded that QB®sCAL is a fast, reliable, and non-invasive diagnostic tool for diagnosing MPE and represents an alternative to ELISA that could be implemented in medical emergencies."

We argue that although this strategy may help defendants evade blame, it may carry longer-term social costs, as lay people's perceptions of a person's agency might determine some of the moral rights they grant them. In this registered report protocol, we seek to expand upon preliminary findings from two pilot studies to examine how and why those using the defense of mental impairment are seen as less deserving of certain rights. The proposed study uses a hypothetical vignette design, varying the type of mental impairment, type of crime, and type of sentence. Our design for the registered study improves on various aspects of our pilot studies and aims to rigorously test the reliability and credibility of our model. The findings have implications for defendants claiming reduced agency through legal defenses, as well as for the broader study of moral rights and mind perception."

We explore apple fruit development through the growing season to establish the point at which physical features differentiating those cultivars become evident. This is relevant both for the understanding of the growing process and to ensure that any identification and classification tools can be used both on ripened-on-tree and stored fruit. Current literature presents some contradictory findings on apple growth, we studied 12 apple cultivars in the Brogdale National Fruit Collection, UK over two seasons to establish patterns of growth. Fruit were sampled at regular time points throughout the growing season and four morphometrics (maximum length, maximum diameter, weight, and centroid size) were collected. These were regressed against growing degree days in order to appropriately describe the growth pattern observed. All four morphometrics were adequately described using log-log linear regressions, with adjusted R2 estimates ranging from 78.3% (maximum length) to 86.7% (weight). For all four morphometrics, a 10% increase in growing degree days was associated with a 1% increase in the morphometric. Our findings refine previous work presenting rapid early growth followed by a plateau in later stages of development and contrast with published expo-linear models. We established that apples harvested for commercial storage purposes, two weeks prior to maturity, showed only a modest decrease in size compared with ripened-on-tree fruit, demonstrating that size morphometric approaches are appropriate for classification of apple fruit at point of harvest."
https://openalex.org/W3170283819,"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is considered an effective treatment in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). However, the long-term durability of below-the-knee (BTK) PTA is known to be limited. This study sought to compare the 1-year clinical outcomes following stenting versus balloon angioplasty alone in BTK lesions. This study included 357 consecutive patients (400 limbs, 697 lesions) with BTK lesions who underwent PTA from September 2010 to December 2016. All enrolled patients were treated either by stenting (stent group; 111 limbs of 102 patients) or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA group; 289 limbs of 255 patients). Stent group includes both primary and provisional stenting. Angiographic outcomes, procedural success, complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups up to 1 year. After propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, 56 pairs were generated, and the baseline and angiographic characteristics were balanced. The procedural success and complications were similar between the two groups; however, the incidence of procedure-related perforation was higher in the POBA group than in the stenting group [5(11.9%) vs.1 (0.9%), P = 0.009]. Six- to 9-month computed tomography or angiographic follow-up showed similar incidences of binary restenosis, primary patency, and secondary patency. In the 1-year clinical follow-up, there were similar incidences of individual hard endpoints, including mortality, myocardial infarction, limb salvage, and amputation rate, with the exception of target extremity revascularization (TER), which tended to be higher in the stenting group than in the POBA group [21 (20.8%) vs. 11 (10.9%), P = 0.054]. Although there was a trend toward a higher incidence of TER risk in the stenting group, stent implantation, particularly in bail-out stenting seemed to have acceptable 1-year safety and efficacy compared to POBA alone in patients undergoing BTK PTA."
https://openalex.org/W3170431451,"Insects hold considerable ecological and agricultural importance making it vital to understand the factors impacting their reproductive output. Environmental stressors are examples of such factors which have a substantial and significant influence on insect reproductive fitness. Insects are also ectothermic and small in size which makes them even more susceptible to environmental stresses. The present study assesses the consequence of desiccation on the mating latency and copulations duration in tropical Drosophila melanogaster. We tested flies for these reproductive behavioral parameters at varying body water levels and with whole metabolome analysis in order to gain a further understanding of the physiological response to desiccation. Our results showed that the duration of desiccation is positively correlated with mating latency and mating failure, while having no influence on the copulation duration. The metabolomic analysis revealed three biological pathways highly affected by desiccation: starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. These results are consistent with carbohydrate metabolism providing an energy source in desiccated flies and also suggests that the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway plays a role in the reproductive fitness of the flies. Desiccation is a common issue with smaller insects, like Drosophila and other tropical insects, and our findings indicate that this lack of ambient water can immediately and drastically affect the insect reproductive behaviour, which becomes more crucial because of unpredictable and dynamic weather conditions."

To characterize the factors associated with the prolonged use of PPI, a multivariate logistic regression model was used.Pantoprazole (42.7%) and omeprazole (31%) were the most acquired PPIs, prescribed mainly by gastroenterologists (49.5%). They are used in the morning, especially for gastrointestinal symptoms, however, they had been consumed for more than 5 years in 30% of cases. The factors associated with prolonged use are old age (OR 1.03 CI95% 1.01-1.05), body mass index (OR 1.07 CI95% 1.01-1.12), use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (OR 3.18 CI95% 1.20-8.43) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR 3.5 95% CI 1.39-8.88).PPIs are adequate in terms of indication and form of use, however, prolonged use associated with old age, being overweight and use of anti-inflammatories and antidepressants is frequent."
https://openalex.org/W3171744792,"The Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA) aims to transform higher education in Africa. One of its main thrusts is supporting promising university faculty (fellows) to obtain high quality doctoral training. CARTA offers fellows robust support which includes funding of their attendance at Joint Advanced Seminars (JASes) throughout the doctoral training period. An evaluation is critical in improving program outcomes. In this study; we, CARTA fellows who attended the fourth JAS in 2018, appraised the CARTA program from our perspective, specifically focusing on the organization of the program and its influence on the fellows' individual and institutional development.Exploratory Qualitative Study Design was used and data was obtained from three focus group discussions among the fellows in March 2018. The data were analyzed using thematic approach within the framework of good practice elements in doctoral training-Formal Research Training, Activities Driven by Doctoral Candidates, Career Development as well as Concepts and Structures.In all, 21 fellows from six African countries participated and all had been in the CARTA program for at least three years. The fellowship has increased fellows research skills and expanded our research capacities. This tremendously improved the quality of our doctoral research and it was also evident in our research outputs, including the number of peer-reviewed publications. The CARTA experience inculcated a multidisciplinary approach to our research and enabled significant improvement in our organizational, teaching, and leadership skills. All these were achieved through the well-organized structures of CARTA and these have transformed us to change agents who are already taking on research and administrative responsibilities in our various home institutions. Unfortunately, during the long break between the second and the third JAS, there was a gap in communication between CARTA and her fellows, which resulted in some transient loss of focus by a few fellows.The CARTA model which builds the research capacity of doctoral fellows through robust support, including intermittent strategic Joint Advanced Seminars has had effective and transformative impacts on our doctoral odyssey. However, there is a need to maintain the momentum through continuous communication between CARTA and the fellows all through this journey."

This study focused on one of the health concerns worldwide, a leading cause of death related to mental health-suicide-in the context of a dominant visual social media platform, YouTube. This study employed content analysis method to identify the factors predicting viewer responses to suicide-themed content from the perspectives of who's, what's, and how's of suicide-themed videos. The results of the hierarchical multiple regression showed that the characteristics of content provider and content expression were more significant predictors of viewer engagement than were the characteristics of the message. These findings have implications for not only platform service providers but also diverse groups of individuals who participate in online discussions on suicide. YouTube has the potential to function as a locus for open discussion, education, collective coping, and even the diagnosis of suicidal ideation."
https://openalex.org/W3130694659,"In diploid cells, the paternal and maternal alleles are, on average, equally expressed. There are exceptions from this: a small number of genes express the maternal or paternal allele copy exclusively. This phenomenon, known as genomic imprinting, is common among eutherian mammals and some plant species; however, genomic imprinting in species with haplodiploid sex determination is not well characterized. Previous work reported no parent-of-origin effects in the hybrids of closely related haplodiploid Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti jewel wasps, suggesting a lack of epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis in these species. Here, we replicate the gene expression dataset and observations using different individuals and sequencing technology, as well as reproduce these findings using the previously published RNA sequence data following our data analysis strategy. The major difference from the previous dataset is that they used an introgression strain as one of the parents and we found several loci that resisted introgression in that strain. Our results from both datasets demonstrate a species-of-origin effect, rather than a parent-of-origin effect. We present a reproducible workflow that others may use for replicating the results. Overall, we reproduced the original report of no parent-of-origin effects in the haplodiploid Nasonia using the original data with our new processing and analysis pipeline and replicated these results with our newly generated data."
https://openalex.org/W3171481839,"The present global pandemic triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has lingered for over a year in its devastating effects. Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently established with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by means of oropharyngeal-, nasopharyngeal-, anal-swabs, sputum and blood plasma. However, oral and nasal swabs are more commonly used. This study, therefore, assessed sensitivity and specificity of plasma as a diagnostic in comparison with a combination of oral and nasal swab samples, and the implications for blood transfusion. Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were obtained from 125 individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and stored in viral transport medium (VTM) tubes. Ten millilitres of blood samples in EDTA were also obtained by venepuncture and spun to obtain plasma. Viral RNA was obtained from both swabs and plasma by manual extraction with Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit. Detection was done using a real time fluorescent RT-qPCR BGI kit, on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR instrument. Average age of study participants was 41 years, with 74 (59.2%) being male. Out of the 125 individuals tested for COVID-19, 75 (60%) were positive by OP/NP swab. However, only 6 (4.8%) had a positive plasma result for COVID-19 with median Ct value of 32.4. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test using plasma was 8% and 100% respectively. There was no false positive recorded, but 69 (55.2%) false negatives were obtained by plasma. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected, albeit low (4.8%) in plasma. Plasma is likely not a suitable biological sample to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The implication of transfusing blood in this era of COVID-19 needs further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3166637212,"The extent to which a nasal whiff of scent can exogenously orient visual spatial attention remains poorly understood in humans. In a series of seven studies, we investigated the existence of an exogenous capture of visual spatial attention by purely trigeminal (i.e., CO2) and both olfactory and trigeminal stimuli (i.e., eucalyptol). We chose these stimuli because they activate the trigeminal system which can be considered as an alert system and are thus supposedly relevant for the individual, and thus prone to capture attention. We used them as lateralized cues in a variant of a visual spatial cueing paradigm. In valid trials, trigeminal cues and visual targets were presented on the same side whereas in invalid trials they were presented on opposite sides. To characterize the dynamics of the cross-modal attentional capture, we manipulated the interval between the onset of the trigeminal cues and the visual targets (from 580 to 1870 ms). Reaction times in trigeminal valid trials were shorter than all other trials, but only when this interval was around 680 or 1170 ms for CO2 and around 610 ms for eucalyptol. This result reflects that both pure trigeminal and olfactory-trigeminal stimuli can exogenously capture humans' spatial visual attention. We discuss the importance of considering the dynamics of this cross-modal attentional capture."
https://openalex.org/W3168427967,"A review of the literature on moral issues indicates that none of the empirical approaches to moral reasoning proposes an experimental approach which controls for such object-related experimental variables as: knowledge, motivation, acceptance of moral norms and consequences of human behavior in moral situations in a single research procedure. A unique element of the proposed experimental method is a multi-stage model determining morality indicators. In the two-phase design experiment, psychology students were asked to create model ethical stories and then conduct an overall assessment of each of these stories. As a result, a base of ethical stories was created with empirical moral indicators (positive, negative, neutral). The patterns in the moral evaluation of ethical stories were determined by identifying three processes (selection, differentiation and integration). The final result is a confirmed design of the experiment and a set of formulas that can be used in education and research on morality reasoning."
https://openalex.org/W3169342721,"The manner in which inserted foreign coding sequences become transcriptionally activated and fixed in the plant genome is poorly understood. To examine such processes of gene evolution, we performed an artificial evolutionary experiment in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a model of gene-birth events, we introduced a promoterless coding sequence of the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene and established 386 T2-generation transgenic lines. Among them, we determined the individual LUC insertion loci in 76 lines and found that one-third of them were transcribed de novo even in the intergenic or inherently unexpressed regions. In the transcribed lines, transcription-related chromatin marks were detected across the newly activated transcribed regions. These results agreed with our previous findings in A. thaliana cultured cells under a similar experimental scheme. A comparison of the results of the T2-plant and cultured cell experiments revealed that the de novo-activated transcription concomitant with local chromatin remodelling was inheritable. During one-generation inheritance, it seems likely that the transcription activities of the LUC inserts trapped by the endogenous genes/transcripts became stronger, while those of de novo transcription in the intergenic/untranscribed regions became weaker. These findings may offer a clue for the elucidation of the mechanism by which inserted foreign coding sequences become transcriptionally activated and fixed in the plant genome."
https://openalex.org/W3169469067,"This study aimed to begin to address this gap using validated techniques in human factors to perform a participatory user-centered analysis of physical space during emergency Cesarean.This study employed a mixed-methods design. Focus group interviews and surveys were administered to a convenience sample (n = 34) of multidisciplinary obstetric teams. Data collected from focus group interviews were used to perform a task and equipment analysis. Survey data were coded and mapped by specialty to identify reported areas of congestion and time spent, and to identify themes related to physical space of the OR and labor and delivery unit.Task analysis revealed complex interdependencies between specialties. Thirty task groupings requiring over 20 pieces of equipment were identified. Perceived areas of congestion and areas of time spent in the OR varied by clinical specialty. The following categories emerged as main challenges encountered during an emergency Cesarean: 1) size of physical space and equipment, 2) layout and orientation, and 3) patient transport.User insights on physical space and workflow processes during emergency Cesarean section at the institution studied revealed challenges related to getting the patients into the OR expediently and having space to perform tasks without crowding or staff injury. By utilizing human factors techniques, other institutions may build upon our findings to improve safety during emergency situations on labor and delivery."
