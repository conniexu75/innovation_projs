https://openalex.org/W3008585479,"The pyroptosis execution protein GSDMD is cleaved by inflammasome-activated caspase-1 and LPS-activated caspase-11/4/5. The cleavage unmasks the pore-forming domain from GSDMD-C-terminal domain. How the caspases recognize GSDMD and its connection with caspase activation are unknown. Here, we show site-specific caspase-4/11 autoprocessing, generating a p10 product, is required and sufficient for cleaving GSDMD and inducing pyroptosis. The p10-form autoprocessed caspase-4/11 binds the GSDMD-C domain with a high affinity. Structural comparison of autoprocessed and unprocessed capase-11 identifies a β sheet induced by the autoprocessing. In caspase-4/11-GSDMD-C complex crystal structures, the β sheet organizes a hydrophobic GSDMD-binding interface that is only possible for p10-form caspase-4/11. The binding promotes dimerization-mediated caspase activation, rendering a cleavage independently of the cleavage-site tetrapeptide sequence. Crystal structure of caspase-1-GSDMD-C complex shows a similar GSDMD-recognition mode. Our study reveals an unprecedented substrate-targeting mechanism for caspases. The hydrophobic interface suggests an additional space for developing inhibitors specific for pyroptotic caspases."
https://openalex.org/W3007811953,"Summary Mammalian tissues engage in specialized physiology that is regulated through reversible modification of protein cysteine residues by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS regulate a myriad of biological processes, but the protein targets of ROS modification that drive tissue-specific physiology in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we develop Oximouse, a comprehensive and quantitative mapping of the mouse cysteine redox proteome in vivo. We use Oximouse to establish several paradigms of physiological redox signaling. We define and validate cysteine redox networks within each tissue that are tissue selective and underlie tissue-specific biology. We describe a common mechanism for encoding cysteine redox sensitivity by electrostatic gating. Moreover, we comprehensively identify redox-modified disease networks that remodel in aged mice, establishing a systemic molecular basis for the long-standing proposed links between redox dysregulation and tissue aging. We provide the Oximouse compendium as a framework for understanding mechanisms of redox regulation in physiology and aging."
https://openalex.org/W3007560401,"Aging causes a functional decline in tissues throughout the body that may be delayed by caloric restriction (CR). However, the cellular profiles and signatures of aging, as well as those ameliorated by CR, remain unclear. Here, we built comprehensive single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic atlases across various rat tissues undergoing aging and CR. CR attenuated aging-related changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and core transcriptional regulatory networks. Immune cells were increased during aging, and CR favorably reversed the aging-disturbed immune ecosystem. Computational prediction revealed that the abnormal cell-cell communication patterns observed during aging, including the excessive proinflammatory ligand-receptor interplay, were reversed by CR. Our work provides multi-tissue single-cell transcriptional landscapes associated with aging and CR in a mammal, enhances our understanding of the robustness of CR as a geroprotective intervention, and uncovers how metabolic intervention can act upon the immune system to modify the process of aging."
https://openalex.org/W3007680205,"Skin homeostasis is orchestrated by dozens of cell types that together direct stem cell renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and single-molecule RNA FISH to provide a systematic molecular atlas of full-thickness skin, determining gene expression profiles and spatial locations that define 56 cell types and states during hair growth and rest. These findings reveal how the outer root sheath (ORS) and inner hair follicle layers coordinate hair production. We found that the ORS is composed of two intermingling but transcriptionally distinct cell types with differing capacities for interactions with stromal cell types. Inner layer cells branch from transcriptionally uncommitted progenitors, and each lineage differentiation passes through an intermediate state. We also provide an online tool to explore this comprehensive skin cell atlas, including epithelial and stromal cells such as fibroblasts, vascular, and immune cells, to spur further discoveries in skin biology."

Quiescent HSCs are thought to rely on glycolysis for their energy, but the overall metabolic properties of HSCs remain elusive. Using combined approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we show that mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) distinguishes quiescent from cycling-primed HSCs. We found that primed, but not quiescent, HSCs relied readily on glycolysis. Notably, in vivo inhibition of glycolysis enhanced the competitive repopulation ability of primed HSCs. We further show that HSC quiescence is maintained by an abundance of large lysosomes. Repression of lysosomal activation in HSCs led to further enlargement of lysosomes while suppressing glucose uptake. This also induced increased lysosomal sequestration of mitochondria and enhanced the competitive repopulation ability of primed HSCs by over 90-fold in vivo. These findings show that restraining lysosomal activity preserves HSC quiescence and potency and may be therapeutically relevant.

Bone marrow transplantation is curative in many blood disorders as well as in disorders of other origin, including solid tumors (Huang and Broxmeyer, 2019Huang X. Broxmeyer H.E. Progress towards improving homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells for clinical transplantation.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2019; 26: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A major limitation of bone marrow transplantation is the scarcity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and challenges associated with the maintenance and expansion of HSCs ex vivo for therapeutic purposes. HSCs have a unique property to maintain blood homeostasis and generate billions of cells daily throughout life (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). This potential is sustained through the capacity of HSCs to self-renew. HSCs also generate blood in response to loss or damage as it occurs with hemorrhage or infection (Seita and Weissman, 2010Seita J. Weissman I.L. Hematopoietic stem cell: self-renewal versus differentiation.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Syst. Biol. Med. 2010; 2: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). HSC functions are measured by their ability to restore all blood lineages in lethally irradiated mice (Till and McCULLOCH, 1961Till J.E. McCULLOCH E.A. A direct measurement of the radiation sensitivity of normal mouse bone marrow cells.Radiat. Res. 1961; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). Despite their immense in vivo repopulating capacity, HSCs remain quiescent for most of their lifetime, a feature shared with most adult stem cells (Bigarella et al., 2014Bigarella C.L. Liang R. Ghaffari S. Stem cells and the impact of ROS signaling.Development. 2014; 141: 4206-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Chandel et al., 2016Chandel N.S. Jasper H. Ho T.T. Passegué E. Metabolic regulation of stem cell function in tissue homeostasis and organismal ageing.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Quiescence is proposed to protect HSCs from replicative and metabolic stress that would otherwise alter their health and longevity. Quiescence that is best evidenced by tracking histone 2B-green fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP) label retention (Qiu et al., 2014Qiu J. Papatsenko D. Niu X. Schaniel C. Moore K.

Takizawa H. Suda T. The analysis, roles and regulation of quiescence in hematopoietic stem cells.Development. 2014; 141: 4656-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The underpinning mechanisms that maintain quiescence remain elusive, partly due to challenges associated with the heterogeneity of HSC populations (Dykstra et al., 2007Dykstra B. Kent D. Bowie M. McCaffrey L. Hamilton M. Lyons K. Lee S.J. Brinkman R. Eaves C.

Quiescence is intimately coupled with cellular metabolism that becomes profoundly modulated with HSC commitment (Bigarella et al., 2014Bigarella C.L. Liang R. Ghaffari S. Stem cells and the impact of ROS signaling.Development. 2014; 141: 4206-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Chandel et al., 2016Chandel N.S. Jasper H. Ho T.T. Passegué E.

However, the metabolic signature of HSC quiescence remains unresolved. It is postulated that quiescent HSCs restrict mitochondrial respiration and rely mainly on glycolysis for their maintenance (Simsek et al., 2010Simsek T. Kocabas F. Zheng J. Deberardinis R.J.

Turcotte R. Cui J. Zimmerman S.E. Pinho S. Mizoguchi T. Arai F. Runnels J.M. Alt C.

Lysosomes are a major component of organelle degradation and cellular recycling (Luzio et al., 2014Luzio J.P. Hackmann Y. Dieckmann N.M. Griffiths G.M.

To elucidate mechanisms that regulate HSC quiescence, we took advantage of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial activity (Nakamura-Ishizu et al., 2018Nakamura-Ishizu A. Matsumura T. Stumpf P.S.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and confirmed that the majority (~75%) of phenotypically defined HSCs (LSKCD150+CD48−) contain active mitochondria (primed HSCs). Using a combinatorial approach that includes single-cell transcriptomics and high-resolution confocal imaging, we show that most if not all defining properties of HSCs, including self-renewal, segregate with the minor (<25%) subpopulation that displays relatively low mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; quiescent HSCs). We further uncover the molecular signature of quiescence in primary HSCs. We show that primed MMP-high rather than quiescent MMP-low HSCs rely mainly on glycolysis as their source of energy. On the other hand, MMP-low HSCs are enriched in relatively large lysosomes that maintain their quiescence. We show that the disruption of lysosomal activation enhances HSCs’ quiescence and the in vivo potency in primed HSCs. Our studies suggest that HSCs are metabolically heterogeneous and that curbing lysosomal activation is key in maintaining HSC quiescence and function. Mitochondrial activity in HSCs was measured using the cationic fluorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). As previously observed (Rimmelé et al., 2015Rimmelé P. Liang R. Bigarella C.L. Kocabas F. Xie J. Serasinghe M.N. Chipuk J. Sadek H. Zhang C.C. Ghaffari S. Mitochondrial metabolism in hematopoietic stem cells requires functional FOXO3.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), MMP and ROS levels, which are positively correlated with mitochondrial activity, were higher in more downstream multipotent progenitors (Lin−Sca1+cKit+ [LSK] and Lin−/CD48−) than in phenotypically defined HSCs (LSKCD150+CD48−) with the ability to repopulate blood in a lethally irradiated mouse for a long period of time (referred to as HSCs; Figure S1A, top panels). Notably, HSCs with similar low ROS levels were heterogeneous in their mitochondrial activity (Figures S1A, middle and bottom panels, and Figure S1B). Within the phenotypically defined HSCs, two distinct fractions were apparent, with a majority (~75%) of HSCs displaying (on average 6 times) greater levels of TMRE (MMP-high) than the rest of the HSC population (MMP-low). The MMP-low fraction reflected lesser accumulation of TMRE rather than enhanced efflux of HSCs (Figure S1C). As anticipated (Kim et al., 1998Kim M. Cooper D.D. Hayes S.F. Spangrude G.J. Rhodamine-123 staining in hematopoietic stem cells of young mice indicates mitochondrial activation rather than dye efflux.Blood. 1998; 91: 4106-4117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of the multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP) with verapamil did not modulate significantly TMRE levels or the proportion of MMP-low HSCs (Figure S1C). These observations confirm (Rimmelé et al., 2015Rimmelé P. Liang R. Bigarella C.L. Kocabas F. Xie J. Serasinghe M.N. Chipuk J. Sadek H. Zhang C.C. Ghaffari S.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that the phenotypically defined bone marrow HSC compartment contains metabolically diverse subpopulations with distinct mitochondrial activity that are not discriminated by their ROS levels. HSCs within the lowest MMP levels (the bottom ~25%) were 2.7-fold enriched in long-term-culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) with the ability to generate colonies in vitro as compared to MMP-high (the top ~25%) HSCs (Figure S1D). The frequency of competitive repopulating units was also 3.7-fold greater within the MMP-low than MMP-high fraction of HSCs at 16 weeks post-transplantation by limiting dilution analysis (Figures S1E and S1F). Reconstitution levels were consistently more robust in MMP-low relative to MMP-high HSCs at each time point analyzed (8.3-fold higher at 20 weeks) in lethally irradiated mice transplanted with 7 or 15 purified CD45.1 HSCs mixed with unfractionated CD45.2 (2 × 105) competitors (Figure S1F). Self-renewing HSCs were also detected more robustly in mice serially transplanted with MMP-low rather than MMP-high HSCs (Figure S1G). In fact, only 1 mouse injected with 15 MMP-high HSCs exhibited over 1% chimerism in the secondary transplant after 18 weeks compared to 6 out of 10 recipients of MMP-low HSCs (Figure S1G). Importantly, while MMP-low HSC-derived lineages were balanced in their composition, as defined previously (Müller-Sieburg et al., 2002Müller-Sieburg C.E. Cho R.H. Thoman M. Adkins B. Sieburg H.B. Deterministic regulation of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Blood. 2002; 100: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), up to 20 weeks post-transplantation, MMP-high HSCs were myeloid biased (Figure S2A). MMP-high HSCs did not produce a sufficient number of mice with over 1% chimerism in the secondary transplants for lineage analysis (Figure S2B). The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR; Figure S2C), an HSC marker independent of mitochondrial activity (Balazs et al., 2006Balazs A.B. Fabian A.J. Esmon C.T. Mulligan R.C. Endothelial protein C receptor (CD201) explicitly identifies hematopoietic stem cells in murine bone marrow.Blood. 2006; 107: 2317-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), was also significantly more elevated in MMP-low rather than MMP-high HSCs and negatively correlated with TMRE intensity (Figures S2C and S2D). Conversely, EPCR+ HSCs displayed significantly less mitochondrial activity than EPCR− HSCs (Figure S2D). These findings are consistent with previous results (Sukumar et al., 2016Sukumar M. Liu J. Mehta G.U. Patel S.J. Roychoudhuri R. Crompton J.G. Klebanoff C.A. Ji Y. Li P.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and suggest that HSCs with low MMP contained the most potent in vivo competitive repopulating and self-renewing units as compared to MMP-high HSCs. We next examined the cell-cycle dynamics using a combination of pyronin Y, which marks RNA in live cells, and Hoechst, which labels DNA, together distinguishing quiescent (G0) from non-quiescent HSCs either in G1 or actively dividing in the S/G2/M phases. MMP-low fractions of HSCs were almost entirely (~90%) quiescent (G0), whereas the striking majority of MMP-high HSCs (~55%) had exited G0 (Figure 1A). Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling in vivo, we confirmed that a greater fraction of MMP-high in contrast to MMP-low HSCs was proliferating (Figure S2E). Consistent with these results, over 60% of MMP-low GFP+ HSCs cultured at the single-cell level did not divide during 60 h, while over 90% of MMP-high GFP+ HSCs divided at least once during the same period of time in culture under optimum conditions (Figure 1B). In addition, over 40% of MMP-high divided more than twice relative to less than 20% of MMP-low GFP+ HSCs. These results further supported that MMP-low HSCs are mostly quiescent in contrast to MMP-High HSCs that are primed/activated. To further address the relevance of mitochondrial activity under homeostasis, we examined HSCs that retain a pulsed H2B-GFP label (known as label-retaining HSCs) (Qiu et al., 2014Qiu J. Papatsenko D.

HSCs within the MMP-low fractions contained a significantly higher proportion of label-retaining GFP+ HSCs than the ones within the MMP-high fractions (Figure 1E). Conversely, label-retaining GFP+HSCs maintained lower MMP than non-label-retaining cells (Figure 1F). GFP+ label-retaining and non-label-retaining cells were also segregated by MMP fraction, which further suggested that a significant majority of GFP+ label-retaining cells are within the MMP-low fraction (Figure 1G). These combined data (Figure 1) reinforce the notion that mitochondrial activity distinguishes between quiescent HSCs (MMP-low; dormant) and HSCs that exit quiescence and are already activated (MMP-high; primed). These findings elicit the likelihood that quiescent (G0) (Figure 1A) and label-retaining HSCs (Figures 1C–1G) with low MMP levels are molecularly distinct from G0 and label-retaining HSCs with high MMP levels. To elucidate the potential diversity of HSC identity at the single-cell level in quiescent MMP-low versus primed MMP-high fractions, we interrogated the transcriptome using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using the Fluidigm C1 platform, a total of 122 MMP-low HSCs and 126 MMP-high HSCs deemed healthy after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) purification were subsequently sequenced (Figure 2A). A total of 224 cells were included for further analysis after the reads were mapped, processed, and filtered (>600,000 reads, >5,500 genes detected). Initial analysis confirmed segregation of MMP-low versus MMP-high HSCs (Figure 2B) and revealed significant differences in the number of genes expressed in HSCs with low (~4,849 genes) versus high MMP (~6,421 genes; p < 0.001) (Figure 2B; Table S1).

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio in identifying genes that were differentially expressed between MMP-low and MMP-high HSCs, genes expressed by less than 2 cells were first filtered out. MAST (model-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics) was then used to include only genes that were highly variable between MMP-low and MMP-high HSCs. The resulting 5,635 genes were then used for downstream analysis (Table S2) (Finak et al., 2015Finak G. McDavid A. Yajima M. Deng J. Gersuk V. Shalek A.K. Slichter C.K. Miller H.W. McElrath M.J.

Within this list, a subset of 1,868 genes differentially expressed with statistical significance between MMP fractions of HSCs were identified (Table S2). Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that genes implicated in metabolic processes as well as the negative regulation of transcription and translation, including protein maturation and mRNA processing pathways, were highly enriched in MMP-low HSCs, whereas MMP-high HSCs were enriched for anabolic pathways that support transcription, translation, and cell-cycle progression (Figure 2D; Table S2). These analyses showed that genes involved in chromatin modification, DNA replication, telomere maintenance, DNA damage repair pathways, and RNA processing as well as mitochondrial biogenesis were greatly enriched in MMP-high HSCs (Figure 2D; Table S2), in line with their active nature to sustain the integrity of their genome as they replenish downstream lineages.

An important question in neuroscience is how neurons in the brain wire up and adapt their connectivity to form functional circuits. In the cortex, circuits are typically formed of excitatory pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons that modulate the activity of pyramidal cells through local connections. Whereas many studies have focused on the emergence of excitatory synapses, the rules that govern the formation of GABAergic synapses are less well understood (De Marco García et al., 2011De Marco García N.V.

Interneuron cell types are fit to function.Nature. 2014; 505: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Among the highly heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons that provide inhibition in the cortex, Chandelier cells (ChCs) are one of the least well characterized, mainly due to their sparseness and the lack of genetic tools to label them until recently (Taniguchi et al., 2013Taniguchi H. Lu J. Huang Z.J. The spatial and temporal origin of chandelier cells in mouse neocortex.Science. 2013; 339: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yet, they display many morphological features that make them particularly good candidates for controlling both neuronal and circuit activity in the brain (Inan et al., 2013Inan M. Blázquez-Llorca L.

A specific ‘axo-axonal’ interneuron in the visual cortex of the rat.Brain Res. 1977; 136: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Although sparsely distributed throughout the cortex, ChC axons are highly ramified, resulting in the dense innervation of hundreds of neighboring pyramidal neurons, within well-defined cortical domains (Inan et al., 2013Inan M. Blázquez-Llorca L. Merchán-Pérez A. Anderson S.A. DeFelipe J. Yuste R. Dense and overlapping innervation of pyramidal neurons by chandelier cells.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A salient feature of the ChC axon is its specific targeting of the axon initial segment (AIS) on pyramidal cells (Peters et al., 1982Peters A. Proskauer C.C. Ribak C.E.

ChCs are therefore thought to exert a powerful influence on neuronal excitability, by providing direct modulation of pyramidal cell output. Indeed, abnormalities in axo-axonic synapses have been associated with developmental brain disorders such as schizophrenia (Fazzari et al., 2010Fazzari P. Paternain A.V. Valiente M. Pla R. Luján R.

Recent work has begun to shed some light on the developmental profile and wiring logic of ChCs in the cortex. The general emerging picture is that, compared to other interneurons, ChCs are delayed in all aspects of their development. Following a relatively late birth and migration into the cortex, ChC axons ramify to form stable cartridges at the AIS around the third postnatal week (Steinecke et al., 2017Steinecke A. Hozhabri E. Tapanes S. Ishino Y. Zeng H. Kamasawa N. Taniguchi H.

Lu J. Huang Z.J. The spatial and temporal origin of chandelier cells in mouse neocortex.Science. 2013; 339: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), later than the contacts formed by other cortical interneurons (Favuzzi et al., 2019Favuzzi E. Deogracias R. Marques-Smith A. Maeso P. Jezequel J. Exposito-Alonso D. Balia M. Kroon T. Hinojosa A.J. F Maraver E. Rico B. Distinct molecular programs regulate synapse specificity in cortical inhibitory circuits.Science. 2019; 363: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The formation of these contacts relies on the expression of a specific cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), which increases its expression levels during this period and is required for the formation and maintenance of axo-axonic contacts at the AIS (Tai et al., 2019Tai Y. Gallo N.B. Wang M. Yu J.R. Van Aelst L.

In addition, a recent study has shown a remarkable selectivity in the choice of postsynaptic partners, where L2/3 ChCs in the prefrontal cortex preferentially target pyramidal neurons that project to deeper nuclei such as the basolateral amygdala, rather than those that project to the contralateral hemisphere (Lu et al., 2017Lu J. Tucciarone J. Padilla-Coreano N. He M. Gordon J.A. Huang Z.J. Selective inhibitory control of pyramidal neuron ensembles and cortical subnetworks by chandelier cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1377-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, although we have a basic understanding of ChC development, we do not yet understand the activity-dependent rules that mold its distinctive wiring pattern. To date, many basic aspects of ChC physiology remain a mystery. In fact, it is still unclear how ChCs modulate neuronal output at the single-cell level. Previous work has proposed both inhibitory and excitatory (Szabadics et al., 2006Szabadics J. Varga C. Molnár G. Oláh S. Barzó P. Tamás G.

Yuste R. The enigmatic function of chandelier cells.Front. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) roles for ChC function, which may depend on the state of the network (Woodruff et al., 2011Woodruff A.R. McGarry L.M. Vogels T.P. Inan M. Anderson S.A. Yuste R. State-dependent function of neocortical chandelier cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17872-17886Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recent findings have attempted to reconcile these differences by showing that the developmental stage of the brain defines the polarity of axo-axonic synapses. Building on the notion that GABA switches from being depolarizing to hyperpolarizing during development (Ben-Ari et al., 2007Ben-Ari Y. Gaiarsa J.L. Tyzio R. Khazipov R. GABA: a pioneer transmitter that excites immature neurons and generates primitive oscillations.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1215-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), the effect of GABA released from ChCs appears to follow a similar, albeit delayed, trajectory. Whereas postsynaptic responses elicited by most GABAergic interneurons switch polarity during the first 2 postnatal weeks, ChCs in the prelimbic cortex continue to be depolarizing beyond the third postnatal week (Rinetti-Vargas et al., 2017Rinetti-Vargas G. Phamluong K. Ron D. Bender K.J. Periadolescent Maturation of GABAergic Hyperpolarization at the Axon Initial Segment.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), resulting in a developmental window where different interneuron types may modulate pyramidal cell activity in opposite directions. Although the transition in GABA polarity is a developmental milestone in circuit function, our understanding of the rules of interneuron plasticity across this switch in polarity remains incomplete. This question is all the more important when we consider that the switch in polarity of ChCs occurs in peri-adolescence (Rinetti-Vargas et al., 2017Rinetti-Vargas G. Phamluong K. Ron D. Bender K.J. Periadolescent Maturation of GABAergic Hyperpolarization at the Axon Initial Segment.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), right after the period of circuit wiring, a time where activity-dependent plasticity is thought to play an important role in the formation of stable cortical circuits (Andreae and Burrone, 2014Andreae L.C. Burrone J. The role of neuronal activity and transmitter release on synapse formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Tien and Kerschensteiner, 2018Tien N.W. Kerschensteiner D. Homeostatic plasticity in neural development.Neural Dev. 2018; 13: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we set out to uncover the rules that govern the development and plasticity of ChC axo-axonic synapses in the mouse cortex. We find that both axo-axonic synapses and their target, the AIS, are highly plastic structures, especially during development. Specifically, we followed the plasticity rules behind ChC connectivity across the developmental switch in GABA polarity. We show that axo-axonic synapse plasticity opposes the changes in the activity of the network, consistent with a model where the wiring of GABAergic synapses follows homeostatic rules that serve to stabilize brain activity, especially during development. We used a transgenic mouse line (Nkx2.1-CreER) (Taniguchi et al., 2013Taniguchi H. Lu J. Huang Z.J. The spatial and temporal origin of chandelier cells in mouse neocortex.Science. 2013; 339: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) crossed with a reporter line (Ai9) to image the development of ChC axons in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex in vivo (Figure 1A). This line labels ChCs sparsely, allowing accurate morphological reconstructions of dendritic and axonal arbors. In line with the late arrival of ChCs to the cortex, in vivo imaging of individual ChCs over many days also showed a delayed period of axonal growth that peaked within a narrow window across different cells, from P12 to P18. More surprising was the fact that the axonal arbors of individual ChCs showed a rapid transition in their morphology, generally within 2 days, from an immature state with few cartridges, to a highly complex arbor with multiple cartridges that span a well-defined cortical domain (Figures 1B and 1C). The dendrites, on the other hand, appear to develop earlier and remain largely unchanged throughout this period. Mirroring the rapid growth of the axonal arbor, imaging of fixed brain slices at different developmental periods showed that the number of postsynaptic pyramidal cells contacted by an individual ChC also increased during this window (Figures 1D and 1E). Although our data revealed that some connections between ChCs and pyramidal cells existed before P12 (∼50% connectivity on average; Figure 1E), these connections were generally weak, involving few synapses (Figures 1F–1H). Indeed, we observed an abrupt increase in the number of synapses formed onto an AIS (Figures 1F–1H) that followed the increase in axon arbor size, without any changes in AIS length (Figure 1I). In agreement with these morphological findings, we also saw a functional increase in the amplitude (Figure 1J) of GABAergic PSCs recorded from pyramidal cells in response to optogenetic stimulation of ChCs (Figures S1A–S1C) during the period of synaptogenesis, as well as a maturation of the intrinsic firing properties of ChCs themselves (Figures S1D–S1F). We conclude that there is a narrow developmental window (P12–P18) over which ChCs connect to neighboring pyramidal cells and establish a local microcircuit. We next explored the role that network activity plays in the formation and plasticity of ChC circuits in the somatosensory cortex. Using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs, specifically hM3Dq) (Urban and Roth, 2015Urban D.J. Roth B.L. DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs): chemogenetic tools with therapeutic utility.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2015; 55: 399-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) expressed in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex, we increased network activity during the window of ChC synaptogenesis by delivering the DREADD agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), from P12 to P18 (Figure 2A). This manipulation resulted in an increase in activity (verified by cfos expression, Figure S2) in both pyramidal cells that expressed hM3Dq and neighboring cells that did not (referred to as hM3Dq-network), suggesting a network-wide increase in neuronal activity. Indeed, although increases in activity were initially confined exclusively to DREADD-expressing neurons (at P12; Figures S2A and S2B), activity spread to neighboring neurons in the network by the end of the CNO treatment (at P18; Figures S2C and S2D). We found that increased activity during this period resulted in a decrease in the overall number of pyramidal neurons contacted by a single ChC (Figure 2B), a finding that highlights the role of activity in molding the connectivity of inhibitory microcircuits. In parallel to this, we found that the number of axo-axonic synapses formed by single ChCs decreased significantly in both pyramidal neurons expressing DREADDs, as well as in neighboring DREADD-negative (hM3Dq-network) pyramidal cells (Figures 2C–2G), in agreement with a network-wide increase in activity (Figures S2C and S2D). Indeed, close inspection of the levels of cfos expression in the network also showed an increase in cfos-positive ChCs (Figures S2E and S2F), suggesting that increases in the activity of pyramidal cell networks lead to the recruitment of nearby ChCs. The connectivity between ChCs and pyramidal neurons was further studied functionally. GABAergic PSCs were recorded in pyramidal cells in response to optical stimulation of ChCs expressing channel-rhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Matching the morphological decrease in axo-axonic boutons, we found that the amplitude of evoked GABAergic PSCs also decreased, whereas the failure rates of synaptic transmission increased, in line with the idea that few synapses (∼5 boutons per ChC-pyramidal cell contact; Figures 2E–2G) contribute to the postsynaptic response (Figures 2H–2K). Finally, both morphological (Figure 2B) and functional (Figure 2l) measures of connectivity decreased significantly. Although the absolute values differed in each case, this discrepancy is likely explained by the unbiased low stringency rules used to measure morphological connectivity (see STAR Methods). We conclude that ChCs are sensitive to network activity during this early period of synapse formation, decreasing their output in a hyperactive environment. Interneurons belong to a highly heterogeneous group of cells, often classified by their electrophysiological properties and the expression of specific genes (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014Kepecs A. Fishell G. Interneuron cell types are fit to function.Nature. 2014; 505: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, Lim et al., 2018Lim L. Mi D. Llorca A. Marín O. Development and Functional Diversification of Cortical Interneurons.Neuron. 2018; 100: 294-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Those that express parvalbumin (PV), for example, are typically fast spiking and comprise both basket cells and ChCs (Rudy et al., 2011Rudy B. Fishell G. Lee S. Hjerling-Leffler J. Three groups of interneurons account for nearly 100% of neocortical GABAergic neurons.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Tremblay et al., 2016Tremblay R.

Importantly, both these PV interneuron types are thought to play an important role in controlling pyramidal cell output. However, despite their similarities, they show important differences, including their axonal morphology and the targeting of distinct subcellular compartments on pyramidal cells; whereas ChCs only target the AIS, basket cells predominantly target the soma and proximal dendritic domains (Rudy et al., 2011Rudy B. Fishell G. Lee S. Hjerling-Leffler J. Three groups of interneurons account for nearly 100% of neocortical GABAergic neurons.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Tremblay et al., 2016Tremblay R. Lee S. Rudy B. GABAergic Interneurons in the Neocortex: From Cellular Properties to Circuits.Neuron. 2016; 91: 260-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We therefore also explored the effects of network activity on axo-somatic boutons to establish whether basket cells follow similar plasticity programs to ChCs. Contrary to what we observed for ChC axons, we detected an increase in the number of axo-somatic boutons onto hyperactive pyramidal cells, which likely belong to basket cells (Figures S3A–S3C). As expected from this morphological observation, the increase in axo-somatic synapses was also accompanied by an increase in spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency but not amplitude (Figures S3D–S3G) in hyperactive pyramidal cells, in agreement with previous findings (Kilman et al., 2002Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. Activity deprivation reduces miniature IPSC amplitude by decreasing the number of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors clustered at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to better understand the functional consequences of this form of developmental plasticity, we next set out to establish the properties of axo-axonic synapses at the AIS. In the context of homeostatic forms of plasticity (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, Wefelmeyer et al., 2016Wefelmeyer W. Puhl C.J. Burrone J. Homeostatic Plasticity of Subcellular Neuronal Structures: From Inputs to Outputs.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 656-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that rely on GABAergic inputs (Ma et al., 2019Ma Z. Turrigiano G.G. Wessel R. Hengen K.B. Cortical Circuit Dynamics Are Homeostatically Tuned to Criticality In Vivo.Neuron. 2019; 104: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the decrease of ChC axo-axonic synapses in hyperactive networks during development (Figures 2A–2G) is surprising. This discrepancy may be explained by recent work studying the switch in polarity of GABAergic synapses, as they transition from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing/shunting during development, along different subcellular compartments (Rinetti-Vargas et al., 2017Rinetti-Vargas G. Phamluong K. Ron D. Bender K.J. Periadolescent Maturation of GABAergic Hyperpolarization at the Axon Initial Segment.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the polarity of axo-axonic synapses at the AIS during this early period of synaptogenesis by performing voltage imaging of pyramidal neurons in acute slices obtained at P14–P18. This approach provided a readout of changes in membrane potential in responses to GABA, delivered either by local iontophoresis or by ChC stimulation without perturbation of the intracellular milieu or of the resting membrane potential of the neuron. We first carried out local GABA iontophoresis at the AIS of pyramidal neurons expressing the genetically encoded voltage indicator Ace-mNeon (Gong et al., 2015Gong Y. Huang C. Li J.Z. Grewe B.F. Zhang Y. Eismann S. Schnitzer M.J. High-speed recording of neural spikes in awake mice and flies with a fluorescent voltage sensor.Science. 2015; 350: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and grouped responses into three different categories: depolarizing, hyperpolarizing, and non-responsive (presumed shunting) (Figure 3A; see Figure S4 for voltage sensitivity). In agreement with previous findings (Rinetti-Vargas et al., 2017Rinetti-Vargas G. Phamluong K. Ron D. Bender K.J. Periadolescent Maturation of GABAergic Hyperpolarization at the Axon Initial Segment.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), GABA tended to produce mainly depolarizations at the AIS that were sensitive to GABAA receptor antagonists during this developmental period (Figures 3B and 3C). Similar experiments applying GABA onto the soma of pyramidal neurons also resulted in an overall depolarization of the membrane, suggesting there are no obvious differences in GABA polarity between the soma and the AIS at this developmental stage in somatosensory cortex. To further explore the polarity of axo-axonic synapses, we performed whole-cell patch clamping of ChCs to directly stimulate a single ChC and image voltage responses in neighboring pyramidal cells that expressed Ace-mNeon (Figure 3D). Although GABAergic postsynaptic potential responses were small (Figure 3E; note that depolarizations produce a drop in fluorescence), we saw a clear overall depolarization below baseline during the stimulation period (5 action potentials at 50 Hz) that was apparent in individual cells, as well as in the mean response across all 22 cells (Figure 3F). Our results suggest that release of GABA by ChCs causes postsynaptic depolarizations in pyramidal neurons during the early period of synaptogenesis (P12–P18). These findings have important implications for interpreting the plasticity of axo-axonic synapses. We propose that the decrease in depolarizing axo-axonic synapses during chronic elevation of network activity is a homeostatic response that aims to stabilize circuit activity in the cortex. Previous work has demonstrated that the AIS of pyramidal cells is a plastic structure that can change in length (Baalman et al., 2013Baalman K.L. Cotton R.J. Rasband S.N. Rasband M.N.

We therefore investigated whether the structure of the AIS in pyramidal neurons was altered following increased activity. Measures of the length of the AIS showed that DREADD-expressing pyramidal cells, but surprisingly not neighboring hM3Dq-network cells, had shorter AISs (Figure S5A), which were matched by a decrease in intrinsic excitability (Figure S5B), a finding that is in line with homeostatic forms of plasticity previously observed at the AIS in other systems (Evans et al., 2015Evans M.D. Dumitrescu A.S.

https://openalex.org/W3007420340,"Summary Covalent modifications to histones are essential for development, establishing distinct and functional chromatin domains from a common genetic sequence. Whereas repressed chromatin is robustly inherited, no mechanism that facilitates inheritance of an activated domain has been described. Here, we report that the Set3C histone deacetylase scaffold Snt1 can act as a prion that drives the emergence and transgenerational inheritance of an activated chromatin state. This prion, which we term [ESI+] for expressed sub-telomeric information, is triggered by transient Snt1 phosphorylation upon cell cycle arrest. Once engaged, the prion reshapes the activity of Snt1 and the Set3C complex, recruiting RNA pol II and interfering with Rap1 binding to activate genes in otherwise repressed sub-telomeric domains. This transcriptional state confers broad resistance to environmental stress, including antifungal drugs. Altogether, our results establish a robust means by which a prion can facilitate inheritance of an activated chromatin state to provide adaptive benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3008151960,"Stormwater runoff is a leading cause of nitrogen (N) transport to water bodies and hence one means of water quality deterioration. Stormwater runoff was monitored in an urban residential catchment (drainage area: 3.89 hectares) in Florida, United States to investigate the concentrations, forms, and sources of N. Runoff samples were collected over 22 storm events (May to September 2016) at the end of a stormwater pipe that delivers runoff from the catchment to the stormwater pond. Various N forms such as ammonium (NH4–N), nitrate (NOx–N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) were determined and isotopic characterization tools were used to infer sources of NO3–N and PON in collected runoff samples. The DON was the dominant N form in runoff (47%) followed by PON (22%), NOx–N (17%), and NH4–N (14%). Three N forms (NOx–N, NH4–N, and PON) were positively correlated with total rainfall and antecedent dry period, suggesting longer dry periods and higher rainfall amounts are significant drivers for transport of these N forms. Whereas DON was positively correlated to only rainfall intensity indicating that higher intensity rain may flush out DON from soils and cause leaching of DON from particulates present in the residential catchment. We discovered, using stable isotopes of NO3–, a shifting pattern of NO3– sources from atmospheric deposition to inorganic N fertilizers in events with higher and longer duration of rainfall. The stable isotopes of PON confirmed that plant material (oak detritus, grass clippings) were the primary sources of PON in stormwater runoff. Our results demonstrate that practices targeting both inorganic and organic N are needed to control N transport from residential catchments to receiving waters."

Newborns with documented Zika virus exposure during the intrauterine period who were asymptomatic at birth were followed in the first two years of life for neurodevelopment using Bayley III test. Children were classified as having normal or delayed neurodevelopment for age based on most recent Bayley III evaluation results. Eighty-four infants were included in the study. The first Bayley III evaluation was performed at a mean chronological age of 9.7±3.1 month; 13 children (15%) had a delay in one of the three domains, distributed as follow: 10 (12%) in the language domain and 3 (3.5%) in the motor domain. The most recent Bayley III evaluation was performed at a mean age 15.3±3.1 months; 42 children (50%) had a delay in one of the three domains: 4 (5%) in cognition, 31 (37%) in language, and 20 (24%) in motor performance. There were no statistical differences in Gender, Gestational Age, Birth Weight and Head Circurference at birth between children with normal and delayed neurodevelopment for age. A very high proportion of children exposed ZIKV during pregnancy who were asymptomatic at birth demonstrated a delay in neurodevelopment, mainly in the language domain, the first two years of life."
https://openalex.org/W3008544584,"Genome-wide CRISPR screens enable systematic interrogation of gene function. However, guide RNA libraries are costly to synthesize, and their limited diversity compromises the sensitivity of CRISPR screens. Using the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery, we developed CRISPR adaptation-mediated library manufacturing (CALM), which turns bacterial cells into “factories” for generating hundreds of thousands of crRNAs covering 95% of all targetable genomic sites. With an average gene targeted by more than 100 distinct crRNAs, these highly comprehensive CRISPRi libraries produced varying degrees of transcriptional repression critical for uncovering novel antibiotic resistance determinants. Furthermore, by iterating CRISPR adaptation, we rapidly generated dual-crRNA libraries representing more than 100,000 dual-gene perturbations. The polarized nature of spacer adaptation revealed the historical contingency in the stepwise acquisition of genetic perturbations leading to increasing antibiotic resistance. CALM circumvents the expense, labor, and time required for synthesis and cloning of gRNAs, allowing generation of CRISPRi libraries in wild-type bacteria refractory to routine genetic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W3006899891,"The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near São Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at ∼ 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3% of the current region’s natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, ∼ 4757 ha) and that ∼ 9% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated)."
https://openalex.org/W3006929647,"Salt marshes provide a bulwark against sea-level rise (SLR), an interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, important nursery grounds for many species, a buffer against extreme storm impacts, and vast blue carbon repositories. However, salt marshes are at risk of loss from a variety of stressors such as SLR, nutrient enrichment, sediment deficits, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances. Determining the dynamics of salt marsh change with remote sensing requires high temporal resolution due to the spectral variability caused by disturbance, tides, and seasonality. Time series analysis of salt marshes can broaden our understanding of these changing environments. This study analyzed aboveground green biomass (AGB) in seven mid-Atlantic Hydrological Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds. The study revealed that the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed had the highest average loss and the largest net reduction in salt marsh AGB from 1999–2018. The study developed a method that used Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled time series of the Landsat archive for regional analysis of salt marsh change and identified at-risk watersheds and salt marshes providing insight into the resilience and management of these ecosystems. The time series were filtered by cloud cover and the Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII). The combination of GEE enabled Landsat time series, and TMII filtering demonstrated a promising method for historic assessment and continued monitoring of salt marsh dynamics."

ADAM10 is a “molecular scissor” that proteolytically cleaves the extracellular region from >100 substrates, including Notch, amyloid precursor protein, cadherins, growth factors, and chemokines. ADAM10 has been recently proposed to function as six distinct scissors with different substrates, depending on its association with one of six regulatory tetraspanins, termed TspanC8s. However, it remains unclear to what degree ADAM10 function critically depends on a TspanC8 partner, and a lack of monoclonal antibodies specific for most TspanC8s has hindered investigation of this question. To address this knowledge gap, here we designed an immunogen to generate the first monoclonal antibodies targeting Tspan15, a model TspanC8. The immunogen was created in an ADAM10-knockout mouse cell line stably overexpressing human Tspan15, because we hypothesized that expression in this cell line would expose epitopes that are normally blocked by ADAM10. Following immunization of mice, this immunogen strategy generated four Tspan15 antibodies. Using these antibodies, we show that endogenous Tspan15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface, that ADAM10 is the principal Tspan15-interacting protein, that endogenous Tspan15 expression requires ADAM10 in cell lines and primary cells, and that a synthetic ADAM10/Tspan15 fusion protein is a functional scissor.

However, there is an urgent need to generate mAbs to all TspanC8s, to define fully their expression profiles and functional mechanisms. Moreover, it remains to be determined whether ADAM10 functions as an intimate ADAM10/TspanC8 complex or whether TspanC8s are merely modulators of ADAM10 trafficking. This study focuses on Tspan15 as a model TspanC8. Human Protein Atlas mRNA data indicate that Tspan15 is expressed within most tissue types, but only by approximately one-third of cancer cell lines, and not by most blood cell types (17Thul P.J.

The aims of this study were 2-fold: first, to develop a novel strategy for tetraspanin mAb generation to make and characterize the first Tspan15 mAbs, and second, to use these mAbs to test four hypotheses that would support the theory that Tspan15 and ADAM10 exist together as a scissor complex: 1) that endogenous Tspan15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface; 2) that ADAM10 is the principal Tspan15-interacting protein; 3) that Tspan15 expression requires ADAM10; and 4) that covalently linking Tspan15 and ADAM10 together as a single fusion protein yields a functional scissor. The majority of anti-tetraspanin mAbs have epitopes within the large extracellular loop (LEL). However, it has been traditionally difficult to make mAbs to many tetraspanins due to lack of efficacy of recombinant LELs as immunogens. Furthermore, use of tetraspanins expressed in whole cells as the immunogen is complicated by their relatively high sequence conservation between species, their relatively small size, and possible masking of mAb epitopes by larger partner proteins (22Rubinstein E. Charrin S. Tomlinson M.G. Organisation of the tetraspanin web.in: Berditchevski F. Rubinstein E. Tetraspanins. Springer, Dordrecht, Netherlands2013: 47-90Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that expression of human Tspan15 in ADAM10-knockout mouse cells would “unmask” Tspan15, allowing the generation of a mAb response in mice immunized with these cells. Thus, ADAM10-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (23Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. ADAM10 cleavage of N-cadherin and regulation of cell-cell adhesion and β-catenin nuclear signalling.EMBO J. 2005; 24 (15692570): 742-75210.1038/sj.emboj.7600548Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) stably overexpressing FLAG-tagged human Tspan15 were generated by lentiviral transduction, and cell lysates (generated using the widely used 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer) were immunoblotted with a FLAG antibody to confirm expression (Fig. 1A). Immunization of mice with these cells, and subsequent hybridoma generation, was outsourced to Abpro Therapeutics. Four positive hybridomas were identified by screening of hybridoma tissue culture supernatants by flow cytometry of WT versus CRISPR/Cas9 Tspan15-knockout Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1B). The mAbs were isotyped as IgG1κ for clones 1C12, 4A4, and 5D4 and as IgG2Bκ for 5F4 (data not shown). To investigate whether the Tspan15 mAbs might cross-react with other members of the TspanC8 family, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, or Tspan33, and whole-cell lysates were Western blotted. Tspan15 was detected by each of the four Tspan15 mAbs, but none of the other TspanC8s were detected (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the Tspan15 mAbs can co-immunoprecipitate ADAM10, human platelets were lysed in the relatively stringent 1% digitonin lysis buffer that was previously used to identify TspanC8/ADAM10 interactions (6Dornier E. Coumailleau F. Ottavi J.F. Moretti J. Boucheix C. Mauduit P. Schweisguth F. Rubinstein E.

Tspan15 immunoprecipitation followed by ADAM10 Western blotting showed that each mAb effectively co-immunoprecipitated ADAM10 (Fig. 1D). Therefore, these data validate the four new mAbs as specific mouse anti-human Tspan15 reagents capable of immunoprecipitating Tspan15/ADAM10 complexes. To determine whether our novel immunogen strategy may be useful for other tetraspanins, the same strategy was used for Tspan14, another member of the TspanC8 subgroup. This generated five mouse anti-human Tspan14 monoclonal antibodies, which were selected by flow cytometry screening of HEK-293T cells transiently overexpressing Tspan14 (Fig. S1). However, these mAbs did not detect overexpressed Tspan14 by Western blotting and did not detect endogenous Tspan14 by flow cytometry in several cell lines tested (data not shown); the selected antibodies may be low-affinity. Nevertheless, this suggests that mouse cell lines engineered to lack a tetraspanin partner are promising immunogens for the generation of antibody responses in mice to the human tetraspanin. To determine whether the Tspan15 mAbs have epitopes in the LEL, previously described Tspan15/Tspan5 chimeric GFP-tagged constructs were used in which the LELs were exchanged (15Saint-Pol J. Billard M. Dornier E. Eschenbrenner E. Danglot L. Boucheix C. Charrin S. Rubinstein E. New insights into the tetraspanin Tspan5 using novel monoclonal antibodies.J. Biol.

In flow cytometry analyses of transfected HEK-293T cells, the four Tspan15 mAbs detected the Tspan15 LEL on a Tspan5 backbone (T5-LEL15), but not the reciprocal protein (T15-LEL5) (Fig. 2A). As a control, a Tspan5 mAb detected Tspan5 LEL on a Tspan15 backbone (Fig. 2A), as reported previously (15Saint-Pol J. Billard M. Dornier E. Eschenbrenner E. Danglot L. Boucheix C. Charrin S. Rubinstein E. New insights into the tetraspanin Tspan5 using novel monoclonal antibodies.J. Biol.

To investigate whether the Tspan15 mAbs have overlapping epitopes, an antibody-binding competition assay was performed. To do this, the A549 lung epithelial cell line was preincubated with one of the Tspan15 mAbs or a negative control antibody and then incubated with Tspan15 mAbs conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 647. Flow cytometry analyses showed that all four unlabeled Tspan15 mAbs inhibited binding of each of the four labeled Tspan15 mAbs (Fig. 2B), suggesting that their epitopes are located in close proximity. Within the Tspan15 LEL, only eight of the 121 amino acid residues vary between mice and humans, all within the C-terminal half of the LEL (Fig. 2C). Because none of the Tspan15 mAbs detected mouse Tspan15 by Western blotting (Fig. 2D), this suggested that some of the differing residues were important for antibody binding. To determine which were important, four FLAG-tagged Tspan15 human/mouse chimeric constructs were made by substituting residues within the LEL of human Tspan15 with the corresponding mouse residues (Fig. 2C), an approach that we used previously to epitope-map mAbs to tetraspanin CD53 (24Tomlinson M.G.

Wright M.D. Characterization of mouse CD53: epitope mapping, cellular distribution and induction by T cell receptor engagement during repertoire selection.Eur. J.

Western blotting of lysates from transfected Tspan15-knockout HEK-293T cells showed that reactivity of all four Tspan15 mAbs was almost completely lost by changing residues FSV to LNA but was unaffected in the three other chimeras (Fig. 2D). However, the human FSV sequence was not sufficient for recognition, because introduction of these residues into mouse Tspan15 did not enable recognition by the four Tspan15 mAbs (Fig. 2D). To gain further insights into the antibody-binding region, a Tspan15 model structure was generated, based on the crystal structure of CD81 (5Zimmerman B. Kelly B. McMillan B.J. Seegar T.C.M. Dror R.O. Kruse A.C. Blacklow S.C. Crystal structure of a full-length human tetraspanin reveals a cholesterol-binding pocket.Cell. 2016; 167 (27881302): 1041-1051.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.09.056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This model suggested that the critical FSV sequence is close to the top of the Tspan15 molecule, adjacent to a predicted α helix in the variable region (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, the mAbs detected overexpressed mouse Tspan15 by flow cytometry, and clones 1C12 and 4A4 were more effective than 5D4 and 5F4 (Fig. S2). This contrasts with their complete lack of reactivity to mouse Tspan15 by Western blotting (Fig. 2D), but nevertheless demonstrates at least some affinity for the mouse protein. Taken together, these data identify the FSV sequence in the LEL as an important component of the epitope for all four mAbs, but there may be subtle differences in epitopes for each one. To test whether the four Tspan15 mAbs modulate Tspan15/ADAM10 activity, their effects on VE-cadherin cleavage were assessed in transfected HEK-293T cells. This assay was chosen because VE-cadherin cleavage was strikingly dependent on Tspan15 in this transfection system following ADAM10 activation with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Fig. 3A), even though we have previously reported no such dependence on Tspan15 for endogenous VE-cadherin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (14Reyat J.S. Chimen M. Noy P.J. Szyroka J. Rainger G.E. Tomlinson M.G. ADAM10-interacting tetraspanins Tspan5 and Tspan17 regulate VE-cadherin expression and promote T lymphocyte transmigration.J. Immunol. 2017; 199 (28600292): 666-67610.4049/jimmunol.1600713Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tspan15 mAbs 1C12 and 4A4 at 10 μg/ml inhibited VE-cadherin cleavage by ∼50%, and a titration effect was observed with lower concentrations (Fig. 3, Bi and Bii). In contrast, mAbs 5D4 and 5F4 had no effect (Fig. 3, Biii and Biv). The reason for the different effects of the mAbs is not known, but it could be related to subtle differences in epitope, given that 1C12 and 4A4 more efficiently detected mouse Tspan15 by flow cytometry (Fig. S2). Nevertheless, these data show that certain Tspan15 mAbs can inhibit ADAM10/Tspan15 activity. Epitope-tagged Tspan15 is known to co-localize with ADAM10 in transfected cells (6Dornier E. Coumailleau F. Ottavi J.F. Moretti J. Boucheix C. Mauduit P. Schweisguth F. Rubinstein E.

To address this, endogenous Tspan15 and ADAM10 were visualized on the surface of A549 cells by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Tspan15 showed substantial co-localization with ADAM10, in contrast to the non-TspanC8 tetraspanin CD9, which was used as a control (Fig. 4Ai). Quantitation of the imaging data using Manders' coefficient showed that significantly more of the Tspan15/ADAM10 overlapping signal was present within total ADAM10 signal compared to the proportion of CD9/ADAM10 overlapping signal within total ADAM10 signal (M1) (Fig. 4Aii). Consistent with this, significantly more of the Tspan15/ADAM10 signal was present within total Tspan15 signal than CD9/ADAM10 was within total CD9 signal (M2) (Fig. 4Aii). In addition, significantly more of the Tspan15/ADAM10 overlapping signal was within total Tspan15 (M2), than was within total ADAM10 (M1) (Fig. 4Aii). This is consistent with the expression of other TspanC8s in A549 cells (7Haining E.J. Yang J. Bailey R.L. Khan K. Collier R. Tsai S. Watson S.P. Frampton J. Garcia P. Tomlinson M.G.

Stoddard et al. now show that Glk1 polymers are structurally distinct from actin filaments and suggest that polymerization of Glk1 evolved independently of the polymerization of other actin-like polymers. Glk1 polymerization inhibits its hexokinase activity, and the monomerpolymer equilibrium appears to set a maximum rate for the entire enzyme pool rather than a maximum rate per enzyme. This inhibition was found to be important for cell viability in the context of nutrient shifts, allowing yeast cells to modulate their metabolism rapidly in response to stochastic changes in the environment.

Zinc concentrations in wholegrain varied from 24–49 mg kg-1 and were correlated with iron concentration (r = 0.64) and grain protein content (r = 0.14). However, the correlation with yield was low (r = -0.16) indicating little yield dilution. A sub-set of 24 wheat lines were selected from 245 wheat genotypes and characterised for Zn and Fe concentrations in wholegrain and white flour over two sites and years. White flours from 24 selected lines contained 8–15 mg kg-1 of zinc, which was positively correlated with the wholegrain Zn concentration (r = 0.79, averaged across sites and years). This demonstrates the potential to exploit the diversity in landraces to increase the concentration of Zn in wholegrain and flour of modern high yielding bread wheat cultivars."

An off-target inhibition of the endogenous ligand binding to the human melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) has been suggested as a potential mechanism for clinical body weight gain following initiation of dolutegravir, an INSTI. In this study, we interrogated several INSTIs for their capacity for antagonism or agonism of MC4R in an in vitro cell-based assays including at concentrations far exceeding plasma concentrations reached at the recommended dosages. Our results indicate that while INSTIs do exhibit the capacity to antagonize MC4R, this occurs at concentrations well above predicted clinical exposure and is thus an implausible explanation for INSTI-associated weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W3007100847,"The enantiomers of many chiral drugs not only exhibit different pharmacological effects in regard to targets that dictate therapeutic and toxic effects, but are also handled differently in the body due to pharmacokinetic effects. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of N-acetyl-leucine after administration of the racemate (N-acetyl-DL-leucine) or purified, pharmacologically active L-enantiomer (N-acetyl-L-leucine). The results suggest that during chronic administration of the racemate, the D-enantiomer would accumulate, which could have negative effects. Compounds were administered orally to mice. Plasma and tissue samples were collected at predetermined time points (0.25 to 8 h), quantified with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic constants were calculated using a noncompartmental model. When administered as the racemate, both the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve (AUC) were much greater for the D-enantiomer relative to the L-enantiomer. When administered as the L-enantiomer, the dose proportionality was greater than unity compared to the racemate, suggesting saturable processes affecting uptake and/or metabolism. Elimination (ke and T1/2) was similar for both enantiomers. These results are most readily explained by inhibition of uptake at an intestinal carrier of the L-enantiomer by the D-enantiomer, and by first-pass metabolism of the L-, but not D-enantiomer, likely by deacetylation. In brain and muscle, N-acetyl-L-leucine levels were lower than N-acetyl-D-leucine, consistent with rapid conversion into L-leucine and utilization by normal leucine metabolism. In summary, the enantiomers of N-acetyl-leucine exhibit large, unexpected differences in pharmacokinetics due to both unique handling and/or inhibition of uptake and metabolism of the L-enantiomer by the D-enantiomer. Taken together, these results have clinical implications supporting the use of N-acetyl-L-leucine instead of the racemate or N-acetyl-D-leucine, and support the research and development of only N-acetyl-L-leucine."
https://openalex.org/W3008928409,"Early onset, intensive and repetitive, gait training may improve outcome after stroke but for patients with severe limitations in walking, rehabilitation is a challenge. The Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is a gait machine that captures voluntary actions and support gait motions. Previous studies of HAL indicate beneficial effects on walking, but these results need to be confirmed in blinded, randomized controlled studies. This study aimed to explore effects of incorporating gait training with HAL as part of an inpatient rehabilitation program after stroke. Thirty-two subacute stroke patients with severe limitations in walking were randomized to incorporated HAL training (4 days/week for 4 weeks) or conventional gait training only. Blinded assessments were carried out at baseline, after the intervention, and at 6 months post stroke. The primary outcome was walking independence according to the Functional Ambulation Categories. Secondary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, 2-Minute Walk Test, Berg Balance Scale, and the Barthel Index. No significant between-group differences were found regarding any primary or secondary outcomes. At 6 months, two thirds of all patients were independent in walking. Prediction of independent walking at 6 months was not influenced by treatment group, but by age (OR 0.848, CI 0.719–0.998, p = 0.048). This study found no difference between groups for any outcomes despite the extra resources required for the HAL training, but highlights the substantial improvements in walking seen when evidence-based rehabilitation is provided to patients, with severe limitations in walking in the subacute stage after stroke. In future studies potential subgroups of patients who will benefit the most from electromechanically-assisted gait training should be explored."

However, the role of Hh pathway activation in lung cancers has been controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical Hh signaling pathway is activated in lung stroma by Hh ligands secreted from transformed lung epithelia. Genetic deletion of Shh , the primary Hh ligand expressed in the lung, in Kras G12D/+ ;Trp53 fl/fl autochthonous murine lung adenocarcinoma had no effect on survival. Early abrogation of the pathway by an anti-SHH/IHH antibody 5E1 led to significantly worse survival with increased tumor and metastatic burden. Loss of IHH, another Hh ligand, by in vivo CRISPR led to more aggressive tumor growth suggesting that IHH, rather than SHH, activates the pathway in stroma to drive its tumor suppressive effects—a novel role for IHH in the lung. Tumors from mice treated with 5E1 had decreased blood vessel density and increased DNA damage suggestive of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. Treatment of Kras G12D/+ ;Trp53 fl/fl mice with 5E1 and N-acetylcysteine, as a ROS scavenger, decreased tumor DNA damage, inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. Thus, IHH induces stromal activation of the canonical Hh signaling pathway to suppress tumor growth and metastases, in part, by limiting ROS activity."
https://openalex.org/W3007149650,"Cholesterol metabolism is greatly affected in fish fed plant-based diet. The regulation of cholesterol metabolism is mediated by both transcriptional factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and liver X receptors (LXRs), and posttranscriptional factors including miRNAs.

The hepatic expression of cholesterol synthetic genes, srebp-2 and miR-33a as well as miR-33a level in plasma were increased in fish fed the plant-based diet, reversely, their expression in hepatocytes were inhibited with the increasing 25-HC in vitro. However, lxrα was not affected neither in vivo nor in vitro. Our results suggest that SREBP-2 and miR-33a synergistically enhance the expression of cholesterol synthetic genes but do not support the involvement of LXRα in the regulation of cholesterol elimination. As plasma level of miR-33a appears as potential indicator of cholesterol synthetic capacities, this study also highlights circulating miRNAs as promising noninvasive biomarker in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W3008488536,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes are key regulators of intercellular communication that can be found in almost all bio fluids. Although studies in the last decade have made great headway in discerning the role of EVs in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, the bioavailability and impact of dietary EVs and their cargo still remain to be elucidated. Due to its widespread consumption and high content of EV-associated microRNAs and proteins, a major focus in this field has been set on EVs in bovine milk and colostrum. Despite promising in vitro studies in recent years that show high resiliency of milk EVs to degradation and uptake of milk EV cargo in a variety of intestinal and blood cell types, in vivo experiments continue to be inconclusive and sometimes outright contradictive. To resolve this discrepancy, we assessed the potential postprandial transfer of colostral EVs to the circulation of newborn calves by analysing colostrum-specific protein and miRNAs, including specific isoforms (isomiRs) in cells, EV isolations and unfractionated samples from blood and colostrum. Our findings reveal distinct populations of EVs in colostrum and blood from cows that can be clearly separated by density, particle concentration and protein content (BTN1A1, MFGE8). Postprandial blood samples of calves show a time-dependent increase in EVs that share morphological and protein characteristics of colostral EVs. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles by Next-Generation Sequencing gave a different picture however. Although significant postprandial expression changes could only be detected for calf EV samples, expression profiles show very limited overlap with highly expressed miRNAs in colostral EVs or colostrum in general. Taken together our results indicate a selective uptake of membrane-associated protein cargo but not luminal miRNAs from colostral EVs into the circulation of neonatal calves."
https://openalex.org/W3007356027,"Most obese patients develop hyperleptinaemia. Leptin, mainly produced by adipocytes, demonstrates a promotional role in liver fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, a key step in liver fibrogenesis, requires global reprogramming of gene expression. The remodeling of DNA methylation is a mechanism of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a principle biological methyl donor, is catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) such as MATⅡ which has been shown to promote HSC activation in vitro. This study was mainly aimed to determine the effect of leptin on MAT2A expression (the catalytic subunit of MATⅡ) in HSCs. Results showed that MAT2A knockdown reduced leptin-induced HSC activation and liver fibrosis in the leptin-deficient mouse model. Leptin promoted MAT2A expression in HSCs and increased MAT2A promoter activity. The axis of the β-catenin pathway/E2F-4 mediated the effect of leptin on MAT2A expression. Leptin-induced β-catenin signaling reduced E2F-4 expression and thus abated E2F-4 binding to MAT2A promoter at a site around −2779 bp, leading to an increase in the MAT2A promoter activity. These data might shed more light on the mechanisms responsible for liver fibrogenesis in obese patients with hyperleptinaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3008475473,"Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain PA23 is a biocontrol agent capable of protecting canola from stem rot disease caused by the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. PA23 produces several inhibitory compounds that are under control of a complex regulatory network. Included in this cascade is the PhzRI quorum sensing (QS) system, which plays an essential role in PA23 biocontrol, as well as CsaRI and AurRI, which have not yet been characterized in PA23. The focus of the current study was to employ RNA sequencing to explore the spectrum of PA23 genes under QS control. In this work, we investigated genes under the control of the main QS transcriptional regulator, PhzR, as well as those differentially expressed in an AHL-deficient strain, PA23-6863, which constitutively expresses an AiiA lactonase, rendering the strain QS defective. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 545 differentially expressed genes (365 downregulated; 180 upregulated) in the phzR mutant and 534 genes (382 downregulated; 152 upregulated) in the AHL-deficient PA23-6863. In both strains, decreased expression of phenazine, pyrrolnitrin, and exoprotease biosynthetic genes was observed. We have previously reported that QS activates expression of these genes and their encoded products. In addition, elevated siderophore and decreased chitinase gene expression was observed in the QS-deficient stains, which was confirmed by phenotypic analysis. Inspection of the promoter regions revealed the presence of “phz-box” sequences in only 58 of the 807 differentially expressed genes, suggesting that much of the QS regulon is indirectly regulated. Consistent with this notion, 41 transcriptional regulators displayed altered expression in one or both of the QS-deficient strains. Collectively, our findings indicate that QS governs expression of approximately 13% of the PA23 genome affecting diverse functions ranging from secondary metabolite production to general metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3008664682,"Introduction The benefit of reducing the time of antibiotic initiation in the emergency department (ED) for neutropenic patients is controversial and the research on the impact of antibiotic adherence to international guidelines in the ED is scarce. We aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotic timing and appropriateness on outcomes in patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) and to assess the performance of the MASCC risk-index to risk-stratify such patients in the ED. Methods We prospectively identified patients with FN who presented to our ED and assessed their Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk-index. The time to parenteral antibiotic initiation and the appropriateness of the antibiotic regimen according to international guidelines were retrospectively abstracted. The performance of the MASCC risk-index in predicting the absence of complication was assessed with sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). We investigated the effect of the time to antibiotic initiation and the appropriateness of the antibiotic regimen on the outcome (ICU admission or death) by logistic regression analyses. Results We included 249 patients. Median age was 60 years and 67.9% had hematological malignancies, 26 (10.4%) were admitted to the ICU and 23 (9.8%) died during hospital stay. Among the 173 patients at low risk according to the MASCC risk-index, 56 (32.4%) presented at least one complication including 11 deaths. The MASCC risk-index had a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.78% and 0.43%, respectively, in predicting the absence of complication and the AUC was 0.67. The time to antibiotic initiation in the ED was not associated with the outcome after adjusting for performance status and shock-index. Conversely, an inadequate ED antibiotic regimen was associated with higher ICU admission or death during hospital stay (OR = 3.50; 95% CI = 1.49 to 8.28). Conclusion An inadequate ED antibiotic regimen in patients with FN was significantly associated with higher ICU admission or death during hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W3008321270,"Avian adenoviruses (AdVs) are a very diverse group of pathogens causing diseases in poultry and wild birds. Wild birds, endangered by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation in the tropical forests, are recognised to play a role in the transmission of various AdVs. In this study, two novel, hitherto unknown AdVs were described from faecal samples of smooth-billed ani and tropical screech owl. The former was classified into genus Aviadenovirus, the latter into genus Atadenovirus, and both viruses most probably represent new AdV species as well. These results show that there is very limited information about the biodiversity of AdVs in tropical wild birds, though viruses might have a major effect on the population of their hosts or endanger even domesticated animals. Surveys like this provide new insights into the diversity, evolution, host variety, and distribution of avian AdVs."
https://openalex.org/W3007011753,"Periodontal disease, the most prevalent infectious disease in the world, is caused by biofilms formed in periodontal pockets. No specific bacterial species that can cause periodontitis alone has been found in any study to date. Several periodontopathic bacteria are associated with the progress of periodontal disease. Consequently, it is hypothesized that dysbiosis of subgingival microbiota may be a cause of periodontal disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the subgingival microbiota and the clinical status of periodontal pockets in a quantitative and clinically applicable way with the newly developed Oral Care Chip. The Oral Care Chip is a DNA microarray tool with improved quantitative performance, that can be used in combination with competitive PCR to quantitatively detect 17 species of subgingival bacteria. Cluster analysis based on the similarity of each bacterial quantity was performed on 204 subgingival plaque samples collected from periodontitis patients and healthy volunteers. A significant difference in the number of total bacteria, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedia bacteria in any combination of the three clusters indicated that these bacteria gradually increased in number from the stage before the pocket depth deepened. Conversely, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus constellatus, which had significant differences only in limited clusters, were thought to increase in number as the pocket depth deepened, after periodontal pocket formation. Furthermore, in clusters where healthy or mild periodontal disease sites were classified, there was no statistically significant difference in pocket depth, but the number of bacteria gradually increased from the stage before the pocket depth increased. This means that quantitative changes in these bacteria can be a predictor of the progress of periodontal tissue destruction, and this novel microbiological test using the Oral Care Chip could be effective at detecting dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3006908265,"The purpose of the study is to reduce the error in the pricing process of financial derivatives, as well as to obtain more accurate product values, thereby reducing transaction costs, accelerating transaction speed, establishing a larger investment scale, and enabling investors to obtain excellent returns under market conditions as much as possible. Based on the variance reduction technology, a Monte Carlo model that can effectively analyze financial prices is added to analyze price fluctuations and find the optimal holding time for users of financial derivatives, thereby reducing the risk of holding the financial derivatives. The results show that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology can significantly improve the simulation efficiency of financial derivatives pricing. In addition, the importance sampling method is used to optimize the selection, thereby making it closer to the theoretical values. The proposed method is easy to implement and has higher computational efficiency, which can ensure the financial benefits of users holding financial derivatives during the holding period. It can be seen that the Monte Carlo model-based variance reduction technology has high application value in the pricing of financial derivatives, and it is of great significance for the pricing of other products."
https://openalex.org/W3008004029,"Research into the ability to coordinate one’s movements with external cues has focussed on the use of simple rhythmic, auditory and visual stimuli, or interpersonal coordination with another person. Coordinating movements with a virtual avatar has not been explored, in the context of responses to temporal cues. To determine whether cueing of movements using a virtual avatar is effective, people’s ability to accurately coordinate with the stimuli needs to be investigated. Here we focus on temporal cues, as we know from timing studies that visual cues can be difficult to follow in the timing context. Real stepping movements were mapped onto an avatar using motion capture data. Healthy participants were then motion captured whilst stepping in time with the avatar’s movements, as viewed through a virtual reality headset. The timing of one of the avatar step cycles was accelerated or decelerated by 15% to create a temporal perturbation, for which participants would need to correct to, in order to remain in time. Step onset times of participants relative to the corresponding step-onsets of the avatar were used to measure the timing errors (asynchronies) between them. Participants completed either a visual-only condition, or auditory-visual with footstep sounds included, at two stepping tempo conditions (Fast: 400ms interval, Slow: 800ms interval). Participants’ asynchronies exhibited slow drift in the Visual-Only condition, but became stable in the Auditory-Visual condition. Moreover, we observed a clear corrective response to the phase perturbation in both the fast and slow tempo auditory-visual conditions. We conclude that an avatar’s movements can be used to influence a person’s own motion, but should include relevant auditory cues congruent with the movement to ensure a suitable level of entrainment is achieved. This approach has applications in physiotherapy, where virtual avatars present an opportunity to provide the guidance to assist patients in adhering to prescribed exercises."
https://openalex.org/W3007171087,"The microRNA miR-1 is an important regulator of muscle phenotype including cardiac muscle. Down-regulation of miR-1 has been shown to occur in left ventricular hypertrophy but its contribution to right ventricular hypertrophy in pulmonary arterial hypertension are not known. Previous studies have suggested that miR-1 may suppress transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signalling, an important pro-hypertrophic pathway but only indirect mechanisms of regulation have been identified. We identified the TGF-β type 1 receptor (TGF-βR1) as a putative miR-1 target. We therefore hypothesized that miR-1 and TGF-βR1 expression would be inversely correlated in hypertrophying right ventricle of rats with pulmonary arterial hypertension and that miR-1 would inhibit TGF-β signalling by targeting TGF-βR1 expression. Quantification of miR-1 and TGF-βR1 in rats treated with monocrotaline to induce pulmonary arterial hypertension showed appropriate changes in miR-1 and TGF-βR1 expression in the hypertrophying right ventricle. A miR-1-mimic reduced enhanced green fluorescent protein expression from a reporter vector containing the TGF-βR1 3'- untranslated region and knocked down endogenous TGF-βR1. Lastly, miR-1 reduced TGF-β activation of a (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog) SMAD2/3-dependent reporter. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-1 targets TGF-βR1 and reduces TGF-β signalling, so a reduction in miR-1 expression may increase TGF-β signalling and contribute to cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3007451538,"Experience can lead to faster exploitation of food patches through spatial learning or other parallel processes. Past studies have indicated that hungry animals either search more intensively for food or learn better how to detect it. However, fewer studies have examined the contribution of non-spatial information on the presence of food nearby to maze solving, as a parallel process to spatial learning. We exposed Cataglyphis niger ant workers to a food reward and then let them search for food in a maze. The information that food existed nearby, even without spatial information, led to faster maze solving compared to a control group that was not exposed to the food prior to the experiment. Faster solving is probably achieved by a higher number of workers entering the maze, following the information that food is present nearby. In a second experiment, we allowed the ants to make successive searches in the maze, followed by removing them after they had returned to the nest and interacted with their naïve nestmates. This procedure led to a maze-solving time in-between that displayed when removing the workers immediately after they had reached the food and preventing their return to the colony, and that of no removal. The workers that interacted upon returning to the nest might have transferred to naïve workers information, unrelated to spatial learning, that food existed nearby, and driven them to commence searching. Spatial learning, or an increase in the correct movements leading to the food reward relative to those leading to dead-ends, was only evident when the same workers were allowed to search again in the same maze. However, both non-spatial information on the presence of food that elevated search intensity and spatial learning led to faster maze solving."
https://openalex.org/W3007831634,"Providing direct health and social care services for people who exhibit behaviours that challenge can be a highly stressful occupation. Existing literature has suggested that there is a need to develop further theoretical understanding of how work related stress can be reduced in professions that consist of providing care for people who exhibit behaviours that challenge. The aim for this study was to use a Classic Grounded Theory approach to develop a theoretical framework to illustrate a common issue that could influence work related stress levels experienced when managing behaviours that challenge in health and social care settings. A series of focus groups and 1:1 semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the articulated experiences of 47 health/social care professionals who provide care for people who exhibit behaviours that challenge. This led to the development of Therapeutic Engagement Stress Theory (TEST), which illustrates that the perceived capacity to therapeutically engage with people who exhibit behaviours that challenge is an issue that can influence the levels of stress experienced by health/social care professionals. TEST provides a framework that could be applied to identify specific factors that inhibit staff to successfully deliver caring interventions for people who exhibit behaviours that challenge, and also inform bespoke support mechanisms to reduce stress in health/social care professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3007459437,"Objective To determine risk factors of severe acute maternal morbidity in women with twin pregnancies and identify subgroups at high risk. Methods In a prospective, population-based study of twin deliveries, the JUMODA cohort, all women with twin pregnancies at or after 22 weeks of gestation were recruited in 176 French hospitals. Severe acute maternal morbidity was a composite criterion. We determined its risk factors by multilevel multivariate Poisson regression modeling and identified high-risk subgroups by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, in two steps: first considering only characteristics known at the beginning of pregnancy and then adding factors arising during its course. Results Among the 8,823 women with twin pregnancies, 542 (6.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6–6.6) developed severe acute maternal morbidity. Risk factors for severe maternal morbidity identified at the beginning of pregnancy were maternal birth in sub-Saharan Africa (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.3), preexisting insulin-treated diabetes (aRR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1–4.4), nulliparity (aRR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3–2.0), IVF with autologous oocytes (aRR, 1.3, 95% CI, 1.0–1.6), and oocyte donation (aRR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–2.8); CART analysis identified nulliparous women with oocyte donation as the subgroup at highest risk (SAMM rate: 14.7%, 95% CI, 10.3–19.1). At the end of pregnancy, additional risk factors identified were placenta praevia (aRR 3.5, 95% CI 2.3–5.3), non-severe preeclampsia (aRR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9–3.2), and macrosomia for either twin (aRR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.1); CART analysis identified women with both oocyte donation and non-severe preeclampsia (SAMM rate: 28.9%, 95% CI, 19.9–37.9) and sub-Saharan nulliparous women with non-severe preeclampsia (SAMM rate: 26.9%, 95% CI, 9.9–43.9) as the two subgroups at highest risk. Conclusion In woman with twin pregnancy, rates of severe acute maternal morbidity vary between subgroups from 4.6% to 14.7% and from 3.8% to 28.9% at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy respectively, depending on the combined presence of risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3008417771,"Renal cell carcinoma comprises a variety of entities, the most common being the clear-cell, papillary and chromophobe subtypes. These subtypes are related to different clinical evolution; however, most therapies have been developed for clear-cell carcinoma and there is not a specific treatment based on different subtypes. In this study, one hundred and sixty-four paraffin samples from primary nephrectomies for localized tumors were analyzed. MiRNAs were isolated and measured by microRNA arrays. Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Consensus Cluster algorithm were used to characterize different renal subtypes. The analyses showed that chromophobe renal tumors are a homogeneous group characterized by an overexpression of miR 1229, miR 10a, miR 182, miR 1208, miR 222, miR 221, miR 891b, miR 629-5p and miR 221-5p. On the other hand, clear cell renal carcinomas presented two different groups inside this histological subtype, with differences in miRNAs that regulate focal adhesion, transcription, apoptosis and angiogenesis processes. Specifically, one of the defined groups had an overexpression of proangiogenic microRNAs miR185, miR126 and miR130a. In conclusion, differences in miRNA expression profiles between histological renal subtypes were established. In addition, clear cell renal carcinomas had different expression of proangiogenic miRNAs. With the emergence of antiangiogenic drugs, these differences could be used as therapeutic targets in the future or as a selection method for tailoring personalized treatments."

Methods In a retrospective comparative study, children aged 3–8 years old treated between 2011 and 2016, with partially accommodative esotropia with high AC/A ratio, deviation at distance of 10 prism diopters or more, and at least 1 year of follow-up, were included. Visual acuity, alternate prism and cover test, stereoacuity, biomicroscopy, and cycloplegic retinoscopy were carried out at initial, baseline visit, 6 months and 1 year after BTX injection or surgery. Main outcome variables were deviation at distance and near, improvement in stereoacuity, and percentage of success. We used multiple regression or proportional odds analysis to control for potential confounding variables. Results Of 95 patients, 84 were eligible, 48 children in group 1 and 36 in group 2. Deviation and stereoacuity were similar in the two groups at 6 months, but significantly better in the BTX group at 1 year (median distance deviation 0 prism diopters vs 5 prism diopters, p<0.01), although differences were not clinically relevant. Percentage of success was also significantly better only at 1 year (93% vs 72%, p = 0.01). Change in distance-near disparity was not significantly different in the two groups in the period of study. Conclusions Botulinum toxin could be superior to, or as effective as surgery, at middle term, in the treatment of partially accommodative esotropia with high AC/A ratio."

The objective was to describe the characteristics of the stalking campaigns experienced by men and women, their consequences, and the coping strategies adopted by the victims, as they are recorded in police case files. All the information was collected in three cities in the Northwest of Italy. Analyses were performed on 271 files classified by police officers as cases of stalking, reported by men (87, 32.1%) and women (184, 67.9%). The study revealed that men tended to let the stalking campaign last for a longer time than women before turning to the police. Procrastination had some consequences, especially in the emotional sphere, that affected the victim’s wellbeing. Moreover, the coping strategies used by men victims were not effective and even risked to hamper the work of the police officers intervening and investigating on the case."
https://openalex.org/W3007934257,"PaV1 is a pathogenic virus found only to infect Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus, a major fishing resource. P. argus is a benthic mesopredator and has a complex life history, with several ontogenetic habitat changes. Habitat characteristics and species diversity of surrounding communities may have implications for disease dynamics. This is of more concern for juvenile lobsters, which are more susceptible to PaV1 and are far less mobile than adult lobsters. We targeted a population of juvenile P. argus in a reef lagoon in Mexico, where PaV1 was first observed in 2001. Prevalence has been since irregularly assessed, but in 2016 we began a more systematic assessment, with two sampling periods per year (June and November) in three different zones of the reef lagoon. To examine the relationship between PaV1 prevalence and potential ecological determinants, we assessed habitat complexity, cover of different substrates, and invertebrate community composition in all zones during the first four sampling periods (June and November 2016 and 2017). Habitat complexity and percent cover of some substrates varied with zone and sampling period. This was the case for seagrass and macroalgae, which nevertheless were the dominant substrates. The invertebrate community composition varied with sampling period, but not with zone. Probability of infection decreased with increasing lobster size, consistent with previous studies, but was not affected by zone (i.e., variations in ecological characteristics did not appear to be sufficiently large so as to influence prevalence of PaV1). This result possibly reflects the dominance of marine vegetation and suggests that lobsters can be sampled throughout the reef lagoon to assess PaV1 prevalence. Prevalence was higher in only one of seven sampling periods (November 2017), suggesting that the pathogen has leveled off to an enzootic level."
https://openalex.org/W3007517217,"Gap-graded soils from mountain areas are often used as subgrade filling materials, but problems associated with the gap-graded soils such as large permeability, poor uniformity, and poor seepage stability have to be solved. This article proposes a new terminology “void filling ratio” to study the seepage internal stability of gap-graded soils as subgrade filling materials. Laboratory seepage tests were performed to investigate the effects of compaction degrees of coarse grains, void filling ratios, and clay contents on the internal stability. Laboratory model tests were also performed to verify the findings from the laboratory seepage tests. It was found that the internal stability increased with increase of the void filling ratios, confirmed by both laboratory seepage tests and slope model tests. The increases of both void filling ratio and the clay content were able to change the type of internal instability from piping to the transitional type of internal instability. In laboratory model tests, surface areas lost more fine particles than the deeper area did in the models, but when the void filling ratio was increased, the amount of lost fine particles was significantly reduced. Finally, it was confirmed that void filling ratio was able to effectively describe the internal stability of gap-graded soils subject to different levels of hydraulic gradient."

Design Experimental crossover study. Animals Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs. Procedure All dogs received maropitant (1 mg kg-1) intravenously under the following conditions: 1) awake with non-invasive blood pressure monitoring (AwNIBP), 2) awake with invasive blood pressure monitoring (AwIBP), 3) premedication with acepromazine (0.005 mg kg-1) and butorphanol (0.2 mg kg-1) intramuscularly followed by propofol induction and isoflurane anesthesia (GaAB), and 4) premedication with dexmedetomidine (0.005 mg kg-1) and butorphanol (0.2 mg kg-1) intramuscularly followed by propofol induction and isoflurane anesthesia (GaDB). Heart rate (HR), systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean blood pressures (MAP) were recorded before injection of maropitant (baseline), during the first 60 seconds of injection, during the second 60 seconds of injection, at the completion of injection and every 2 minutes post injection for 18 minutes. The data were compared over time using a Generalized Linear Model with mixed effects and then with simple effect comparison with Bonferroni adjustments (p <0.05). Results There were significant decreases from baseline in SAP in the GaAB group (p < 0.01) and in MAP and DAP in the AwIBP and GaAB (p < 0.001) groups during injection. A significant decrease in SAP (p < 0.05), DAP (p < 0.05), and MAP (p < 0.05) occurred at 16 minutes post injection in GaDB group. There was also a significant increase in HR in the AwIBP group (p < 0.01) during injection. Clinically significant hypotension occurred in the GaAB group with a mean MAP at 54 ± 6 mmHg during injection. Conclusion Intravenous maropitant administration significantly decreases arterial blood pressure during inhalant anesthesia. Patients premedicated with acepromazine prior to isoflurane anesthesia may develop clinically significant hypotension."

Wangata is increasing and transmission is suspected to be via a non-food source. A recent outbreak investigation of sources of S. Wangata recovered isolates from humans, domestic animals, wildlife and the environment. Here, we extend that investigation by characterising and describing the genomic determinates of these isolates. We found that Australian S. Wangata isolates from different sources exhibited similar virulence and antimicrobial resistance gene profiles. There were no major genomic differences between isolates obtained from different geographical regions within Australia or from different host species. In addition, we found evidence (low number of SNPs and identical virulence gene profiles) suggestive of an international transmission event between Australia and the United Kingdom. This study supports the hypothesis that S. Wangata is shared between different hosts in NSW, Australia and provides strong justification for the continued use of genomic surveillance of Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W3007483707,"The relationship between plant traits and species relative abundance along environmental gradients can provide important insights on the determinants of community structure. Here we bring extensive data on six key traits (specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass, seed germination rate, height, leaf proline content and photosynthesis rate) to test trait-abundance relationships in a successional chronosequence of subalpine meadow plant communities. Our results show that in late-successional meadows, abundant species had higher values for seed mass, seed germination rate, and SLA, but had lower values for height, photosynthesis rate, and leaf proline content than rarer species. The opposite patterns of trait-abundance relationships were observed for early-successional meadows. Observations of strong trait convergence and divergence in these successional communities lend greater support for niche processes compared to neutral community assembly. We conclude that species’ niches that determine plant growth (plant height and photosynthesis rate), carbon balance (SLA, photosynthesis rate), regeneration (seed mass and seed germination rate), and abiotic stress resistance (leaf proline content) under different environmental conditions have strong influence on species relative abundance in these sub-alpine meadow communities during succession."
https://openalex.org/W3007605029,"Since the real estate market reform in 1998, China's house prices have been rising. High housing prices have exerted negative impacts on labour mobility, the investment environment and resident consumption, all of which may affect the overall resource allocation efficiency and the improvement of the global value chain position of China's manufacturing industry. However, there is little research on the mechanism of the impact of housing prices on the status of manufacturing global value chain. Based on the matching data of China and the OECD-TiVA from 2005 to 2016, the parallel multiple mediator model is adopted to empirically test the transmission mechanism of housing price fluctuation on the global value chain position of China's manufacturing industry in this study using human capital level, resident consumption level, resident consumption structure, and R&D investment level as the mediating variables. This article finds that although housing price fluctuations do not have a direct impact on the global value chain position of the manufacturing industry, human capital level and resident consumption structure do have positive and negative mediating effects, respectively. Finally, we put forward some suggestions to promote the global value chain position of China's manufacturing industry, which provides useful reference for policy makers."
