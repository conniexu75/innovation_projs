https://openalex.org/W2165160175,"A large body of evidence supports the involvement of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans in physiological processes such as development and diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of HS emerges from its ability to interact and regulate the activity of a vast number of extracellular proteins including growth factors and extracellular matrix components. A global view on how protein-HS interactions influence the extracellular proteome and, consequently, cell function is currently lacking. Here, we systematically investigate the functional and structural properties that characterize HS-interacting proteins and the network they form. We collected 435 human proteins interacting with HS or the structurally related heparin by integrating literature-derived and affinity proteomics data. We used this data set to identify the topological features that distinguish the heparin/HS-interacting network from the rest of the extracellular proteome and to analyze the enrichment of gene ontology terms, pathways, and domain families in heparin/HS-binding proteins. Our analysis revealed that heparin/HS-binding proteins form a highly interconnected network, which is functionally linked to physiological and pathological processes that are characteristic of higher organisms. Therefore, we then investigated the existence of a correlation between the expansion of domain families characteristic of the heparin/HS interactome and the increase in biological complexity in the metazoan lineage. A strong positive correlation between the expansion of the heparin/HS interactome and biosynthetic machinery and organism complexity emerged. The evolutionary role of HS was reinforced by the presence of a rudimentary HS biosynthetic machinery in a unicellular organism at the root of the metazoan lineage."

ADAM17 is the main sheddase of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) to induce IL-6 trans-signaling. However, serum levels of soluble murine IL-6R were not reduced in ADAM17(ex/ex) mice, and murine ADAM17 was not the major sheddase of murine IL-6R. Shedding of murine IL-6R by murine ADAM17 was rescued in chimeric murine IL-6R proteins containing any extracellular domain but not the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human IL-6R. Apoptosis is a physiological stimulus of ADAM17-mediated shedding of human IL-6R. Even though apoptosis induced IL-6R shedding in mice, the responsible protease was identified as ADAM10. ADAM10 also was identified as protease responsible for ionomycin-induced shedding of murine and human IL-6R. However, in ADAM10-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, compensatory shedding of human IL-6R was mediated by ADAM17, but loss of ADAM10-mediated shedding of murine IL-6R was compensated by an as-yet-unidentified protease. Finally, we identified physiological purinergic P2X7 receptor stimulation as a novel inducer of murine and human IL-6R shedding solely mediated by ADAM10. In conclusion, we describe an unexpected species specificity of ADAM10 and ADAM17 and identified ADAM10 as novel inducible sheddase of IL-6R in mice and humans, which might have consequences for the interpretation of phenotypes from ADAM17- and ADAM10-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W1991744562,"In neurons, the proper distribution of mitochondria is essential because of a requirement for high energy and calcium buffering during synaptic neurotransmission. The efficient, regulated transport of mitochondria along axons to synapses is therefore crucial for maintaining function. The trafficking kinesin protein (TRAK)/Milton family of proteins comprises kinesin adaptors that have been implicated in the neuronal trafficking of mitochondria via their association with the mitochondrial protein Miro and kinesin motors. In this study, we used gene silencing by targeted shRNAi and dominant negative approaches in conjunction with live imaging to investigate the contribution of endogenous TRAKs, TRAK1 and TRAK2, to the transport of mitochondria in axons of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We report that both strategies resulted in impairing mitochondrial mobility in axonal processes. Differences were apparent in terms of the contribution of TRAK1 and TRAK2 to this transport because knockdown of TRAK1 but not TRAK2 impaired mitochondrial mobility, yet both TRAK1 and TRAK2 were shown to rescue transport impaired by TRAK1 gene knock-out. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time the pivotal contribution of the endogenous TRAK family of kinesin adaptors to the regulation of mitochondrial mobility.

https://openalex.org/W2002936592,"Triacylglycerols are stored in eukaryotic cells within lipid droplets (LD). The LD core is enwrapped by a phospholipid monolayer with phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a minor component. We demonstrate that the onset of LD formation is characterized by a change in cellular PC, PE, and phosphatidylserine (PS). With induction of differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, the cellular PC/PE ratio decreased concomitant with LD formation, with the most pronounced decline between confluency and day 5. The mRNA for PS synthase-1 (forms PS from PC) and PS decarboxylase (forms PE from PS) increased after day 5. Activity and protein of PE N-methyltransferase (PEMT), which produces PC by methylation of PE, are absent in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts but were induced at day 5. High fat challenge induced PEMT expression in mouse adipose tissue. PE, produced via PS decarboxylase, was the preferred substrate for methylation to PC. A PEMT-GFP fusion protein decorated the periphery of LD. PEMT knockdown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes correlated with increased basal triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Pemt−/− mice developed desensitization against adenosine-mediated inhibition of basal hydrolysis in adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypotrophy was observed in Pemt−/− animals on a high fat diet. Knock-out of PEMT in adipose tissue down-regulated PS synthase-1 mRNA, suggesting coordination between PE supply and converting pathways during LD biosynthesis. We conclude that two consecutive processes not previously related to LD biogenesis, (i) PE production via PS and (ii) PE conversion via PEMT, are implicated in LD formation and stability.

Cytosolic neutral lipid droplets (LD) 7The abbreviations used are: LD, lipid droplet; ADA, adenosine deaminase; CT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; EGFP, enhanced GFP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MAM, mitochondria-associated membrane; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase; PIA, ((R)-N6-[l-2-phenylisopropyl]adenosine); PL, phospholipid; PS, phosphatidylserine; TG, triacylglycerol; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; fw, forward; rev, reverse; qPCR, quantitative PCR; PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. within eukaryotic cells represent intracellular storage compartments for triacylglycerols (TG) and cholesteryl esters to bridge alimentary or metabolic gaps (1Badman M.K. Flier J.S. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2103-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Adipocytes are the body's primary depots for efficient TG storage. Upon defined stimulation of adipocytes (2Zechner R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), fatty acids are released from TG droplets to supply energy or to provide essential components for the synthesis of biological membranes. Given these important functions, LD of all cell types are considered as dynamic organelles that represent fundamental components of intracellular lipid homeostasis (3Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that LD originate from the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), contain a core of neutral lipids, and are surrounded by a phospholipid (PL) monolayer (4Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 5Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The finding that cytosolic LD in adipocytes contain at their periphery minor amounts of ER proteins such as BiP (6Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A. Blaschitz A. Graier W.F. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyrer E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and calnexin might reflect their site of origin in the ER. The primary LD proteins are so-called cage proteins, which not only stabilize LD but also protect their neutral lipid cores from unregulated degradation (7Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Several other proteins contributing to the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking or targeting (3Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), and components of the intermediate filament protein machinery, have also been shown to be associated with intracellular LD (8Liu P. Bartz R. Zehmer J.K. Ying Y.S. Zhu M. Serrero G. Anderson R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the LD protein shell and how newly formed TG enters LD (10Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the nature and architecture of the LD monolayer lags far behind. Although PC is the most abundant cellular PL, PE exhibits, among all PL, the highest relative increase during fat cell differentiation (11Kasturi R. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3559-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a specific function for PE during LD biogenesis. In addition to PC and PE, the monolayer contains a broad spectrum of minor membrane components such as ether lipids (12Bartz R. Li W.H. Venables B. Zehmer J.K. Roth M.R. Welti R. Anderson R.G. Liu P. Chapman K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and unesterified cholesterol (6Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A. Blaschitz A. Graier W.F. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyrer E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One would expect compositional similarities between ER membranes and the LD monolayer due to the origin of the PL monolayer from ER structures. However, mass spectrometric analyses of the LD monolayer PL subspecies, PC and lyso-PC, revealed differences in the fatty acid pattern compared with the parental ER membrane (4Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Whereas mono-unsaturated fatty acids are the predominant constituents of lyso-PC and PC in LD, saturated fatty acids or fatty acids with two double bonds are more highly represented in rough ER membranes (4Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this finding reflects the species of PL fatty acids in LD of distinct cell types or whether other glycero-PL classes (e.g. PE, phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol) are also differentially distributed between LD and subcellular membranes. Potentially, PL remodeling could occur close to or at the ER membrane during biogenesis of the LD monolayer. Several in vitro studies confirm that PL remodeling mechanisms are required for sprouting of nascent LD monolayers from the outer ER leaflet and/or subsequent budding of the nascent LD from the ER monolayer. Olofsson and co-workers (13Marchesan D. Rutberg M. Andersson L. Asp L. Larsson T. Borén J. Johansson B.R. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27293-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reconstructed some of the fundamental steps (14Andersson L. Boström P. Ericson J. Rutberg M. Magnusson B. Marchesan D. Ruiz M. Asp L. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Borén J. Olofsson S.O. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) of early LD biogenesis. Their results clearly demonstrate that enzyme activity of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a prerequisite for LD formation. Similar results underscoring the impact of PLD1 were obtained in 3T3-L1 cells (15Nakamura N. Banno Y. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings imply that the products of this reaction, conically shaped phosphatidic acid molecules (16Dowhan W. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. 5th Ed. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2008: 1-37Google Scholar), might represent structural tools that initiate curvatures in the ER outer leaflet when LD budding is initiated. From other studies it is apparent that PE, also conically shaped (16Dowhan W. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. 5th Ed. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2008: 1-37Google Scholar), represents another component that might initiate formation of concavely bent membranes (17Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The characterization of distinct but mechanistically related intracellular processes (e.g. biogenesis of very low density lipoproteins) indirectly supports this idea. In liver, where these lipoproteins are made, PC homeostasis is maintained by two independent pathways (18Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. 5th Ed. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2008: 213-244Google Scholar) as follows: (i) the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway, which is the primary route for synthesis of PC from diacylglycerol and activated choline, and (ii) the PE methylation pathway in which PC is produced from PE by three sequential methylation steps in a reaction catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). Previous results have shown that normal very low density lipoprotein secretion requires not only de novo PC biosynthesis (19Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fast D.G. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Verkade H.J. Fast D.G. Rusiñol A.E. Scraba D.G. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but a delicate balance between the levels of hepatic PE and PC (22Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yao Z. Fujimori K. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In line with this observation, Pemt−/− mice rapidly develop hepatic steatosis when challenged by a high fat diet (23Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Zhu X. Song J. Mar M.H. Edwards L.J. Zeisel S.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this animal model, hepatic accumulation of neutral lipids is due to a mechanistically uncharacterized defect in very low density lipoprotein secretion. A direct or indirect role for PS in LD biogenesis has no precedent in the current literature. The presence of specific PL such as PE and phosphatidic acid in biological membranes may be a prerequisite for induction of local membrane curvature of the ER. Given this potentially important structural function of PE during LD biogenesis, we reasoned that PE represents a primary component for the biogenesis and growth of intracellular LD in murine adipocytes. We report that several previously unrecognized PL remodeling events occur during LD formation. Male Pemt+/+ and Pemt−/− mice (25Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (8–16 weeks old) were fed ad libitum either regular rodent chow or a high fat diet containing 30.2% crude fat (SSNIFF® Spezialdiäten GmbH, Germany, EF R/M, E15116) for 3 weeks; adipose tissue from 45- to 50-week-old animals was used for lipolysis assays. Tissues were harvested, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and either flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until used for protein, immunoblot, and RNA analyses or used immediately for lipolysis assays. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (6Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A. Blaschitz A. Graier W.F. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyrer E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulated neutral lipids were analyzed by direct in vivo staining of neutral lipids with Nile Red and fluorescence microscopy (26Schrader M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). OP9 mouse stromal cells (kindly provided by Dr. Toru Nakano, Osaka University) were differentiated using insulin-oleate albumin complex (27Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Park C. Choi K. Bickel P.E. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For isolation of LD, 3T3-L1 adipocytes at different days of differentiation were scraped into 1 ml of cold water, and the lysate was layered on a 0.25 m sucrose/TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) as described previously (6Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A. Blaschitz A. Graier W.F. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyrer E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following radiolabeled precursors were used: [1,2-14C]ethanolamine hydrochloride (E-2388; Sigma) (55 mCi/mmol); l-[G-3H]serine (NET248; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (24.6 Ci/mmol); and [1-14C]dimethylethanolamine (ARC1626; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) (51 mCi/mmol). For 56-cm2 dishes, 5 μCi of 14C label (10 μCi for 3H label) were used. For each well of a 6-well tray, 1 μCi of 14C label (2 μCi of 3H label) were used. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with radiolabeled precursor for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 12 or 24 h. Cells cultured on 56-cm2 dishes were scraped into 1 ml of distilled water, and three dishes were pooled for isolation of lipid droplets. Lipids from cells cultured on 6- or 24-well plates were directly extracted using hexane/isopropyl alcohol (see below). For quantitation of incorporation of radiolabel, the corresponding lipids were scraped from thin layer plates (see below), transferred into scintillation mixture, and radiolabel incorporation was measured (Tri-Carb 2700 TR, Packard Instrument Co.). Lipids from cells on 6-well trays were extracted using two consecutive extractions (30 min each) with 0.5 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2; v/v). Lipids from LD or pellet membrane fractions were extracted as described previously (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The amount of TG was measured with the Triglyceride FS* kit (DiaSys, Germany), and PC was quantified with Phospholipids FS* kit (DiaSys, Germany). For quantification of phospholipids of OP9 cells, the lipid fractions were dried, solubilized in chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v), and spotted onto Silica Gel 60 plastic sheets (20 × 20 cm) (Merck). Lipid classes were separated with methyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/chloroform/methanol/potassium chloride (0.25% in H2O) (25:25:25:10:9; v/v) as mobile phase. TLC plates were sprinkled with a primuline (206865, Sigma) aerosol spray (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), and lipids were visualized with a UV lamp (366 nm) and scraped for quantification by gas chromatography. Fatty acid composition of individual PL of OP9 cells was performed by gas chromatography. Bands corresponding to individual PL were scraped from thin layer chromatography plates under argon and subjected to direct, in situ trans-esterification with BF3/MeOH in the presence of the thin layer adsorbent (29Sattler W. Reicher H. Ramos P. Panzenboeck U. Hayn M. Esterbauer H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pentadecanoic acid (10 μg in toluene) was added as internal standard, and trans-esterification was performed in the presence of 1 ml of toluene and 1 ml of BF3/MeOH (20%) at 110 °C for 60 min. Excess BF3 was eliminated by the addition of 2 ml of water, and fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into 200 μl of hexane. Two μl of organic phase were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a CP-FFAP CB column (25 m, 0.32 mm inner diameter) with a Hewlett Packard (HP) 5890 or Thermo Scientific Trace GC ultra gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a split/splitless injector. Helium was used as carrier gas; the split ratio was ∼10:1. The initial temperature (150 °C) increased to 215 °C at 2.5 °C/min with a hold at 215 °C for 10 min, and the temperature was then increased to 230 °C at 10 °C/min with a hold at this temperature for 12.5 min. Detector temperature was 300 °C, and the injector temperature was 300 °C. Concentrations of fatty acids were calculated by comparison of peak areas with internal standard (30Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Dried lipid extracts from 3T3-L1 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v) containing PC 12:0/13:0, PC 17:0/20:4, PC 17:0/14:1, PE 12:0/13:0, PE 17:0/20:4, PE 17:0/14:1, phosphatidylinositol 12:0/13:0, phosphatidylinositol 17:0/20:4, phosphatidylinositol 21:0/22:6, PS 21:0/22:6, PS 17:0/20:4, and PS 17:0/14:1 at 100 pmol each as internal standards. Chromatographic separation of lipids was performed by an Accela HPLC (Thermo Scientific) on a Thermo Hypersil GOLD C18, 100 × 1 mm, 1.9-μm column. Solvent A was an aqueous solution of 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile/2-propanol (5:2, v/v) supplemented with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The gradient was run from 35 to 70% solvent B for 4 min and then to 100% B for an additional 16 min with a subsequent hold at 100% for 10 min. The flow rate was 250 μl/min. PL species were determined by a TSQ Quantum Ultra (Thermo Scientific) triple quadrupole instrument in positive and negative ESI mode. The spray voltage was set to 2000 V (−5000 V) and capillary voltage to 35 V (−35 V). PC, PE, and PS species were detected in positive ionization by precursor ion scan on m/z 184 at 35 eV, neutral loss scan at Mr 141 at 25 eV, and neutral loss scan on Mr 185 at 25 eV, respectively, as described previously (31Brügger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Molar values were converted to PL mass values using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-2-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Mr 761.0 for PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-2-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Mr 718.0 for PE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-2-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (Mr 784.0 for PS) as conversion factors. siRNA (Qiagen, Germany) for PEMT (NM 008819) and control (AllStars Negative Control, Qiagen, Germany) were transfected to 3T3-L1 adipocytes at time points indicated in the figure legends with the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 8 × 104 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with siRNA (0.25 μm) with the following protocol: pulse voltage 1,400 V; pulse width 30 ms; pulse number 1. Cells were analyzed 72 h after transfection. RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen). In brief, tissues (1 g) were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol in a TissueLyser for 20 s at 5000 rpm, followed by a phase separation with 0.2 ml of chloroform/ml TRIzol and precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated by an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany). Reverse transcription was carried out using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1.5–3 μg of RNA after DNase I treatment with 1 unit of RQ1 (Promega) in 15 μl of reverse transcriptase reaction buffer (15 min at 37 °C). BioThermTM DNA polymerase (genXpress, Austria) was used for the PCR. Amplification of the PCR products was measured during the exponential phase of the reaction. The following primers (sequence 5′ → 3′) were used for cDNA amplification: PEMT fw (CCATTGTGTTCAACCCACTC) and PEMT rev (CTGCCCCAGTACATGGGGTT); PSS1 fw (CTCGACCTCATCCAGCCTTA) and PSS1 rev (GATCTTCCCTGTGGTGGTGT); PSS2 fw (ATTGTGGCCAGTATTTTGGT) and PSS2 rev (CTTCATGCCACAGTAGATGC); GAPDH fw (GAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATT TGGC) and GAPDH rev (GGTGGTGCAGGATGCATTGCTGACA); CTβ fw (CAGAAATGCAGCATGGACAAGGACG) and CTβ rev (GGCGCGTCTCTGATGACTTCATCCA); and hPEMT fw (CTACCTGGCCTGCTACTCTC) and hPEMT rev (CTCAATCAGCTCCTCTTGTG). RNA isolation and reverse transcription were performed as described above. RT-PCR analysis was performed in 384-well plates in a total volume of 4 μl containing 2 ng of original total RNA using the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) and validated QuantiTec primer assays (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions for Light Cycler 480 instruments. In brief, after the initial 5-min heat activation step at 95 °C, cycling conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s; combined annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. The PCR efficiency of the target and housekeeping genes was determined by cDNA dilution series prepared from an untreated sample. Results were corrected with the LightCycler relative quantification software (Roche Diagnostics). mRNA levels of PEMT (primer assay QT00109809), PSS1 (primer assay QT00159103), PSS2 (primer assay QT00162540), PSD (primer assay QT00162071), and CTβ (primer assay QT00111433) were normalized to mouse GAPDH (primer assay QT01658692) and expressed as relative ratio (ΔΔCT). All samples were assayed in duplicate, and average values were used for quantification. Full-length rat PEMT cDNA (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_013003.1) (32Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned in the vector pCI (Promega). PEMT cDNA (87 bp upstream of start codon plus 684-bp coding region, lacking the stop codon) was amplified by PCR using primers introducing EcoRI (5′-CGTCGAATTCAAGCTCTTCGAAGCC-3′) and NcoI (5′-GATGCCATGGCGCTCCTTTTGTGC-3′) sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. PCR was performed with a thermal cycler (Mastercycler gradient; Eppendorf) at an annealing temperature of 68 °C (20 s), denaturation at 94 °C (10 s), and elongation at 72 °C (40 s) for 25 cycles. The PEMT fragment was cloned into vector pIRES2-DsRed2 (Clontech) together with an EGFP cDNA fragment. EGFP was excised from vector pEGFP-1 (Clontech) and replaced DsRed2 at NcoI and NotI sites. In the final construct, the fusion site of the peptide was serine (last amino acid of PEMT)-alanine-methionine (first amino acid of EGFP). Transient transfections of 3T3-L1 and OP9 cells, grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates, using Metafectene (Biontex) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 3 μg of plasmid-DNA and 5 μl of Metafectene transfection reagent (Biontex, Germany), diluted with 50 μl of serum-free cell medium each, were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 10–20 μl of the mixture were added directly to the cell culture medium 1 h after a routine medium change. After 6 h of incubation with the plasmid-Metafectene complex, the medium was changed again. Fluorescence microscopy was performed 18–24 h post-transfections. Protein content was determined with the Coomassie Blue protein protocol from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as a standard or the BCA reagent (Pierce). PEMT assays were performed as described previously (33Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine as a substrate (Avanti Polar Lipids). Epididymal fat pads and liver were sonicated, and indicated amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 10–12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon PVDF (Millipore) membranes and probed with either rabbit anti-rat PEMT (32Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) (6Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A. Blaschitz A. Graier W.F. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyrer E. J.

Using a customized array confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope, transiently transfected cells were alternatively illuminated at 488 and 514 nm with a 150-milliwatt argon laser (34Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to excite PEMT-EGFP and Nile Red, respectively. Emission was detected at 535 nm for PEMT-EGFP and at 570 nm for Nile Red (535/30 and E570LPv2) using Metamorph 5.0 (Universal Imaging, Visitron Systems, Germany). For three-dimensional reconstruction, images were taken every 100 nm with a ×100 objective (α Plan-Fluar ×100/1.45 oil objective from Zeiss Microsystems, Germany) alternately for PEMT-EGFP and Nile Red starting at the bottom of the cell as described previously (34Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Wild type and Pemt−/− mice (chow diet) were sacrificed and tissue samples surgically excised from visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) using three visceral fat samples from each of six animals of each genotype. Fat pads (∼2–3 mg) were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% defatted BSA (Sigma) (35Zimmermann R.

Aliquots of the medium were taken at several time points and analyzed for fatty acid content using commercial kits (NEFA C, Wako Chemicals, Germany). After 180 min, fat pads were transferred into fresh medium containing 1 μm isoproterenol (Sigma) and either 1 μm PIA or 0.5 units of ADA and incubated for another 60 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, aliquots of the medium were removed and analyzed for fatty acid content. Fat pads were delipidated in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (66:33:1; v/v) for 1 h, and lysed in 0.3 n NaOH containing 0.1% SDS. Protein measurements were performed using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Values were normalized to protein content of the corresponding tissue piece (36Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D.

https://openalex.org/W2038102686,"The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here we report that Sirt1 inhibits T cell activation by suppressing the transcription of Bcl2-associated factor 1 (Bclaf1), a protein required for T cell activation. Sirt1-null T cells have increased acetylation of the histone 3 lysine 56 residue (H3K56) at the bclaf1 promoter, as well as increasing Bclaf1 transcription. Sirt1 binds to bclaf1 promoter upon T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 stimulation by forming a complex with histone acetyltransferase p300 and NF-κB transcription factor Rel-A. The recruitment of Sirt1, but not p300, requires Rel-A because blocking Rel-A nuclear translocation in T cells and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rel-A can inhibit Sirt1 binding to bclaf1 promoter. Although knockdown of either p300 or GCN5 partially suppressed global H3K56 acetylation, only p300 knockdown specifically attenuated H3K56 acetylation at the bclaf1 promoter. Lastly, knockdown of Bclaf1 suppresses the hyperactivation observed in Sirt1(-/-) T cells, indicated by less IL-2 production in CD4(+) T cells and reduced proliferation. Therefore, Sirt1 negatively regulates T cell activation via H3K56 deacetylation at the promoter region to inhibit transcription of Bclaf1."
https://openalex.org/W1981075157,"Death receptors (DRs) induce apoptosis but also stimulate proinflammatory ""non-apoptotic"" signaling (e.g. NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation) and inhibit distinct steps of DR-activated maturation of procaspase-8. To examine whether isoforms of cellular FLIP (cFLIP) or its cleavage products differentially regulate DR signaling, we established HaCaT cells expressing cFLIP(S), cFLIP(L), or mutants of cFLIP(L) (cFLIP(D376N) and cFLIP(p43)). cFLIP variants blocked TRAIL- and CD95L-induced apoptosis, but the cleavage pattern of caspase-8 in the death inducing signaling complex was different: cFLIP(L) induced processing of caspase-8 to the p43/41 fragments irrespective of cFLIP cleavage. cFLIP(S) or cFLIP(p43) blocked procaspase-8 cleavage. Analyzing non-apoptotic signaling pathways, we found that TRAIL and CD95L activate JNK and p38 within 15 min. cFLIP variants and different caspase inhibitors blocked late death ligand-induced JNK or p38 MAPK activation suggesting that these responses are secondary to cell death. cFLIP isoforms/mutants also blocked death ligand-mediated gene induction of CXCL-8 (IL-8). Knockdown of caspase-8 fully suppressed apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling. Knockdown of cFLIP isoforms in primary human keratinocytes enhanced CD95L- and TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, and JNK and p38 activation, underscoring the regulatory role of cFLIP for these DR-mediated signals. Whereas the presence of caspase-8 is critical for apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling, cFLIP isoforms are potent inhibitors of TRAIL- and CD95L-induced apoptosis, NF-κB activation, and the late JNK and p38 MAPK activation. cFLIP-mediated inhibition of CD95 and TRAIL DR could be of crucial importance during keratinocyte skin carcinogenesis and for the activation of innate and/or adaptive immune responses triggered by DR activation in the skin."

In contrast, noradrenaline and dopamine transporters and the more distantly related GABA transporter 1 relied on SEC24D for ER export. These observations demonstrate that closely related transporters are exclusive client cargo proteins for different SEC24 isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2143074742,"Large conductance, Ca(2+)-activated, and voltage-dependent K(+) (BK) channels control a variety of physiological processes in nervous, muscular, and renal epithelial tissues. In bronchial airway epithelia, extracellular ATP-mediated, apical increases in intracellular Ca(2+) are important signals for ion movement through the apical membrane and regulation of water secretion. Although other, mainly basolaterally expressed K(+) channels are recognized as modulators of ion transport in airway epithelial cells, the role of BK in this process, especially as a regulator of airway surface liquid volume, has not been examined. Using patch clamp and Ussing chamber approaches, this study reveals that BK channels are present and functional at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. BK channels open in response to ATP stimulation at the apical membrane and allow K(+) flux to the airway surface liquid, whereas no functional BK channels were found basolaterally. Ion transport modeling supports the notion that apically expressed BK channels are part of an apical loop current, favoring apical Cl(-) efflux. Importantly, apical BK channels were found to be critical for the maintenance of adequate airway surface liquid volume because continuous inhibition of BK channels or knockdown of KCNMA1, the gene coding for the BK α subunit (KCNMA1), lead to airway surface dehydration and thus periciliary fluid height collapse revealed by low ciliary beat frequency that could be fully rescued by addition of apical fluid. Thus, apical BK channels play an important, previously unrecognized role in maintaining adequate airway surface hydration."

FAPP1 is recruited to the Golgi through binding of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and a small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). Despite the critical role of FAPP1 in membrane trafficking, the molecular basis of its dual function remains unclear. Here, we report a 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the FAPP1 PH domain and detail the molecular mechanisms of the PtdIns(4)P and ARF1 recognition. The FAPP1 PH domain folds into a seven-stranded β-barrel capped by an α-helix at one edge, whereas the opposite edge is flanked by three loops and the β4 and β7 strands that form a lipid-binding pocket within the β-barrel. The ARF1-binding site is located on the outer side of the β-barrel as determined by NMR resonance perturbation analysis, mutagenesis, and measurements of binding affinities. The two binding sites have little overlap, allowing FAPP1 PH to associate with both ligands simultaneously and independently. Binding to PtdIns(4)P is enhanced in an acidic environment and is required for membrane penetration and tubulation activity of FAPP1, whereas the GTP-bound conformation of the GTPase is necessary for the interaction with ARF1. Together, these findings provide structural and biochemical insight into the multivalent membrane anchoring by the PH domain that may augment affinity and selectivity of FAPP1 toward the TGN membranes enriched in both PtdIns(4)P and GTP-bound ARF1.

https://openalex.org/W2055040993,"Insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface in fat and muscle cells is the basis for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Studies in adipocytes strongly support the following molecular mechanism for this process. Insulin-elicited phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating protein TBC1D4 (AS160) suppresses its activity toward Rab10 and thereby leads to an increase in the GTP-bound form of Rab10, which in turn triggers movement of vesicles containing GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and their fusion with the membrane. This process is expected to require the participation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to generate the GTP-bound form of Rab10, but this GEF has not hitherto been identified. The present study identifies Dennd4C, a recently described GEF for Rab10, as the primary GEF required for GLUT4 translocation. Knockdown of Dennd4C markedly inhibited GLUT4 translocation, and ectopic expression of Dennd4C slightly stimulated it. Dennd4C was found in isolated GLUT4 vesicles. This study thus identifies another key component in the machinery of GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, it provides a potential explanation for the moderate association of a variant in the Dennd4C gene with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2109997480,"HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key viral enzymatic protein acting in several viral replication steps, including integration. IN has been shown to be an unstable protein degraded by the N-end rule pathway through the host ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. However, it is still not fully understood how this viral protein is protected from the host ubiquitin-proteasome system within cells during HIV replication. In the present study, we provide evidence that the host protein Ku70 interacts with HIV-1 IN and protects it from the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination proteasomal pathway. Moreover, Ku70 is able to down-regulate the overall protein polyubiquitination level within the host cells and to specifically deubiquitinate IN through their interaction. Mutagenic studies revealed that the C terminus of IN (residues 230–288) is required for IN binding to the N-terminal part of Ku70 (Ku70(1–430)), and their interaction is independent of Ku70/80 heterodimerization. Finally, knockdown of Ku70 expression in both virus-producing and target CD4+ T cells significantly disrupted HIV-1 replication and rendered two-long terminal repeat circles and integration undetectable, indicating that Ku70 is required for both the early and the late stages of the HIV-1 life cycle. Interestingly, Ku70 was incorporated into the progeny virus in an IN-dependent way. We proposed that Ku70 may interact with IN during viral assembly and accompany HIV-1 IN upon entry into the new target cells, acting to 1) protect IN from the host defense system and 2) assist IN integration activity.

IL-33 is the ligand of ST2 and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) that triggers nuclear factor-κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and MAPK signaling. We discovered a novel short splice variant of IL-33 that was termed spIL-33. The new spIL-33 lacks exon 3 containing a proposed caspase-1 cleavage site. We isolated spIL-33 cDNA from the Huh7 human hepatocarcinoma cell line and expressed the recombinant spIL-33 protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant spIL-33 and pro-IL-33 were not cleaved by caspase-1, unlike IL-18 (IL-1F4). The recombinant spIL-33 was constitutively active, and spIL-33-induced inflammatory cytokine production was caspase-1-independent in HMC-1 and Raw 264.7 cells. The recombinant spIL-33 induced the phosphorylation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), NF-κB, p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK, and JNK in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Anti-ST2 monoclonal antibody specifically blocked the spIL-33-induced cytokine production. In this study, we identified and characterized a new IL-33 splice variant, which was a constitutively active IL-33 isoform. The existence of constitutively active spIL-33 suggests that the biological activity of IL-33 could be triggered by diverse stimulations during immune responses. Further investigation of the spIL-33 expression pattern may contribute to understanding the involvement of IL-33 in inflammatory disorders."

Tajima O. Okuda T. Tokuda N. Furukawa K. Kamerling J.P. Boons G.J. Lee Y.C. Suzuki A. Taniguchi N. Voragen A.G.J. Comprehensive Glycoscience: From Chemistry to Systems Biology.

Using a GD3-defective mutant of the SK-MEL-28 subline N1 cell (5Nakano J. Raj B.K. Asagami C. Lloyd K.O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the effects of re-expression of GD3 in N1 cells on the phenotypes of melanoma cells have been analyzed. The adaptor molecules p130Cas and paxillin were the major molecules activated and involved in the enhanced cell growth and invasion related to GD3 expression (6Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Hayashi T. Hattori T. Nakano J. Nakashima H. Okuda T. Mizutani H. Hattori H. Ueda M. Urano T. Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 3The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GEM, glycolipid-enriched microdomain. also undergoes activation under GD3 expression and is involved in the enhanced malignant properties in GD3+ transfectant cells (7Hamamura K.

All these experiments were performed by stimulating melanoma cells with FCS after serum starvation. Similar experiments have been performed using fibroblasts (8Zeng G. Gao L. Yu R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), hamster melanoma (9Birklé S. Gao L. Zeng G. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and CHO cells (10Daniotti J.L. Zurita A.R. Trindade V.M. Maccioni H.J. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the same involvement of GD3 has been reported. Opposite effects of GD3 on vascular smooth muscle cells were also reported (11Bhunia A.K. Schwarzmann G. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Moon S.K. Kim H.M. Lee Y.C. Kim C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33063-33070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of GD3 on cell adhesion were analyzed (13Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression of GD3 apparently enhanced cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and increased phosphorylation levels of adaptor molecules during adhesion (13Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggested that signals mediated via growth factor receptor(s) and those mediated via adhesion receptor integrins might converge in the vicinity of the cell membrane. In this study, the roles of Src family kinases in the enhancement of the malignant properties of melanoma cells involving GD3 expression have been examined. Although several members of Src family kinases were expressed in the melanoma cells, only Yes was functionally involved in the enhanced signaling that contributes to the malignant phenotypes of melanoma cells. Mechanisms by which Yes is activated under the influence of GD3 were extensively analyzed. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20, anti-FAK (mouse mAb IgG1), anti-paxillin (mouse mAb IgG1), anti-Yes (mouse mAb IgG1), anti-Fyn (mouse mAb IgG2b), anti-Lck (mouse mAb IgG2a), anti-Lyn (mouse mAb IgG1), and anti-flotillin-1 (mouse mAb IgG1) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-flotillin-1 (rabbit IgG, H-104), anti-p130Cas (rabbit IgG, C-20), anti-FAK (rabbit IgG, C-20), anti-c-Src (rabbit IgG, N-16), anti-c-Src (mouse mAb IgG2a), and anti-Lyn (rabbit IgG, 44) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Src family (Tyr-416, rabbit IgG) was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (Mouse TrueBlotTM ULTRA) was purchased from eBioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 555, anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488, and anti-mouse IgG3 Alexa Fluor 488 were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-GD3 mAb R24 was kindly provided by Dr. L. J. Old at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York). Protein G-Sepharose or A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Purified mouse IgG and rabbit IgG were from Millipore (Temecula, CA). RestoreTM Western blot stripping buffer was from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). Several kinds of StealthTM siRNAs against some portion of human Src, Fyn, and Yes cDNA were designed by Invitrogen, and siRNAs against p130Cas, paxillin, and FAK were designed by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). They were transfected into a transfectant line G5 and a vector control line V9 with Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As a nonspecific siRNA control, a sequence targeting firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene (X65324) 153–175 (Dharmacon Research) or StealthTM siRNA negative control Med and Low (Invitrogen) were used. Finally, selected target sequences for knockdown of Src, Fyn, Yes, p130Cas, paxillin, and FAK were as follows: Src, 5′-GGAGACAGACCUGUCCUUCAAGAAA-3′; Fyn, 5′-GAGCGACAGCUAUUGUCCUUUGGAA-3′; Yes 1, 5′-CCAAGUUCAUAUCCUGCUGGUUUAA-3′; Yes 2, 5′-GGCUGCUAAUAUUCUUGUAGGAGAA-3′; p130Cas, 5′-AACCCACAAGCUGGUGUUCAU-3′; paxillin, 5′-AAGAACGACAAGCCUUACUGU-3′; and FAK, 5′-AAGUGAAGACAAGGACAG AAA-3′. SK-MEL-28-N1 was established as described previously (5Nakano J. Raj B.K. Asagami C. Lloyd K.O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Construction of a cDNA expression vector of human α2,8-sialyltransferase (GD3 synthase) was as described previously (14Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10455-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and GD3+ transfectant cells were established by transfecting SK-MEL-28-N1 cells with the cDNA expression vectors and selecting G-418-resistant clones in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) (Sigma). The transfectant cells were screened by flow cytometry using mAb R24 (anti-GD3) and maintained in DMEM with 7.5% FCS and G418 (400 μg/ml). The cell surface expression of GD3 was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described previously (6Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Hayashi T. Hattori T. Nakano J. Nakashima H. Okuda T. Mizutani H. Hattori H. Ueda M. Urano T. Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11041-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Control samples were usually prepared using non-relevant mAbs with the same subclasses for individual mAbs. Invasion assays were performed with a Boyden chamber as described previously (6Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Hayashi T. Hattori T. Nakano J. Nakashima H. Okuda T. Mizutani H. Hattori H. Ueda M. Urano T. Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11041-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted with ice-cold PBS (100 μg/ml). 0.6 ml were then added to each filter (polyethylene terephthalate membrane, 8-μm pore size, 23.1 mm in diameter, Falcon 3093) and left to be polymerized overnight. The membrane was reconstituted with serum-free medium. The lower chamber (6-well plate, Falcon 3502) was filled with the culture medium with or without serum before the chamber was assembled. Cells (1∼8 × 105 cells/well) were added to serum-free medium in the upper chamber and incubated for 24 h. Then the cells on the surface of the filter were stained with Giemsa (Wako, Osaka) and counted under microscopy. Cells grown on a 60-well plate were incubated in the presence of BrdU for 14 h according to the instructions of the cell proliferation kit (Amersham Biosciences) and then fixed with acid-ethanol for 30 min. The cells were immunostained with anti-BrdU antibody and Alexa 546-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The BrdU-positive cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo), and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was calculated. Cells (2 × 103) were seeded in 98-well plates. An MTT assay was performed by assessing the reduction of MTT to formazan on the basis of the absorbance at 590 nm using an ELISA reader Immuno Mini NJ-2300 (System Instruments, Tokyo). 2 or 6 × 105 cells were plated in a 6- or 10-cm dish, respectively, and serum-starved for 12 h before treatment with FCS. Then, cells were treated with FCS for 0–120 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 1 mm PMSF), and then insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. Lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE using 10–15% gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-PTM membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membrane was first probed with primary antibodies. After being washed, the blots were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgGs or goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with HRP (1:2000). After washing, bound conjugates were visualized with an ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, was used as a positive control for Lyn. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal or polyclonal antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose or A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 75 min. The beads were washed five times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA) and finally resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted. Melanoma cells were plated at 70∼80% confluency in 3.5- or 6-cm cell culture dishes and were cultured overnight. They were transiently transfected with siRNAs (100 nm) of the target gene or control in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Four hours later, the Opti-MEM I medium was replaced by regular culture medium. The efficiency of knockdown against individual gene products and the effects of knockdown on the other molecules were assessed with immunoblotting 48 h after the transfection. For the invasion assay and BrdUrd assay, cells were collected 2 days after the transfection and replated for the assays. The lysates prepared from cells treated with FCS were immunoprecipitated using anti-Yes antibody, and the immunocomplexes were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA) and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 μm Na3VO4). Then, the immunocomplexes were resuspended in 20 μl kinase buffer with 2.62, 3.00, or 6.99 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) as a substrate, 1 μm ATP (Sigma), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For in vitro kinase assays in the presence of liposome-embedded GD3, GM1, or GD1a, dipalmitoylphosphatidycholine (0.5 μmol) (NOF Corp., Tokyo) and cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.5 μmol), GD3, GM1 (1, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 μg) or GD1a (5, 10, or 20 μg) were mixed in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and dried by evaporation. Then, they were dissolved in 100 μl of the kinase buffer, and liposomes were formed. An aliquot of them (3.6 μl) was added to the immunocomplexes resuspended in 21.4 μl of the kinase buffer containing 3 μg of acid-denatured enolase, 1 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. The final reaction products were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels. The bands were visualized by TyphoonTM 8600 (Amersham Biosciences). Glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEM)/raft membrane microdomains were prepared using a detergent extraction method essentially as described by Mitsuda et al. (15Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 per 15-cm dish (Greiner Bio One, Frickenhausen, Germany) and cultured up to 80% confluency, and six dishes of cells were used for each preparation. After being washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were collected, suspended in 1 ml of TNE/Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA), Dounce homogenized 20 times, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (w/v). Then, samples (2 ml) were placed at the bottom of Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). 2 ml of 30% sucrose in TNE buffer without Triton X-100 was laid on top of the samples, and 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in TNE buffer without Triton X-100 was laid on top. The samples were centrifuged at 105,000 × g in a MLS50 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16 h at 4 °C. The entire procedure was performed at 4 °C. From the top of the gradient, 0.5 ml each of fraction was collected to yield 10 fractions. Furthermore, the GEM/raft fraction was prepared using a non-detergent extraction method essentially as described by Nishio et al. (16Nishio M. Nishio M. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Ichimura A. Miyazaki H. Kusunoki S. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33368-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 per 15-cm dish and cultured up to 80% confluency, and six dishes of cells were used for each preparation. After being washed twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were scraped in 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11.0). The cells were sequentially homogenized using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a sonicator (three 20-s bursts). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate (1 ml) was then adjusted to 45% (w/v) sucrose by adding 1 ml of 90% (w/v) sucrose prepared in 2× MNE buffer (25 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The final pH of the mixture was 10.2. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying 2 ml of 35% (w/v) sucrose onto the mixture and then 1 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose. Both of these layers were prepared with MNE containing 0.25 m sodium carbonate. The samples were centrifuged at 105,000 × g in a MLS50 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16 h at 4 °C. From the top of the gradient, 0.5 ml each of fraction was collected to yield 10 fractions. The components in each fraction were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in MNE buffer, and precipitates were resolved in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4) and used for Western immunoblotting. To investigate distribution patterns of phosphorylated Yes inside/outside of GEM/rafts, antibodies on the membranes were stripped using Western blot stripping buffer for 1 h at 37 °C after immunoblotting by an anti-phospho-Src family (Tyr-416) antibody. Then, the membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h and was probed with an anti-Yes antibody. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS for 10 min) and then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. After being washed, nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. They were incubated with anti-mouse IgG1-Alexa Fluor 555 and anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse IgG3-Alexa Fluor 488 in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. The resulting staining patterns were imaged using a confocal microscope (Fluoview FV500, Olympus). To stably knock down GD3 synthase in SK-MEL-28, we used an shRNAi expression plasmid as described previously (17Ko K. Furukawa K. Takahashi T. Urano T. Sanai Y. Nagino M. Nimura Y. Furukawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6924-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After transfection of the anti-GD3 synthase shRNAi vector into SK-MEL-28 and subsequent selection with puromycin (0.4 μg/ml) (Sigma), GD3 knockdown clones were established. To analyze the band intensities in immunoblotting and the autoradiograph, bands were scanned by Adobe Photoshop CS2 or TyphoonTM 8600 and quantified using National Institutes of Health Image 1.61. Statistical significance of data were determined using Student's t test. As described previously (6Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Hayashi T. Hattori T. Nakano J. Nakashima H. Okuda T. Mizutani H. Hattori H. Ueda M. Urano T. Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11041-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), SK-MEL-28-N1 was transfected by an expression vector of GD3 synthase cDNA, resulting in the establishment of GD3+ transfectant cells G5 and G11. As shown in Fig. 1, G5 and G11 showed definite expression of GD3, whereas transfectants of the vector alone, V5 and V9, showed no GD3. In TLC, the transfectant contained 67.1% of GD3 (∼ 0.27 μg/mg wet tissue) compared with that in SK-MEL-28, as shown in the previous report (supplemental Fig. S1) (7Hamamura K. Tsuji M. Ohkawa Y. Nakashima H. Miyazaki S. Urano T. Yamamoto N. Ueda M. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A few faint bands were detected as well as GD3 bands, suggesting that a minor portion of GD3 was converted. SK-MEL-28-N1 and controls derived from it showed no band of GD3 (below 0.005 μg/mg wet tissue) in TLC, as suggested in flow cytometry. To determine the expression of Src family kinases in melanoma cells, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed with antibodies for individual Src family kinases. These results showed that the expression levels of Yes and Fyn were fairly high, whereas those of Src and Lyn were low (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression of Lck was not detected (supplemental Fig. S2). Involvement of Src family kinases in cell proliferation and invasion was analyzed by knockdown with siRNAs against individual Src family kinases. Between two siRNAs for the knockdown of Yes, highly effective siRNA (YES1) was selected (Fig. 2C). Because a single knockdown of Yes was not enough, repeated transfection of YES1 siNRA was performed, resulting in sufficient reduction of Yes protein (Fig. 2D). To examine specificity of YES1 siRNA, it was analyzed whether Fyn protein was affected by YES1. Consequently, no effect on Fyn was observed (Fig. 2E). After the transfection of individual siRNAs into GD3+ transfectant cells and GD3− vector control cells, cell proliferation and invasion activity were analyzed with the BrdUrd assay and the Boyden chamber invasion assay, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2F, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin were definitely suppressed by knockdown of Yes, although their total protein amounts were not affected in GD3+ cells. The proliferation and invasion activities were markedly reduced after knockdown of Yes in GD3+ cells (G5 and G11) (Fig. 2, G and H), whereas they showed no change by knockdown of Yes in GD3− cells (V5 and V9). On the other hand, knockdown of Fyn in GD3+ cells did not affect the phosphorylation levels of FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin (Fig. 2I). Furthermore, the proliferation and invasion activity showed no change by knockdown of Fyn (Fig. 2, J and K). (Data of Src are in supplemental Fig. S3). To clarify the position of Yes in the signaling pathway, knockdown of Yes, FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin was performed with siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, after knockdown of p130Cas or paxillin with individual siRNAs, the total amounts of p130Cas or paxillin were definitely suppressed, respectively, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Yes was not affected. After knockdown of FAK, the phosphorylation levels of Yes were partially suppressed. On the other hand, after knockdown of Yes, the phosphorylation levels of p130Cas and paxillin were strongly suppressed and that of FAK was partially suppressed (Fig. 2F). These results indicated that Yes was located upstream of p130Cas and paxillin and at an equivalent level to FAK. The time course of tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Yes in GD3+ cells and GD3− cells after FCS treatment was analyzed. Cells were treated with FCS after serum starvation for 12 h, and the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Yes were observed up to 120 min after the addition of FCS (Fig. 4, A and B). Stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of Yes in GD3+ cells than in GD3− cells was observed up to 15 min after stimulation of FCS. Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation level at Tyr-416 was already increased in GD3+ cells even before FCS treatment. Then, in vitro kinase assays were done with enolase as a substrate to determine whether GD3 enhanced kinase activity of Yes. We conducted the in vitro kinase assay using 3 μg of enolase and 1 μm ATP on the basis of the preliminary experiments (supplemental Fig. S4). The bands of autophosphorylated Yes, phosphorylated p125, and phosphorylated enolase were stronger in GD3+ cells than in GD3− cells at both 0 and 15 min after FCS treatment (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that Yes is already activated before FCS treatment, although not fully, and activated more strongly by FCS in GD3+ cells. To investigate whether expression of GD3 in melanoma cells is involved in the formation of complexes of Yes with FAK and/or p130Cas after FCS treatment, immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting was performed using lysates from GD3+ and GD3− melanoma cells during the FCS treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the band intensities of Yes coprecipitated with FAK from 0 to 120 min were generally higher in GD3+ transfectant cells. p130Cas was also associated with Yes much more in GD3+ transfectants compared with GD3− cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The presence of equivalent amounts of Yes in both types of cells was confirmed (supplemental Fig. S5). Consequently, molecular complexes consisting of Yes and FAK and/or p130Cas were formed more strongly in GD3+ cells than in GD3− cells. To clarify molecular mechanisms by which kinase activity, phosphorylation of Tyr-416, and complex formation of Yes were increased in GD3+ transfectant cells, the intracellular localization of Yes in the GEM/raft was analyzed. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of Triton X-100 extracts was performed using flotillin-1 as a marker of GEM/rafts. It was detected in fractions 2–4 (supplemental Fig. S6). Bands of Yes were found at much higher levels in GEM/raft fractions of the GD3+ cells compared with GD3− cells at time 0, whereas its bands in GEM/raft fractions were found in GD3− control cells at the same level as GD3+ transfectant cells at 30 min after FCS treatment (Fig. 6A–C). Both levels of phosphorylated Yes and ratios of phosphorylated Yes to total Yes in GEM/raft fractions were significantly higher in GD3+ transfectant cells than in GD3− control cells both at time 0 and 30 min (Fig. 6, D–F). On the other hand, ratios of phosphorylated Yes to total Yes in non-GEM/raft fractions of GD3− cells were almost equivalent to those in GD3+ cells both at time 0 and 30 min. These results suggested that Yes in GEM/raft fractions might be constitutively activated in GD3+ cells. Furthermore, similar patterns of Yes localization were observed when a non-detergent method was used for the preparation (supplemental Fig. S7). Yes colocalized with flotillin-1 only in GD3+ cells at time 0, whereas its colocalization was almost equivalent between GD3+ cells and GD3− cells 30 min after FCS treatment (Fig. 7A). Yes colocalized with GD3 in GD3+ cells as expected (Fig. 7B). These results corresponded well with those in Fig. 6. We conducted in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Yes from GD3− cells in the presence of liposome-embedded GD3 to examine effects of GD3 on the kinase activity in a membrane-like environment. The effects of direct addition of GD3 on the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Yes are shown in supplemental Fig. S8, showing some increase in its kinase activity at 1–50 μm. As shown in Fig. 8, A, C, E, and G, Yes kinase activity was higher in samples with liposome-embedded GD3 than in samples with liposome only. The effects of GD3-liposome were dose dependent, and the kinase activity of Yes was enhanced particularly at around 5 μm of GD3-liposome. On the other hand, kinase activity of Yes from GD3− cells did not change in the presence of liposome-embedded GM1 or GD1a (supplemental Fig. S9, A–D). Furthermore, kinase activity of Yes from GD3+ cells was significantly reduced in the presence of liposome-embedded GM1 (Fig. 8, B, D, F, and H). The kinase activity was particularly reduced at around 5 μm of GM1-liposome. These results suggested the possibility that kinase activity of Yes was oppositely regulated by GD3 and GM1 in the in vitro kinase assay and probably in melanoma cells. After the transfection of SK-MEL-28 with the shRNAi expression plasmid, two GD3 synthase-knockdown clones (KF10T-1 and KF10T-2) were established. A control clone transfected with PH1-RNA puro alone (VC-A) was also isolated (Fig. 9A). To clarify the effects of GD3 sy"
https://openalex.org/W2026487543,"SET domain lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) are S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the site-specific methylation of lysyl residues in histone and non-histone proteins. Based on crystallographic and cofactor binding studies, carbon-oxygen (CH···O) hydrogen bonds have been proposed to coordinate the methyl groups of AdoMet and methyllysine within the SET domain active site. However, the presence of these hydrogen bonds has only been inferred due to the uncertainty of hydrogen atom positions in x-ray crystal structures. To experimentally resolve the positions of the methyl hydrogen atoms, we used NMR 1H chemical shift coupled with quantum mechanics calculations to examine the interactions of the AdoMet methyl group in the active site of the human KMT SET7/9. Our results indicated that at least two of the three hydrogens in the AdoMet methyl group engage in CH···O hydrogen bonding. These findings represent direct, quantitative evidence of CH···O hydrogen bond formation in the SET domain active site and suggest a role for these interactions in catalysis. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis of AdoMet binding indicated that these interactions are important for cofactor binding across SET domain enzymes. SET domain lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) are S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the site-specific methylation of lysyl residues in histone and non-histone proteins. Based on crystallographic and cofactor binding studies, carbon-oxygen (CH···O) hydrogen bonds have been proposed to coordinate the methyl groups of AdoMet and methyllysine within the SET domain active site. However, the presence of these hydrogen bonds has only been inferred due to the uncertainty of hydrogen atom positions in x-ray crystal structures. To experimentally resolve the positions of the methyl hydrogen atoms, we used NMR 1H chemical shift coupled with quantum mechanics calculations to examine the interactions of the AdoMet methyl group in the active site of the human KMT SET7/9. Our results indicated that at least two of the three hydrogens in the AdoMet methyl group engage in CH···O hydrogen bonding. These findings represent direct, quantitative evidence of CH···O hydrogen bond formation in the SET domain active site and suggest a role for these interactions in catalysis. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis of AdoMet binding indicated that these interactions are important for cofactor binding across SET domain enzymes. IntroductionPost-translational modifications in proteins are now well recognized as important players in many biological processes. Among these modifications, site-specific lysine methylation by SET domain KMTs 3The abbreviations used are: KMT, lysine methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; CH···O, carbon-oxygen hydrogen bond; B3LYP, Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr; MD, molecular dynamics; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; LSMT, Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase. is known to be critical to a diverse set of processes within the nucleus, including gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage response (1Albert M.

In particular, the human KMT SET7/9 has been shown to methylate lysine residues on many histone and non-histone proteins and is now considered to be important in many cellular pathways (3Pradhan S.

Despite these studies, many aspects regarding its methyl transfer reaction mechanism remain unclear, including the possibility that unconventional CH···O hydrogen bonds participate in catalysis (6Couture J.F.

Despite their importance, experimental characterization of CH···O hydrogen bonds in proteins remains challenging. Current methods for identifying CH···O hydrogen bonds (33Cordier F. Barfield M.

These interactions were identified in x-ray crystal structures, in which C···O distances between the AdoMet methyl carbon, structurally conserved carbonyl oxygen atoms, and an invariant tyrosine were appropriate (<3.7 Å) for CH···O hydrogen bonding to occur (6Couture J.F.

These hydrogen bonds can form because the electron withdrawing character of the sulfonium cation polarizes the methyl group of AdoMet. Isothermal calorimetry demonstrated that AdoMet displays higher binding affinity to a SET domain KMT than AdoMet analogues that are incapable of forming CH···O hydrogen bonds (6Couture J.F. Hauk G.

In addition, it was postulated that the CH···O hydrogen bonds align the AdoMet methyl group in the requisite linear geometry with the substrate lysine ϵ-amine group for the SN2 methyl transfer reaction.

However, as hydrogen atoms are not observed in all but the highest resolution x-ray crystal structures, it is possible that the AdoMet methyl protons occupy positions that preclude CH···O hydrogen bond formation, despite close C···O contacts within SET domain crystal structures. Thus, the presence of CH···O hydrogen bonding can only be inferred from these structures. Here, we address the fundamental question, is there direct experimental evidence for CH···O hydrogen bonding between the AdoMet methyl group and the SET domain active site in solution?RESULTSTo probe CH···O hydrogen bonding between SET7/9 and the AdoMet methyl group, we examined the NMR chemical shift produced by the AdoMet methyl group while bound to SET7/9. To measure the bound 1H chemical shift for the AdoMet methyl group and distinguish it from resonances arising from the enzyme, we synthesized [13C]methyl-labeled AdoMet using AdoMet synthase and [methyl-13C]methioine (43Iwig D.F. Booker S.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13496-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 63Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol.

We recorded two-dimensional HSQC spectra of [methyl-13C]AdoMet in the presence of stoichiometric quantities of the unlabeled catalytic domain of SET7/9 (Fig. 1). The 1H chemical shift of the AdoMet methyl group was recorded as 3.8 ppm. This chemical shift was unusually far downfield for a methyl group and also represented a large downfield change relative to the reported chemical shift for the AdoMet methyl group free in solution (3.0 ppm) (65Seeger K. Lein S. Reuter G. Berger S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6208-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unlike 13C, downfield 1H chemical shift changes often qualitatively indicate hydrogen bond formation (23Ash E.L. Sudmeier J.L. Day R.M. Vincent M. Torchilin E.V. Haddad K.C. Bradshaw E.M.

Although this combination of techniques has been used to identify CH···O hydrogen bonds in small organic molecules (37Yates J.R. Pham T.N. Pickard C.J. Mauri F. Amado A.M. Gil A.M. Brown S.P. J. Am.

Struct. 2000; 500: 441-452Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it has, to our knowledge, not yet been applied experimentally in biological macromolecules. Using this combination of techniques, we reasoned that it should be possible to solve for the hydrogen positions and, thus hydrogen bonding patterns, of the AdoMet methyl group within the SET7/9 active site.Previous studies of CH···O hydrogen bonding in small organic molecules showed that the chemical shift calculations of hydrogen were usually accurate to 0.1 ppm of the experiment (37Yates J.R. Pham T.N. Pickard C.J. Mauri F. Amado A.M. Gil A.M. Brown S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 70Sigalov M. Vashchenko A. Khodorkovsky V. J. Org.

Chem. 2009; 47: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Error in biological molecules could arise from many sources, including but not limited to implicit solvation modeling and large or truncated molecules used in calculations. Therefore, to validate the accuracy of our calculations for the AdoMet methyl group, we first calculated the chemical shift of the AdoMet methyl group using the solution state NMR structure of free AdoMet in water. Methyl proton geometry was optimized, allowing for the appropriate number of hydrogen bonds formed in solution by the methyl group, followed by chemical shift calculation (see “Experimental Procedures” for computational details and supplemental Table S1 for a list of all chemical shifts). By averaging all three values together to reproduce the single experimental methyl resonance, the difference in chemical shift between the experimental (3.0 ppm) (65Seeger K. Lein S. Reuter G. Berger S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6208-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and calculated values was <0.1 ppm. This level of accuracy prompted us to attempt to locate the methyl protons of AdoMet within the active site of SET7/9.To compare with our experimental data, we then modeled the active site of SET7/9 using its crystal structure bound to AdoMet at 1.7 Å resolution (4Kwon T. Chang J.H. Kwak E. Lee C.W. Joachimiak A. Kim Y.C. Lee J. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hydrogens were added to this model, and the geometry of the hydrogen positions was optimized (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Chemical shifts were then calculated for the methyl group protons and averaged to a single value, as performed for free AdoMet. The geometry-optimized structure of the AdoMet methyl group shows CH···O hydrogen bond formation from the AdoMet methyl group to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-335 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of His-293, with H···O distances of 2.5 and 2.1 Å, respectively (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the C-H···O angles of 146° and 140°, respectively, are acceptable hydrogen bonding angles (16Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24: 290-296Crossref Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 17Derewenda Z. Lee L. Kobos P. Derewenda U. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1246Google Scholar, 72Sarkhel S. Desiraju G.R. Proteins. 2004; 54: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As predicted, the calculations showed that protons participating in CH···O hydrogen bonds experienced significant downfield changes in chemical shift. The proton engaged in close hydrogen bonding with His-293 had a calculated chemical shift of 5.0 ppm, whereas the proton forming hydrogen bonds with Tyr-335 had a calculated chemical shift of 3.3 ppm. The chemical shift of the third proton was calculated to be 2.6 ppm. Averaging all three values together yielded a calculated chemical shift of 3.7 ppm, which is within 0.1 ppm of the experimental value of 3.8 ppm.FIGURE 2Optimized active site with bound AdoMet (A) and manually rotated geometry (B) to eliminate CH···O hydrogen bonds. Truncated AdoMet and the protein are depicted with green and gray carbon atoms, respectively. Residues labeled in red designate CH···O acceptors. H···O distances from methyl protons to nearest oxygen atom for optimized and broken geometry are shown in magenta and cyan, respectively. The crystal structure of the SET7/9·AdoMet complex (Protein Data Bank code 1N6A) was used as the model for the calculations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm the presence of CH···O hydrogen bonding, the methyl group was rotated manually through a range of 120° (example shown in Fig. 2B), and chemical shifts were recalculated at intermediate geometries to explore whether alternative hydrogen positions could agree with the experimental data. The rotation of the AdoMet methyl group resulted in a smooth functional change in the calculated chemical shift, passing through a minimum at 36° (Fig. 3). The minimum of this plot corresponded to the structure for which the model and the experimentally measured chemical shift differed by 0.6 ppm. This difference represents the following: 1) the largest deviation between the experiment and model, 2) the most upfield of the calculated chemical shifts, and 3) the model in which the methyl rotamer forms minimal CH···O hydrogen bonds in the active site (Fig. 2B). These calculations indicated that AdoMet methyl rotamers precluding CH···O hydrogen bond formation were inconsistent with the experimental chemical shift data. All of the calculated chemical shifts that agreed closely with experimental chemical shifts represented structures that optimized CH···O hydrogen bonding for at least one AdoMet methyl hydrogen atom. Collectively, the experimental data and calculations yielded direct evidence via NMR chemical shift for CH···O hydrogen bond formation between the AdoMet methyl group and oxygen atoms within the active site of SET7/9.FIGURE 3Chemical shift of the AdoMet methyl group as a function of rotation angle. 0° and 120°, rendered in green, are equivalent geometry optimized positions (displayed in Fig. 2A), whereas all other points were derived from manual rotation of the AdoMet methyl group. The point at 36° represents the chemical shift calculated from the AdoMet methyl conformation shown in Fig. 2B. The blue and red dashed lines indicate the experimental chemical shift and the structure calculated to contain the least CH···O hydrogen bonding, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These findings prompted us to examine the thermodynamic parameters for cofactor binding by SET7/9 using ITC (see “Experimental Procedures” for experimental details). Binding affinities and enthalpies for SET7/9 were measured with AdoMet (Fig. 4), its methyl transfer product AdoHcy, and sinefungin, an AdoMet analogue in which the methyl sulfonium cation is substituted by an amine-methylene group that can participate in conventional NH···O hydrogen bonding. Crystal structures of SET7/9 and other SET domain enzymes illustrated that these cofactors share a structurally homologous binding mode (supplemental Fig. S4) (4Kwon T. Chang J.H. Kwak E. Lee C.W.

Vertino P.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 336-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The ITC data revealed that SET7/9 displayed nanomolar affinities for AdoMet and sinefungin, whereas its affinity for AdoHcy was ∼1000-fold weaker (Table 1). These data were analogous to those obtained for the binding of these ligands to the SET domain protein Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase (LSMT), demonstrating consistency in rank order of binding affinities across different SET domain enzymes (6Couture J.F. Hauk G. Thompson M.J. Blackburn G.M. Trievel R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19280-19287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, SET7/9 and LSMT displayed comparable differences in binding enthalpy between AdoMet and sinefungin (∼3 kcal/mol). The high affinity that these enzymes displayed for AdoMet is presumably due to the ability of its methyl group to engage in CH···O hydrogen bonding, emphasizing the importance of these interactions in cofactor binding by SET domain KMTs.FIGURE 4ITC analysis of AdoMet binding to SET7/9. The top panel represents the titration of AdoMet into SET7/9, whereas the bottom panel represents the binding isotherm with fitted curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe identification of CH···O hydrogen bonding between the AdoMet methyl group and oxygen atoms within the SET domain active site has implications for these interactions in lysine methyl transfer reactions. As proposed previously, CH···O hydrogen bonds appear to play roles in binding AdoMet, positioning its methyl group in an appropriate geometry for transfer, and stabilizing the SN2 transition state (6Couture J.F. Hauk G. Thompson M.J. Blackburn G.M. Trievel R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19280-19287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the CH···O hydrogen bonds confer a specific orientation for the methyl group to align it during catalysis and could potentially limit its motion within the active site. Future studies will further define the specific roles that CH···O hydrogen bonds may play in promoting the methyl transfer reaction catalyzed by SET domain enzymes.The thermodynamic analyses of SET7/9 bound to AdoMet and its analogues are consistent with previous findings on LSMT (6Couture J.F. Hauk G. Thompson M.J. Blackburn G.M. Trievel R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19280-19287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The consistency of rank order in binding affinity indicates that CH···O hydrogen bonds are important in cofactor binding by multiple KMTs due to the structural conservation of the SET domain active site. Moreover, these CH···O interactions may in part explain the importance of the evolutionarily invariant Tyr-335 to enzyme function (Fig. 2A), given the propensity of its hydroxyl group to form CH···O hydrogen bonds with the AdoMet methyl group. It is also interesting to note that the change in binding affinity between AdoMet and its analogues is substantially more dramatic in SET7/9 than in LSMT. This effect could be a function of the plasticity of the SET7/9 active site (9Xiao B. Jing C. Kelly G. Walker P.A. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Martin S.R. Sarma K. Reinberg D. Gamblin S.J. Wilson J.R. Gene Dev. 2005; 19: 1444-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), as compared with the preformed active site of LSMT (42Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Future studies may address how conformational flexibility within the SET domain family influences CH···O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet.In terms of methodology, our results have demonstrated that chemical shift can be used as a structural parameter for determining hydrogen positions and hydrogen bonding patterns within an enzyme active site. To our knowledge, these chemical shift data and calculations provide the first direct, quantitative evidence of CH···O hydrogen bonding in an enzyme active site in solution. One advantage of chemical shift as a probe to examine CH···O hydrogen bonding in biomolecular structure is the relative ease of data acquisition. In the future, this methodology could be applied broadly to characterize CH···O hydrogen bonding in proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological molecules, expanding our understanding of the functional importance of these interactions in macromolecular structure, ligand binding, and enzyme catalysis. IntroductionPost-translational modifications in proteins are now well recognized as important players in many biological processes. Among these modifications, site-specific lysine methylation by SET domain KMTs 3The abbreviations used are: KMT, lysine methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; CH···O, carbon-oxygen hydrogen bond; B3LYP, Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr; MD, molecular dynamics; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; LSMT, Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase. is known to be critical to a diverse set of processes within the nucleus, including gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage response (1Albert M.

In particular, the human KMT SET7/9 has been shown to methylate lysine residues on many histone and non-histone proteins and is now considered to be important in many cellular pathways (3Pradhan S.

Furthermore, SET7/9 has emerged as an archetype for the specificity and catalytic mechanism of the SET domain family due to multiple high resolution crystal structures, NMR analyses, and computational studies on its structure and function (4Kwon T.

These interactions were identified in x-ray crystal structures, in which C···O distances between the AdoMet methyl carbon, structurally conserved carbonyl oxygen atoms, and an invariant tyrosine were appropriate (<3.7 Å) for CH···O hydrogen bonding to occur (6Couture J.F.

These hydrogen bonds can form because the electron withdrawing character of the sulfonium cation polarizes the methyl group of AdoMet. Isothermal calorimetry demonstrated that AdoMet displays higher binding affinity to a SET domain KMT than AdoMet analogues that are incapable of forming CH···O hydrogen bonds (6Couture J.F. Hauk G.

In addition, it was postulated that the CH···O hydrogen bonds align the AdoMet methyl group in the requisite linear geometry with the substrate lysine ϵ-amine group for the SN2 methyl transfer reaction.

However, as hydrogen atoms are not observed in all but the highest resolution x-ray crystal structures, it is possible that the AdoMet methyl protons occupy positions that preclude CH···O hydrogen bond formation, despite close C···O contacts within SET domain crystal structures. Thus, the presence of CH···O hydrogen bonding can only be inferred from these structures. Here, we address the fundamental question, is there direct experimental evidence for CH···O hydrogen bonding between the AdoMet methyl group and the SET domain active site in solution?"

The short term regulation of NF-κB is well understood, but little is known about the mechanisms of its long term activation. We studied the effect of a single application of TNF-α on NF-κB activity for up to 48 h in intestinal epithelial cells. Results show that NF-κB remained persistently activated up to 48 h after TNF-α and that the long term activation of NF-κB was accompanied by a biphasic degradation of IκBα. The first phase of IκBα degradation was proteasome-dependent, but the second was not. Further investigation showed that TNF-α stimulated formation of autophagosomes in intestinal epithelial cells and that IκBα co-localized with autophagosomal vesicles. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of autophagosome formation or the inhibition of lysosomal proteases decreased TNF-α-induced degradation of IκBα and lowered NF-κB target gene expression. Together, these findings indicate a role of autophagy in the control of long term NF-κB activity.

In this study, oligopeptide arrays were used to screen substrates directly phosphorylated by purified recombinant wild-type and oncogenic RET kinase domain in the presence or absence of small molecule inhibitors. The results of the peptide array were validated by enzyme kinetics, in vitro kinase, and cell-based experiments. The identification of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a direct substrate for RET kinase revealed (i) a RET-FAK transactivation mechanism consisting of direct phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-576/577 by RET and a reciprocal phosphorylation of RET by FAK, which crucially is able to rescue the kinase-impaired RET K758M mutant and (ii) that FAK binds RET via its FERM domain. Interestingly, this interaction is abolished upon RET phosphorylation, indicating that RET binding to the FERM domain of FAK is a priming step for RET-FAK transactivation. Finally, our data indicate that FAK inhibitors could be used as potential therapeutic agents for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 tumors because both, treatment with the FAK kinase inhibitor NVP-TAE226 and FAK down-regulation by siRNA reduced RET phosphorylation and signaling as well as the proliferation and survival of tumor and transfected cell lines expressing oncogenic RET."

Signal. 2009; 2: re7Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases, a class of proteolytic enzymes under strict transcriptional and post-translational regulation, are composed of 24 members in mammals. MMPs are responsible for the degradation and turnover of extracellular matrix components. MMPs all share a common structure that consists of a signal peptide, the pro-peptide domain, and a catalytic domain containing a Zn2+ ion at the active site (16Ra H.J. Parks W.C. Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In general, MMPs are secreted as zymogens and are maintained in a latent state until activated. Latency is maintained by a covalent thiol-Zn2+ interaction between a conserved cysteine in the pro-peptide domain and a Zn2+ ion complexed in the catalytic domain. Activation of pro-MMP occurs upon the dissociation of the Cys-S-Zn2+ bond or by proteolytic cleavage of the pro-domain (17Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of MMP activity is linked with the initiation and development of numerous pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, cardiac remodeling, emphysema, and metastatic cancers (18Lemaître V. D'Armiento J. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Byproducts of inflammatory reactions play a role during MMP activation in vivo. In this context, compelling evidence supports that a product of neutrophil myeloperoxidase, hypochlorous acid, induces in vitro activation of proMMP-7 by Cys-SH oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) (19Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Also, the product of superoxide and NO reaction, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), induces oxidation and glutathiolation (Cys-S-SG) of the MMP cysteine switch thiol (20Okamoto T. Akaike T. Sawa T. Miyamoto Y. van der Vliet A. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29596-29602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast, MMP activation by NO-mediated Cys-S-nitrosation remains controversial, because of the broad range of concentrations and chemical natures of different NO donors being used (21Gu Z. Kaul M. Yan B. Kridel S.J. Cui J. Strongin A. Smith J.W. Liddington R.C. Lipton S.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 22McCarthy S.M. Bove P.F. Matthews D.E. Akaike T. van der Vliet A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5832-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). During the onset of inflammation, immune cell access to sites of injury and infection is facilitated by MMP activity. Uncontrolled or prolonged exposure to MMP activity results in tissue damage, remodeling, poor resolution of inflammation, and even progression of disease toward more chronic states. For example, atheroma formation in blood vessels is associated with, neointimal proliferation and infiltration of macrophages (23Dollery C.M. Libby P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Plaque stability is critically related to the action of MMPs, as the hydrolysis of extracellular matrix leads to plaque instability, plaque rupture, and vessel occlusion (24Newby A.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 17: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It remains unclear as to what regulates the beneficial versus deleterious actions of MMPs toward atherosclerotic plaque. Studies of MMP-9−/− mice have revealed opposing results on plaque size and stability (25Johnson J.L. George S.J. Newby A.C. Jackson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15575-15580Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Newby A.C. George S.J. Ismail Y. Johnson J.L. Sala-Newby G.B. Thomas A.C. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 101: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of MMP expression by macrophages and control of the inflammatory process seem to be crucial aspects for the prevention of plaque rupture. In this regard, in vivo administration of OA-NO2 inhibits the formation of fatty streaks and stabilizes atheromatous plaque in ApoE−/− mice fed a high-fat diet, a model of atherosclerosis (27Rudolph T.K. Rudolph V. Edreira M.M. Cole M.P. Bonacci G. Schopfer F.J. Woodcock S.R. Franek A. Pekarova M. Khoo N.K. Hasty A.H. Baldus S. Freeman B.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, tissue and plasma levels of NO2-FA can be increased by inflammatory and ischemic processes (10Rudolph V. Rudolph T.K.

For these reasons, we examined the impact of an exemplary nitroalkenyl fatty acid, OA-NO2, on the activity and transcriptional regulation of MMPs using MMP-7 and MMP-9 as enzymatic and biological models. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, if not stated otherwise. Recombinant human proMMP-7, proMMP-9, MMP-2/MMP-9 substrate II, and MMP-7 fluorescent Mca peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)Ala-Ala-Arg-NH2) were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal MMP-9 antibody was obtained from Sigma and streptavidin-conjugated HRP from Pierce. Nitro-linoleic acid (9-, 10-, 12-, or 13- octadeca 9,12-cis, cis dienoic acids; LNO2) and nitro-oleic acid (9- or 10- octadeca 9-cis enoic acids; OA-NO2) were prepared as previously described (30Baker P.R.

The human macrophage THP-1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal serum bovine (FBS), and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Pro-MMP-9 activation was determined by following the proteolytic product of the MMP synthetic peptide substrate by mass spectrometry. Pro-MMP-9 was incubated with various concentrations of OA-NO2 (1–20 μm), oleic acid (OA, 1–20 μm), and methanol (vehicle control) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 45 min at 23 °C. Then, 30 μmol of the synthetic substrate was added and, at the indicated time points, the reaction was terminated by acidification with formic acid (1% final concentration) and proteolytic products were quantified by LC-ESI-MS. Mass spectrometric analysis and quantification were performed using a hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (4000 Q trap; Applied Biosystems) coupled to a Shimadzu HPLC system. Peptides were separated on a reverse-phase column (Zorbax SB300-C18, 100 × 0.5 mm, 3.5 μm) using mobile phase: solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of solvent B (2–100% in 7 min). MS analysis in the positive ion mode showed an ion corresponding to the MMP peptide substrate m/z 656.5, and the MMP cleavage product ion with an m/z 369.5 resulting from the activation of proMMP-9 with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, a known activator of latent MMP-9. Quantification of substrate consumption and product formation was done using the multiple reaction monitoring scan mode by recording peak areas using an external standard curves. The following multiple reaction monitoring transitions were used for substrate consumption (m/z 656.5/369.5) and product formation (m/z 369.5/239.1). Proteolytic activity of proMMP-7 was measured by fluorescence analysis using the synthetic peptide, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)Ala-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Mca peptide), which under proteolytic cleavage release the fluorescence domain. Briefly, the proMMP-7 sample was incubated with NO2-FA as described above with proMMP-9. Then, aliquots of proMMP-7 (30 ng) were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate containing 3 μm substrate (Mca) in 500 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). Fluorescence was acquired using an excitation wavelength of λex = 328 nm and emission λem = 392 nm in a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Control reactions were performed to evaluate the effects of the reaction mixture components on fluorescence yields. MMP-9 activity was assessed in conditioned media from THP-1 cells incubated with OA-NO2, OA, or preincubated with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. Samples were prepared in non-reducing buffer and loaded on 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated for 18 h in activation buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. Then, gels were stained in 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 solution. Proteolytic activity was determined as proteolysed areas of gelatin against the blue background staining. Native proMMP-7 (10 μg) was digested before and after OA-NO2 and OA treatment with sequencing grade trypsin (1:50) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 16 h. ESI-LC-MS analysis of the peptide digest was performed in the positive ion mode with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-XL, Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated in a reverse-phase column (Grace Vydac, 5 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, 300 Å) with solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (5–60% in 70 min). The electrospray voltage was set at 5 kV and the capillary temperature was 260 °C. ProMMP-9 and MMP-9 treated with OA-NO2-biotin or OA-biotin were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (CriterionTM XT Precast Gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 90 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Pierce) in TTBS, 1% nonfat milk for 1 h at RT. Then, membranes were washed in TTBS and developed with chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare). To ensure even protein loading, membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-MMP-9 antibody, which recognizes pro- and active forms. THP-1 cells (90% of confluent) were treated with OA-NO2 (1–2.5 μm), Rosiglitazone (1–2.5 μm), and methanol (vehicle control) for 1 h before stimulation with 0.1 μm PMA during 4, 9, and 16 h. Then, cells were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed in a 25-μl reaction using iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed by TaqMan fast universal PCR master mixture using gene expression primers for MMP-9 (Hs00234579_m1) and actin as a housekeeping gene. Samples were run in triplicate in the StepOne detection system (Applied Biosystems). Male ApoE−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. At 8 weeks age, mice were placed on an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks (21% fat and 1.25% cholesterol, Harlan Teklan). Concurrently, mice were implanted with a subcutaneous osmotic mini-pump (Alzet®, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA), which delivered OA-NO2 (8 mg/kg/d), OA (8 mg/kg/d, Nu-Chek Inc.), or vehicle control (polyethylene glycol/ethanol). At the termination of treatment, mice were sacrificed and aortic roots dissected and embedded in OCT medium for posterior sectioning. Tissue was fixed before staining and atherosclerotic lesions were detected by Oil Red O staining. Immunofluorescence of aortic root sections was performed with an anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma). All animal studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval 0709432). To evaluate whether OA-NO2 disrupts Cys-Zn2+ interactions to activate proMMP-9, the pro-enzyme was treated with OA-NO2 and extents of proteolytic product generation from an added synthetic peptide substrate was monitored by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). Incubation with OA-NO2 (1–10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C induced a 3-fold increase in the activation of proMMP-9, whereas both vehicle control (not shown) and OA had no effect (Fig. 1A). Activation of proMMP-9 was both time- and dose-dependent, with pro-enzyme not being activated by native OA (Fig. 1B). In addition, the activation of proMMP-9 by OA-NO2 presented a biphasic response profile, showing activation at concentrations lower than 10 μm and reduction of activity at higher and less biological concentrations (>10 μm) (Fig. 1, A and B). ProMMP-7 activation by OA-NO2 was also dose-dependent and unaffected by native OA (Fig. 1C), with proMMP-7 slightly more sensitive to activation by OA-NO2 than proMMP-9 (Fig. 1A, C). MMP-9 activity was not affected by 10 μm OA-NO2 and its native fatty acid counterpart OA (Fig. 1D). To verify that OA-NO2 activated MMP-9 by inducing cleavage of the pro-domain, recombinant proMMP-9 was incubated with OA-NO2 and evaluated by both gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis. Zymography gels (Fig. 2A) showed that OA-NO2 treatment induces, in a dose-dependent fashion (1–10 μm), conversion of the zymogen (92 kDa) to the active form of MMP-9, as revealed by an emerging band showing both proteolytic activity and a lower molecular mass (82 kDa). In separate experiments over time (2, 12, and 24 h), treatment with OA-NO2 gave similar results, confirming conversion to the active MMP-9 form, as compared with the MMP activator p-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Treatment with native OA did not induce cleavage of proMMP-9 (Fig. 2B). The activation of proMMP-9 was further evaluated with a biotin-OA-NO2 derivative. MMP-9 and proMMP-9 (0.2 μg) were treated with either biotin-OA-NO2 or the corresponding native fatty acid control, biotin-OA, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Formation of the proMMP-9-OANO2-biotin adduct was increased in a dose-dependent manner (1–10 μm) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the active form of MMP-9, which lacks the 10-kDa amino-terminal pro-domain, was not alkylated by biotin-OA-NO2 at concentrations up to 10 μm. Non-electrophilic OA-biotin was used as a control for nonspecific interactions (Fig. 3). These results reveal that biotin-OA-NO2 adduction to proMMP-9 occurs in the pro-domain region, which contains the critical thiol group involved in the activation of MMPs (Cys-70 and Cys-100 for proMMP-7 and proMMP-9, respectively). To define specific sites of OA-NO2 adduction, proMMP-7 was trypsin digested and sequenced by mass spectrometry. ProMMP-7 was selected for analysis due to its lower molecular mass (29 kDa) and the fact that it contains only 1 cysteine (in the prodomain) and 8 histidine residues. Untreated proMMP-7 (5 μg) tryptic digests were analyzed by ESI-LC-MS, resulting in 65% peptide coverage of the primary sequence (not shown). When digests of OA-NO2-treated proMMP-7 were analyzed, four OA-NO2-adducted peptides were identified (Table 1). These peptides showed both the addition of m/z 327.3 upon OA-NO2 reaction (the mass of OA-NO2) and a shift in retention time compared with the non-modified peptides, due to an increased hydrophobicity induced by OA-NO2 adduction. One of the four modified peptides encompassed residues 70–86 that contain the cysteine switch domain coordinating the Zn2+ ion in the catalytic domain. ESI-LC-MS analysis also showed a new peak in the treated sample as the doubly charged ion m/z 1075.4; [C(OA-NO2)GVPDVAEYSLFPNSPK]2+ having a theoretical mass of m/z of 1075.8 (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1A). The unmodified peptide was detected as a doubly charged ion of m/z 912.0 [CGVPDVAEYSLFPNSPK]2+; which was present in low abundance in OA-NO2-treated samples (supplemental Fig. S1A). The mass difference between the non-modified and the modified peptide was m/z 163.4 atomic mass units, corresponding to the mass of OA-NO2 in a doubly charged peptide (supplemental Fig. S1A). To verify these results, MS/MS analysis of ions m/z 912.0 and 1075.4 was performed and showed a sequence of b and y ions that match the expected ion products from the cysteine switch domain peptide (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicate that the thiol group of the pro-domain is the principal target for covalent adduction by OA-NO2, and supports that lipid electrophiles can play a role in the activation of MMPs.TABLE 1LC-MS analysis of proMMP-7 cysteine and histidine adduction by OA-NO2 Open table in a new tab Activation of pro-MMP involves the disruption of the thiol-Zn2+ interactions that in turn trigger an autoproteolytic cleavage of the prodomain. MS analysis of the peptide digest of OA-NO2-treated proMMP-7 identified a doubly charged ion of m/z 526.7 [YSLFPNSPK]2+, which corresponds to the autoproteolytic product of the prodomain peptide, CGVPDVAE77Y78SLFPNSPK (supplemental Fig. S1C). Analysis of unmodified proMMP-7 did not detect this peptide ion. Failure to detect the complementary ion CGVPDVAE+ (m/z 1117.3) in both treatments may have been the result of poor ionization. To determine whether OA-NO2 modulates MMP-9 transcription, THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with 0.1 μm PMA after OA-NO2 treatment. Upon activation, MMP-9 mRNA transcription was assessed at 4, 9, and 16 h by quantitative real time PCR. PMA induced 10 ± 1.5- and 65 ± 4.3-fold increases in mRNA levels at 9 and 16 h, respectively (Fig. 4A). OA-NO2 (1–2.5 μm) and Rosiglitazone (2.5 μm), both potent PPARγ ligands (11Schopfer F.J.

Hallis T.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12321-12333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), markedly suppressed PMA induction to 2 ± 0.2- and 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increases, respectively, after 9 h of incubation. Comparable results were obtained after 16 h of treatment, with OA-NO2 and Rosiglitazone reducing PMA induction of MMP-9 mRNA transcription to 31.3 ± 4.1- and 35 ± 3.8-fold increases. Only slight effects were observed at 4 h after PPARγ ligand addition (Fig. 4A). No change in MMP-9 mRNA expression was induced by OA-NO2 or Rosiglitazone in the absence of cell differentiation by PMA (Fig. 4B). To evaluate whether a change in transcription affected MMP-9 protein secretion, extracellular levels of MMP-9 were assessed. THP-1 cells in serum-free medium were treated for 1 h with OA-NO2 (0–2.5 μm) or Rosiglitazone (0–2.5 μm) before PMA stimulation and then secretion into the medium was monitored by Western blotting. MMP-9 was only detectable in cell medium upon PMA stimulation (Fig. 4C). Both Rosiglitazone and OA-NO2 significantly decreased extracellular MMP-9 secretion, although the effect of NO2-FA was less pronounced. Trypan blue exclusion staining for cell viability did not show any difference between treatments (not shown). Gelatin zymography of THP-1-conditioned medium confirmed the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by OA-NO2 (1–5 μm). Notably, when cells were incubated with the PPARγ receptor antagonist GW9662 (20 μm), OA-NO2-induced inhibition of MMP-9 expression was abrogated (Fig. 4D). The effect of OA-NO2 administration in vivo on MMP-9 expression in developing atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE−/− mice was examined by immunofluorescence analysis of protein expression. There was a significant decrease in MMP-9 expression when compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5, A and B) supporting in vivo regulation of MMP-9 expression by OA-NO2. The electrophilic fatty acid OA-NO2 modulates the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 and MMP-7 by reaction with and alkylation of the cysteine switch domain thiol, converting the pro-enzyme to the active form. In addition, OA-NO2 suppresses PMA-induced human THP-1 macrophage MMP-9 mRNA gene expression to an extent similar to the PPARγ agonist Rosiglitazone. This effect was inhibited by the PPARγ receptor antagonist GW9662. These actions are of potential clinical significance, because MMPs strongly influence turnover and remodeling of the vascular extracellular matrix. Thus, electrophilic fatty acids can transduce the vessel remodeling promoted by physiologic modulators of MMP expression and activity that include inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and hemodynamic stresses (32Manicone A.M. McGuire J.K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 19: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Inflammatory stimuli induce elevated rates of generation of reactive oxygen and NO-derived species, which in turn contribute to the nitration of unsaturated fatt"
https://openalex.org/W2035942480,"The dysregulation of EGF family ligand cleavage has severe consequences for the developing as well as the adult organism. Therefore, their production is highly regulated. The limiting step is the ectodomain cleavage of membrane-bound precursors by one of several a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) metalloproteases, and understanding the regulation of cleavage is an important goal of current research. We have previously reported that in mouse lung epithelial cells, the pro-EGF ligands TGFα, neuregulin 1β (NRG), and heparin-binding EGF are differentially cleaved depending on the cleavage stimulus (Herrlich, A., Klinman, E., Fu, J., Sadegh, C., and Lodish, H. (2008) FASEB J.). In this study in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack different ADAMs, we show that induced cleavage of EGF ligands can involve the same substrate-specific metalloprotease but does require different stimulus-dependent signaling pathways. Cleavage was stimulated by phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a mimic of diacylglycerol and PKC activator), hypertonic stress, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced G protein-coupled receptor activation, or by ionomycin-induced intracellular calcium release. Although ADAMs showed substrate preference (ADAM17, TGFα and heparin-binding EGF; and ADAM9, NRG), substrate cleavage differed substantially with the stimulus, and cleavage of the same substrate depended on the presence of different, sometimes multiple, PKC isoforms. For instance, classical PKC was required for TPA-induced but not hypertonic stress-induced cleavage of all EGF family ligands. Inhibition of PKCζ enhanced NRG release upon TPA stimulation, but it blocked NRG release in response to hypertonic stress. Our results suggest a model in which substantial regulation of ectodomain cleavage occurs not only on the metalloprotease level but also on the level of the substrate or of a third protein."

Here, we demonstrate the possibility to confer voltage sensitivity to cytosolic enzymes. By fusing the tumor suppressor PTEN to the voltage sensor of the prototypic VSP from Ciona intestinalis, Ci-VSP, we generated chimeric proteins that are voltage-sensitive and display PTEN-like enzymatic activity in a strictly depolarization-dependent manner in vivo. Functional coupling of the exogenous enzymatic activity to the voltage sensor is mediated by a phospholipid-binding motif at the interface between voltage sensor and catalytic domains. Our findings reveal that the main domains of VSPs and related phosphoinositide phosphatases are intrinsically modular and define structural requirements for coupling of enzymatic activity to a voltage sensor domain. A key feature of this prototype of novel engineered voltage-sensitive enzymes, termed Ci-VSPTEN, is the novel ability to switch enzymatic activity of PTEN rapidly and reversibly. We demonstrate that experimental control of Ci-VSPTEN can be obtained either by electrophysiological techniques or more general techniques, using potassium-induced depolarization of intact cells. Thus, Ci-VSPTEN provides a novel approach for studying the complex mechanism of activation, cellular control, and pharmacology of this important tumor suppressor. Moreover, by inducing temporally precise perturbation of phosphoinositide concentrations, Ci-VSPTEN will be useful for probing the role and specificity of these messengers in many cellular processes and to analyze the timing of phosphoinositide signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2005368117,"The histone chaperone Vps75 presents the remarkable property of stimulating the Rtt109-dependent acetylation of several histone H3 lysine residues within (H3-H4)(2) tetramers. To investigate this activation mechanism, we determined x-ray structures of full-length Vps75 in complex with full-length Rtt109 in two crystal forms. Both structures show similar asymmetric assemblies of a Vps75 dimer bound to an Rtt109 monomer. In the Vps75-Rtt109 complexes, the catalytic site of Rtt109 is confined to an enclosed space that can accommodate the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in (H3-H4)(2). Investigation of Vps75-Rtt109-(H3-H4)(2) and Vps75-(H3-H4)(2) complexes by NMR spectroscopy-probed hydrogen/deuterium exchange suggests that Vps75 guides histone H3 in the catalytic enclosure. These findings clarify the basis for the enhanced acetylation of histone H3 tail residues by Vps75-Rtt109."

In characterizing a novel insulin growth factor (IGF)-like (IGFL) gene in mice (mIGFL), we found transcripts of this gene to be most highly expressed in skin with enhanced expression in models of skin wounding and psoriatic-like inflammation. A possible functional ortholog in humans, IGFL1, was uniquely and significantly induced in psoriatic skin samples. In vitro IGFL1 expression was up-regulated in cultured primary keratinocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α but not by other psoriasis-associated cytokines. Finally, using a secreted and transmembrane protein library, we discovered high affinity interactions between human IGFL1 and mIGFL and the TMEM149 ectodomain. TMEM149 (renamed here as IGFLR1) is an uncharacterized gene with structural similarity to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family.

https://openalex.org/W1985119561,"Understanding how self-cleaving ribozymes mediate catalysis is crucial in light of compelling evidence that human and bacterial gene expression can be regulated through RNA self-cleavage. The hairpin ribozyme catalyzes reversible phosphodiester bond cleavage through a mechanism that does not require divalent metal cations. Previous structural and biochemical evidence implicated the amidine group of an active site adenosine, A38, in a pH-dependent step in catalysis. We developed a way to determine microscopic pK(a) values in active ribozymes based on the pH-dependent fluorescence of 8-azaadenosine (8azaA). We compared the microscopic pK(a) for ionization of 8azaA at position 38 with the apparent pK(a) for the self-cleavage reaction in a fully functional hairpin ribozyme with a unique 8azaA at position 38. Microscopic and apparent pK(a) values were virtually the same, evidence that A38 protonation accounts for the decrease in catalytic activity with decreasing pH. These results implicate the neutral unprotonated form of A38 in a transition state that involves formation of the 5'-oxygen-phosphorus bond."
https://openalex.org/W2044829630,"The NIMA family protein kinases Nek9/Nercc1 and the highly similar Nek6 and Nek7 form a signaling module activated in mitosis, when they are involved in the control of spindle organization and function. Here we report that Nek9, the module upstream kinase, binds to DYNLL/LC8, a highly conserved protein originally described as a component of the dynein complex. LC8 is a dimer that interacts with different proteins and has been suggested to act as a dimerization hub promoting the organization and oligomerization of partially disorganized partners. We find that the interaction of LC8 with Nek9 depends on a (K/R)XTQT motif adjacent to the Nek9 C-terminal coiled coil motif, results in Nek9 multimerization, and increases the rate of Nek9 autoactivation. LC8 binding to Nek9 is regulated by Nek9 activity through the autophosphorylation of Ser(944), a residue immediately N-terminal to the (K/R)XTQT motif. Remarkably, LC8 binding interferes with the interaction of Nek9 with its downstream partner Nek6 as well as with Nek6 activation, thus controlling both processes. Our work sheds light into the control of signal transduction through the module formed by Nek9 and Nek6/7 and uncovers a novel manner in which LC8 can regulate partner physiology by interfering with protein complex formation. We suggest that this and other LC8 functions can be specifically regulated by partner phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2060971308,"Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B and Escherichia coli K1 bacteria produce a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that is composed of α2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA). Biosynthesis of PSA in these bacteria occurs via an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter-dependent pathway. In N. meningitidis, export of PSA to the surface of the bacterium requires two proteins that form an ABC transporter (CtrC and CtrD) and two additional proteins, CtrA and CtrB, that are proposed to form a cell envelope-spanning export complex. CtrA is a member of the outer membrane polysaccharide export (OPX) family of proteins, which are proposed to form a pore to mediate export of CPSs across the outer membrane. CtrB is an inner membrane protein belonging to the polysaccharide co-polymerase (PCP) family.

There is currently no structural information available for PCP or OPX proteins involved in an ABC transporter-dependent CPS biosynthesis pathway to support their proposed roles in polysaccharide export. Here, we report cryo-EM images of purified CtrB reconstituted into lipid bilayers. These images contained molecular top and side views of CtrB and showed that it formed a conical oligomer that extended ∼125 Å from the membrane.

The capsule helps prevent bacteria from desiccation and is important in infection because it provides protection from the host immune response by interfering with both complement-mediated killing (1Cross A.S.

Pathog. 1994; 16: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consequently, capsules are an important virulence factor for numerous pathogenic bacteria including those that cause disease in livestock, like Pasteurella multocida, and bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis, which cause bacterial meningitis and sepsis in humans (6Harvey D. Holt D.E. Bedford H. Semin. Perinatol. 1999; 23: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CPSs vary significantly in carbohydrate composition and glycosidic linkages. Despite the diversity of structures, the majority of CPSs produced by Gram-negative bacteria are assembled via either an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway or a Wzy-dependent biosynthesis pathway (for review, see Refs. 7Cuthbertson L. Mainprize I.L. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). These pathways are fundamentally different in the topology of the polysaccharide polymerization reaction at the inner membrane. In Wzy-dependent pathways, polymer repeat units are assembled at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane on undecaprenol diphosphate and flipped to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane in a process that requires a putative flippase protein, Wzx. Polymerization occurs on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane in a process that is dependent on the polymerase Wzy. In contrast, CPSs assembled via ABC transporter-dependent pathways are polymerized entirely at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. The complete polysaccharide is exported across the inner membrane in a process that requires an ABC transporter that is composed of two nucleotide binding domain subunits and two transmembrane domain subunits. Translocation of full-length CPS to the surface of the cell requires a polysaccharide co-polymerase (PCP) protein and an outer membrane polysaccharide export (OPX) protein in both the Wzy-dependent pathway and the ABC transporter-dependent pathway (for review, see Refs. 7Cuthbertson L.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). PCP proteins share a conserved membrane topology that consists of N- and C-terminal membrane-spanning regions (or a C-terminal membrane-associated region) that flank a predominantly α-helical periplasmic domain (for review, see 7Cuthbertson L.

Most PCP proteins possess a proline-containing consensus motif (PX2PX4SPKX11GGMXGAG) that is located at the interface between the periplasmic domain and the C-terminal membrane-spanning region, as well as amino acid sequences that are predicted to form periplasmic coiled-coils (7Cuthbertson L.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). PCP-1 proteins (Wzz homologs) determine LPS O antigen chain length in a Wzy-dependent biosynthesis pathway and represent the best characterized family members. PCP-2a proteins are involved in Wzy-dependent CPS biosynthesis and possess a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with tyrosine kinase activity; this domain is absent in PCP-1 and PCP-3 proteins. Certain PCP-2 proteins (including proteins from prominent Gram-positive bacteria) lack the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain but function in conjunction with a separate cognate kinase polypeptide. PCP-3 proteins are confined to the ABC transporter-dependent CPS biosynthesis. Structural information is available for PCP-1 (12Larue K. Kimber M.S. Ford R. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

OPX proteins have limited sequence similarity and are identified by a polysaccharide export sequence motif (7Cuthbertson L. Mainprize I.L. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Wza from E. coli K30 is the prototype OPX protein and operates in a Wzy-dependent assembly system. The crystal structure of Wza shows that it is an octamer that forms a large (140 × 105 Å) barrel with eight amphipathic α-helices that insert into the outer membrane to form a channel (15Dong C.

The majority of Wza is located in the periplasm, where it encloses a central water-filled cavity. A cryo-EM structure of a complex of Wza and the PCP-2a protein Wzc shows that PCP-OPX proteins are capable of assembling into cell envelope-spanning structures that are consistent with their proposed roles in polysaccharide export (16Collins R.F. Beis K. Dong C. Botting C.H. McDonnell C. Ford R.C. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2390-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PCP-3 proteins and their partner OPX proteins are thought to form a similar polysaccharide export complex in ABC transporter-dependent assembly systems, but there are currently no structural data available supporting this hypothesis. E. coli K1 and N. meningitidis group B both make ABC transporter-dependent capsules that are polymers of α2,8-linked polysialic acid (PSA) (17Devi S.J. Schneerson R. Egan W. Vann W.F. Robbins J.B. Shiloach J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 732-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of PSA in E. coli serves as an influential model for ABC transporter-dependent CPS assembly and export (reviewed in (18Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol.

The E. coli PSA export apparatus consists of two proteins providing the transmembrane domains and nucleotide binding domains of the ABC transporter (KpsM and KpsT, respectively), the PCP-3 protein (KpsE) and the OPX protein (KpsD). Homologous proteins in other bacteria are proposed to function in similar CPS exporters. As expected, given the shared mode of assembly, conserved components are encoded by the capsule loci from E. coli and N. meningitidis (7Cuthbertson L. Mainprize I.L. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol.

PSA export in N. meningitidis requires two proteins that form an ABC transporter (CtrC and CtrD), a PCP-3 protein (CtrB), and an OPX protein (CtrA). In this study, we provide evidence that the PCP-3-OPX pairs from E. coli and N. meningitidis are functionally interchangeable, but they require cognate interactions between partner proteins for CPS export. In addition, cryo-EM is used to examine the PCP-3 protein CtrB from N. meningitidis reconstituted in lipid bilayers and shows that it forms a structure resembling PCP-1 and PCP-2 family members. These data support the model for a cell envelope-spanning CPS export system in ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathways.

Cells expressing each CtrB variant were grown in 200 ml LB of broth inoculated with an overnight culture (1% v/v) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl), and divided into three aliquots. OGM (40 μm) was added to aliquot 1, labeling Cys residues accessible to the periplasm. The sample was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and quenched with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In aliquot 2, periplasmic Cys residues were blocked with methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) (2 mm) for 15 min at room temperature. Aliquots 1 and 2 were washed twice by centrifugation using buffer A to resuspend the cell pellets. All three aliquots were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and 20% (w/v) sucrose. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 18 ml of cold water was added to each aliquot to disrupt the cells. OGM (10 μm) was then added to aliquots 2 and 3, and all three aliquots were subjected to 30 s of sonication (10 s on, 10 s off), followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. This labeled any available and unblocked cytoplasmic Cys residues in aliquot 2 and labeled all of the accessible Cys residues in aliquot 3. The labeling reaction was quenched in aliquots 2 and 3 with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the unbroken cells and cell debris were collected from all three aliquots by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Membranes were collected from the cell-free lysates by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and solubilized overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) dimethylmyristylammonio propanesulfonate (SB3-14) (Sigma-Aldrich). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of nickel affinity resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature. The solubilized membrane-resin mixture was then loaded into 1-ml minicolumns (Bio-Rad) and washed twice with 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 0.05% (w/v) SB3-14. Proteins were eluted with 200 μl of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) SDS and 500 mm imidazole into 200 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 15-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) gels, and fluorescence was recorded with exposure of the gels to UV light using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc equipped with a CCD camera. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue following UV exposure to visualize protein bands. The experiment was conducted in duplicate and produced the same results. To confirm the interpretation of SDS-PAGE results from the OGM-labeling experiments described above, purified CtrB variants were labeled with OGM in an SDS solution and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The CtrB variants were expressed from their respective plasmids in 200-ml cultures and purified according to the procedure described above but omitting OGM labeling and MTSET blocking. The solubilized membrane-resin mixture was washed with 2 ml of buffer A containing 0.05% (w/v) SB3-14 and 20 mm imidazole followed by 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 0.05% (w/v) SB3-14 and 50 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with 300 μl of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) SDS and 500 mm imidazole. A 50-μl aliquot from each CtrB sample was incubated with OGM (40 μm) for 15 min at room temperature and quenched with ∼1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Untreated and OGM-treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to UV light, and fluorescence was recorded as described above. After exposure to UV light, the nitrocellulose membranes were probed with anti-His5 antibodies (Qiagen) using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Separate gels were also stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein bands (data not shown). His10-CtrB was overexpressed from pWQ555 in E. coli TOP10. One liter of LB containing ampicillin was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture and grown with shaking at 37 °C. When an A600 nm of 0.6 was reached, expression of CtrB was induced by adding 0.1% (w/v) arabinose, and growth was continued for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell-free lysate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were collected from the cell-free lysate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was solubilized overnight in 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) decyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DM) (Fluka). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and 2 ml of His-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the supernatant. The mixture of resin and solubilized membranes was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking and loaded into a 20-ml Bio-Rad chromatography column. The resin was washed with 20 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) DM, and 20 mm imidazole, followed by 5 ml of the same buffer containing 75 mm imidazole. His10-CtrB was eluted with a 5-ml fraction of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) DM, and 300 mm imidazole, followed by 5 ml of the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions collected throughout the purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fraction containing purified CtrB was diluted to 50 ml using 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% (w/v) DM and concentrated by centrifugation using a 100,000-Da cutoff filter to 1/100 of the original volume. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kit with BSA as a standard. Reconstitution experiments were performed using 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), DMPC-DOPS mixtures (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 (w:w)), and DOPC-DOPE mixtures (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 (w:w)) (Avanti Polar Lipids). Lipids and lipid mixtures were prepared at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml and solubilized with 1% (w/v) octyl β-d-1-thioglucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. 50-μl reconstitution reactions were prepared at lipid-to-protein ratios of 0.25:1, 0.5:1, and 0.75:1 (w:w) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Reconstitution was initiated by the addition of ∼ 10 hydrophobic beads (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in water. The beads were replaced at ∼12-h intervals for 2–4 days. The formation of proteoliposomes and membrane sheets was screened by transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens, as described previously (12Larue K. Kimber M.S. Ford R. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7395-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 3-μl samples from reconstitution experiments were applied undiluted to Quantifoil R 2/2 holey carbon-coated EM grids and plunged frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot plunge freezing system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) using 2 × 1-s blots and an offset setting of −1 mm. Cryo-EM was performed using a Tecnai F20 200kV EM operating in low dose mode at 200 kV at the University of Guelph Microscopy Imaging Facility. Micrographs were recorded using a Gatan 4k CCD at defocus values of 2–8 μm with a calibrated magnification corresponding to 3.88 Å/pixel. Images were recorded with a 1-s exposure time corresponding to an overall electron dose of ∼2500 electrons/nm2. Images were manipulated using the EMAN software package (23Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Molecular side views and small membrane patches containing top views of CtrB were selected using BOXER. The degree of underfocus for each micrograph was determined, and the CTF correction was performed using the CTFIT program within the EMAN package. Classification of the particles (after CTF correction) and averaging of translationally and rotationally aligned particles within each class was also carried out using the EMAN package. The contour-delineated CtrB projection map shown in Fig. 5E was generated using the SPIDER software contouring function (24Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). To examine total cellular PSA, E. coli strains were grown overnight on LB agar at 37 °C and whole cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cells were harvested from the surface of the LB agar and resuspended in water. The equivalent of 1 ml of cells with an A600 nm = 3.0 was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 150 μl of 70% (v/v) ethanol. Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 150 μl of 100% ethanol, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were collected again by centrifugation, and the supernatant from each sample was discarded. After allowing the cell pellet to dry completely, it was resuspended in a 50-μl solution containing 10 μg/ml DNase I, 10 μg/ml RNaseA, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and 10 mm MgCl2. The samples were incubated for 90 min at room temperature and mixed with 50 μl of 2× sample loading buffer (100 mm MOPS, 100 mm Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 250 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 7.7). The cell lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and 15-μl samples were loaded into 5% (w/v) gels prepared with a 3% (w/v) stacking layer. The gel buffer and running buffer contained 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm Tris, 0.1% (w/v) SDS,"
https://openalex.org/W2051933513,"AS160 (TBC1D4) is a known Akt substrate that is phosphorylated downstream of insulin action and that leads to regulated traffic of GLUT4. As GLUT4 vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is a highly regulated step in GLUT4 traffic, we investigated whether AS160 and 14-3-3 interactions are involved in this process. Fusion was inhibited by a human truncated AS160 variant that encompasses the first N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, by either of the two N-terminal PTB domains, and by a tandem construct of both PTB domains of rat AS160. We also found that in vitro GLUT4 vesicle fusion was strongly inhibited by the 14-3-3-quenching inhibitors R18 and fusicoccin. To investigate the mode of interaction of AS160 and 14-3-3, we examined insulin-dependent increases in the levels of these proteins on GLUT4 vesicles. 14-3-3γ was enriched on insulin-stimulated vesicles, and its binding to AS160 on GLUT4 vesicles was inhibited by the AS160 tandem PTB domain construct. These data suggest a model for PTB domain action on GLUT4 vesicle fusion in which these constructs inhibit insulin-stimulated 14-3-3γ interaction with AS160 rather than AS160 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2160384970,"Eukaryotic sodium channels are important membrane proteins involved in ion permeation, homeostasis, and electrical signaling. They are long, multidomain proteins that do not express well in heterologous systems, and hence, structure/function and biochemical studies on purified sodium channel proteins have been limited. Bacteria produce smaller, homologous tetrameric single domain channels specific for the conductance of sodium ions. They consist of N-terminal voltage sensor and C-terminal pore subdomains. We designed a functional pore-only channel consisting of the final two transmembrane helices, the intervening P-region, and the C-terminal extramembranous region of the sodium channel from the marine bacterium Silicibacter pomeroyi. This sodium ""pore"" channel forms a tetrameric, folded structure that is capable of supporting sodium flux in phospholipid vesicles. The pore-only channel is more thermally stable than its full-length counterpart, suggesting that the voltage sensor subdomain may destabilize the full-length channel. The pore subdomains can assemble, fold, and function independently from the voltage sensor and exhibit similar ligand-blocking characteristics as the intact channel. The availability of this simple pore-only construct should enable high-level expression for the testing of potential new ligands and enhance our understanding of the structural features that govern sodium selectivity and permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1982834248,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is affected by formation of GPCR homo- or heterodimers, but GPCR regulation by other cell surface proteins is not well understood. We reported that the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) heterodimerizes with membrane carboxypeptidase M (CPM), facilitating receptor signaling via CPM-mediated conversion of bradykinin or kallidin to des-Arg kinin B1R agonists. Here, we found that a catalytically inactive CPM mutant that still binds substrate (CPM-E264Q) also facilitates efficient B1R signaling by B2 receptor agonists bradykinin or kallidin. This response required co-expression of B1R and CPM-E264Q in the same cell, was disrupted by antibody that dissociates CPM from B1R, and was not found with a CPM-E264Q-B1R fusion protein. An additional mutation that reduced the affinity of CPM for C-terminal Arg and increased the affinity for C-terminal Lys inhibited the B1R response to bradykinin (with C-terminal Arg) but generated a response to Lys(9)-bradykinin. CPM-E264Q-mediated activation of B1Rs by bradykinin resulted in increased intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a B1R FRET construct, similar to that generated directly by a B1R agonist. In cytokine-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells, disruption of B1R-CPM heterodimers inhibited B1R-dependent NO production stimulated by bradykinin and blocked the increased endothelial permeability caused by treatment with bradykinin and pyrogallol (a superoxide generator). Thus, CPM and B1Rs on cell membranes form a critical complex that potentiates B1R signaling. Kinin peptide binding to CPM causes a conformational change in the B1R leading to intracellular signaling and reveals a new mode of GPCR activation by a cell surface peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W2001614361,"The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) plays an important role in mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal development, particularly coupled with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Wnt5a protein is known to regulate the development of dopaminergic neurons. We analyzed the effect of Wnt5a on dopaminergic neuron development in mesencephalic primary cultures from wild-type (WT) and D2R knock-out (D2R(-/-)) mice. Treatment with Wnt5a increased the number and neuritic length of dopamine neurons in primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures from WT mice, but not from D2R(-/-) mice. The effect of Wnt5a was completely blocked by treatment with D2R antagonist or inhibitors of MAPK or EGFR. Wnt5a-mediated ERK activation in mesencephalic neuronal cultures was inhibited by treatment of D2R antagonist and EGFR inhibitors in WT mice. However, these regulations were not observed for D2R(-/-) mice. Co-immunoprecipitation and displacement of [(3)H]spiperone from D2R by Wnt5a demonstrated that Wnt5a could bind with D2R. This interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown assays demonstrating that the domain including transmembrane domain 4, second extracellular loop, and transmembrane domain 5 of D2R binds to Wnt5a. These results suggest that the interaction between D2R and Wnt5a has an important role in dopamine neuron development in association with EGFR and the ERK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2166889206,"The Kv2.1 channel generates a delayed-rectifier current in neurons and is responsible for modulation of neuronal spike frequency and membrane repolarization in pancreatic β-cells and cardiomyocytes. As with other tetrameric voltage-activated K+-channels, it has been proposed that each of the four Kv2.1 voltage-sensing domains activates independently upon depolarization, leading to a final concerted transition that causes channel opening. The mechanism by which voltage-sensor activation is coupled to the gating of the pore is still not understood. Here we show that the carbon-monoxide releasing molecule 2 (CORM-2) is an allosteric inhibitor of the Kv2.1 channel and that its inhibitory properties derive from the CORM-2 ability to largely reduce the voltage dependence of the opening transition, uncoupling voltage-sensor activation from the concerted opening transition. We additionally demonstrate that CORM-2 modulates Shaker K+-channels in a similar manner. Our data suggest that the mechanism of inhibition by CORM-2 may be common to voltage-activated channels and that this compound should be a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of electromechanical coupling.

https://openalex.org/W2028747797,"Down-regulation of overabundant interleukin (IL)-8 present in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways could ease excessive neutrophil burden and its deleterious consequences for the lung. IL-8 production in airway epithelial cells, stimulated with e.g. inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, is regulated by several signaling pathways including nuclear factor (NF)-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). We previously demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone and ibuprofen suppress NF-κB; however, only dexamethasone down-regulates cytokine-induced IL-8, highlighting the importance of non-NF-κB mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that down-regulation of cytokine-induced IL-8 requires modulation of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1/p38 MAPK/mRNA stability pathway. The effects of dexamethasone (5 nm) and ibuprofen (480 μm) on this pathway and IL-8 were studied in CF (CFTE29o-, CFBE41o-) and non-CF (1HAEo-) airway epithelial cells. We observed that dexamethasone, but not ibuprofen, destabilizes IL-8 mRNA and up-regulates MKP-1 mRNA. Further, siRNA silencing of MKP-1, via p38 MAPK, leads to IL-8 overproduction and diminishes the anti-IL-8 potential of dexamethasone. However, MKP-1 overexpression does not significantly alter IL-8 production. By contrast, direct inhibition of p38 MAPK (inhibitor SB203580) efficiently suppresses IL-8 with potency comparable with dexamethasone. Similar to dexamethasone, SB203580 decreases IL-8 mRNA stability. Dexamethasone does not affect p38 MAPK activation, which excludes its effects upstream of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, normal levels of MKP-1 are necessary for a full anti-IL-8 potential of pharmacological agents; however, efficient pharmacological down-regulation of cytokine-induced IL-8 also requires direct effects on p38 MAPK and mRNA stability independently of MKP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2064712531,"The metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively investigated because its processing generates the amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ), which is a likely cause of Alzheimer disease. Much prior research has focused on APP processing using transgenic constructs and heterologous cell lines. Work to date in native neuronal cultures suggests that Aβ is produced in very large amounts. We sought to investigate APP metabolism and Aβ production simultaneously under more physiological conditions in vivo and in vitro using cultured rat cortical neurons and live pigs. We found in cultured neurons that both APP and Aβ are secreted rapidly and at extremely high rates into the extracellular space (2-4 molecules/neuron/s for Aβ). Little APP is degraded outside of the pathway that leads to extracellular release. Two metabolic pools of APP are identified, one that is metabolized extremely rapidly (t1/2;) = 2.2 h), and another, surface pool, composed of both synaptic and extrasynaptic elements, that turns over very slowly. Aβ release and accumulation in the extracellular medium can be accounted for stoichiometrically by the extracellular release of β-cleaved forms of the APP ectodomain. Two α-cleavages of APP occur for every β-cleavage. Consistent with the results seen in cultured neurons, an extremely high rate of Aβ production and secretion from the brain was seen in juvenile pigs. In summary, our experiments show an enormous and rapid production and extracellular release of Aβ and the soluble APP ectodomain. A small, slowly metabolized, surface pool of full-length APP is also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1964880132,"Receptor-independent G-protein regulators provide diverse mechanisms for signal input to G-protein-based signaling systems, revealing unexpected functional roles for G-proteins. As part of a broader effort to identify disease-specific regulators for heterotrimeric G-proteins, we screened for such proteins in cardiac hypertrophy using a yeast-based functional screen of mammalian cDNAs as a discovery platform. We report the identification of three transcription factors belonging to the same family, transcription factor E3 (TFE3), microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, and transcription factor EB, as novel receptor-independent activators of G-protein signaling selective for Gα(16). TFE3 and Gα(16) were both up-regulated in cardiac hypertrophy initiated by transverse aortic constriction. In protein interaction studies in vitro, TFE3 formed a complex with Gα(16) but not with Gα(i3) or Gα(s). Although increased expression of TFE3 in heterologous systems had no influence on receptor-mediated Gα(16) signaling at the plasma membrane, TFE3 actually translocated Gα(16) to the nucleus, leading to the induction of claudin 14 expression, a key component of membrane structure in cardiomyocytes. The induction of claudin 14 was dependent on both the accumulation and activation of Gα(16) by TFE3 in the nucleus. These findings indicate that TFE3 and Gα(16) are up-regulated under pathologic conditions and are involved in a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation via the relocalization and activation of Gα(16)."
https://openalex.org/W2060160430,"Previously, we reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) activated in the mid-stage of skeletal muscle differentiation promotes myogenic differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we investigated an activity of MEK1 for MyoD. Activated MEK1 associates with MyoD in the nucleus of differentiating myoblasts. In vitro kinase assay using active MEK1, a (32)P-labeled protein band corresponding to GST-MyoD was observed but not to mutant GST-MyoD-Y156F. Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous MyoD was detected with a specific anti-pMyoD-Y156 antibody; however, this response was blocked by PD184352, a MEK-specific inhibitor. These results indicate that activated MEK1 phosphorylates the MyoD-Y156 residue directly. Interestingly, the protein level of mutant MyoD-Y156F decreased compared with that of wild type but was recovered in the presence of lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor. The protein level of MyoD-Y156E, which mimics phosphorylation at Tyr-156, was above that of wild type, indicating that the phosphorylation protects MyoD from the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition, the low protein level of MyoD-Y156F was recovered over that of wild type by an additional mutation at Leu-164, a critical binding residue of MAFbx/AT-1, a Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) E3-ubiquitin ligase. The amount of MyoD co-precipitated with MAFbx/AT-1 also was reduced in the presence of active MEK1. Thus, these results suggested that the phosphorylation probably interrupts the binding of MAFbx/AT-1 to MyoD and thereby increases its stability. Collectively, our results suggest that MEK1 activated in differentiating myoblasts stimulates muscle differentiation by phosphorylating MyoD-Y156, which results in MyoD stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2073795572,"Heparan sulfates (HS) are highly modified sugar polymers in multicellular organisms that function in cell adhesion and cellular responses to protein signaling. Functionally distinct, cell type-dependent HS modification patterns arise as the result of a conserved network of enzymes that catalyze deacetylations, sulfations, and epimerizations in specific positions of the sugar residues. To understand the genetic interactions of the enzymes during the HS modification process, we have measured the composition of HS purified from mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans. From these measurements we have developed a genetic network model of HS modification. We find the interactions to be highly recursive positive feed-forward and negative feedback loops. Our genetic analyses show that the HS C-5 epimerase hse-5, the HS 2-O-sulfotransferase hst-2, or the HS 6-O-sulfotransferase hst-6 inhibit N-sulfation. In contrast, hse-5 stimulates both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation and, hst-2 and hst-6 inhibit 6-O- and 2-O-sulfation, respectively. The effects of hst-2 and hst-6 on N-sulfation, 6-O-sulfation, and 2-O-sulfation appear largely dependent on hse-5 function. This core of regulatory interactions is further modulated by 6-O-endosulfatase activity (sul-1). 47% of all 6-O-sulfates get removed from HS and this editing process is dependent on hst-2, thereby providing additional negative feedback between 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation.

Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These diverse binding capabilities are determined by distinct patterns of saccharide modifications. Cell type-specific modification patterns arise as the result of the action of an evolutionarily conserved network of enzymes that catalyze specific epimerization and sulfations of the sugar chain. How these enzymes interact during the HS modification process is the subject of this report. HS is a modification product of a polymer of alternating glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (3Lindahl U. Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Polymer modification is not uniform nor does it go to completion, therefore the resulting glycans are chemically heterogeneous. Modification begins with the removal of acetyl groups from GlcNAc by the dual specificity enzyme N-deacetylase/sulfotransferase followed by N-sulfation of glucosamine by N-deacetylase/sulfotransferase (3Lindahl U. Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). N-Sulfation occurs as a prerequisite for subsequent glucuronyl C-5 epimerization and O-linked sulfations (3Lindahl U. Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). C-5 epimerization is the process of converting GlcA to isomeric iduronic acid (IdoA). The resultant pattern of modifications consists of continuous stretches of N-sulfated and O-sulfated domains (NS domains) interspersed between continuous stretches of unmodified domains (NA domains) with short transition zones of alternating modified and unmodified saccharides (NS/NA domains) between them (3Lindahl U. Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The processes regulating extent and distribution of these domains of modifications is not well understood. HS modification patterns are dependent on cell type, developmental stage, and possibly the type of core protein (4Li F. Shi W. Capurro M. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Shworak N.W. Kojima T. Rosenberg R.D. Haemostasis. 1993; 23: 161-176PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tveit H. Dick G. Skibeli V.

The nature of this regulation is an important unanswered question regarding HS synthesis (3Lindahl U. Li J.P. Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 276: 105-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Several HS biosynthetic and modification enzymes have been shown to physically interact or to exhibit co-dependent subcellular localization. For example, the heparan polymerizing enzymes EXT1 and EXT2 interact with each other and EXT2 interacts with N-deacetylase/sulfotransferase (9Presto J. Thuveson M. Carlsson P. Busse M. Wilén M. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of C-5 epimerase and Hs2st are mutually dependent suggesting assembly into a complex (10Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These and other observations led to the hypothesis that heparan synthesis and modification occurs in the context of an organized quaternary complex named the “GAGosome” (9Presto J. Thuveson M. Carlsson P. Busse M. Wilén M. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). One prediction of the GAGosome concept is that the concentration and spatial organization of the enzymes within the Golgi should strongly influence HS modification patterns. Genetic analyses of individual enzymes have been reported in a variety of experimental contexts. One general concept that has emerged from these studies is that loss of an individual enzyme by mutation affects modifications not catalyzed by that enzyme, for example, loss of the HS 2-O-sulfotransferase in mice or flies leads to an increase in 6-O-sulfation (12Kamimura K.

These effects are not limited to modifications believed to occur after the step catalyzed by the mutant gene. For example, both C-5 epimerase and HS 2-O-sulfotransferase mutants display an increase in N-sulfation (14Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A.

Therefore, there exists a set of interactions between the modification genes that remains unexplained. The control of heparan modifications undoubtedly results from a hierarchy of regulatory interactions, likely including a combination of substrate specificity and availability, physical interaction between the enzymes, trafficking of enzymes and substrates through the secretion pathway, transcription control of enzyme mRNA, translational control of protein production, and finally post-translational modification of the modification enzymes. To gain insight into the complex process of heparan modifications in vivo we have systematically perturbed HS modifications in Caenorhabditis elegans, using deletion and missense mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in HS modification. Using complete enzymatic depolymerization of the HS chains and separation of the resulting disaccharide mixture by reverse phase-ion pair liquid chromatography, we measured the HS disaccharide composition enabling us to determine the individual disaccharide fractions and the degree of sulfation for each mutant and mutant combination. From these measurements we have developed a comprehensive model of HS modification gene (referred throughout as HSMGs) interactions that forms the basis for understanding HS biosynthesis in metazoans. All strains used for biochemical analysis were maintained at 20 °C on NGM plates seeded with streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli OP50. For glycosaminoglycan production, worms were grown for 4 days in liquid culture. One or two, 250-ml cultures of worms were lyophilized, then resuspended in 10 ml of acetone and disrupted with a Fisher brand Polytron for 2 min at half-power. The homogenate was de-lipidated in acetone, clarified by centrifugation, and lyophilized. 150–600 mg of acetone-dried worm powder was solubilized, and crude GAGs were purified as described by Toyoda et al. (17Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The crude GAGs were frozen and stored at −80 °C. Frozen samples were thawed and incubated with 800 μl of DEAE for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 5 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Glycosaminoglycans were eluted by incubating in 800 μl of 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, for 10 min. The elution was repeated three times and the resulting fractions were pooled and desalted on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Desalted glycosaminoglycans were lyophilized and resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water. The samples were digested with a mixture containing 1 mIU each of heparinase I, heparinase II, and heparinase III (Ibex, Montreal, Canada) in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 2 mm calcium acetate for 5 h at 37 °C. After digestion, the HS disaccharides were isolated by filtration using an YM-10 microcon filtration device (Fisher). The protocol for determining the unsaturated disaccharide composition of heparan sulfate was essentially as described (17Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with variations on the columns used. Briefly, the chromatographic equipment included a U3000 HPLC from Dionex, two single piston pumps from Eldex Laboratories, a RF2000 fluorescence detector from Dionex with a 12-μl flow cell volume, a dry reaction bath (FH-40) and a thermocontroller (TC-55) from Brinkman Instruments. The samples were analyzed using a Dionex C18 3-μm Acclaim 120 column (2.1 × 150 mm) or a Senshu Pak C22 3-μm Docosil column (2 × 100 mm) with comparable results. The flow rates were 0.300 ml/min for the U3000 gradient pump and 0.175 ml/min for the reaction pumps. The buffers were: Buffer A, water; Buffer B, 200 mm NaCl; Buffer C, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate; and Buffer D, 50% acetonitrile, with an injection volume = 20 μl. Initial conditions were % B = 1.0, % C = 12.0, and % D = 17.0. The gradient was as follows: 1–55% B over 9.0 min, 55–70% B over 1.5 min, 70% B for 4 min, 1% B for 10 min. C and D were constant at 12 and 17%, respectively. To the effluent from the HPLC, 1.0% NaOH and 0.5% 2-cyanoacetamide, respectively, were added as reactants by the Eldex pumps at 0.175 ml/min each. The mixture was passed through a reaction coil (0.25 mm inner diameter × 15 m long) set in a dry reaction temperature controlled chamber set at 125 °C and monitored fluorometrically (excitation wavelength, 346 nm; emission wavelength, 410 nm). Peaks were identified based on the retention times of known unsaturated chondroitin and HS disaccharide standards (V-labs, Covington, LA). The relative amount of each disaccharide is expressed as a percent of the total disaccharides determined. We have applied the method of Toyoda et al. (17Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J.

Open table in a new tab To systematically interrogate and quantify the contribution of individual HSMGs to the genetic control of HS modifications, we removed individual HSMGs and analyzed the resulting HS composition. We first analyzed HS from animals with the hse-5(tm472) deletion allele, predicted to result in complete loss of function of the sole HS C-5 glucuronic acid epimerase hse-5 in C. elegans (20Bülow H.E. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The HS disaccharide composition of the hse-5(tm472) allele differs from control HS in three principal ways. First, the amount of N-sulfated disaccharides increases from 38% in the control to 64% in the hse-5 mutant (Fig. 1C, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S1A). Second, the amount of 2-O-sulfated HS disaccharides decreases from 27% in control animals to 3% in the mutant. Finally, the amount of 6-O-sulfated disaccharides increases from 12% in the control to 18% in the mutant. These results indicate that hse-5 exerts a stimulatory effect on 2-O-sulfation and inhibits 6-O-sulfation. We next analyzed HS from animals carrying the deletion alleles hst-2(ok595) (20Bülow H.E.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), both predicted to represent complete loss of function alleles of the HS 2-O-sulfotransferase hst-2 or the sole C. elegans HS 6-O-sulfotransferase hst-6, respectively. HS from hst-2(ok595) mutant animals contains no detectable 2-O-sulfated HS disaccharides and the amount of N-sulfated disaccharides and 6-O-sulfated disaccharides increase from 42% in the control to 58% in the mutant and, 11% in the control to 27% in the mutant, respectively (Fig. 1C, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S1B). Furthermore, we find that HS from the hst-6(ok273) mutant animals completely lack 6-O-sulfation and exhibit an increase in N-sulfation from 41% in the control strain to 46% in the mutant as well as an increase in 2-O-sulfation from 29% in the control strain to 37% in the mutant (Fig. 1C, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S1C). Thus, hst-2 and hst-6 each limit N-sulfation as well as 6-O-sulfation and 2-O-sulfation, respectively. A characteristic feature of the 6-O-sulfate group in HS is that it can be enzymatically removed by the action of a 6-O-endosulfatase (22Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D.

Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), only a single ortholog (sul-1) encoding a 6-O-endosulfatase can be identified in C. elegans (supplemental Fig. S2A). HS from animals harboring a large deletion in the sul-1 locus, predicted to result in complete loss of function (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) display no changes in N-sulfation (42 versus 42%) or 2-O-sulfation (29 versus 26%) compared with HS from control animals (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1D). However, we find an increase in 6-O-sulfation in the sul-1 mutant (19 versus 11% in the control). Therefore the inhibitory input of sul-1 to the steady state 6-O-sulfate phenotype is 8 sulfates/100 disaccharides. Furthermore, the increase in 6-O-sulfation occurs only on the tri-sulfated disaccharide D2S6 and not on the D0S6 disaccharide, suggesting that 6-O-sulfation in C. elegans occurs exclusively in NS domains. In summary, removing any of the individual HSMGs, hse-5, hst-2, or hst-6, in C. elegans results in HS with increased N-sulfation, and 6-O-sulfation (if hse-5 or hst-2 are removed) or 2-O-sulfation (if hst-6 is removed). Furthermore, genetic removal of the only HS 6-O-endosulfatase sul-1 results in increased 6-O-sulfation to a similar extent (47%) as observed in mice (25Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T. Merry C.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We conclude that the basic regulatory principles of HS biosynthesis are conserved from worms to vertebrates. To understand the genetic network governing HS modification in vivo, we conducted double and triple mutant analyses. We first determined, whether individual HSMGs can act independently in controlling N-sulfation. Because the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273)hst-2(ok595) triple mutant is viable (26Bülow H.E. Tjoe N. Townley R.A. Didiano D. van Kuppevelt T.H. Hobert O. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1978-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in C. elegans, the individual contributions of each HSMG can be quantified directly by comparing the N-sulfation phenotype of the triple mutant to the three possible double mutants involving these genes. We find that HS from the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273)hst-2(ok595) triple mutant is more extensively N-sulfated than control HS (72 versus 37% N-sulfation in the control (Table 1)). Interestingly, HS from each of the double mutants analyzed, i.e. hst-2(ok595)hst-6(ok273), hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273), or hse-5(tm472);hst-2(ok595), had marginally reduced N-sulfation compared with the triple mutant (67, 68, or 67 versus 72% in the triple (Table 1)) suggesting that hse-5, hst-2, or hst-6 all have a minor role in restricting N-sulfation that is independent of the other HSMG genes. This interpretation is further corroborated by the following observations. First, both hse-5(tm472);hst-2(ok595) and hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273) have a slightly higher N-sulfation (68 and 67%, Table 1) than the hse-5(tm472) single mutant (64%, Table 1). Thus the minor independent effects of hst-2 or hst-6 on N-sulfation can be detected by both reintroducing the activity of either gene into the triple mutant and removal of either gene from the hse-5(tm472) single mutant. Second, the amount of N-sulfation in the hst-2(ok595)hst-6(ok273) double mutant (67%) is greater than either mutant alone (58% in hst-2(ok595) and 46% in hst-6(ok273), Table 1) demonstrating that both hst-2 and hst-6 can act independently to restrict the extent of N-sulfation. In a complementary manner, we assessed and quantified the ability of the HSMGs to interact with each other to limit the extent of N-sulfation. The hse-5(tm472);hst-2(ok595) double deletion mutant has an N-sulfation content of 67% compared with 64 or 58% in the hse-5(tm472) or hst-2(ok595) mutants, respectively (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3, A-C), demonstrating that hst-2 has a larger inhibitory effect (18%) in the presence of hse-5 than in the absence (3%). A qualitatively similar relationship between hst-6 and hse-5 can be observed from comparing the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273) double mutant (N-sulfation is 67%) to the hse-5(tm472) and hst-6(ok273) single mutants (64 and 46%, respectively) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3, A–C). Thus hst-6 has a greater influence on N-sulfation in the presence of hse-5 than in the absence. In summary, our findings indicate that hse-5 interact with hst-2 and hst-6 to limit the extent of N-sulfation (Fig. 2A). We next asked how HSMGs interact to control 2-O-sulfation. Individual contributions of hse-5 and hst-6 to the 2-O-sulfation phenotype can be determined and quantified by comparing the 2-O-sulfation content of the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273) double mutant to the respective single mutants. Hse-5 has a strong stimulatory effect on 2-O-sulfation (8% in the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273) double mutant versus 37% in hst-6(ok273) single mutant). The effect of hse-5 on 2-O-sulfation is greater in the absence of hst-6 than in its presence indicating an inhibitory effect of hst-6 on 2-O-sulfation. Interestingly, the fraction of 2-O-sulfated disaccharides in the hse-5(tm472);hst-6(ok273) double mu"
https://openalex.org/W2083884752,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) is a transmembrane receptor that integrates multiple signaling pathways. Its cytoplasmic domain serves as docking sites for several adaptor proteins such as the Src homology 2/α-collagen (ShcA), which also binds to several tyrosine kinase receptors such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor. However, the physiological significance of the physical interaction between LRP1 and ShcA, and whether this interaction modifies tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, are still unknown. Here we report that LRP1 forms a complex with the IGF-1 receptor, and that LRP1 is required for ShcA to become sensitive to IGF-1 stimulation. Upon IGF-1 treatment, ShcA is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocates to the plasma membrane only in the presence of LRP1. This leads to the recruitment of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) to ShcA, and activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Conversely, in the absence of ShcA, IGF-1 signaling bifurcates toward the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and accelerates adipocyte differentiation when cells are stimulated for adipogenesis. These results establish the LRP1-ShcA complex as an essential component in the IGF-1-regulated pathway for MAP kinase and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin activation, and may help to understand the IGF-1 signaling shift from clonal expansion to growth-arrested cells and differentiation during adipogenesis."

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This signaling cascade is conserved in vertebrates, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. TAK1 (a kinase activated by transforming growth factor-β), mitogen-activated protein-kinase-kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7), and MAP kinase (MAPK)-related NEMO-like kinase (NLK) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling (4Ishitani T.

TAK1 activation stimulates NLK activity and down-regulates transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin and TCF/LEF-1. NLK phosphorylates TCF/LEF-1 factors and inhibits the interaction of the β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 complex with DNA (5Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), indicating that the TAK1-NLK pathway negatively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) was originally identified as a binding partner of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and aggregates through its C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ) structure, thereby becoming an active enzyme (6Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of ZIPK in NIH3T3 cells induced apoptosis, whereas a kinase-inactive mutant, ZIPK K42A (KA), failed to induce apoptosis, indicating that ZIPK stimulates apoptosis via its kinase activity (6Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Kögel D. Plöttner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that ZIPK, in collaboration with Daxx and Par-4, induces apoptosis from promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (8Kawai T. Akira S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6174-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the activation of ZIPK and the downstream substrates that mediate its apoptotic activity remain unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that ZIPK specifically interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and enhances its transcriptional activity (9Sato N. Kawai T. Sugiyama K. Muromoto R. Imoto S. Sekine Y. Ishida M. Akira S. Matsuda T. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that leukemia-inhibitory factor induces Thr-265 phosphorylation of ZIPK (10Sato N. Kamada N. Muromoto R. Kawai T. Sugiyama K. Watanabe T. Imoto S. Sekine Y. Ohbayashi N. Ishida M. Akira S. Matsuda T. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 103: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is critical for its kinase activation, suggesting that leukemia-inhibitory factor signaling mediates ZIPK/STAT3 activation through phosphorylation of Thr-265. In the current study, we focused on ZIPK as a novel transcriptional regulator of Wnt signaling and demonstrated a functional link between ZIPK and NLK-mediated repression of Wnt signaling. LiCl was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Expression vectors for TOPFLASH, FOPFLASH, TCF4, and Wnt3a were kindly provided by Dr. S.

Gal4-ZIPK kinase domain (KD) was constructed by fusing the coding sequence for the kinase domain (amino acids 1–125) of ZIPK in-frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (12Ohbayashi N.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 cells were transformed with pGal4-STAT4 and then mated with Y187 cells containing a pretransformed mouse 11-day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech), and ∼2.6 × 106 colonies were screened as described previously (9Sato N.

Plasmid DNAs derived from positive clones were extracted from the yeast and sequenced. A human cervix carcinoma cell line, HeLa, and a human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line, 293T, were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. A human colon carcinoma cell line, SW480, was maintained in L-15 medium containing 10% FCS. A human colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116, was maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% FCS with 2 mm l-glutamine. A human colon carcinoma cell line, Caco2, was maintained in DMEM containing 20% FCS. HeLa cells were transfected using jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection, Strasbourg, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells were transfected using a standard calcium precipitation protocol (13Ikeda O.

The siRNAs targeting human ZIPK used in this study were as follows: ZIPK-1, 5′-CCAACAUCUCAGCCGUGAATT-3′; ZIPK-2, 5′-CCAGCUUGCCGCCCAACAATT-3′. Control siRNA was obtained from Qiagen (nonsilencing; catalog No. 1022076). HeLa or SW480 cells were plated on 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and incubated with an siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) mixture at 37 °C for 4 h followed by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FCS (13Ikeda O.

HeLa cells were further transfected with or without TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH using jetPEI as described above. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were left untreated or were treated with LiCl (30 mm) for an additional 12 h and then assayed for their luciferase activities using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three or more independent experiments were carried out for each assay. Cells were harvested, and total RNAs prepared by using Iso-Gen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) were used in RT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed using the RT-PCR High-Plus kit (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). The primers used for RT-PCR were: cyclin D1, 5′-GCTGCTCCTGGTGAACAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCAATGAAATCGTGCGGG-3′ (antisense); SURVIVIN, 5′-GGACCACCGCATCTCTACAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GACAGAAAGGAAAGCGCAAC-3′ (antisense); human ZIPK (hZIPK), 5′-TGCACGACATCTTCGAGAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCTTGTCCAGCAGCATGA-3′ (antisense); and mouse ZIPK (mZIPK), 5′-TCGCACACTTTGACCTGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCGCTCAGGAGGATGTAG-3′ (antisense). qRT-PCR analyses of the respective genes as well as the control actin mRNA transcripts were carried out using the Assay-on-DemandTM gene-specific fluorescently labeled TaqMan MGB probe in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (13Ikeda O.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (13Ikeda O. Sekine Y. Yasui T. Oritani K. Sugiyma K. Muromoto R. Ohbayashi N. Yoshimura A. Matsuda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5027-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filters were then immunoblotted with each antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore). In vitro kinase reactions were preformed as described (14Matsuda T. Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Sekine Y. Ihle J.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, immune complex of TCF4 were washed in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2) and mixed with 5μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for 30 min. The products of these reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells were transfected with control or ZIPK siRNA followed by transfection with an expression vector for TCF4. At 36 h after transfection, ChIP-enriched DNAs were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (15Barré B. Vigneron A. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15673-15681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Wu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Yang X. Wang Y. Ren F. Liu H. Zhai Y. Jia B. Yu J. Chang Z. J. Biol.

Primers used for the cyclin D1 promoter were: 5′-CACCTCCACCTCACCCCCTAAATCC-3′ and 5′-ACTCCCCTGTAGTCCGTGTGACGTT-3′. RT-PCR was used to quantify the precipitated DNA fragments. The numbers of viable SW480 cells after the indicated treatments were measured using a WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) assay (Cell Counting Kit-8, Wako Pure Chemicals) (17Muromoto R. Ishida M. Sugiyama K. Sekine Y. Oritani K. Shimoda K. Matsuda T. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of WST-8 solution was added to the cells in each well and incubated for 2 h. Absorbency was measured at a test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The significant differences between group means were determined by Student's t test. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA library using the kinase domain of ZIPK as bait (9Sato N. Kawai T. Sugiyama K. Muromoto R. Imoto S. Sekine Y. Ishida M. Akira S. Matsuda T. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). From a screen of 2.6 × 106 transformants, we identified several positive clones. Sequence analysis revealed that one of them encoded the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–125) of NLK. We first examined whether NLK binds ZIPK in mammalian cells. 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged ZIPK together with Myc-tagged NLK. Western blot analysis revealed that the immunoprecipitates with an anti-HA antibody (for ZIPK) contained NLK protein in 293T cells (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possibility that the interaction between ZIPK and NLK was due to overexpression, we examined direct binding between endogenous ZIPK and NLK in HeLa cells by co-immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates with anti-ZIPK antibody, but not those with control antibody, contained endogenous NLK proteins. An anti-NLK antibody also co-immunoprecipitated ZIPK, indicating that the binding of ZIPK to NLK occurs at physiological expression levels (Fig. 1B). Next, to delineate the regions of ZIPK involved in the ZIPK-NLK interaction, various deletion constructs of Myc-ZIPK (Fig. 1C) were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG-tagged NLK. As shown in Fig. 1D, the kinase domain of ZIPK (ZIPK KD) as well as full-length ZIPK (ZIPK FL) interacted with NLK. Using a series of deletion mutants of NLK (Fig. 1E), we also determined the NLK domain involved in the interaction with ZIPK. As shown in Fig. 1F, both the N-terminal (NLK N) and kinase domains (NLK KD) of NLK interacted individually with ZIPK. To clarify the physiological significance of the molecular interactions between ZIPK and NLK, we focused on the effect of ZIPK on NLK-mediated suppression of Wnt signaling. Recently, NLK has been shown to act as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling by interacting with and phosphorylating TCF/LEF-1 family proteins on two serine/threonine residues located in the central region (5Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation by NLK inhibits DNA binding by the β-catenin-TCF complex. We first tested whether ZIPK affects Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation by using the established β-catenin/LEF/TCF luciferase reporter (TOPFLASH) (18Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destrée O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). The TOPFLASH reporter and vectors expressing ZIPK and/or NLK were transfected into 293T cells, and the cells were then treated with LiCl, which activated TOPFLASH activity in 293T cells (Fig. 2A). In this situation, LiCl did not activate the reporter harboring mutated LEF/TCF-consensus sites (FOPFLASH) (data not shown). LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activity was reduced by expression of NLK as described previously (19Röttinger E. Croce J. Lhomond G. Besnardeau L. Gache C. Lepage T. Development. 2006; 133: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ectopic expression of ZIPK enhanced LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activity (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, NLK-mediated reduction of LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activity was restored by ZIPK expression. We also tested whether the kinase activity of ZIPK is required for ZIPK-mediated enhanced Wnt signaling. TOPFLASH reporter and vectors containing wild-type (WT) ZIPK or a kinase-dead mutant of ZIPK, ZIPK K42A, were transfected into 293T cells, and the cells were then treated with LiCl. LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activity was enhanced by expression of ZIPK WT and KA (Fig. 2B), indicating that the kinase activity of ZIPK is not necessary for ZIPK-mediated enhanced Wnt signaling. To further explore the involvement of ZIPK in Wnt signaling, we used siRNA to reduce the endogenous expression of ZIPK in HeLa cells. Specific siRNAs for ZIPK (ZIPK-1 and ZIPK-2) or a control siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells, and aliquots of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, which confirmed the reduced expression of ZIPK (Fig. 2C). First, we determined the effects of these siRNAs on LiCl-induced TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH activation in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, siRNA-mediated reduced expression of ZIPK resulted in a significant reduction of LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activation. We further tested whether the effect of ZIPK siRNAs was specific for TOPFLASH. We then examined the effect of ZIPK siRNAs on TNF-α-induced NF-κB luciferase or IL-6 promoter luciferase. However, we did not observe any significant reduction of TNF-α-induced luciferase activities by ZIPK knockdown (data not shown), suggesting that the effect of ZIPK siRNAs is specific for TOPFLASH. Furthermore, reduced LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activation in the ZIPK knockdown cells was restored by overexpression of a mouse ZIPK cDNA (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we concluded that ZIPK increases LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activation. We also examined the effects of these siRNAs on Wnt3a-induced TOPFLASH activation in HeLa cells. siRNA-mediated reduced expression of ZIPK also resulted in a significant reduction of Wnt3a-induced TOPFLASH activation (Fig. 2E), indicating that ZIPK positively regulates canonical Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation in HeLa cells. We further tested whether ZIPK knockdown would have any effect on the LiCl-induced increase of β-catenin protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2F, siRNA-mediated reduced expression of ZIPK showed no effect on the LiCl-induced increase of β-catenin protein levels. We also investigated the recruitment of β-catenin to the cyclin D1 promoter region with ChIP analysis. When we transfected with TCF4 in control or ZIPK siRNA-treated HeLa cells, LiCl-induced TCF4-mediated binding of β-catenin on the cyclin D1 promoter was markedly reduced in ZIPK siRNA-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2G). Therefore, the β-catenin-TCF4 complex may be a direct target of ZIPK in the nucleus. To further understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for ZIPK-mediated enhancement of Wnt signaling, we focused on the restoration of NLK-mediated repression of Wnt signaling by ZIPK. NLK-mediated repression of Wnt signaling is initiated by a direct interaction between the NLK and TCF family proteins (5Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether ZIPK interacts directly with TCF4. Expression vectors for Myc-tagged ZIPK or NLK with FLAG-tagged TCF4 were transfected into 293T cells. The cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, a significant interaction of ZIPK with TCF4 was observed, whereas NLK also bound to TCF4 as described previously (5Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), indicating that both ZIPK and NLK associate with TCF4. Similar interactions between ZIPK and TFC4 were also observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Next, to determine the regions of ZIPK involved in the ZIPK-TCF4 interaction, various deletion constructs of Myc-ZIPK (Fig. 1C) were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG-tagged TCF4. As shown in Fig. 3B, the kinase domain but not the LZ domain of ZIPK interacted with TCF4. These findings allowed us to investigate whether ZIPK affects complex formation between NLK and TCF4. When we co-expressed Myc-tagged ZIPK and NLK and FLAG-tagged TCF4 in 293T cells, the binding of NLK to TCF4 disappeared in the presence of ZIPK (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the interaction between ZIPK and NLK disrupts NLK-TCF4 complex formation. This possibility is, in part, supported by the fact that TCF4 recognized the same NLK-binding domain of ZIPK (Fig. 3B). We also tested whether the kinase activity of ZIPK was required for ZIPK-mediated disruption of NLK-TCF4 complex formation. When we co-expressed FLAG-tagged NLK, Myc-tagged TCF4, and FLAG-tagged ZIPK WT or KA in 293T cells, the binding of NLK to TCF4 decreased in the presence of either ZIPK WT or KA (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the kinase activity of ZIPK is not required for ZIPK-mediated disruption of NLK-TCF4 complex formation. We further tested the effect of ZIPK on the phosphorylation of TCF4 by NLK. Expression vectors for Myc-tagged NLK or ZIPK WT or KA together with those for FLAG-tagged TCF4 were transfected into 293T cells. The cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and subjected to in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3E, a robust phosphorylation of TCF4 by NLK was observed. Importantly, co-expression of ZIPK WT or KA with NLK resulted in a significantly reduced phosphorylation of TCF4 by NLK, indicating that ZIPK-mediated disruption of NLK-TCF4 complex formation influences phosphorylation of TCF4 by NLK. As described above, the Wnt signal is mediated by β-catenin, a transcription factor that is normally degraded in the cytosol by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by a large protein complex composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, Axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) initiates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt signaling, phosphorylation of β-catenin is inhibited, resulting in the accumulation and translocation of β-catenin into the nuclei, thereby inducing the expression of several genes such as c-myc and cyclin D. Mutations in APC, Axin, and β-catenin, resulting in abolished β-catenin ubiquitylation, are found in many human cancers (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar), indicating that the inappropriate activation of Wnt signaling plays an important role in human cancers. Most colorectal cancers have mutations of APC or β-catenin that result in the stabilization of β-catenin and activation of β-catenin target genes, ultimately leading to cancer. Finally we tested whether ZIPK was involved in gene expression and cell growth of colon cancer cells by using human SW480 colon carcinoma cells that carry an APC mutation. Indeed, we observed that an anti-ZIPK antibody co-immunoprecipitated NLK (Fig. 4A), indicating that the binding of ZIPK to NLK occurs at physiological expression levels in SW480 cells. A specific siRNA for ZIPK-1, ZIPK-2, or a control siRNA was transfected into SW480 cells, and aliquots of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, which confirmed reduced expression of ZIPK (Fig. 4B). The reduced protein levels of ZIPK were observed for at least 5 days after the ZIPK siRNA treatment (data not shown). First, we determined the effects of these siRNAs on TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH activation in SW480 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, siRNA-mediated reduced expression of ZIPK resulted in a significant reduction of TOPFLASH activation in SW480 cells. We next examined the effect of these siRNAs on β-catenin/TCF-mediated gene expression by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4D, the expression of β-catenin/TCF-mediated genes involved in Wnt signaling, including cyclin D1 and SURVIVIN, was reduced by ZIPK knockdown. Furthermore, the reduced expression of these genes in the ZIPK knockdown cells was significantly restored by overexpression of a mouse ZIPK cDNA (Fig. 4E). Therefore, ZIPK positively regulates β-catenin/TCF-mediated gene expression in SW480 cells. We further examined the effect of ZIPK knockdown on the growth of SW480 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, ZIPK knockdown in SW480 cells induced a significant decrease in cell growth, suggesting that ZIPK acts as a positive regulator in Wnt/β-catenin signaling and enhances SW480 cell growth. We also showed growth suppression by ZIPK siRNA treatment in other colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and Caco-2) (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 5ZIPK knockdown influences cell growth in colon carcinoma cells. A, SW480 cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with control, ZIPK-1, or ZIPK-2 siRNA. At 24 h after transfection, siRNA-transfected cells were harvested and seeded into 96-well plates (5 × 103/well). At the indicated time point, cell viability was determined by using Cell Counting Kit-8. Shown is a representative experiment, which was repeated at least three times with similar results. B and C, HCT116 (B) or Caco2 (C) cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with control, ZIPK-1, or ZIPK-2 siRNA. At 24 h after transfection, siRNA-transfected cells were harvested and seeded into 96-well plates (5 × 103/well). An approximately 60% reduction of ZIPK mRNA in HCT116 cells and 50% reduction of ZIPK mRNA in Caco2 by ZIKP siRNAs was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). At the indicated time point, cell viability was determined by using Cell Counting Kit-8.

Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is tightly regulated by a variety of interacting proteins. Recently, many factors have been demonstrated to interact with the β-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complex, which includes a group of factors such as TATA-binding protein (20Hecht A. Litterst C.M. Huber O.

The mechanisms of action of the negative regulators of the β-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complex are diverse. For example, NLK phosphorylates TCF4 to mediate the dissociation of the β-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complex from DNA (5Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NARF, an NLK-associated ring finger protein, mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of TCF4/LEF-1 (24Yamada M. Ohnishi J.

ICAT (inhibitor of catenin) inhibits the interaction of β-catenin with TCF4 (25Tago K. Nakamura T. Nishita M. Hyodo J. Nagai S. Murata Y. Adachi S. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Shibuya H. Akiyama T.

Yang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3323-3333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Chibby, a nuclear β-catenin-associated antagonist of Wnt signaling, competes with LEF-1 for binding with β-catenin (27Takemaru K. Yamaguchi S. Lee Y.S. Zhang Y. Carthew R.W. Moon R.T. Nature. 2003; 422: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). APC enhances the ability of C-terminal binding protein to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complexes (28Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). P15RS, a p15INK4b-related gene involved in G1/S progression, interacts with both β-catenin and TCF4 and inhibits the formation of the β-catenin-TCF4 complex (16Wu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Yang X. Wang Y. Ren F. Liu H. Zhai Y. Jia B. Yu J. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34621-34631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We show here that ZIPK functions like a co-activator to enhance the activity of the β-catenin-TCF4/LEF-1 complex by competing with NLK on TCF4. ZIPK is also known as DAPK3. ZIPK and DAPK1 constitute members of a family of death-associated protein kinases that includes DAPK2, DRAK1, and DRAK2 (29Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), all of which are implicated in executing apoptosis. Furthermore, evidence that the gene encoding DAPK may function as a tumor suppressor has been presented (30Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A. Nature. 1997; 390: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 31Raveh T. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. DePinho R.A. Kimchi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the negative regulatory roles of DAPK family proteins. Therefore, a novel function of ZIPK as a positive regulator in Wnt signaling appears attractive. The kinase domain of ZIPK shows strong homology to that of death-associated protein kinase 1(DAPK1) (6Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of siRNA-mediated reduced expression of DAPK1 or DAPK2 on LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activation in HeLa cells. siRNA-mediated reduced expression of DAPK1 or DAPK2 resulted in no significant reduction of LiCl-induced TOPFLASH activation (data not shown), suggesting that ZIPK specifically regulates canonical Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation in HeLa cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that another DAPK family kinase, DRAK2, has lymphoid-specific expression and plays an essential role in maintaining the survival of T cells activated under specific contexts (32McGargill M.A. Wen B.G. Walsh C.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, DAPK has also been shown to be a positive regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in response to growth factor activation (33Stevens C. Lin Y. Harrison B. Burch L. Ridgway R.A. Sansom O. Hupp T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 334-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that DAPK family kinases may affect not only apoptosis but also cell survival. Further detailed work will be required to clarify the molecular mechanisms of ZIPK-mediated modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. It will also provide insights into the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for Wnt/β-catenin-mediated malignancies."

The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins is finely tuned by the dynamic balance between protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (also known as Met), a receptor protein tyrosine kinase, is a major regulator of proliferation, migration, and survival for many epithelial cell types. We report here that receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTP-β) specifically dephosphorylates Met and thereby regulates its function. Expression of RPTP-β, but not other RPTP family members or catalytically inactive forms of RPTP-β, reduces hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated Met tyrosine phosphorylation in HEK293 cells. Expression of RPTP-β in primary human keratinocytes reduces both basal and HGF-induced Met phosphorylation at tyrosine 1356 and inhibits downstream MEK1/2 and Erk activation. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous RPTP-β increases basal and HGF-stimulated Met phosphorylation at tyrosine 1356 in primary human keratinocytes. Purified RPTP-β intracellular domain preferentially dephosphorylates purified Met at tyrosine 1356 in vitro. In addition, the substrate-trapping mutant of RPTP-β specifically interacts with Met in intact cells. Expression of RPTP-β in human primary keratinocytes reduces HGF induction of VEGF expression, proliferation, and motility. Taken together, the above data indicate that RPTP-β is a key regulator of Met function.

https://openalex.org/W2044405767,"HoxA10 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is maximally expressed in myeloid progenitor cells. An increase in HoxA10 expression correlates with poor prognosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this scenario, HoxA10 overexpression in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative neoplasm that advances AML over time. Despite the importance of HoxA10 for leukemogenesis, few genuine HoxA10 target genes have been identified. The current study identified ARIH2, the gene encoding Triad1, as a HoxA10 target gene. We identified two distinct HoxA10-binding cis elements in the ARIH2 promoter and determined that HoxA10 activates these cis elements in myeloid cells. Triad1 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and we found that HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid cells exhibited a Triad1-dependent increase in protein ubiquitination. Therefore, these studies have identified the regulation of protein ubiquitination as a novel function of Hox transcription factors. Forced overexpression of Triad1 has been show previously to inhibit colony formation by myeloid progenitor cells. In contrast, HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells exhibited increased proliferation in response to low doses of various cytokines. We found that Triad1 knockdown further increased cytokine-induced proliferation in HoxA10-overexpressing cells. Therefore, these studies have identified a HoxA10 target gene that antagonizes the overall influence of overexpressed HoxA10 on myeloproliferation. This result suggests that the consequences of HoxA10 overexpression reflect a balance between the target genes that facilitate and antagonize proliferation. These results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in AML with Hox overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2076613705,"The common polymorphism of p53 at codon 72, either encoding proline or arginine, has drawn attention as a genetic factor associated with clinical outcome or cancer risk for the last 2 decades. We now show that these two polymorphic variants differ in protein structure, especially within the N-terminal region and, as a consequence, differ in post-translational modification at the N terminus. The arginine form (p53-72R) shows significantly enhanced phosphorylation at Ser-6 and Ser-20 compared with the proline form (p53-72P). We also show diminished Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53-72R compared with p53-72P, which is at least partly brought about by higher levels of phosphorylation at Ser-20 in p53-72R. Furthermore, enhanced p21 expression in p53-72R-expressing cells, which is dependent on phosphorylation at Ser-6, was demonstrated. Differential p21 expression between the variants was also observed upon activation of TGF-β signaling. Collectively, we demonstrate a novel molecular difference and simultaneously suggest a difference in the tumor-suppressing function of the variants."

We investigated the interaction of a highly potent insect-selective scorpion depressant β-toxin, Lqh-dprIT3, from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus with insect sodium channels from Blattella germanica (BgNav). Like other scorpion β-toxins, Lqh-dprIT3 shifts the voltage dependence of activation of BgNav channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes to more negative membrane potentials but only after strong depolarizing prepulses. Notably, among 10 BgNav splice variants tested for their sensitivity to the toxin, only BgNav1-1 was hypersensitive due to an L1285P substitution in IIIS1 resulting from a U-to-C RNA-editing event. Furthermore, charge reversal of a negatively charged residue (E1290K) at the extracellular end of IIIS1 and the two innermost positively charged residues (R4E and R5E) in IIIS4 also increased the channel sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3. Besides enhancement of toxin sensitivity, the R4E substitution caused an additional 20-mV negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation of toxin-modified channels, inducing a unique toxin-modified state. Our findings provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of the domain III voltage-sensing module in the action of scorpion β-toxins.

Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in most excitable cells. They consist of a large pore-forming α-subunit that is associated with a variable number of smaller subunits in different excitable tissues (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). The α-subunit comprises four repeat homologous domains (I–IV), each having six membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6). The S1–S4 segments constitute the voltage-sensing module. S4 in each domain contains four to seven positively charged residues and moves outward in response to membrane depolarization, which initiates the channel activation process (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). The S5 and S6 segments and their connecting P loops compose the pore-forming module. Each reentrant P loop contains two short segments (SS1 and SS2) that span the membrane as a hairpin and form the lining of the pore. Mammals produce functionally and pharmacologically diverse Nav α-subunits by selective expression of distinct sodium channel genes (at least nine in rat and human) in different tissues (2Goldin A.L.

Moreover, Tz1 from Tityus zulianus is especially active at rNav1.4 compared with rNav1.2 and human Nav1.5 (18Leipold E. Hansel A. Borges A. Heinemann S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The prominent activity of Css4 on rNav1.2 and rNav1.4 compared with its very weak effect on rNav1.5 motivated Catterall and co-workers (16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) to analyze each of the 16 extracellular loops of rNav1.5 in the background of rNav1.2. Their analysis revealed that IS5–SS1, IIS1–S2, IIS3–S4, and IIISS2–S6, particularly a G845N substitution in IIS3–S4, play a role in determining toxin preference, suggesting that scorpion β-toxins bind to the S3–S4 loop (16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, differences in potency of the toxin Tz1 on rat muscle, cardiac, and neuronal Nav channels motivated Heinemann and co-workers (18Leipold E. Hansel A. Borges A. Heinemann S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to swap rNav1.2a sequences in the background of rNav1.4. Their analysis revealed that three amino acid residues in the C-terminal pore loop (SS2–S6) of domain III determine the Tz1 preference for the skeletal muscle Nav channel (18Leipold E. Hansel A. Borges A. Heinemann S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To account for enhanced sodium channel activation by Css4, a voltage sensor-trapping model was proposed in which the S4 voltage sensor of domain II (IIS4) is trapped and stabilized in its outward activated position by the scorpion β-toxin (16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu Y. Sampieri F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21332-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Neutralization or reversal of gating charges in the voltage sensor of domain II enhances the action of scorpion β-toxins. According to the classical models of sodium channel gating, the voltage sensors of the sodium channel activate independently, and at least three of them have to be in an activated position for the channel to open (22Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 23Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1952; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For a scorpion β-toxin to shift the threshold of activation, more than one voltage sensor could be affected by the toxins. Bezanilla and co-workers (24Campos F.V. Chanda B. Beirão P.S. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) combined electrophysiological and spectroscopic measurements to determine the structural rearrangements induced by the scorpion β-toxin Ts1 on the rNav1.4 channel. Consistent with studies using Css4, Ts1 binding to the channel has been shown to be restricted to a single binding site in the voltage sensor of domain II, where it traps IIS4 in the activated state. Interestingly, Ts1 binding to S4 of domain II allosterically potentiates activation of the other three voltage sensors at more hyperpolarized potentials. However, it is unknown how voltage-sensing modules in other domains contribute to the voltage sensor trapping by β-toxins. In this study, we analyzed the sensitivity of 10 B. germanica Nav (BgNav) variants (25Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to a potent insect-selective Lqh-dprIT3 depressant toxin (26Strugatsky D. Zilberberg N. Stankiewicz M. Ilan N. Turkov M. Cohen L. Pelhate M. Gilles N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9179-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The discovery of one variant that is hypersensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 led to the identification of the critical effect of Leu-1285 and Glu-1290 in IIIS1 on channel sensitivity to the toxin. We further show that substitutions of the two innermost positively charged residues (R4E and R5E) in IIIS4 also enhance the effect of Lqh-dprIT3. These findings demonstrate that the voltage-sensing module of domain III is critical for the action of the scorpion β-toxin. Of eight Lqh-dprIT3 variants produced by the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, the highly potent variant c, hereafter referred to as Lqh-dprIT3, was produced in recombinant form and analyzed as described previously (26Strugatsky D. Zilberberg N. Stankiewicz M. Ilan N. Turkov M. Cohen L. Pelhate M. Gilles N. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9179-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of BgNav1-1 and BgNav1-1a was performed via PCR using oligonucleotide primers and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the modifications were verified by DNA sequencing. The procedures for oocyte preparation and cRNA injection are identical to those described previously (27Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For robust expression of the BgNav channels, cRNA was co-injected into oocytes with D. melanogaster tipE cRNA (1:1 ratio), which enhances channel expression (28Feng G. Deák P. Chopra M. Hall L.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29Warmke J.W. Reenan R.A. Wang P. Qian S. Arena J.P. Wang J. Wunderler D. Liu K. Kaczorowski G.J. Van der Ploeg L.H. Ganetzky B. Cohen C.J. J. Gen Physiol. 1997; 110: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Methods for two-electrode recording and data analysis were similar to those described previously (30Tan J. Liu Z. Wang R. Huang Z.Y. Chen A.C. Gurevitz M. Dong K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sodium currents were measured with an OC725C oocyte clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Data were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Leak currents were corrected by P/4 subtraction. pCLAMP 8.2 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. The maximal peak sodium current was limited to <2.0 μA to achieve optimal voltage control. The voltage dependence of sodium channel conductance (G) was calculated by measuring the peak current at test potentials ranging from −80 to +65 mV in 5-mV increments and divided by (V − Vrev), where V is the test potential and Vrev is the reversal potential for sodium ions. Peak conductance values were normalized to the maximal peak conductance (Gmax) and fit with a two-state Boltzmann equation of the form G/Gmax = (1 + exp(V − V1/2)/k)−1 or with the sum of two such expressions, where V is the potential of the voltage pulse, V1/2 is the voltage for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. The percentage of channel modification by Lqh-dprIT3 was determined by the percentage of channels with the voltage dependence of activation shifted to negative membrane potentials, which was derived from double Boltzmann fits of the conductance-voltage relationships. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). We first examined a well characterized cockroach sodium channel, BgNav1-1 (27Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for the effect of Lqh-dprIT3. Previous studies showed that, for most of scorpion β-toxins, a strong depolarization prepulse is required for the toxins to induce a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation (11Cestèle S. Catterall W.A. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

For example, a 1-ms depolarizing prepulse to 50 mV followed by a depolarizing test pulse to −65 mV activates Css4-modified Nav1.2 channels but not unmodified channels (16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We initially used a similar protocol to examine the effect of Lqh-dprIT3 on BgNav1-1 channels and found that a brief depolarizing pulse was not sufficient to detect Lqh-dprIT3 action (data not shown). We then applied a 20-Hz train of 50 5-ms depolarizing prepulses to 50 mV as the conditional pulses, followed by a 20-ms depolarizing test pulse between −80 and −65 mV from a holding potential of −120 mV. As expected, in the absence of the toxin, no sodium currents were detected under any of the test pulses (Fig. 1A). However, in the presence of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3, substantial sodium currents were detected at −75 to −65 mV (Fig. 1A), indicating that Lqh-dprIT3 modified the gating of BgNav1-1 channels. The toxin effect was also evident in analyses of current-voltage relation and conductance curves exhibiting a negative shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation after conditional prepulses in the presence of toxin (Fig. 1, B and D). In addition, a significant increase in peak current was observed at 300 nm but not at a lower concentration (100 nm) (Fig. 1B). Neither of these effects was observed without the prepulses (Fig. 1C). The voltage dependence of channel inactivation was not affected by the toxin (data not shown). At both 100 and 300 nm, the current-voltage and conductance-voltage relations determined from Lqh-dprIT3 effects were biphasic (Fig. 1D). Fitting the conductance curves with the sum of two Boltzmann relations revealed that the voltage dependence of activation of 40% (with 100 nm Lqh-dprIT3) and 80% (with 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3) of BgNav1-1 channels shifted 40 mV to a more hyperpolarizing membrane potential. The extent of the toxin-induced hyperpolarizing shift in activation was not concentration-dependent. Thus, like other scorpion β-toxins, Lqh-dprIT3 causes sodium channels to activate at subthreshold membrane potentials. To identify specific regions of the channel that are involved in the enhanced response to Lqh-dprIT3, we examined different BgNav splice variants. We determined the voltage dependence of channel activation of nine additional BgNav splice variants in the absence or presence of Lqh-dprIT3 using the same protocol described in Fig. 1A. Because BgNav1-1 is a type 1 splice variant, we selected two additional splice variants of this type, BgNav1-2 and BgNav1-3, and seven variants each representing a different splice type. Besides differences in usage of alternative exons, these variants also contain four to eight unique amino acid changes likely due to RNA editing (25Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Lqh-dprIT3 (300 nm) modified only 14–27% of the channels for all of the other splice variants compared with 80% for BgNav1-1 (Fig. 2A and Table 1), indicating that these variants are less sensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 compared with BgNav1-1. Dose-response analysis revealed that BgNav1-1 is 17-fold more sensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 compared with BgNav1-3 (Fig. 2B). The toxin-induced hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation ranged from −23 to −42 mV (Table 1).TABLE 1Voltage dependence of activation of BgNav splices variants before and after application of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3Toxin-freeLqh-dprIT3 (300 nm)V0.5kV0.5k1A1V0.5k2A2%%BgNav1-1−23.2 ± 1.06.3 ± 0.3−21.0 ± 0.45.3 ± 0.320 ± 5aSignificant differences from other splice variants (p < 0.05).−62.8 ± 2.67.9 ± 0.580 ± 5aSignificant differences from other splice variants (p < 0.05).BgNav1-1a−28.4 ± 2.14.1 ± 0.6−28.1 ± 1.55.0 ± 0.382 ± 5−60.0 ± 3.310.4 ± 1.618 ± 5BgNav1-2−25.2 ± 2.85.1 ± 1.1−25.5 ± 2.16.1 ± 1.481 ± 3−58.1 ± 1.28.6 ± 0.819 ± 3BgNav1-3−30.4 ± 2.14.3 ± 0.6−30.6 ± 1.55.5 ± 0.486 ± 4−68.7 ± 0.85.4 ± 0.314 ± 4BgNav5−35.9 ± 2.63.7 ± 0.5−35.7 ± 0.74.0 ± 0.477 ± 1−59.3 ± 3.011.5 ± 0.923 ± 1BgNav6−27.9 ± 2.44.1 ± 0.9−29.2 ± 2.65.2 ± 0.979 ± 5−59.0 ± 5.810.9 ± 2.321 ± 3BgNav7−31.7 ± 1.94.8 ± 0.4−32.5 ± 2.33.1 ± 0.679 ± 6−56.7 ± 2.811.8 ± 2.121 ± 5BgNav8−26.5 ± 1.04.8 ± 0.2−26.2 ± 0.95.5 ± 0.286 ± 3−60.0 ± 0.58.2 ± 0.214 ± 3BgNav9−30.7 ± 3.16.4 ± 1.2−31.0 ± 2.97.5 ± 1.482 ± 5−60.0 ± 2.610.1 ± 1.518 ± 5BgNav10−34.1 ± 2.43.5 ± 0.5−35.8 ± 0.73.9 ± 0.775 ± 6−58.6 ± 2.014.3 ± 2.625 ± 6BgNav11−49.3 ± 2.0−3.2 ± 0.5−43.2 ± 2.75.6 ± 0.773 ± 3−73.7 ± 3.02.9 ± 1.127 ± 3a Significant differences from other splice variants (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Because the type 1 splice variants BgNav1-2 and BgNav1-3 were less sensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 compared with BgNav1-1, we reasoned that the alternative exons common to these three variants were not responsible for the hypersensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3. Compared with BgNav1-2 and BgNav1-3, four amino acid residues are different in BgNav1-1: R502G, L1285P, V1685A, and I1806L (Fig. 3). Of these four differences, L1285P and V1685A have been shown to result from U-to-C RNA-editing events (25Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Lqh-dprIT3 on a recombinant channel, BgNav1-1a, in which these four unique residues were replaced with those of BgNav1-2 and BgNav1-3 (25Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We found that the sensitivity of BgNav1-1a to Lqh-dprIT3 decreased prominently, with only 18% of the channels modified by 300 nm toxin (Fig. 2 and Table 2). This result suggested that one or more of these four amino acids were responsible for the hypersensitivity of BgNav1-1 to Lqh-dprIT3.TABLE 2Voltage dependence of activation of BgNav1-1a and mutants before and after the application of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3Toxin-freeLqh-dprIT3 (300 nm)V0.5kV0.5k1A1V0.5k2A2%%BgNav1-1a−28.4 ± 2.14.1 ± 0.6−28.1 ± 1.55.0 ± 0.382 ± 5−60.0 ± 3.310.4 ± 1.618 ± 5R502G−28.3 ± 0.64.0 ± 0.2−27.5 ± 1.35.1 ± 0.186 ± 2−60.0 ± 3.511.6 ± 1.514 ± 2L1285P−25.0 ± 1.05.4 ± 0.2−25.1 ± 1.65.5 ± 0.529 ± 4aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).−64.3 ± 1.58.6 ± 0.971 ± 4aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).V1685A−27.5 ± 0.73.9 ± 0.2−26.0 ± 1.54.7 ± 0.386 ± 4−61.3 ± 2.07.4 ± 1.014 ± 4I1806L−26.2 ± 0.54.4 ± 0.3−24.6 ± 1.25.1 ± 0.287 ± 3−63.5 ± 2.06.6 ± 0.813 ± 3a Significant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab To determine which of the four amino acid substitutions in BgNav1-1 is responsible for the hypersensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3, we substituted each of the four amino acids in the background of BgNav1-1a with those found in BgNav1-1 (i.e. R502G, L1285P, V1685A, and I1806L) and determined the effect of Lqh-dprIT3. Whereas none of the substitutions had an effect on the voltage dependence of channel activation in the absence of toxin (Table 2), 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3 caused a shift in all four channel mutants (Fig. 3). The fraction of toxin-modified channels was 71% for the L1285P mutant compared with BgNav1-1. In contrast, the fraction of toxin-modified channels for the other three mutants was 13–14%, similar to that for BgNav1-1a (Fig. 3 and Table 2). These results indicated that the L1285P substitution was responsible for the hypersensitivity of BgNav1-1 to Lqh-dprIT3. To further determine the impact of the side chain of the residue at position 1258 on Lqh-dprIT3 action, we substituted Leu-1285 with an aromatic residue (Phe), two neutral residues (Gly and Cys), and a positively charged Lys residue in the background of BgNav1-1a. In contrast to L1285P, none of these substitutions increased the channel sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3 (Fig. 4 and Table 3). In addition, none of these substitutions significantly altered the voltage dependence of channel activation. However, the L1285G substitution caused a 13-mV positive shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (data not shown).TABLE 3Voltage dependence of activation of BgNav1-1a and L1285 substitutions before and after the application of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3Toxin-freeLqh-dprIT3 (300 nm)V0.5kV0.5k1A1V0.5k2A2%%BgNav1-1a−28.4 ± 2.14.1 ± 0.6−28.1 ± 1.55.0 ± 0.382 ± 5−60.0 ± 3.310.4 ± 1.618 ± 5L1285P−25.0 ± 1.05.4 ± 0.2−25.1 ± 1.65.5 ± 0.529 ± 4aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).−64.3 ± 1.58.6 ± 0.971 ± 4aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).L1285F−28.6 ± 1.14.2 ± 0.2−25.0 ± 1.04.8 ± 0.287 ± 4−61.6 ± 3.18.3 ± 0.213 ± 4L1285G−28.7 ± 0.83.9 ± 0.3−27.8 ± 1.24.0 ± 0.685 ± 3−50.6 ± 610.1 ± 2.015 ± 3L1285K−30.5 ± 2.14.6 ± 0.4−27.5 ± 1.55.9 ± 0.686 ± 2−67.2 ± 1.98.5 ± 1.214 ± 2L1285C−28.7 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.3−25.9 ± 1.64.6 ± 0.285 ± 2−59.6 ± 3.111.0 ± 1.615 ± 2a Significant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Because of the prominent effect of the L1285P substitution in IIIS1 on Lqh-dprIT3 action, we analyzed the effect of alanine substitution of two nearby, negatively charged residues (Glu-1290 and Asp-1291) at the extracellular end of IIIS1. Glu-1290 is highly conserved in voltage-gated ion channels, including potassium, calcium and sodium channels. The E1290A substitution did not alter the voltage dependence of activation in the absence of toxin. However, the E1290A channel was also more sensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 compared with BgNav1-1a, similar to the effects of the L1285P substitution. 52% of the E1290A channels were modified by 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3 versus 18% of the BgNav1-1a channels (Fig. 5 and Table 4). Substitution of Asp-1291 with alanine did not alter the channel sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3 (data not shown). Because charge neutralization at Glu-1290 enhanced the effect of Lqh-dprIT3, we further characterized the role of this residue by its substitution with the positively charged amino acid lysine. The E1290K mutation did not alter the voltage dependence of activation in the absence of toxin, but Lqh-dprIT3 (300 nm) caused a complete shift of the conductance curve channel by −40 mV (Fig. 5 and Table 4).TABLE 4Voltage dependence of activation of BgNav1-1a and mutants before and after the application of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3Toxin-freeLqh-dprIT3 (300 nm)V0.5kV0.5k1A1V0.5k2A2%%BgNav1-1a−28.4 ± 2.14.1 ± 0.6−28.1 ± 1.55.0 ± 0.382 ± 5−60.0 ± 3.310.4 ± 1.6118 ± 5E1290A−24.5 ± 1.84.9 ± 0.3−24.0 ± 3.56.9 ± 0.248 ± 12aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).−60.0 ± 2.46.1 ± 0.552 ± 12aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).E1290K−24.2 ± 1.26.6 ± 0.4−68.1 ± 2.87.5 ± 0.4a Significant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab To further investigate the role of the voltage-sensing module of domain III in channel sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3, we evaluated the effects on toxin action of charge reversal of the five positively charged residues in IIIS4. We individually substituted these residues with glutamic acid, generating K1E, R2E, R3E, R4E, and R5E. In the absence of toxin, the K1E, R2E, R3E, and R4E substitutions caused 5–7-mV negative shifts in the voltage dependence of activation, whereas the R5E substitution caused a 4-mV positive shift (Table 5). We did not observe a significant change in the slope of the activation curve for the K1E, R2E, R3E, and R4E channel mutants, although the R5E channel mutant demonstrated a slightly shallower slope compared with the parental channel (Fig. 6 and Table 5).TABLE 5Voltage dependence of activation of BgNav1-1a and mutants before and after the application of 300 nm Lqh-dprIT3Toxin-freeLqh-dprIT3 (300 nm)V0.5kV0.5k1A1V0.5k2A2%%BgNav1-1a−28.4 ± 2.14.1 ± 0.6−28.1 ± 1.55.0 ± 0.382 ± 5−60.0 ± 3.310.4 ± 1.618 ± 5K1E−35.5 ± 2.54.7 ± 0.4−35.8 ± 3.94.8 ± 0.382 ± 4−70.0 ± 6.110.7 ± 2.118 ± 4R2E−34.3 ± 2.85.1 ± 0.3−32.9 ± 2.15.5 ± 0.481 ± 4−75.5 ± 4.57.4 ± 0.819 ± 4R3E−34.2 ± 2.55.0 ± 0.2−34.7 ± 2.76.8 ± 0.375 ± 5−76.1 ± 8.77.0 ± 0.625 ± 5R4E−33.7 ± 3.85.7 ± 0.5−26.9 ± 3.68.1 ± 0.643 ± 8aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).−87.9 ± 3.65.1 ± 0.557 ± 8aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).R5E−24.0 ± 1.97.2 ± 0.4−25.0 ± 3.98.6 ± 0.835 ± 7aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).−63.6 ± 5.07.9 ± 0.665 ± 7aSignificant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05).a Significant differences from BgNav1-1a (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab The R4E and R5E channel mutants were more sensitive to Lqh-dprIT3 compared with BgNav1-1a and the K1E, R2E, and R3E channel mutants. At 300 nm, the toxin modified >50% of the R4E and R5E channels but only 18–25% of the other channels. For the R5E channels, Lqh-dprIT3 (300 nm) shifted the voltage dependence of activation of modified R5E channels by 40 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, similar to the extent of the shift for the BgNav1-1a, K1E, R2E, and R3E channels (Fig. 6 and Table 5). However, Lqh-dprIT3 caused a −60-mV shift in voltage dependence of activation for the modified R4E channels, which started to activate at membrane potentials as negative as −100 mV. The differential sensitivities of BgNav sodium channel splice variants from B. germanica have been valuable in elucidating the channel regions involved in channel function and resistance to pyrethroid insecticides (4Dong K. Invert. Neurosci. 2007; 7: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Dong K. Gilbert L.I. Gill S.S. Insect Pharmacology. Elsevier, Oxford, United Kingdom2010: 25-27Google Scholar). Here, we examined the sensitivity of 10 BgNav channel variants to the insect-selective scorpion depressant β-toxin Lqh-dprIT3. This screening unexpectedly revealed that substitutions at the voltage-sensing module of domain III influenced the action of the β-toxin. The binding site of the β-toxin Css4 has been shown to involve the voltage-sensing module of domain II and the pore module of domain III (16Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T.

We found that a Leu-to-Pro substitution at position 1285 in IIIS1, resulting from an RNA-editing event, was responsible for the hypersensitivity of the sodium channel variant BgNav1-1 to Lqh-dprIT3. Further site-directed mutagenesis identified additional residues whose substitution affected the action of Lqh-dprIT3, including a negatively charged residue at the extracellular end of IIIS1 (Glu-1290) and the two innermost positively charged gating residues in IIIS4. Charge reversal of either Glu-1290 or each of the two gating charges in IIIS4 did not hinder but rather increased the channel sensitivity to the toxin. A preliminary three-dimensional model of Css4 docking at rNav1.2a, constructed using as template the crystal structure of the bacterial voltage-gated potassium channel KvAP (21Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu Y. Sampieri F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21332-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggested that the toxin binds at a crevice between S1–S2 and S3–S4 in domain II, thus controlling IIS4 movement during activation. When the two outermost positively charged residues in IIS4 of rNav1.2 were neutralized or charge-reversed, Css4 activity increased, most likely due to their increased mobility during activation, thus enhancing the trapping by the toxin (31Cestèle S. Scheuer T. Mantegazza M. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The voltage-sensing module of domain III has not previously been implicated in the binding and/or action of scorpion β-toxins. The increased sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3 by the L1285P and E1290A/K substitutions in IIIS1 might indicate that the Lqh-dprIT3 toxin binds at the crevice juxtaposed to S1 of domain III in the channel mutants. Alternatively, alterations in domain III may indirectly facilitate trapping of the voltage sensor in domain II by the toxin. The enhanced channel sensitivity to Lqh-dprIT3 when Leu-1285 was substituted specifically with proline (Table 2) seems more consistent with the latter explanation. Proline inserts a kink in the distal part of the S1 α-helix, which would disrupt the local arrangement of IIIS1, including Glu-1290. Because these alterations increased rather than decreased the effect of Lqh-dprIT3, we speculate that the unmodified IIIS1 in BgNav1 imposes some structural constraint that limits the full effect of the toxin in binding to the domain II voltage sensor and/or in the voltage sensor trapping, and this constraint is lifted by the above substitutions. The most dramatic effect inspected was when the two innermost gating charges in domain III were substituted with negative charges. This result is quite different from the effects of substituting negative charges in the S4 voltage sensor of domain II. In domain II, neutralization of the two outermost charged residues markedly enhanced β-scorpion toxin activation, and neutralization of the three innermost positively charged residues had no effect (31Cestèle S. Scheuer T. Mantegazza M. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed that reversal of the three outermost positively charged residues in IIIS4 had no effects on toxin activity, and reversal of the two innermost charges greatly enhanced the effect of the toxin. It is unlikely that the two innermost charges directly interact with the toxin because these residues are embedded in the membrane even when the channel is in the activated state. The effects on toxin sensitivity are also unlikely due to effects on the voltage dependence of activation because the effect of the R4E substitution was similar to those of the K1E, R2E, and R3E substitutions (a hyperpolarizing shift), and the R5E substitution had the opposite effect (a small depolarizing shift). For these reasons, we believe that effects of the R4E and R5E substitutions are most likely mediated by allosteric interactions with the S4 voltage sensor of domain II. The percentage of modified channels was dependent on the concentration of toxin, whereas the magnitude of the toxin-induced shift in activation was concentration-independent. These results suggest that the channels can exist in only two states: unmodified and completely modified. The substitutions in IIIS1 (L1285P, E1290A, and E1290K) and the R5E substitution in IIIS4 increased the percentage of channels that were modified, suggesting that these alterations shifted the equilibrium for toxin modification. In contrast, the R4E substitution in IIIS4 increased both the percentage of modified channels and the magnitude of the shift in activation, indicating that this mutation also altered the modified state of the channel. These differential effects are more consistent with an allosteric modulation of channel gating than a direct interaction between the substituted residues and the toxin. Bezanilla and co-workers (33Chanda B. Asamoah O.K. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) proposed that the voltage sensors of the sodium channel are intrinsically tightly coupled. They have shown that binding of the scorpion β-toxin Ts1 to S4 of domain II allosterically activates the movement of all the other voltage sensors in the sodium channel, with the maximal effect on the neighboring voltage sensors of domains I and III rather than on the distant S4 of domain IV. Our results suggest that alterations in the voltage sensor of domain III affect this interaction and that mutations in domain III are likely to enhance the effect of the toxins on IIS4. The role of the voltage-sensing module of domain III in the action of Lqh-dprIT3 on insect sodium channels, as revealed in this study, may be conserved in mammalian sodium channel interaction with other scorpion β-toxins. Future research should test this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2144990397,"Replicating amyloids, called prions, are responsible for transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in mammals and some heritable phenotypes in fungi. The transmission of prions between species is usually inhibited, being highly sensitive to small differences in amino acid sequence of the prion-forming proteins. To understand the molecular basis of this prion interspecies barrier, we studied the transmission of the [PSI(+)] prion state from Sup35 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to hybrid Sup35 proteins with prion-forming domains from four other closely related Saccharomyces species. Whereas all the hybrid Sup35 proteins could adopt a prion form in S. cerevisiae, they could not readily acquire the prion form from the [PSI(+)] prion of S. cerevisiae. Expression of the hybrid Sup35 proteins in S. cerevisiae [PSI(+)] cells often resulted in frequent loss of the native [PSI(+)] prion. Furthermore, all hybrid Sup35 proteins showed different patterns of interaction with the native [PSI(+)] prion in terms of co-polymerization, acquisition of the prion state, and induced prion loss, all of which were also dependent on the [PSI(+)] variant. The observed loss of S. cerevisiae [PSI(+)] can be related to inhibition of prion polymerization of S. cerevisiae Sup35 and formation of a non-heritable form of amyloid. We have therefore identified two distinct molecular origins of prion transmission barriers between closely sequence-related prion proteins: first, the inability of heterologous proteins to co-aggregate with host prion polymers, and second, acquisition by these proteins of a non-heritable amyloid fold."

Proper progression of mitosis depends on orderly ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various mitotic inhibitors. At the molecular level, upon removal of SAC, Cdc20 activates E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome that, along with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH10, executes this function. Both Cdc20 and UbcH10 are overexpressed in many cancer types and are associated with defective SAC function leading to chromosomal instability. The precise mechanism of correlated overexpression of these two proteins remains elusive. We show that Cdc20 transcriptionally up-regulates UbcH10 expression. The WD40 domain of Cdc20 is required for this activity. Physical interaction between Cdc20 and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-CBP/p300 complex and its subsequent recruitment to the UBCH10 promoter are involved in this transactivation process.

This transcriptional regulatory function of Cdc20 was observed to be cell cycle-specific. We hypothesize that this co-regulated overexpression of both proteins contributes to chromosomal instability. Chromosomal instability has been found to be a prominent cause for aneuploidy and consequently the onset of cancer. Proper chromosomal segregation during the mitotic stage of cell division prevents the occurrence of chromosomal instability and thus rules out the generation of aneuploid cells (1Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Chi Y.H. Jeang K.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The bipolar segregation of duplicated chromosomes during metaphase to anaphase transition is monitored by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). 4The abbreviations used are: SAC, spindle assembly checkpoint; nt, nucleotide; APC/C, anaphase promoting complex; oligo, oligonucleotide; pol, polymerase; qPCR, quantitative PCR; MCC, mitotic checkpoint complex. Cells are allowed to proceed toward chromosomal segregation after all the kinetochores of sister chromatids are attached to bipolar spindles. But in case any defect occurs at kinetochore-spindle attachment or in the generation of tension across the bipolar spindle arrangement, the cells remain arrested at metaphase by SAC until all the defects are corrected (3Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). At the biochemical level, this mitotic progression of cells is mediated by sequential ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of different substrates. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is the mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase that, along with E2 ubiquitin carrier protein UbcH10, mediates this ubiquitination activity (4Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 5Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W.

For proper functional activity of APC/C, the presence of one of two WD40 domain-containing adapter proteins, Cdc20 and Cdh1, is required (7Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Cdc20 activates APC/C at metaphase, and APC/CCdc20 ubiquitinates securin, thus releasing the endopeptidase separase. Free separase then cleaves the SCC1 subunit of the cohesin complex, which holds together the sister chromatids at metaphase plate. After separation, chromatids move to the opposite poles, and the cells enter the anaphase. Cdc20 is the direct target of SAC. When SAC is on, Cdc20 remains sequestered by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) comprising Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3, and APC/CCdc20 remains inactive (3Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 8Baker D.J. Dawlaty M.M. Galardy P. van Deursen J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that UbcH10 terminates SAC-mediated mitotic arrest by ubiquitinating Cdc20 and thereby releasing inhibitory MCC from Cdc20 (5Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Concordant with that, p31comet blocks Mad2 to sequester Cdc20 further (9Mapelli M. Filipp F.V. Rancati G. Massimiliano L. Nezi L. Stier G. Hagan R.S. Confalonieri S. Piatti S. Sattler M. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP44 deubiquitinates Cdc20 so that MCC can sequester it from activating APC/C before the kinetochore attachment to spindle poles (10Stegmeier F. Rape M. Draviam V.M. Nalepa G. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Li M.Z. Hannon G.J. Sorger P.K. Kirschner M.W. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consistent with their mitotic role, both Cdc20 and UbcH10 accumulate gradually during G2 phase with a peak at mitosis and then sharply decrease as the cells exit from mitosis (11Cho R.J. Huang M.

Down-regulation of Cdc20 as well as UbcH10 occurs by APC/CCdh1-mediated ubiquitination assisted by UbcH10 itself after ensuring the proper mitotic exit upon degradation of all mitotic substrates (12Rape M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Defects in the functioning of SAC may lead to chromosomal missegregation thereby resulting in the generation of aneuploid cells. Mutations and/or deregulated expression of various SAC genes have been found in a number of cancer tissues (14Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Yuan B. Xu Y. Woo J.H. Wang Y. Bae Y.K. Yoon D.S. Wersto R.P. Tully E. Wilsbach K. Gabrielson E. Clin.

Cdc20 overexpression has been observed in various cancer tissues (17Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker K. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9309-9314Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) and reported to cause premature anaphase onset resulting in aneuploidy in cancer cells (18Mondal G. Sengupta S. Panda C.K. Gollin S.M. Saunders W.S. Roychoudhury S. Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression of the Mad2-binding deficient and thereby SAC-defective mutant Cdc20 promotes tumor formation in mice (19Li M. Fang X. Wei Z. York J.P. Zhang P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results suggest that proper functioning of Cdc20 is crucial for orderly execution of cell division. However, the downstream effects of Cdc20 overexpression in relation to SAC inactivation and aneuploidization largely remain unknown. In this regard, it is also noteworthy that UbcH10 overexpression may override SAC-mediated cell cycle arrest thereby resulting in defective chromosomal segregation and subsequent onset of aneuploidy (5Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 20Rape M. Reddy S.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2006; 124: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of UbcH10 expression might also be an essential step for proper function of the checkpoint. Indeed, UbcH10 expression is found to be up-regulated in a number of cancer tissues of different origins, and this up-regulation is related with poor prognosis in some cancer types (21Berlingieri M.T.

The UBCH10 gene encoding locus 20q13.1 is also reported to be amplified in several tumors (26Wagner K.W. Sapinoso L.M. El-Rifai W. Frierson H.F. Butz N. Mestan J. Hofmann F. Deveraux Q.L. Hampton G.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6621-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Dominant negative UbcH10 blocks the APC/C-mediated ubiquitination activity, thus preventing the degradation of mitotic substrates causing cells to accumulate at mitosis (27Townsley F.M. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2362-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of UbcH10 expression causes a lower rate of proliferation in both normal and cancer cells (25Pallante P. Berlingieri M.T. Troncone G.

Thus, maintenance of levels of SAC proteins is an important regulatory mechanism to check aneuploidy and subsequent tumorigenesis. Besides degradation of cell cycle regulators via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, another emerging mechanism for cell cycle control is transcriptional regulation of its components. Transcriptional deregulation of the SAC gene MAD2 was correlated with mitotic abnormality in human cancers (29Jeong S.J. Shin H.J. Kim S.J. Ha G.H. Cho B.I. Baek K.H. Kim C.M. Lee C.W.

In a previous study, it was shown that CBP/p300 and APC/C cooperate to regulate transcription (36Turnell A.S. Stewart G.S. Grand R.J. Rookes S.M. Martin A. Yamano H. Elledge S.J. Gallimore P.H.

In this study, we show that WD40 repeat containing protein Cdc20 modulates the APC/C-CBP/p300 complex to regulate the transcription of UBCH10 gene. Human cell lines HeLa and HCT116 were purchased from the American Type Culture collection (Manassas, VA). UPCI:SCC084 and UPCI:SCC104 cells were kind gifts from Dr. Susanne M. Gollin (University of Pittsburgh). HepG2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. S. Adhya (Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, India). All the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (1% PenStrep glutamine and 0.006% gentamicin, Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For cell synchronization, cells were treated with cold thymidine (2.5 mm; United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) for 16 h followed by an 8-h release. The thymidine treatment was repeated for another 22 h. Following this double thymidine block, cells were released in thymidine-free complete medium and harvested at various time points. For mitotic arrest, cells were treated with nocodazole (100 ng/ml; Sigma) for 16 h before harvesting. The proteasomal inhibitor MG115 (Sigma) was added 5 h before harvesting at a final concentration of 25 μm. Transient transfections were done with various plasmids and siRNA constructs in different cell lines using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Except in case of synchronization experiments, all transient transfections were performed either for 48 h (expression analysis) or for 72 h (siRNA analyses). The siRNA transfection of synchronized cells was done 4 h before the first thymidine addition. UBCH10 promoter regions were amplified from human genomic DNA with the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The amplified regions were cloned into the linearized pTZ57R/T (Fermentas, Lithuania) by the T/A cloning method. The fragments were then subcloned into luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI) using restriction enzymes SacI and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).

https://openalex.org/W2075632869,"CorA is a family of divalent cation transporters ubiquitously present in bacteria and archaea. Although CorA can transport both Mg2+ and Co2+ almost equally well, its main role has been suggested to be that of primary Mg2+ transporter of prokaryotes and hence the regulator of Mg2+ homeostasis. The reason is that the affinity of CorA for Co2+ is relatively low and thus considered non-physiological. Here, we show that Thermotoga maritima CorA (TmCorA) is incapable of regulating the Mg2+ homeostasis and therefore cannot be the primary Mg2+ transporter of T. maritima. Further, our in vivo experiments confirm that TmCorA is a highly selective Co2+ transporter, as it selects Co2+ over Mg2+ at >100 times lower concentrations. In addition, we present data that show TmCorA to be extremely thermostable in the presence of Co2+. Mg2+ could not stabilize the protein to the same extent, even at high concentrations. We also show that addition of Co2+, but not Mg2+, specifically induces structural changes to the protein. Altogether, these data show that TmCorA has the role of being the transporter of Co2+ but not Mg2+. The physiological relevance and requirements of Co2+ in T. maritima is discussed and highlighted. We suggest that CorA may have different roles in different organisms. Such functional diversity is presumably a reflection of minor, but important structural differences within the CorA family that regulate the gating, substrate selection, and transport.

However, recent evidence suggests that γ is additionally controlled by residues within the intracellular and extracellular domains. We examined the influence of two anionic residues (Asp113 and Asp127) within the extracellular vestibule of a high conductance human mutant 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3A (5-HT3A) receptor (5-HT3A(QDA)) upon γ, modulation of the latter by extracellular Ca2+, and the permeability of Ca2+ with respect to Cs+ (PCa/PCs). Mutations neutralizing (Asp → Asn), or reversing (Asp → Lys), charge at the 113 locus decreased inward γ by 46 and 58%, respectively, but outward currents were unaffected. The D127N mutation decreased inward γ by 82% and also suppressed outward currents, whereas the D127K mutation caused loss of observable single channel currents. The forgoing mutations, except for D127K, which could not be evaluated, ameliorated suppression of inwardly directed single channel currents by extracellular Ca2+. The PCa/PCs of 3.8 previously reported for the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct was reduced to 0.13 and 0.06 by the D127N and D127K mutations, respectively, with lesser, but clearly significant, effects caused by the D113N (1.04) and D113K (0.60) substitutions.

Notably, the extracellular vestibule was highlighted to present negative charges corresponding to the α1 subunit residues Glu83 and Asp97, where cations appeared to reside before further translocation to the transmembrane portion of the channel. Numerous additional computational approaches applied to homology models of the nACh receptor indicate that the ECD acts to concentrate monovalent cations over anions (e.g. see Refs. 23Meltzer R.H.

Acta. 2009; 1788: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By contrast, a homology model of the GABAA receptor indicates the ECD to concentrate anions in preference to cations (25O'Mara M. Cromer B. Parker M. Chung S.H. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Direct experimental evidence for a role of the extracellular vestibule of human muscle nACh receptors in setting γ has been provided by Hansen et al. (26Hansen S.B. Wang H.L. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36066-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), who made mutations within a negatively charged ring corresponding to Asp97 in the α1 subunit. Mutation of the residues at this locus to lysine in all subunits caused a maximal reduction of γ to ∼20% of control, as observed in recordings performed on cell-attached patches. In this study, we investigate the influence of Asp113 and Asp127 of the 5-HT3A receptor, which align with Glu83 and Asp97 of the α1 nACh receptor subunit, respectively, upon γ, single current channel rectification, ion selectivity, and modulation of γ by extracellular Ca2+. The analyses were performed in the background of a high γ mutant of the human 5-HT3A receptor (5-HT3A(QDA)), because the wild-type 5-HT3A receptor has a γ value too small to quantify by conventional single channel recording techniques (1Peters J.A.

The mutations introduced into the large intracellular loop of the human 5-HT3A receptor to generate the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor construct are R432Q, R436D, and R440A (16Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the extracellular channel vestibule within this model cationic pLGIC strongly influences γ and is also an important determinant of relative permeability to Ca2+ and the modulation of γ by extracellular Ca2+. A preliminary account of some of the results has appeared in abstract form (28.Livesey, M., Cooper, M., Lambert, J., Peters, J., (2009) Proceedings of the British Pharmacological Society, www.pa2online.org/abstracts/Vol7Issue2abst037P.pdf.Google Scholar). The methods employed to generate mutant constructs within the 5-HT3A(QDA) cDNA background and to transiently transfect tsA-201 cells with cDNA constructs were as detailed previously (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mutations generated in this study were 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N, 5-HT3A(QDA) D113K, 5-HT3A(QDA) D127N, and 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 18–96 h in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 100% humidity prior to electrophysiological recordings. The whole-cell and outside-out patch configurations of the patch clamp technique were used to record macroscopic and single channel currents evoked by 5-HT, respectively. Patch electrodes for both modes were filled with a solution comprising 140 mm CsCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with 1 m CsOH; final [Cs+]o = 143 mm). The intracellular free calcium concentration of this solution was estimated to be 10 nm (29Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The recording chamber comprised a 35-mm Petri dish on which the cells were cultivated. Using a gravity-feed system, the chamber was superfused routinely at ∼5 ml/min, at room temperature (20–23 °C), with extracellular solutions of the compositions described below. Single channel currents evoked by pressure-applied 5-HT (10 μm) were recorded in an extracellular solution (E1) consisting of 142.8 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted by 1 m NaOH; final [Na+]o = 146 mm). Whole-cell recording was used to determine the reversal potentials (E5-HT) of macroscopic currents elicited by 5-HT (10 μm) by means of a voltage-ramp protocol using WinWCP V3 9.6 electrophysiology software (J. Dempster, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web). Unless stated otherwise, E5-HT was determined via a protocol wherein the membrane potential was initially set at −60 mV, and a macroscopic current response to 5-HT was elicited. During the plateau of the current response, the membrane potential was stepped from −60 to −100 mV for 100 ms and subsequently ramped to +80 mV within 1 s. Care was taken to ensure that the current amplitude at the beginning and termination of the voltage ramp protocol were similar. An identical voltage ramp in the absence of 5-HT served to determine the leakage current and was subtracted from the currents evoked in the presence of 5-HT to generate the current-voltage (I-V) relationship specifically attributable to the 5-HT-evoked conductance. E5-HT was determined from such leak-subtracted currents. In order to determine the permeability of Na+ relative to Cs+ (PNa/PCs), E5-HT was determined in solution E1, and the permeability ratio was calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) (voltage) equation, E5-HT=RTFln(PNa/PCs)[Na+]o[Cs+]i(eq.1) where R, T, and F have their usual meaning, and [Na+]o and [Cs+]i are the calculated activities of extracellular Na+ and internal Cs+ ions. This equation ignores the very small error anticipated due to the presence of low concentrations of permeant divalent ions (e.g. Ca2+) within the extra- or intracellular solutions. To calculate the permeability of Ca2+ relative to Cs+ (PCa/PCs), E5-HT was determined in solution E2, comprising CaCl2 100 mm, glucose 10 mm, l-histidine 5 mm (pH 7.2), and the ratio was derived from a modified GHK (voltage) equation (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Lewis C.A. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), E5-HT=RTFln4(PCa'/PCs)[Ca2+]o[Cs+]i(eq.2) where [Ca2+]o is the external activity of Ca2+, [Cs+]i is the internal activity of Cs+, and P′Ca/PCs is a modified term relating the permeability of Ca2+ to Cs+. Substituting for P′Ca/PCs, the above can be rewritten as follows. expE5-HTF/RT=4PCa[Ca2+]oPCs(1+expE5-HTF/RT)[Cs+]i(eq.3) For simplicity, we routinely refer to ion concentrations rather than activities throughout, although the latter were employed in the calculations of relative permeabilities. To examine modulation of γ by extracellular Ca2+, single channel recordings and determinations of E5-HT were also made in extracellular solutions (E3, E4, and E5) containing variable [CaCl2]o (0.1, 1, and 10 mm, respectively) but constant [NaCl]o (95 mm), l-histidine (5 mm), and glucose 10 (mm), pH 7.2. The osmolarity of such solutions was held constant by the addition of appropriate amounts of sucrose. An extracellular solution (E6) containing 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 239.4 mm sucrose, 5 mm l-histidine, pH 7.2 (adjusted by 1 m HCl), in addition to solutions E1 and E3, was used to perform dilution potential measurements in order to determine relative permeability to chloride. Liquid junction potentials between the pipette tip and extracellular solutions were measured according to Fenwick et al. (29Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and were corrected post hoc. In brief, the zero current voltage was initially determined with the intracellular solution present within both the patch pipette and the bath. The extracellular solutions (E1–E6) used in the experiments then replaced the intracellular solution, and the change in zero current voltage (i.e. the liquid junction potential) was noted. A salt bridge consisting of 3 m KCl in 4% (w/v) agar connected the bath to the reference electrode, eliminating changes in the potential of the latter during this procedure. Single channel currents were low pass-filtered offline at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz via a DigiData 1302A (Axon Instruments) interface. Using the WinEDR V2 7.6 Electrophysiology Data Recorder (J. Dempster, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web), single channel current amplitude histograms were constructed from sections of single channel activity in which unitary events predominated, as described in detail previously (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The γ value is routinely reported as the chord conductance (i.e. γ = i/(Vm − E5-HT), where i is single channel current amplitude, Vm is the holding potential (including liquid junction potential correction), and E5-HT is the reversal potential of the agonist-evoked macroscopic response determined as described above under the appropriate ionic conditions. In the case of the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K mutant, single channel currents could not be resolved directly in recording from outside-out membrane patches. Thus, we estimated γ by fluctuation analysis of whole-cell current evoked by 5-HT (1 μm) as previously described by us (16Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A rectification index (RI) is used to describe the degree of single channel current rectification. The RI was calculated as follows, RI=slope γ(positive V)slope γ(negative V)(eq.4) where slope γ(positive V) and slope γ(negative V) were obtained from obtaining the slope of the line of best fit plotted to data points from positive and negative holding potentials, respectively. An RI value of 1 indicates a linear/ohmic i-V relationship. An RI of >1 indicates outward rectification, and RI <1 indicates inward rectification. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Dunnett's or Dunn's test as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Asp113 is predicted from a homology model of the human 5-HT3A receptor (18Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Cooper M.A. Livesey M.R. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Hales T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6172-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to reside approximately one-third of the distance from the entrance to the extracellular vestibule to the extracellular border of TM2. Asp113 is homologous to the Torpedo nACh receptor α1 subunit Glu83 locus and is modeled as forming a ring of negative charge within the apical extracellular vestibule (Fig. 1). Asp113 was mutated to either a neutral asparagine or a positively charged lysine, within the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct, yielding 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N or 5-HT3A(QDA) D113K, respectively. At a holding potential of −80 mV in extracellular (E1) and intracellular solutions containing Na+ and Cs+ as the principal charge carriers respectively, 5-HT (10 μm) applied by pressure to outside-out patches excised from tsA-201 cells expressing 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N mutant receptors elicited clearly resolvable single channel events. By comparison with the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor construct previously characterized under identical ionic conditions (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), inwardly directed single channel currents mediated by the 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N construct are effectively halved in amplitude, the chord conductance (γ) being reduced from 41.2 pS to 22.2 ± 0.3 pS (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). The 5-HT3A(QDA) D113K receptor displayed a γ value that was further reduced to 17.1 ± 0.2 pS (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Although the γ value of the D113N and D113K 5-HT3A(QDA) constructs did not differ strikingly, the reduction caused by reversal, rather than neutralization, of charge was significantly greater (Table 1).FIGURE 2Neutralization, or reversal, of charge at the Asp113 locus depresses inwardly directed single channel currents. Single channel events, elicited by 5-HT (10 μm), were recorded from outside-out patches excised from tsA-201 cells transfected with the construct of interest. The Cs+-based pipette solution and extracellular solution E1 were utilized. A, exemplar single channel events recorded at −80 and +80 mV from the 5-HT3A(QDA), 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N, and 5-HT3A(QDA) D113K mutant receptors.

Open table in a new tab Single channel current-voltage (i-V) relationships were generated by recording unitary currents evoked by 5-HT (10 μm) from outside-out patches at holding potentials between −100 and +100 mV in increments of 20 mV. For the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor construct, the single channel current i-V relationship is linear at negative potentials with a slope γ of 41 pS (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E.

However, at positive potentials, γ increases to 46 pS, indicative of modest outward rectification quantified as an RI value (see “Experimental Procedures”) of 1.12 (20Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Under identical ionic conditions, the i-V relationships obtained for the 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N and the 5-HT3A(QDA) D113K receptor constructs reveal that both mutations enhance outward rectification, the RI values being 1.7 and 2.63, respectively (Table 1). Notably, either mutation reduced only inwardly (and not outwardly) directed single channel currents (Fig. 2B). Such results are consistent with a scheme whereby the ring of negativity formed by the Asp113 residues acts via simple coulombic attraction to raise the availability of cations within the receptor extracellular vestibule for translocation to deeper regions of the pore. Neutralization or reversal of charge at this locus would be anticipated to reduce the local concentration of cations within the extracellular vestibule, leading to the emergence of outward rectification. Notably, the effect of neutralizing or reversing the charge at the Asp113 position was increased when [Na+]o was reduced to 95 mm (see below) (see Fig. 5). In comparison with the 4"

We demonstrated previously that importin β1 directly recognizes the zinc finger domain of Snail and transports it into the nucleus. Here, using in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that importin α, an adaptor protein for importin β1, negatively regulates the nuclear import of Snail mediated by importin β1. In vitro binding assays indicated that importin α interacted with the zinc finger domain of Snail to compete with the binding of importin β1 and that Snail did not form a ternary complex with importin α/importin β1. Overexpression of importin α in A549 cells reduced the endogenous Snail protein level, which was restored by inhibitors of the proteasome and glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Furthermore, knockdown of importin α by siRNA treatment increased the endogenous Snail protein level in several cancer cell lines. This study provides a novel regulatory mechanism of the nuclear protein import process by importin α and gives an implication to control Snail activity by inhibiting its nuclear localization."
https://openalex.org/W2152670670,"Chromosomal translocations are a major source of genetic abnormalities causally linked to certain malignancies. Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive soft tissue tumor characterized by a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 18 and X, generating oncoproteins such as SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2. The molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenic potential of SYT-SSX1/2 is not clear. Here we show that SYT-SSX1 leads to up-regulation of NCOA3, a protein critical for the formation of various cancers. The increase of NCOA3 is essential for SYT-SSX1-mediated synovial sarcoma formation. SYT-SSX1 does so by increasing the sumoylation of NCOA3 through interaction with a SUMO E3 ligase, PIASy, as well as the sumoylation of NEMO. NEMO has also been shown to physically interact with NCOA3. Increased sumoylation of NCOA3 leads to its increased steady state level and nuclear localization. Our findings represent the first example that an oncoprotein directly regulates substrate modification by a SUMO E3 ligase, and leads to overexpression of a protein essential for tumor formation. Such a mechanistic finding provides an opportunity to design specific therapeutic interventions to treat synovial sarcoma."
