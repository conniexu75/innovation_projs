However, there have been no experiments which give an insight into the nature of the interaction of the electron transport system with phosphate or any part of the phosphorylating system. The present paper deals with a new approach to this problem with Ols-labeled phosphate. The rationale of the method depends upon the fact that the phosphate group does not necessarily proceed intact through a sequence of phosphorylation, transphosphorylation, and dephosphorylation reactions, but may lose one or more of its original oxygen atoms. Thus, by labeling the oxygen of the phosphate group, it may be possible to follow the path of the phosphate group through a series of reactions in which the phosphorus leaves no trace. If inorganic phosphate labeled with 01* is taken up in organic linkage by the formation of a carbon-oxygen bond as in phosphorylase reactions (3) and in the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase reaction: the oxygen bridging the carbon and phosphorus becomes labeled with Oâ€™*. Should the organic phosphate now be cleaved by the rupture of the phosphorus-oxygen bond as in phosphatase reactions (3), the organic moiety remaining would contain 018. Moreover, if inorganic phosphate were formed in such a reaction, one of the four labeled oxygens would have been replaced by normal oxygen from the water. This opens up two possibilities, (1) the identification of phosphorylated intermediates by the presence of Oi* in the dephosphorylated products and (2) the detection of reactions otherwise unobservable by following the loss of Oi* from inorganic phosphate."

For example, folic acid appears to be involved in purine and formate metabolism and vitamin Blz in the utilization of methyl groups. However, while there have been several reports concerning the influence in viva and in vitro of folic acid and its antagonist, aminopterin, on specific enzyme systems such as xanthine oxidase (l-4), choline oxidase (58), and transmethylase (9, lo), there is scant information on the effects of dietary vitamin Blz on these or other enzyme systems. In the course of work on the biological action in the rat of a reported specific antagonist to vitamin Blz for Lactobacillus leichmannii 4797 (ll), the authors have undertaken a study of the effects of this antagonist as well as of simple vitamin Blz deficiency on certain enzyme systems in the rat. The liver enzymes chosen for study, transmethylase, xanthine oxidase, endogenous respiration, and choline oxidase, have been implicated indirectly by various workers with vitamin Blz metabolism. These investigations should throw some light on the involvement of vitamin Blz with specific enzyme systems. In addition, the effects of the L. leichrnannii antagonist can be compared with a simple vitamin Blz deficiency in the rat."
