https://openalex.org/W2010920096,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a widely studied cellular example of synaptic plasticity. However, the identity, localization, and interplay among the biochemical signals underlying LTP remain unclear. Intracellular microelectrodes have been used to record synaptic potentials and deliver protein kinase inhibitors to postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells. Induction of LTP is blocked by intracellular delivery of H-7, a general protein kinase inhibitor, or PKC(19-31), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, or CaMKII(273-302), a selective inhibitor of the multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). After its establishment, LTP appears unresponsive to postsynaptic H-7, although it remains sensitive to externally applied H-7. Thus both postsynaptic PKC and CaMKII are required for the induction of LTP and a presynaptic protein kinase appears to be necessary for the expression of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2003708679,"MyoD is a skeletal muscle-specific protein that is able to induce myogenesis in a wide variety of cell types. In this report, we show that MyoD is a DNA binding protein capable of specific interaction with two regions of the mouse muscle creatine kinase gene upstream enhancer, both of which are required for full muscle-specific enhancer activity. MyoD shares antigenicity and DNA binding specificity with MEF1, a myocyte-specific DNA binding factor. The contiguous basic and myc homology regions of MyoD that are necessary and sufficient for specific DNA interaction are the same regions of the protein required to convert 10T1/2 fibroblasts into muscle. These findings suggest that the biological activity of MyoD is mediated via its capacity for specific DNA interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2033983053,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by telencephalic neurons provides critical trophic support for cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. In situ hybridization and nuclease protection analyses demonstrate that limbic seizures dramatically increase the amount of messenger RNA for NGF in the neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus within 1 hour of seizure onset and in broadly distributed neocortical and olfactory forebrain neurons some hours later. The increased messenger RNA species is indistinguishable from messenger RNA for transcript B of the beta subunit of NGF from mouse submandibular gland. Thus, the expression of a known growth factor is affected by unusual physiological activity, suggesting one route through which trophic interactions between neurons in adult brain can be modified."
https://openalex.org/W1970575648,"We have identified two platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent autophosphorylation sites in the beta subunit of the human PDGF receptor (PDGF-R). The major site of phosphorylation (Tyr-857) corresponds to the major autophosphorylation site in many other tyrosine kinases. Tyr-751, which lies within the kinase insert region, is a second in vivo site and the major in vitro site. Immunoprecipitates of wild-type PDGF-Rs prepared from PDGF-treated cells contained a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 kinase activity and three specific polypeptides as well as the PDGF-R. Mutation of Tyr-751 to Phe or Gly, or mutation of the catalytic domain to abolish kinase activity, blocked association of the PDGF-R with the PI kinase and the three proteins. These results suggest that autophosphorylation in the kinase insert region triggers the binding of the activated PDGF-R to specific cellular proteins, including a PI kinase whose activity is known to be stimulated by PDGF. Thus autophosphorylation may play a novel role in signal transduction via the PDGF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1964764518,"The leukocyte-common antigen (L-CA) is a family of large molecular weight glycoproteins uniquely expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin. The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA-). The expression of the alpha beta T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (p55), LFA-1, Thy-1, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA- T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to IL-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2107277439,"The chemical identity of the amino acid free-radical site that represents one of the two oxidizing equivalents stored in the H2O2-oxidized intermediate (compound ES) of the mitochondrial heme enzyme, cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) has been sought for almost a quarter of a century. Site-directed mutagenesis alone cannot yield this answer. Low-temperature 35-gigahertz (Q-band) electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy was used to examine compound ES prepared from proteins containing specifically deuterated methionine or tryptophan, as well as the amino acid replacement Trp51----Phe. The results definitely identify the site of the radical in compound ES as tryptophan, most likely Trp191."
https://openalex.org/W2056622362,"Complementary DNAs for the β subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel of rabbit skeletal muscle were isolated on the basis of peptide sequences derived from the purified protein. The deduced primary structure is without homology to other known protein sequences and is consistent with the β subunit being a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of the sarcolemma. The protein contains sites that might be expected to be preferentially phosphorylated by protein kinase C and guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. A messenger RNA for this protein appears to be expressed in brain."
https://openalex.org/W2083842078,We report the cloning of the gene that encodes the yeast TATA binding protein TFIID. TFIID contains 240 amino acids and has no obvious sequence similarity to other known proteins. TFIID was synthesized in vitro and in two separate assays behaved identically to the protein purified from yeast. TFIID bound to TATA elements from the adenovirus major late promoter (TATAAAA) and the yeast LEU2 promoter (TATTTAA) and formed protein-DNA complexes stable to electrophoresis only in the presence of TFIIA. In vitro-synthesized yeast TFIID also complemented a mammalian in vitro transcription system that lacked TFIID. Comparison of the yeast TFIID gene with the yeast SPT15 gene (suppressor of Ty element insertions) showed that the two genes are identical. This finding indicates that the yeast TFIID activity defined in vitro is responsible for specific transcription in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1975909498,"Oligonucleotide recognition offers a powerful chemical approach for the sequence-specific binding of double-helical DNA. In the pyrimidine-Hoogsteen model, a binding size of greater than 15 homopurine base pairs affords greater than 30 discrete sequence-specific hydrogen bonds to duplex DNA. Because pyrimidine oligonucleotides limit triple helix formation to homopurine tracts, it is desirable to determine whether oligonucleotides can be used to bind all four base pairs of DNA. A general solution would allow targeting of oligonucleotides (or their analogs) to any given sequence in the human genome. A study of 20 base triplets reveals that the triple helix can be extended from homopurine to mixed sequences. Guanine contained within a pyrimidine oligonucleotide specifically recognizes thymine.adenine base pairs in duplex DNA. Such specificity allows binding at mixed sites in DNA from simian virus 40 and human immunodeficiency virus."
https://openalex.org/W1531242992,"Gel retardation analyses reveal a cluster of six binding sites for the liganded Ah receptor within a 700-base pair DNA domain upstream of the mouse CYP1A1 gene. The nucleotide sequences of the binding sites define a consensus recognition motif for the liganded receptor. The consensus motif is not symmetric. Alteration of the consensus motif produces a decrease in the receptor-DNA interaction. The ligand receptor binds as a monomer to its recognition motif and preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA. These observations reveal apparent differences between 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and steroid hormones in their respective mechanisms of action."

https://openalex.org/W1479842759,"Abstract An alternate promoter in the glucokinase gene is active in the beta cell and produces a glucokinase mRNA which is longer and that has a different leader sequence and translation start site than the hepatic glucokinase mRNA. The glucokinase beta cell promoter is located at least 12 kilobases upstream from the glucokinase hepatic promoter. Transcription from the glucokinase beta cell promoter initiates over a region of 62 bases. The absence of a TATA box homology in the proximal promoter region may account for the diffuse transcriptional initiation. Translation of the beta cell glucokinase mRNA predicts a glucokinase isozyme that is different from the hepatic isozyme by 15 amino acids at the N terminus. The use of alternative promoters apparently enables the glucokinase gene to be regulated by insulin in the liver and by glucose in the beta cell, thus possibly constituting an important feedback control loop for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Alternate RNA splicing of the beta cell glucokinase mRNA predicts at least two beta cell glucokinase isoforms. An alternate splice acceptor site in the 4th exon of the glucokinase gene was identified in two glucokinase cDNAs from rat insulinoma tissue. Use of the alternate splice acceptor site results in a 51-nucleotide in frame deletion in the beta cell glucokinase mRNA and removal of 17 amino acids from a region of the protein situated between the putative glucose and ATP binding domains. Analysis of the pattern of RNA splicing in tissues containing beta cells indicates that the splice acceptor site utilized in producing hepatic glucokinase mRNA is also utilized in the beta cell."
https://openalex.org/W2082651990,"Mice fed a chemically defined diet devoid of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) grew poorly, failed to reproduce, and became osteolathyritic. Moreover, severely affected mice had friable skin, skin collagen that was readily extractable into neutral salt solutions, and decreased lysyl oxidase. The identification of functional defects in connective tissue and the growth retardation associated with PQQ deprivation suggest that PQQ plays a fundamental role as a growth factor or vitamin."
https://openalex.org/W1551671769,"The hydrogenase (EC 1.2.2.1) of Desulfovibrio gigas is a complex enzyme containing one nickel center, one [3Fe-4S] and two [4Fe-4S] clusters. Redox intermediates of this enzyme were generated under hydrogen (the natural substrate) using a redox-titration technique and were studied by EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. In the oxidized states, the two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters exhibit a broad quadrupole doublet with parameters (apparent delta EQ = 1.10 mm/s and delta = 0.35 mm/s) typical for this type of cluster. Upon reduction, the two [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters are spectroscopically distinguishable, allowing the determination of their midpoint redox potentials. The cluster with higher midpoint potential (-290 +/- 20 mV) was labeled Fe-S center I and the other with lower potential (-340 +/- 20 mV), Fe-S center II. Both reduced clusters show atypical magnetic hyperfine coupling constants, suggesting structural differences from the clusters of bacterial ferredoxins. Also, an unusually broad EPR signal, labeled Fe-S signal B', extending from approximately 150 to approximately 450 mT was observed concomitantly with the reduction of the [4Fe-4S] clusters. The following two EPR signals observed at the weak-field region were tentatively attributed to the reduced [3Fe-4S] cluster: (i) a signal with crossover point at g approximately 12, labeled the g = 12 signal, and (ii) a broad signal at the very weak-field region (approximately 3 mT), labeled the Fe-S signal B. The midpoint redox potential associated with the appearance of the g = 12 signal was determined to be -70 +/- 10 mV. At potentials below -250 mV, the g = 12 signal began to decrease in intensity, and simultaneously, the Fe-S signal B appeared. The transformation of the g = 12 signal into the Fe-S signal B was found to parallel the reduction of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters indicating that the [3Fe-4S]o cluster is sensitive to the redox state of the [4Fe-4S] clusters. Detailed redox profiles for the previously reported Ni-signal C and the g = 2.21 signal were obtained in this study, and evidence was found to indicate that these two signals represent two different oxidation states of the enzyme. Finally, the mechanistic implications of our results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575055097,"Laminin- and elastin-binding proteins were isolated by ligand affinity chromatography from plasma membranes of fetal bovine auricular chondroblasts and human A2058 melanoma cells. From both cell types, a 67-kDa protein was identified which bound to either elastin or laminin affinity resins. Structural and functional similarities between the elastin and laminin-binding proteins were suggested by 1) cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against the two proteins; 2) elution of the laminin receptor from laminin columns with soluble elastin peptides; and 3) modulation of substrate binding by galactoside sugars. In addition, extraction properties indicate that both receptors are peripheral membrane proteins whose association with the cell surface is mediated by their lectin properties. Mapping of the binding site on laminin suggests that the 67-kDa chondroblast receptor interacts with a hydrophobic elastin-like sequence in domain V of the B1 chain, and chemotaxis studies indicate that cell migration to elastin peptides and laminin involves the same receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1592664042,"HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 100 times more resistant to the cytotoxic actions of the antineoplastic, topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating acridine derivative amsacrine (m-AMSA) than is its parent HL-60 line. HL-60/AMSA cells are minimally resistant to etoposide, a topoisomerase II-reactive drug that does not intercalate. Previously we showed that HL-60 topoisomerase II activity in cells, nuclei, or nuclear extracts was sensitive to m-AMSA and etoposide, while HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II was resistant to m-AMSA but sensitive to etoposide. Now we show that purified topoisomerase II from the two cell lines exhibits the same drug sensitivity or resistance as that in the nuclear extracts although the magnitude of the m-AMSA resistance of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II in vitro is not as great as the resistance of the intact HL-60/AMSA cells. In addition HL-60/AMSA cells are cross-resistant to topoisomerase II-reactive intercalators from the anthracycline and ellipticine families and the pattern of sensitivity or resistance to the cytotoxic actions of the various topoisomerase II-reactive drugs is paralleled by topoisomerase II-reactive drug-induced DNA cleavage and protein cross-link production in cells and the production of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and protein cross-linking in isolated biochemical systems. In addition to its lowered sensitivity to intercalators, HL-60/AMSA differed from HL-60 in 1) the susceptibility of its topoisomerase II to stimulation of DNA topoisomerase II complex formation by ATP, 2) the catalytic activity of its topoisomerase II in an ionic environment chosen to reproduce the environment found within the living cell, and 3) the observed restriction enzyme pattern on a Southern blot probed with a cDNA for human topoisomerase II. These data indicate that an m-AMSA-resistant form of topoisomerase II contributes to the resistance of HL-60/AMSA to m-AMSA and to other topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating agents. The drug resistance is associated with additional biochemical and molecular alterations that may be important determinants of cellular sensitivity or resistance to topoisomerase II-reactive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1486939861,"A cDNA clone for the α subunit of mouse brain Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) was transcribed in vitro and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Inclusion of [35S]methionine in the translation system yielded a single 35S-polypeptide of about 50 kDa. When the translation system was assayed for CaM-kinase II activity, there was a 5-10-fold enrichment of kinase activity which was totally dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). Both the 50-kDa 35S-polypeptide and the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase activity were quantitatively immunoprecipitated by rat brain CaM-kinase II antibody. When the translated wild-type kinase was subjected to autophosphorylation conditions in the presence of Ca2+, CaM, Mg2+, and ATP, the Ca2+-independent activity (assayed in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid) increased from 5.8 ± 0.7 to 26.5 ± 2.1% of total activity (assayed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM). These properties confirm the identity of the kinase translated in vitro as CaM-kinase II. The role of Thr-286 autophosphorylation in formation of the Ca2+-independent activity was investigated by site-directed mutation of Thr-286 to Ala (Ala-286 kinase) and to Asp (Asp-286 kinase). The Ala-286 kinase was completely dependent on Ca2+/CaM for activity prior and subsequent to autophosphorylation. The Asp-286 kinase exhibited 21.9 ± 0.8% Ca2+-independent activity, and this was not increased by autophosphorylation. These results establish that introduction of negative charge(s) at residue 286, either by autophosphorylation of Thr or by mutation to Asp, is sufficient and necessary to generate the partially Ca2+-independent form of CaM-kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W2072077423,"CD4 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is thought to interact with nonpolymorphic determinants of class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. CD4 is also the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binding with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Homolog-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify CD4 regions that are important in class II MHC binding and to determine whether the gp120 and class II MHC binding sites of CD4 are related. Class II MHC binding was abolished by mutations in each of the first three immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4. The gp120 binding could be abolished without affecting class II MHC binding and vice versa, although at least one mutation examined reduced both functions significantly. These findings indicate that, while there may be overlap between the gp120 and class II MHC binding sites of CD4, these sites are distinct and can be separated. Thus it should be possible to design CD4 analogs that can block HIV infectivity but intrinsically lack the ability to affect the normal immune response by binding to class II MHC molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2040676520,"The role of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of experimental cholera was evaluated. Fluid accumulated in the rabbit intestinal loop model after 16 hours of incubation with cholera toxin, prostaglandin E1, or prostaglandin E2, but not with membrane-permeable derivatives of cAMP or forskolin. Dibutyryl cAMP triggered a small, transient intestinal fluid accumulation response by 4.5 hours; however, the fluid was completely absorbed by 9 hours. After exposure of intestinal loops to cholera toxin, prostaglandin E was released into the intestinal lumen in a concentration-dependent manner independent of cAMP. Thus, not only cAMP, but also prostaglandins may regulate water and electrolyte secretion in cholera."
https://openalex.org/W1529918245,"Abstract We have characterized the opsin phosphatase activities in extracts of rod outer segments and determined their relationship to known protein phosphatases. The opsin phosphatase activity in the extracts was not due to protein phosphatases 1, 2B, or 2C because it was neither stimulated by Mg2+ or Ca2+/calmodulin nor inhibited by protein phosphatase inhibitors-1 or -2. Opsin phosphatase activity in rod outer segment extracts was potently inhibited by okadaic acid (IC50 approximately 10 nM), a preferential inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A. Moreover, during chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, the opsin phosphatase activity co-eluted with three peaks of protein phosphatase 2A activity, termed protein phosphatases 2A0, 2A1, and 2A2. The opsin phosphatase activity of each peak was stimulated by polylysine, a known activator of protein phosphatase 2A. Finally, treatment of rod outer segment extracts with 80% ethanol at room temperature converted the activity from a high molecular weight form characteristic of the protein phosphatase 2A0, 2A1, and 2A2 species to a low molecular weight form characteristic of the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. We conclude that protein phosphatase 2A is likely to be the physiologically relevant rhodopsin phosphatase. The 48-kDa rod outer segment protein arrestin (S-antigen) was found to inhibit the dephosphorylation of freshly photolyzed rhodopsin by protein phosphatase 2A but did not inhibit the dephosphorylation of unbleached rhodopsin. Arrestin has no effect on the dephosphorylation of phorphorylase a, indicating that the effect was substrate-directed. It appears that dephosphorylation of the photoreceptor protein phosphorhodopsin occurs only after decay of the photoactivated protein and that this may be regulated in vivo by arrestin. The binding of arrestin to photolyzed phosphorylated rhodopsin, i.e. the binding of a regulatory protein to a protein phosphatase substrate to form a complex resistant to dephosphorylation represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A."
https://openalex.org/W1627291089,"Reticulocyte lysate contains all the components of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. Several proteins are degraded in reticulocyte lysate in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. However, none of the proteins studied has a short intracellular half-life. We have investigated the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), one of the most labile proteins in mammalian cells. ODC is efficiently degraded in reticulocyte lysate depleted of the ubiquitin activating enzyme, E1, in fraction II of reticulocyte lysate completely lacking ubiquitin, and in fraction II depleted of the entire complex of enzymes responsible for the ligation of ubiquitin to target proteins. The degradation of ODC is ATP dependent. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in addition to the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway, reticulocyte lysate contains at least one additional ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway. In vitro synthesized ODC served as a substrate in the present degradation study. Its successful utilization establishes a general strategy for investigating the degradation of short-lived proteins (for which a corresponding cDNA is available), that constitute a very small fraction of cellular proteins and for which purification is difficult or impossible. In contrast to ODC synthesized in vitro, that isolated from cells was not degraded by the reticulocyte lysate degradation system, suggesting that post-translational modifications may be involved in regulating ODC degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1544298449,"The recent demonstration that a single mammalian receptor protein binds both mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) with high affinity has suggested a multifunctional physiological role for this receptor, possibly including signal transduction. In order to better understand the functions of this receptor, we have investigated the properties of Man-6-P receptors from non-mammalian species. Receptors were affinity-purified from Triton X-100 extracts of total membranes from Xenopus and chicken liver as well as rat placenta using pentamannosyl 6-phosphate-Sepharose. The Man-6-P receptor was adsorbed to the pentamannosyl 6-phosphate-Sepharose and specifically eluted by Man-6-P in all three species, as evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. When the purified receptors from these three species were cross-linked to 125I-IGF-II with disuccinimidyl suberate, only receptors isolated from rat membranes were affinity-labeled. To further evaluate the properties of these Man-6-P receptors, binding of 125I-rat-IGF-II and 125I-chicken Tyr-Gly-Thr-Ala-IGF-II to purified receptors from Xenopus, chicken, and rat was evaluated by polyethylene glycol precipitation. Only the rat Man-6-P receptor exhibited detectable binding of 125I-IGF-II. These data suggest that the emergence of a high affinity IGF-II binding site on the Man-6-P receptor occurred in evolution after the divergence of mammals from other vertebrates. Thus, the biological actions of IGF-II in chickens and frogs appear to be initiated by the type I IGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2172036559,"Zn2+ (1 mM), Cd2+ (1 mM), and Hg2+ (0.1 mM) belonging to the IIb group in the periodic table stimulated glucose transport activity and cAMP phosphodiesterase in rat adipocytes. The stimulation of glucose transport was due to the translocation of glucose transporters from the intracellular site to the plasma membrane. However, in intact adipocytes none of these ions stimulated insulin receptor kinase activity or phosphorylation of the 95-kDa subunit of insulin receptor or 170- or 60-kDa proteins at the tyrosyl residues. These proteins were markedly phosphorylated by addition of 0.3 nM insulin which stimulated glucose transport activity as effectively as these metal ions. These results indicate that Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ mimic insulin action by a post-receptor/kinase mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1596979305,"We used quantitative immunoblotting to measure the total tissue insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/Man-6-P) receptor in the rat. Whole embryos (6-15 days of gestation) and tissues from 16- and 20-day-old fetal and 5-, 10-, 20-, and 40-day-old postnatal rats were placed in liquid nitrogen, extracted with 2% Triton X-100, and boiled in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with aliquots of a highly purified rat IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor standard. The protein bands were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets by electroelution. The nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with a specific IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor antiserum (3637). The immunoblots were developed with 125I-protein A and an immunoperoxidase stain. Stained areas were cut from the immunoblots, and radioactivity was measured in a gamma-counter. IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor levels were high in fetal tissues and in most tissues declined dramatically in late gestation and/or in the early postnatal period. Concentrations in 16-day-old fetal tissues, expressed as percent of total protein in the extract, were: heart, 1.7; placenta, 1.0; lung, 0.7; intestine, 0.7; muscle, 0.5; kidney, 0.5; liver, 0.3; and brain, 0.1. In whole embryos (6-15 days of gestation), the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor ranged between 0.1 and 0.4% of total protein in the extract. The IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor size varied within approximately 20 kDa among different tissues and also varied with developmental age in the same tissue. We conclude that the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor is a major cellular protein in some fetal tissues and that the developmental pattern of receptor expression suggests that the receptor plays an important role in fetal growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W1495675572,"Abstract The site in calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase, which is phosphorylated by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) has been identified. Analyses of 32P release from tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides derived from [32P]calcineurin plus direct sequence determination established the site as -Arg-Val-Phe-Ser(PO4)-Val-Leu-Arg-, which conformed to the consensus phosphorylation sequence for CaM-kinase II (Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr-). This phosphorylation site is located at the C-terminal boundary of the putative CaM-binding domain in calcinerin (Kincaid, R. L., Nightingale, M. S., and Martin, B. M. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8983-8987), thereby accounting for the observed inhibition of this phosphorylation when Ca2+/CaM is bound to calcineurin. Since the phosphorylation site sequence also contains elements of the specificity determinants for Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) (basic residues both N-terminal and C-terminal to Ser/Thr), we tested calcineurin as a substrate for protein kinase C. Protein kinase C catalyzed rapid stoichiometric phosphorylation, and the characteristics of the reaction were the same as with CaM-kinase II: 1) the phosphorylation was blocked by binding of Ca2+/CaM to calcineurin; 2) phosphorylation partially inactivated calcineurin by increasing the Km (from 9.9 +/- 1.1 to 17.5 +/- 1.1 microM 32P-labeled myosin light chain); and 3) [32P]calcineurin exhibited very slow autodephosphorylation but was rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase IIA. Tryptic and thermolytic 32P-peptide mapping and sequential phosphoamino acid sequence analysis confirmed that protein kinase C and CaM-kinase II phosphorylated the same site."
https://openalex.org/W1558675846,"Medium of untreated human FS-4 foreskin fibroblasts contained a factor which, upon the addition of exogenous tumor necrosis factor (TNF), inhibited encephalomyocarditis virus replication when neither medium alone nor TNF alone were effective. This antiviral activity was abolished by a monoclonal antibody to human interferon (IFN)-beta, suggesting that the active component in the medium from untreated FS-4 cells was IFN-beta, present at subeffective concentrations. In addition, we show that untreated FS-4 cells contain IFN-beta mRNA, demonstrable by the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Treatment of FS-4 cells with TNF produced an approximately 16-fold increase in the steady-state level of IFN-beta mRNA. Our results support the conclusion that autocrine IFN-beta is secreted by untreated normal fibroblasts and that TNF can enhance the production of autocrine IFN-beta by increasing the level of IFN-beta mRNA. Our study also demonstrates that subeffective concentrations of autocrine IFN-beta, which escape detection in conventional assays, are sufficient to produce a strong synergistic action with TNF."
https://openalex.org/W1488153834,"Abstract The UvrA protein is the damage recognition subunit of the Escherichia coli repair enzyme ABC excision nuclease. Sequence analysis of this 940-amino acid protein revealed two regions of sequence homology to the zinc finger motif found in many DNA binding proteins. Physical and chemical analyses indicate about 2 zinc atoms/molecule. We have used extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis to demonstrate that each of these zinc atoms is coordinated with 4 cysteine residues at a distance of 2.32 +/- 0.2 A. Substitution of one of the cysteines by a histidine, a serine, or an alanine in one of the potential finger sites resulted in a respective decrease in complementing activity. We thus conclude that the two zinc fingers identified by sequence analysis do indeed have zinc finger structure in UvrA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1505418565,"A mutant form of the type I regulatory subunit (RI) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been cloned and sequenced (Clegg, C. H., Correll, L. A., Cadd, G. C., and McKnight, G. S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13111-13119) which contains two point mutations in the site B cAMP-binding site, a Gly to Asp at position this report, the effect of each independent mutation on the rate of dissociation of cAMP from RI, the cAMP-mediated activation of holoenzyme and the inducibility of cAMP-responsive genes has been characterized. Dissociation of cAMP from either recombinant wild type RI or the B1 mutant demonstrated biphasic kinetics, indicating two sites with different affinities for cAMP. Dissociation from the B2 subunit, however, was monophasic and very rapid indicating that site B had been destroyed and that the rate of dissociation from site A was increased. The cAMP activation constants (Ka) of the wild type and B1 holoenzymes were 40 and 188 nM, respectively, and demonstrated positive cooperativity, with Hill coefficients of 1.61 for the wild type and 1.67 for B1. The B2 holoenzyme required much greater concentrations of cAMP, 4.7 microM, for half-maximal activation and did not display positive cooperativity. Constitutive expression in mouse AtT20 pituitary cells of the B1 mutant resulted in only a small shift in the Ka for kinase activation in these cells compared with B2 expression which increased the Ka by more than 100-fold. Transient expression of the B1 subunit in human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells inhibited forskolin activation of a cAMP-responsive promoter by 35% whereas similar expression of the B2 RI subunit inhibited the response by 90%. These results suggest that the Gly to Asp mutation at amino acid 324 completely blocks cAMP binding to site B whereas the Arg to His mutation at position 332 causes a more subtle alteration in cAMP binding. Expression of either mutant RI in animal cells results in a dominant repression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated processes."

https://openalex.org/W1514619088,"The bacteriophage T4 uvsY protein is required for efficient recombination in T4-infected Escherichia coli cells. Previous in vitro work has shown that the purified uvsY protein is an accessory protein; it stimulates homologous pairing catalyzed by the phage uvsX protein (a RecA-like recombinase) under certain conditions. We show here that this effect can be traced, at least in part, to a UvsY-dependent stabilization of uvsX protein-single-stranded DNA complexes. These presynaptic filaments are one of the early obligatory intermediates in the strand exchange reaction between homologous single- and double-stranded DNAs. The mechanism of filament stabilization seems to involve a slower loss of UvsX subunits. A model that accounts for the data is presented in which both recombination proteins are incorporated into the presynaptic filament."
https://openalex.org/W1510888770,"Previous studies have demonstrated that modification of erythrocyte membrane cysteine residues via disulfide cross-briding or direct derivatization with thiol reagents promotes massive morphological, rheological, and structural changes in the cell. To determine whether disruption of the band 3-ankyrin interaction, the major membrane-cytoskeletal linkage, might contribute to the above lesions, we quantitatively measured the band 3-ankyrin interaction following modification of Cys-201 and/or Cys-317 of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. It was observed that irreversible alkylating agents (e.g. N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide and its derivatives), reversible derivatizing compounds (.e.g. p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate or glutathione), and native disulfide bond formation all blocked the ankyrin interaction. Comparison of the extent of sulfhydryl modification with the degree of inhibition of ankyrin binding further confirmed that cysteine modification was directly responsible for the inhibition. However, analysis of the site of sulfhydryl derivatization revealed that inhibition of ankyrin binding could be initiated in some cases with derivatization of Cys-201, while in other cases obstruction of Cys-317 appeared to be essential. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by demonstrating that Cys-201 of one strand of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 dimer could disulfide bond with Cys-317 of the opposite strand, thus demonstrating that all four cysteines of the band 3 dimer are clustered at the interface between subunits. We argue that derivatization or disulfide cross-linking of these cysteines can block ankyrin binding by both conformational and steric mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1600194088,"Abstract The A1 adenosine receptor from rat brain membranes has been purified about 50,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by sequential use of affinity chromatography on immobilized xanthine amine congener-agarose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and reaffinity chromatography. The overall yield starting from the membranes was approximately 4%. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified preparation gave a broad single band of an apparent molecular weight of 34,000 either by silver staining or autoradiogram after radioiodination. The purified receptor bound approximately 24 nmol of 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-[3H]dipropylxanthine/mg of protein with a dissociation constant of 1.4 nM. This maximum specific binding value is consistent with the expected theoretical specific activity (29.4 nmol/mg) for a protein with a molecular mass of 34,000 daltons if it is assumed that there is one ligand-binding site/receptor molecule. Affinity-labeling experiments using [3H]p-phenylenediisothiocyanate-xanthine amine congener showed that the Mr = 34,000 protein band contained the ligand-binding sites. The purified receptor gave a typical A1 adenosine receptor pharmacological specificity similar to that of unpurified receptor preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1606115842,"Abstract Whole cell 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) receptor (VDR) binding assays, which measure VDR in the presence of the metabolic machinery of the cell, were used in conjunction with a cytosol binding assay for VDR to determine if self-induced metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 limits VDR occupancy, total VDR levels, and target cell responsiveness. Treatment of cells with 0.5 nM 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 for 16 h results in up-regulation of total cell VDR from 82 to 170 fmol/mg protein as measured in a cytosol binding assay. Conversely, whole cell binding assays of VDR showed a 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated apparent down-regulation of VDR from 90 to 40 fmol/mg protein. Scatchard analysis using the cytosol binding assay demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment increased total cell VDR from 93 to 154 fmol/mg protein. In contrast, Scatchard analysis with the whole cell binding assay demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment resulted in reduction in total cell VDR from 100 to 64 fmol/mg protein. Initial Kd estimates with the whole cell binding assay suggested that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment resulted in a reduction in VDR Kd from 0.6 to 6.2 nM. This apparent reduction in the affinity of VDR for 1,25-(OH)2D3 was due to degradation of free 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 which occurred during whole cell saturation assay. Competitive inhibitors of 1,25-(OH)2D3 metabolism were found to reverse the apparent receptor down-regulation observed in whole cell binding assays of treated cells. In addition, the presence of competitive inhibitors amplified responses of cells to 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 treatment as measured by an increased occupancy of VDR by 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 and increased up-regulation of VDR over that observed without metabolism inhibitors. These data demonstrate that self-induced target tissue deactivation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates 1,25-(OH)2D3 occupancy of VDR and ultimately the biopotency of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605871938,"Leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor induced a rapidly oscillating actin polymerization/depolymerization response in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. N-Formylpeptides were deficient in the ability to induce these oscillations. Flow cytometric analysis of filamentous actin verified that all cells were synchronously responding in this cyclic manner. The hypothesis was tested that these oscillations were analogous to chemical oscillations, i.e. oscillations of intermediate species in chemical systems that are far from equilibrium (Epstein, I. R., Kustin, K., DeKepper, P., and Orban, M. (1983) Sci. Am. 248, 112). Actin polymerization/depolymerization cycles were terminated by adding receptor antagonist a few seconds after initiation of the response by agonists. Thus the oscillations did not represent chemical oscillations that hypothetically could result from a rapid jump of the intracellular milieu to a state far from equilibrium. Rather, continued occupancy of receptors and/or occupancy of new receptors was required to sustain the oscillations. This suggested that the oscillations resulted from regulated polymerization and depolymerization pathways. In simultaneous measurements of actin-associated right angle light scatter and intracellular calcium, no calcium oscillations were detected. Thus, cycles of actin polymerization/depolymerization were not regulated by calcium oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1532000327,"Cell surface binding sites for the constituent proteins of the fibrinolytic system may play a role in the localization and regulation of fibrinolysis. In the present study, specific binding of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to human blood platelets was identified and characterized. 125I-labeled rt-PA was found to bind specifically, saturably, and reversibly to the surface of gel-filtered platelets, reaching equilibrium within 5 min at 22 degrees C. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites. Unstimulated platelets bound 120,000 +/- 24,000 (mean +/- S.D.) molecules/platelet with an apparent Kd of 340 +/- 25 nM, whereas thrombin-stimulated platelets bound 290,000 +/- 32,000 molecules/platelet with an apparent Kd of 800 +/- 60 nM. Binding of 0.1 microM 125I-rt-PA was greater than 90% reversible by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled rt-PA. Binding was not inhibited by fibrinogen or single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator, but plasminogen partially competed for binding of 125I-rt-PA to platelets (up to 40% displacement). These findings indicate that the platelet surface possesses a large number of specific, low affinity binding sites for t-PA and provide further evidence for the role of platelets in localization and regulation of fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1482639028,"Abstract The substrate specificity of the ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation system was explored with regard to recognition of unfolded conformation and/or oxidized methionine residues in six derivatives of bovine RNase A. Based on the following observations, ubiquitination of RNase A substrates by the enzymes in a rabbit reticulocyte extract appears to correlate with unfolded conformation rather than with methionine oxidation. 1) Methionine oxidation in already unfolded forms of RNase A does not enhance ubiquitination. 2) Fluorescence measurements and iodoacetate trapping of free sulfhydryls show that the disulfide bonds of MetSO-RNase A, in which the 4 methionine residues are oxidized to the sulfoxide, are reduced by 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in standard Ub conjugation assays so that this derivative also is unfolded. 3) Although MetSO-RNase A is ubiquitinated in the absence of DTT, its intrinsic fluorescence, cation-exchange properties, and susceptibility to reduction indicate a non-native conformation. 4) Methionine sulfoxide-containing peptides that mimic regions of RNase A fail to inhibit conjugation of 125I-Ub to MetSO-RNase A. Ub adducts to two of the six derivatives (MetSO- and reduced/carboxamidomethylated MetSO-RNase A) increase when DTT is omitted from the reactions. Ubaldehyde, an inhibitor of isopeptidases that disassemble Ub-protein conjugates, increased product yields and reduced or abolished the DTT effect, suggesting that an isopeptidase specific for these two RNase A derivatives may be inactivated by oxidation. Ub conjugates of the other RNase A derivatives also increase with Ub-aldehyde but are unaffected by DTT."

Comparison to EPR of oxidized apo-CODH (CODH from which Ni is lacking) leads to the identification of signals whose intensity is correlated with the presence of Ni. 61Ni labeling observably broadens the sharpest feature of these signals, as does 57Fe. R. rubrum CODH thus contains a cluster containing both Ni and Fe. The EPR associated with this cluster is unlike any EPR previously attributed to Ni-containing prosthetic groups in other CODH enzymes or Ni-containing hydrogenases. The CO-analogue, CN-, perturbs the EPR signals that are attributed to the Ni-Fe species."
https://openalex.org/W1577086989,"Virus inducible elements (IE) in promoters of mouse alpha-interferon and human beta 1-interferon genes contain multiple copies of the hexanucleotide sequence AGT-GAA or its variants which are also found in the interferon-stimulated response element of genes transcriptionally induced by interferon. We have examined the similarities between virus and interferon induction of gene expression and the role of AGTGAA and AAT-GAA hexamers in these responses. Hybrid plasmids were constructed by inserting the IE region, the alpha 4 promoter, or the multiple copies of AGTGAA or AAT-GAA 5' to the inactive-45 human immunodeficiency-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase hybrid gene, and their inducible expression was studied in a transient expression assay. In L-cells, multiple hexamers were efficiently induced both by infection with Newcastle disease virus and by interferon treatment; while the alpha 4 promoter and the IE inducible region were induced predominantly by virus rather than by interferon. In order to dissociate the effect of virus and endogenous interferon on the induction process, we examined the gene expression in Vero cells, which have undergone homozygous deletion of type 1 interferon genes, and in VNPT-159 cells, which were derived from Vero cells by insertion of an inducible human interferon beta 1 gene. The results show that while the alpha 4 promoter was efficiently induced only by virus in both cell types, the constructs containing shorter segments of the IE were induced by both virus and interferon in Vero cells. However, the inducibility by interferon was not detected in VNPT-159 cells, suggesting that the presence of endogenous interferon suppresses interferon-induced expression of hexanucleotide repeats and the short inducible region. In contrast, virus inducibility of endogenous interferon-stimulated genes, ISG-15 and ISG-54, was about 100-fold more efficient in VNPT-159 cells than in Vero cells, suggesting that this induction is largely mediated through synthesis of endogenous interferon. Hence, endogenous interferon may play a role in the autoregulation of both interferon genes and interferon-stimulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1546471181,"Binding of [3H]Ro5-4864, a specific ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, was determined in subcellular fractions of guinea pig lung. Even though the level of binding was predominant in the mitochondrial fraction, nuclear and cytosolic fractions also contained significantly measurable amounts of binding sites. The presence of binding sites in the microsomal fraction and in a fraction intermediate in density between the mitochondria and microsomes depended on which buffer was used to homogenize the tissue. If calcium-containing mannitol buffer was used, binding was negligible in the postmitochondrial organelles. However, in the case of sucrose buffer which did not contain any calcium, the postmitochondrial organelle fractions contained measurable amounts of binding sites. Most probably, these binding sites were of mitochondrial and nuclear origin. Furthermore, binding sites in the mitochondria were associated with the succinic dehydrogenase-enriched mitochondrial inner membrane, but not with the monoamine oxidase- and cholinephosphotransferase-enriched outer mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, several proteolytic enzymes caused a decrease in binding of the ligand to the mitochondrial membrane only under hypotonic conditions and not under isotonic conditions, suggesting that the location of the receptors is inside the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1492892194,"In this work we have characterized the ability of a carboxyl peptide-specific antibody (AS/7), raised against the α subunit of transducin (αT), to potentiate the stimulation of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by transducin. The complexation of the purified guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP γS)-bound form of α T (α T.GTP γ S) with AS/7 results in a 2-5-fold enhancement in the total levels of cyclic GMP hydrolysis measured after 1 min. This potentiation by AS/7 cannot be attributed simply to an increase in the apparent affinity of αT. GTP γS for the effector enzyme, nor to an increased affinity of the enzyme for the substrate cyclic GMP. The AS/7-induced potentiation is specific for α T.GTP γS-PDE interactions; this antibody has no effect on the activity of the trypsin-activated PDE nor on the ability of the GDP-bound form of αT to inhibit the trypsin-activated enzyme (Kroll, S., Phillips, W. J., and Cerione, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4490-4497). Phosphatidylcholine vesicles also will enhance the α T.GTP γ S-stimulated PDE activity (1.5-2-fold) relative to that measured in the absence of a lipid milieu. However, the potentiations of α T-stimulated cyclic GMP hydrolysis elicited by AS/7 and lipids represent separate events. Titration profiles describing the AS/7-induced potentiation, as a function of the amount of antibody added to the assay mixtures, indicate that maximal activity occurs when there is one molecule of AS/7 per two molecules of αT.GTP γ S; the AS/7-induced potentiation is lost when AS/7 much greater than αT. GTP γ S, i.e. conditions which favor the formation of monovalent AS/7-αT.GTP γ S complexes. When the AS/7 is papain-treated to yield monovalent antibody molecules, complexation between these monovalent antibodies and αT still occurs (as reflected by the ability of these antibodies to block rhodopsin-αT coupling); however, the potentiation of the αT.GTP γS-stimulated PDE activity is lost. Taken together, these results suggest that the AS/7-induced potentiation of αT-stimulated activity is dependent on the bivalent nature of the antibody, and maximal stimulation of PDE activity is achieved by the interactions of two activated-αT molecules with a single molecule of PDE."
https://openalex.org/W1550519952,"Our previous studies indicated that amino acid residues 240-250 in the cysteine-rich region of the human insulin receptor alpha-subunit constitute a site in which insulin binds (Yip, C. C., Hsu, H., Patel, R. G., Hawley, D. M., Maddux, B. A., and Goldfine, I. D. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157, 321-329). We have now constructed a human insulin receptor mutant in which 3 residues in this sequence were altered (Thr-Cys-Pro-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Tyr-His-Phe-Gln-Asp to Thr-Cys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Asp-Phe-Gln-Asp) and have expressed this mutant in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells. When compared with cells transfected with normal insulin receptors, cells transfected with mutant receptors had an increase in insulin-binding affinity and a decrease in the dissociation of bound 125I-insulin. Studies using solubilized receptors also demonstrated that mutant receptors had a higher binding affinity than normal receptors. In contrast, cells transfected with either mutant or normal receptors bound monoclonal antibodies against the receptor alpha-subunit with equal affinity. When receptor tyrosine kinase activity and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake were measured, cells transfected with mutant insulin receptors were more sensitive to insulin than cells transfected with normal receptors. These findings lend further support therefore to the hypothesis that amino acid sequence 240-250 of the human insulin receptor alpha-subunit constitutes one site that interacts with insulin, and they indicate that mutations in this site can influence insulin receptor binding and transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1551957818,"Abstract A complex composed of factor Xa and phospholipid vesicles assembled in the presence of calcium ions catalyzes a discrete cleavage of the heavy chain of bovine protein C that is indistinguishable from that produced by thrombin as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This cleavage generates an active site capable of hydrolyzing small substrates and inactivating factor Va function in the prothrombinase complex. Activation of protein C by factor Xa requires both calcium ions and phospholipid vesicles and proceeds at a rate an order of magnitude greater than that observed for alpha-thrombin in solution. gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid-domainless protein C is not activated by factor Xa, consistent with the requirement for phospholipid and distinguishing this reaction from protein C activation by thrombin. Thrombomodulin serves as a cofactor for the factor Xa-catalyzed reaction, forming a 1:1 complex with factor Xa (apparent Kd = 5.7 X 10(-10) M) and stimulating the saturated rate of protein C activation by factor Xa (kcat = 149 min-1) to levels comparable with the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Protein C activation by factor Xa is not inhibited by the specific thrombin inhibitor dansyl-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide but is inhibited by antithrombin III, tripeptide-chloromethyl ketones, and the monoclonal antibody alpha-BFX-2b that is highly specific for factor Xa. These data indicate that thrombomodulin is promiscuous in its role as a cofactor and suggest the existence of an alternative pathway for protein C activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1523561741,"Abstract The synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog (Nle8, Nle18, Tyr34) bovine PTH(1-34)amide (bPTH(1-34)amide) was reacted with biotinyl-epsilon aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide under conditions which yielded five isoforms which were fractionated by a combination of reversed phase and ion-exchange chromatography. These reaction products were analyzed by automated Edman degradation in a manner which allowed us to specify the location and number of biotin residues on picomole quantities of hormone. The ability of each of these isoforms to induce a rise in intracellular cAMP in the ROS 17/2.8 cell line allowed us to evaluate the effect on function of biotinylation at different residues. Derivatized PTH molecules which contained a single biotin at either lysine 13, lysine 26, or lysine 27 possessed full biological activity. However, bioactivity was significantly reduced when position 13 plus either lysine 26 or 27 were biotinylated. Biological activity was lost when all 3 lysine residues were biotinylated. Biotinylation of the alpha-NH2 group of alanine at the NH2 terminus also resulted in a total loss of activity. Hence, unlike the effect of altering the alanine at position 1, modification of a single lysine residue at positions 13, 26, and 27 has a less critical effect on biological activity of the molecule. However, biotinylation of all three lysines results in a biologically inert PTH derivative and suggests that changes in isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, or tertiary structure may strongly influence hormone function. A fully bioactive-mixture of isoforms was used to detect receptors on ROS 17/2.8 cells by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin as a fluorescent indicator. Binding to cell surface receptors was saturable and could be inhibited by native bPTH(1-34) but not by transforming growth factor beta, calcitonin or insulin. Moreover, PTH receptors could also be detected on primary cultures of human bone cells and human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1480309232,"We have recently reported that neolacto series gangliosides (NeuAc-nLc) are increased during granulocytic differentiation of human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 cells induced by retinoic acid and that HL-60 cells are differentiated into mature granulocytes when the cells are cultivated with NeuAc-nLc (Nojiri, H., Kitagawa, S., Nakamura, M., Kirito, K., Enomoto, Y., and Saito, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7443-7446). In contrast to these wild-type-HL-60 cells, HL-60 cells resistant to differentiation induction by retinoic acid showed a markedly decreased content of gangliosides, especially NeuAc-nLc, and did not show any increase in the content of gangliosides when cultivated with retinoic acid. Neutral glycosphingolipids, the precursors of gangliosides, were not accumulated in these resistant cells. When retinoic acid-resistant HL-60 cells were cultivated in the presence of NeuAc-nLc, the cells were found to be differentiated into mature granulocytes on morphological and functional criteria. The differentiation of cells was dependent on the concentration of gangliosides and was accompanied by inhibition of cell growth. Wild-type HL-60 cells differentiated by NeuAc-nLc showed the changes in ganglioside composition, which were similar to those in wild-type HL-60 cells differentiated by retinoic acid; among the gangliosides changed, 2----3 sialylparagloboside and 2----3 sialylnorhexaosylceramide were increased. These findings suggest (a) that the synthesis of particular NeuAc-nLe molecules is an important step for retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation and this step could be bypassed or replaced by exogenous NeuAc-nLc, and (b) that the defective synthesis of particular NeuAc-nLc molecules is responsible for the failure of differentiation induction in retinoic acid-resistant HL-60 cells by retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1637886500,"Erythropoietin (Epo) binds specifically to receptors on the surface membrane of responsive erythroid cells. In search of ontogenic changes in Epo receptor behavior, we studied characteristics of specific binding to hamster yolk sac erythroid cells during hamster ontogeny. We detected receptors specific for Epo on these cells throughout the duration of their intravascular existence (hamster gestational days 8 through 13). These receptors are saturable at an Epo concentration of 1.2 nM in the incubation medium. Attainment of equilibrium of binding prior to hormone internalization, a requirement for receptor binding assays, was possible at 10 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Hence, all incubations of cells with Epo were carried out at 10 degrees C. Data on specific binding analyzed by the method of Scatchard demonstrated that yolk sac erythroid cells possess a single class of Epo receptors at each stage of gestation examined. Binding affinity and numbers of receptors per cell change as ontogeny progresses: Kd (the dissociation constant) increases, a phenomenon observed in other differentiating cell systems, whereas the number of receptors per cell peaks on gestational day 10. The variability in number of receptors per cell is consonant with up and down regulation controlled by Epo availability. We propose that the progressive increase in Kd might be best explained by ontogenic changes in cell membrane structure contiguous to the receptors themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1521394948,"The endogenous neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH 1-13), previously found to have marked antipyretic activity, inhibits histamine-induced increases in vasopermeability. The primary antipyretic amino acid message sequence is believed to be the COOH-terminal trieptide, lysine-proline-valine. In recent preliminary research this tripeptide inhibited increases in vasopermeability, raising the possibility that this portion of the alpha-MSH molecule has general antiinflammatory activity. To test this idea, the effects of graded doses of alpha-MSH [11-13] on ear swelling induced by picryl chloride in mice were compared with the effects of saline and a large dose of corticosteroid. Alpha-MSH [11-13] inhibited swelling in a dose-related fashion. This result, together with previous findings, suggests that endogenous circulating alpha-MSH and its COOH-terminal fragments may contribute to modulation of physiological responses in host defense. If this is true, it may be possible to develop new peptide drugs or mimetics based on the tripeptide that are useful in treating inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1603726753,"Abstract Tetrabutyl-2(2-phenoxyethyl)-1,3-propylidene diphosphonate (SR-7037) completely displaced dihydropyridine [( 3H]PN200-110), phenylalkylamine [( 3H]D888), and benzothiazepine [( 3H]diltiazem) ligands from brain L-type calcium channels. Half-maximal inhibition of [3H]PN200-110 binding occurred at 19 nM with a Hill coefficient of 0.96. SR-7037 primarily decreased the affinity for [3H]PN200-110 with a small, but significantly, effect on the maximal binding capacity. Kinetic studies showed that this was due to an increased radioligand dissociation rate from 0.04 min-1 to 0.43 min-1 in the presence of the diphosphonate. Displacement of [3H]D888 by SR-7037 was biphasic with respective IC50 of 44 and 8400 nM. Likewise, unlabeled (-)-D888 identified two sites with IC50 values of 0.9 and 27 nM. Both SR-7037 (1000 nM) and D888 (200 nM) accelerated radioligand dissociation about 2-fold. [3H]Diltiazem binding was inhibited by SR-7037 with an IC50 value of 29 nM. The inhibition of dihydropyridine binding by SR-7037 is enhanced by most divalent cations at millimolar concentrations with the following potency: Mn2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Co2+. Barium has the opposite effect. The half-maximal effect of calcium occurred at 6 microM free ion. Specific binding of [3H]D888 was antagonized in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. It is concluded that SR-7037 has allosteric interactions with the dihydropyridine receptor of the L-type calcium channel. The differential effect of Ca2+ on the potency of D888 and diltiazem relative to that of SR-7037 indicates that the three drugs may bind to nonequivalent sites. These results support specific calcium channel inhibition, possibly at a novel site, as the primary mechanism of the diphosphonate's pharmacological actions."
https://openalex.org/W1574562818,"Abstract The insulin-sensitive cAMP phosphodiesterase (phosphodiesterase) in rat adipocytes is a membrane-bound low Km enzyme that can be recovered in a crude microsomal fraction (Fraction P-2). The action of this enzyme to hydrolyze cAMP is known to be inhibited by cGMP; nevertheless, it was found in our present study that under selected conditions, the enzyme can also be stimulated by cGMP as well as some other nucleotide derivatives. The maximum cGMP-dependent stimulation was observed when the enzyme in Fraction P-2 was incubated with 10 microM cGMP for 5-20 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of Mg2+, washed, and then assayed in the absence of added cGMP. The level of this stimulation was close to, but less than, that achieved by insulin in intact cells. The actions of the cGMP- and insulin-stimulated enzymes to hydrolyze labeled cAMP were inhibited in an identical manner by cilostamide (Ki = 0.10 microM), griseolic acid (Ki = 0.19 microM), unlabeled cAMP (Km = 0.20 microM), and cGMP (Ki = 0.16 microM), all added to the assay system. Also, the basal, insulin-stimulated, and cGMP-activated enzymes were identically inhibited by a polyclonal antibody raised against a purified membrane-bound low Km phosphodiesterase from bovine adipose tissue. When the same antibody was used for the Western blot analysis of Fraction P-2, it immunoreacted with a single band of protein (165 kDa). These observations indicate that the insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase in rat adipocytes can be stimulated with 10 microM cGMP and that this stimulation is detectable only after the nucleotide has been eliminated since the enzyme would be strongly inhibited by the nucleotide if the latter exists in the assay system. It is proposed that the insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase, which is often referred to as a Type IV enzyme, is functionally similar to the Type II enzymes that are known to be stimulated by a low concentration of cGMP and inhibited by higher concentrations of the same nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1498611366,"Abstract A well defined extrachromosomal DNA element, referred to as an episome (Ostrowski, M., Richard-Foy, H., Wolford, R., Berard, D., and Hager, G. (1983) Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 2045-2057), was employed as a target for the topoisomerase II inhibitors amsacrine and teniposide. Both drugs have distinct mechanisms of action in cleaving the episome, as defined by topological forms conversion assays. The concentration ranges required to measure episomal cleavage are similar. The onset of damage induced by amsacrine begins within 1 min and is maintained at that level for at least 1 h. Teniposide induces damage that peaks between 30 and 60 min. The amsacrine-induced damage is only partially reversible, whereas teniposide-induced damage is almost completely reversible. Sites of specific cleavage are quite dissimilar. Multiple cleavage sites are formed in the episomal regulatory regions after amsacrine treatment, whereas a single cleavage in the regulatory region and one outside this region are found after teniposide treatment. Transcriptional activation using dexamethasone does not change the amount or site preference of episomal cleavage induced by either agent. Damage to the episome was quantitatively compared with damage produced in genomic DNA between 500 and 24,000 rad equivalents. The study showed that amsacrine has a significant (33-38-fold) preference for episomal DNA over genomic DNA."
