https://openalex.org/W4309780556,"The TOC and TIC complexes are essential translocons that facilitate the import of the nuclear genome-encoded preproteins across the two envelope membranes of chloroplast, but their exact molecular identities and assembly remain unclear. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of TOC-TIC supercomplex from Chlamydomonas, containing a total of 14 identified components. The preprotein-conducting pore of TOC is a hybrid β-barrel co-assembled by Toc120 and Toc75, while the potential translocation path of TIC is formed by transmembrane helices from Tic20 and YlmG, rather than a classic model of Tic110. A rigid intermembrane space (IMS) scaffold bridges two chloroplast membranes, and a large hydrophilic cleft on the IMS scaffold connects TOC and TIC, forming a pathway for preprotein translocation. Our study provides structural insights into the TOC-TIC supercomplex composition, assembly, and preprotein translocation mechanism, and lays a foundation to interpret the evolutionary conservation and diversity of this fundamental translocon machinery."
https://openalex.org/W4309796697,"Background Stigma can be experienced as perceived or actual disqualification from social and institutional acceptance on the basis of one or more physical, behavioural or other attributes deemed to be undesirable. Long Covid is a predominantly multisystem condition that occurs in people with a history of SARSCoV2 infection, often resulting in functional disability. This study aimed to develop and validate a Long Covid Stigma Scale (LCSS); and to quantify the burden of Long Covid stigma. Methods Data from the follow-up of a co-produced community-based Long Covid online survey using convenience non-probability sampling was used. Thirteen questions on stigma were designed to develop the LCSS capturing three domains–enacted (overt experiences of discrimination), internalised (internalising negative associations with Long Covid and accepting them as self-applicable) and anticipated (expectation of bias/poor treatment by others) stigma. Confirmatory factor analysis tested whether LCSS consisted of the three hypothesised domains. Model fit was assessed and prevalence was calculated. Results 966 UK-based participants responded (888 for stigma questions), with mean age 48 years (SD: 10.7) and 85% female. Factor loadings for enacted stigma were 0.70–0.86, internalised 0.75–0.84, anticipated 0.58–0.87, and model fit was good. The prevalence of experiencing stigma at least ‘sometimes’ and ‘often/always’ was 95% and 76% respectively. Anticipated and internalised stigma were more frequently experienced than enacted stigma. Those who reported having a clinical diagnosis of Long Covid had higher stigma prevalence than those without. Conclusion This study establishes a scale to measure Long Covid stigma and highlights common experiences of stigma in people living with Long Covid."

How brainstem circuits encode and convey these locomotor parameters remains unclear. Here, we have combined in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, anatomy, and behavior in adult zebrafish to address these questions. We reveal that the detailed parameters of locomotor movements are encoded by two molecularly, topographically, and functionally segregated glutamatergic neuron subpopulations within the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The start, duration, and changes of locomotion speed are encoded by vGlut2+ neurons, whereas vGlut1+ neurons encode sudden changes to high speed/high amplitude movements. Ablation of vGlut2+ neurons compromised slow-explorative swimming, whereas vGlut1+ neuron ablation impaired fast swimming. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how separate brainstem subpopulations implement flexible locomotor commands. These two brainstem command subpopulations are suitably organized to integrate environmental cues and hence generate flexible swimming movements to match the animal’s behavioral needs."

https://openalex.org/W4309796908,"This paper presents a new global dataset on contemporary witchcraft beliefs and investigates their correlates. Witchcraft beliefs cut across socio-demographic groups but are less widespread among the more educated and economically secure. Country-level variation in the prevalence of witchcraft beliefs is systematically linked to a number of cultural, institutional, psychological, and socioeconomic characteristics. Consistent with their hypothesized function of maintaining order and cohesion in the absence of effective governance mechanisms, witchcraft beliefs are more widespread in countries with weak institutions and correlate positively with conformist culture and in-group bias. Among the documented potential costs of witchcraft beliefs are disrupted social relations, high levels of anxiety, pessimistic worldview, lack of entrepreneurial culture and innovative activity."
https://openalex.org/W4309797046,"With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of cannabis use in pregnancy. Our population-based study investigated the effects of prenatal cannabis use on maternal and newborn outcomes, and modification by infant sex.The cohort included 1,280,447 singleton births from the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, the Better Outcomes Registry & Network Ontario, and the Perinatal Program Newfoundland Labrador from April 1st, 2012 to March 31st, 2019. Logistic regression determined the associations between prenatal cannabis use and low birth weight, small-for-gestational age, large-for-gestational age, spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth, very preterm birth, stillbirth, major congenital anomalies, caesarean section, gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension. Models were adjusted for other substance use, socio-demographic and-economic characteristics, co-morbidities. Interaction terms were included to investigate modification by infant sex.The prevalence of cannabis use in our cohort was approximately 2%. Prenatal cannabis use is associated with increased risks of spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth (1.80[1.68-1.93] and 1.94[1.77-2.12], respectively), very preterm birth (1.73[1.48-2.02]), low birth weight (1.90[1.79-2.03]), small-for-gestational age (1.21[1.16-1.27]) and large-for-gestational age (1.06[1.01-1.12]), any major congenital anomaly (1.71[1.49-1.97]), caesarean section (1.13[1.09-1.17]), and gestational diabetes (1.32[1.23-1.42]). No association was found for stillbirth or gestational hypertension. Only small-for-gestational age (p = 0.03) and spontaneous preterm birth (p = 0.04) showed evidence of modification by infant sex.Prenatal cannabis use increases the likelihood of preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age and major congenital anomalies with prenatally exposed female infants showing evidence of increased susceptibility. Additional measures are needed to inform the public and providers of the inherent risks of cannabis exposure in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4309928097,"Post-acute COVID-19 sequelae refers to a variety of health complications involving different organ systems that have been described among individuals after acute phase of illness. Data from unselected population groups with long-time follow up is needed to comprehensively describe the full spectrum of post-acute COVID-19 complications.In this retrospective nationwide cohort study, we used data obtained from electronic health record database. Our primary cohort were adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 and matched (age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index) unaffected controls from general population. Individuals included from February 2020 until March 2021 were followed up for 12 months. We estimated risks of all-cause mortality, readmission and incidence of 16 clinical sequelae after acute COVID-19 phase. Using a frailty Cox model, we compared incidences of outcomes in two cohorts.The cohort comprised 3949 patients older than 18 years who were alive 30 days after COVID-19 hospital admission and 15511 controls. Among cases 40.3% developed at least one incident clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was two times higher than in general population group. We report substantially higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.57 (95%CI 2.23-2.96) and hospital readmission aHR = 1.73 (95%CI 1.58-1.90) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We found that the risks for new clinical sequalae were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than their controls, especially for dementia aHR = 4.50 (95% CI 2.35-8.64), chronic lower respiratory disease aHR = 4.39 (95% CI 3.09-6.22), liver disease aHR 4.20 (95% CI 2.01-8.77) and other (than ischemic) forms of heart diseases aHR = 3.39 (95%CI 2.58-4.44).Our results provide evidence that the post-acute COVID-19 morbidity within the first year after COVID-19 hospitalization is substantial. Risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation and majority of clinical sequelae were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in general population controls and warrant targeted prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4309645674,"A meaningful engagement of learners is critical in the quality teaching and learning of mathematics at school level. Learner engagement has been an ongoing issue in mathematics classrooms in Nepal and elsewhere. In this context, this study aimed to examine the level of engagement (behavioral, social, emotional, and cognitive activities) and their association with learning mathematics through the virtual mode of instruction during the pandemic. The cross-sectional online survey design was employed among 402 secondary-level mathematics teachers in Nepal. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and structural equation modeling were the major statistical techniques used in research. The findings indicate that the level of behavioral, social, emotional, and cognitive engagement of students was found to be high in the online mode of instruction. Additionally, cognitive engagement has significant highest impact on social, behavior, and emotional engagement."
https://openalex.org/W4309796357,"Background Wasting is perhaps one of the signs of malnutrition that has been linked to the deaths of children suffering from malnutrition. As a result, understanding its correlations and drivers is critical. Using quantile regression analysis, this research aims to contribute to the discussion on under-5 malnutrition by analyzing the predictors of wasting in Bangladesh. Methods and materials The dataset was extracted from the 2017–18 Bangladesh demographic and health survey (BDHS) data. The weight-for-height (WHZ) z-score based anthropometric indicator was used in the study as the target variable. The weighted sample constitutes 8,334 children of under-5 years. However, after cleaning the missing values, the analysis is based on 8,321 children. Sequential quantile regression was used for finding the contributing factors. Results The findings of this study depict that the prevalence of wasting in children is about 8 percent and only approximately one percent of children are severely wasted in Bangladesh. Age, mother’s BMI, and parental educational qualification, are all major factors of the WHZ score of a child. The coefficient of the female child increased from 0.1 to 0.2 quantiles before dropping to 0.75 quantile. For a child aged up to three years, the coefficients have a declining tendency up to the 0.5 quantile, then an increasing trend. Children who come from the richest households had 16.3%, 3.6%, and 15.7% higher WHZ scores respectively than children come from the poorest households suggesting that the risk of severe wasting in children under the age of five was lower in children from the wealthiest families than in children from the poorest families. The long-term malnutrition indicator (wasting) will be influenced by the presence of various childhood infections and vaccinations. Furthermore, a family’s economic position is a key determinant in influencing a child’s WHZ score. Conclusions It is concluded that socioeconomic characteristics are correlated with the wasting status of a child. Maternal characteristics also played an important role to reduce the burden of malnutrition. Thus, maternal nutritional awareness might reduce the risk of malnutrition in children. Moreover, the findings disclose that to enrich the nutritional status of children along with achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-3 by 2030, a collaborative approach should necessarily be taken by the government of Bangladesh, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at the community level in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4309600445,"Potato is a staple food and a main crop of Bangladesh. Climate plays an important role in different crop production all over the world. Potato production is influenced by climate change, which is occurring at a rapid pace according to time and space.The main objective of this research is to observe the variation in potato production based on the discrepancy of the variability in the spatial and temporal domains. The research is based on secondary data on potato production from different parts of Bangladesh and five major climate variables for the last 17 years ending with 2020.Bayesian Spatial-temporal modelling for linear, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and auto-Regressive models were used to find the best-fitted model compared with the independent Error Bayesian model. The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) were used as the model choice criteria and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was implemented to generate information about the prior and posterior realizations.Findings revealed that the ANOVA model under the Spatial-temporal framework was the best model for all model choice and validation criteria. Results depict that there is a significant impact of spatial and temporal variation on potato yield rate. Besides, the windspeed does not show any influence on potato production, however, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and sunshine are important components of potato yield rate in Bangladesh.It is evident that there is a potential impact of climate change on potato production in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authors believed that the findings will be helpful to the policymakers or farmers in developing potato varieties that are resilient to climate change to ensure the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger."
https://openalex.org/W4309928140,"Phytophthora species are primary causal agents of raspberry root rot and wilting complex (RRWC), a disease complex that is of major concern to raspberry producers worldwide. Accurate identification of the causal agents is a first step for effective disease management. Advancements in molecular diagnostics can facilitate the detection of multiple pathogen species associated with this disease complex. We developed multiplex targeted-sequencing methods using degenerate primers for heat shock protein 90, elongation factor 1α and β-tubulin genes to identify Phytophthora species causing RRWC. One hundred and twenty-eight isolates recovered during 2018 to 2020 from diverse fields in major raspberry growing areas of British Columbia (BC) were sequenced and identified by comparing with known reference sequences of 142 Phytophthora species, 111 Pythium species, and nine Phytopythium species in the NCBI database. This multiplex targeted-sequencing method was highly specific and identified two species of Phytophthora associated with RRWC. These were P . rubi (85% of isolates) and P . gonapodyides (15% of isolates). Phytophthora rubi was predominantly isolated from the cultivars ‘Chemainus’ (51%), ‘Rudi’ (27%) and ‘Meeker’ (15%), whereas P . gonapodyides was predominately isolated from the moderately resistant cultivar ‘Cascade Bounty’. Pathogenicity studies on intact plants and detached leaves confirmed that P . rubi and P . gonapodyides can cause symptoms of RRWC on raspberry, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P . gonapodyides as a causal agent of RRWC on raspberry in BC. This study provides novel insights into the identification and species composition of Phytophthora associated with RRWC in raspberry production systems."
https://openalex.org/W4309928698,"Medical studies have shown that the condition of human retinal vessels may reveal the physiological structure of the relationship between age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, atherosclerosis, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and other ophthalmic diseases and systemic diseases, and their abnormal changes often serve as a diagnostic basis for the severity of the condition. In this paper, we design and implement a deep learning-based algorithm for automatic segmentation of retinal vessel (CSP_UNet). It mainly adopts a U-shaped structure composed of an encoder and a decoder and utilizes a cross-stage local connectivity mechanism, attention mechanism, and multi-scale fusion, which can obtain better segmentation results with limited data set capacity. The experimental results show that compared with several existing classical algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the highest blood vessel intersection ratio on the dataset composed of four retinal fundus images, reaching 0.6674. Then, based on the CSP_UNet and introducing hard parameter sharing in multi-task learning, we innovatively propose a combined diagnosis algorithm vessel segmentation and diabetic retinopathy for retinal images (MTNet). The experiments show that the diagnostic accuracy of the MTNet algorithm is higher than that of the single task, with 0.4% higher vessel segmentation IoU and 5.2% higher diagnostic accuracy of diabetic retinopathy classification."
https://openalex.org/W4309796349,"Although research shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to declines in mental health, the existing research has not identified the pathways through which this decline happens.The current study identifies the distinct pathways through which COVID-induced stressors (i.e., social distancing, disease risk, and financial stressors) trigger mental distress and examines the causal impact of these stressors on mental distress.We combined evidence of objective pandemic-related stressors collected at the county level (e.g., lack of social contact, infection rates, and unemployment rates) with self-reported survey data from over 11.5 million adult respondents in the United States collected daily for eight months. We used mediation analysis to examine the extent to which the objective stressors influenced mental health by influencing individual respondents' behavior and fears.County-level, day-to-day social distancing predicted significantly greater mental distress, both directly and indirectly through its effects on individual social contacts, worries about getting ill, and concerns about finances. Economic hardships were indirectly linked to increased mental distress by elevating people's concerns about their household's finances. Disease threats were both directly linked to mental distress and indirectly through its effects on individual worries about getting ill. Although one might expect that social distancing from people outside the home would have a greater influence on people who live alone, sub-analyses based on household composition do not support this expectation.This research provides evidence consistent with the thesis that the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the mental well-being of adults in the United States and identifies specific stressors associated with the pandemic that are responsible for increasing mental distress."
https://openalex.org/W4309796943,"Tiny animals in various metazoan phyla inhabit the interstices between sand and/or gravel grains, and adaptive traits in their body plan, such as simplification and size reduction, have attracted research attention. Several possible explanations of how such animals colonized interstitial habitats have been proposed, but their adaptation to this environment has generally been regarded as irreversible. However, the actual evolutionary transitions are not well understood in almost all taxa. In the present study, we show reversible evolutionary shifts from interstitial to epibenthic habitats in the lineage of the polyclad flatworm genus Boninia . In addition, we establish two new species of this genus found from different microhabitats on a single beach in Okinawa Island, Japan: ( i ) the interstitial species Boninia uru sp. nov. from gravelly sediments and ( ii ) the epibenthic species Boninia yambarensis sp. nov. from rock undersurfaces. Our observations suggest that rigid microhabitat segregation exists between these two species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the partial 18S and 28S rDNA sequences of the new Boninia species and four other congeners, for which molecular sequences were available in public databases [ Boninia antillara (epibenthic), Boninia divae (epibenthic), Boninia neotethydis (interstitial), and an unidentified Boninia sp. (habitat indeterminate)], revealed that the two interstitial species ( B . neotethydis and B . uru sp. nov.) were not monophyletic among the three epibenthic species. According to ancestral state reconstruction analysis, the last common ancestor of the analyzed Boninia species inhabited interstitial realms, and a shift to the epibenthic environment occurred at least once. Such an “interstitial to noninterstitial” evolutionary route seems to be rare among Animalia; to date, it has been reported only in acochlidian slugs in the clade Hedylopsacea. Our phylogenetic tree also showed that the sympatric B . uru sp. nov. and B . yambarensis sp. nov. were not in a sister relationship, indicating that they colonized the same beach independently rather than descended in situ from a common ancestor that migrated and settled at the beach."
https://openalex.org/W4309865880,"Regeneration after severe peripheral nerve injury is often poor. Knowledge of human nerve regeneration and the growth microenvironment is greatly lacking. We aimed to identify the regenerative proteins in human peripheral nerve by comparing the proteome before and after a transection injury. In a unique study design, we collected closely matched samples of naïve and injured sural nerve. Naïve and injured (two weeks after injury) samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry and immunoassays. We found significantly altered levels following the nerve injury. Mass spectrometry revealed that injury samples had 568 proteins significantly upregulated and 471 significantly downregulated compared to naïve samples (q-value ≤ 0.05 and Z ≥ |2| (log2)). We used Gene Ontology (GO) pathway overrepresentation analysis to highlight groups of proteins that were significantly upregulated or downregulated with injury-induced degeneration and regeneration. Significant protein changes in key pathways were identified including growth factor levels, Schwann cell de-differentiation, myelination downregulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and axonal regeneration pathways. The proteomes of the uninjured nerve compared to the degenerating/regenerating nerve may reveal biomarkers to aid in the development of repair strategies such as infusing supplemental trophic factors and in monitoring neural tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4309722167,"Maternal obesity (MO) during pregnancy is linked to increased and premature risk of age-related metabolic diseases in the offspring. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain not fully understood. Using a well-established nonhuman primate model of MO, we analyzed tissue biopsies and plasma samples obtained from post-pubertal offspring (3-6.5 y) of MO mothers (n = 19) and from control animals born to mothers fed a standard diet (CON, n = 13). All offspring ate a healthy chow diet after weaning. Using untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis, we quantified a total of 351 liver, 316 skeletal muscle, and 423 plasma metabolites. We identified 58 metabolites significantly altered in the liver and 46 in the skeletal muscle of MO offspring, with 8 metabolites shared between both tissues. Several metabolites were changed in opposite directions in males and females in both liver and skeletal muscle. Several tissue-specific and 4 shared metabolic pathways were identified from these dysregulated metabolites. Interestingly, none of the tissue-specific metabolic changes were reflected in plasma. Overall, our study describes characteristic metabolic perturbations in the liver and skeletal muscle in MO offspring, indicating that metabolic programming in utero persists postnatally, and revealing potential novel mechanisms that may contribute to age-related metabolic diseases later in life."
https://openalex.org/W4309796331,"Fatal and non-fatal drowning is a significant public health issue, which disproportionately impacts children and young people. In Australia, the highest fatal and non-fatal drowning rates occur in children under five years of age. To date, little qualitative research has been conducted on non-fatal drowning, with causal factor analysis generally conducted using coronial and hospital data. This study's aim was to identify causal factors in hospital treated cases of non-fatal drowning in children as qualitatively self-reported by parents and caregivers. Cases of unintentional child (0-16 years) non-fatal drowning admissions and Emergency Department presentations to three tertiary care paediatric hospitals in New South Wales, Australia were identified via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding. Parents and caregivers of drowning patients were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Data were thematically coded using an inductive approach, with a focus on causal factors and recommendations for preventive approaches. Of 169 incidents, 86 parents/caregivers were interviewed. Children hospitalised for drowning were more often male (59.3%), aged 0-4 years (79.1%) and 30.2% were from household who spoke a language other than English. Qualitative incident descriptions were coded to five themes: lapse of supervision, unintended access (commonly in home swimming pools), brief immersion (usually young children bathing), falls into water and ongoing impacts. Drowning prevention recommendations were grouped under supervision, pool barriers and maintenance, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and emergency response, drowning is quick and silent, and learning swimming. Parents and caregivers of young children require ongoing education regarding supervision distractions and pool barrier compliance. Additional challenges are faced by those in rental properties with pools, parents/caregivers who cannot swim, and parents/caregivers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Affordable, accessible, and culturally appropriate swimming lessons, water safety education and CPR training should be made more available for adult caregivers, particularly in languages other than English."
https://openalex.org/W4309796544,"The ‘Roman emperor’ Sponsian is known only from an assemblage of coins allegedly found in Transylvania (Romania) in 1713. They are very unlike regular Roman coins in style and manufacture, with various enigmatic features including bungled legends and historically mixed motifs, and have long been dismissed as poorly made forgeries. Here we present non-destructive imaging and spectroscopic results that show features indicative of authenticity. Deep micro-abrasion patterns suggest extensive circulation-wear. Superficial patches of soil minerals bound by authigenic cement and overlain by oxidation products indicate a history of prolonged burial then exhumation. These observations force a re-evaluation of Sponsian as a historical personage. Combining evidence from the coins with the historical record, we suggest he was most likely an army commander in the isolated Roman Province of Dacia during the military crisis of the 260s CE, and that his crudely manufactured coins supported a functioning monetary economy that persisted locally for an appreciable period."
https://openalex.org/W4309796710,"Based on the morphological comparisons and molecular results, three new species of Homatula , i.e., H . geminusclathratus sp. nov., H . microcephala sp. nov., and H . longibarbatus sp. nov., have been described and named from the Lancang-jiang (the upper Mekong River) and the Chuan-he (the upper Black River, a tributary of the Red River) basins. The loaches of Homatula from the Lancang-jiang and the Chuan-he can be distinguished via morphology, genetics, and geographic distribution. All of the 10 recorded species distributed in the Nu-jiang (the upper Salween River), the Lancang-jiang, and the upper Black River share the following combination of character states: whole body, except head, densely scaled; lateral line complete; and a short adipose crest along the dorsal midline of the caudal peduncle, anteriorly not reaching vertically through the anal-fin origin. Species with these characters are called the densely-scaled group of Homatula . The three newly described species belong to the densely-scaled group of Homatula . Based on molecular phylogenetics, these Homatula species form a monophyletic group that can be divided into two clades, the densely-scaled group and the non-densely-scaled group. The densely-scaled group of Homatula includes 13 species occurring between the Nu-jiang and the upper Black River. The non-densely-scaled group is non-monophyletic and includes 14 species that are distributed in the Red, Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow River basins. Species of the non-densely-scaled group are clustered into four sub-clades that are constrained to the four river basins. Homatula exclusively inhabits mountain streams with rapid or gentle currents, vauclusian springs, underground rivers connected to streams, and ditches near villages and farmland. No specimens of Homatula were collected from the main streams of Lixian-jiang, Lancang-jiang, and Nu-jiang as well as their large tributaries. Small environmental changes in the habitat of Homatula , such as water pollution or extensive human use, can lead to species/population extinction. Effective conservation of rare and endemic fishes, like loaches of Homatula , entails systematic observations and more targeted protection."
https://openalex.org/W4309796944,"This study characterized associations between annually scaled thermal indices and annual heat stress illness (HSI) morbidity outcomes, including heat stroke and heat exhaustion, among active-duty soldiers at ten Continental U.S. (CONUS) Army installations from 1991 to 2018. We fit negative binomial models for 3 types of HSI morbidity outcomes and annual indices for temperature, heat index, and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), adjusting for installation-level effects and long-term trends in the negative binomial regression models using block-bootstrap resampling. Ambulatory (out-patient) and reportable event HSI outcomes displayed predominately positive association patterns with the assessed annual indices of heat, whereas hospitalization associations were mostly null. For example, a one-degree Fahrenheit (°F) (or 0.55°C) increase in mean temperature between May and September was associated with a 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.29) times greater rate of ambulatory encounters. The annual-scaled rate ratios and their uncertainties may be applied to climate projections for a wide range of thermal indices to estimate future military and civilian HSI burdens and impacts to medical resources."
https://openalex.org/W4309818518,"Cataract, a disease that causes opacity of the lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Cataracts secondary to diabetes are common, even in young patients, so they are of significant clinical importance. Here, we used an ex vivo model of galactose-induced cataracts in the rat lens to investigate the therapeutic effects of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors. Among the tested HAT inhibitors, TH1834 was the only one that could reverse most of the opacity once it had formed in the lens. Combination treatment with C646/CPTH2 and CBP30/CPTH2 also had therapeutic effects. In lens cross-sections, vacuoles were present in the tissue of the cortical equatorial region of untreated cataract samples. In treated cataract samples, lens tissue regenerated to fill the vacuoles. To identify the genes regulated by HAT inhibitors, qRT-PCR was performed on treated and untreated cataract samples to determine candidate genes. Expression of Acta1 and Stmn4, both of which are involved in the cytoskeleton, were altered significantly in C646+CPTH2 samples. Expression of Emd, a nuclear membrane protein, and Prtfdc1, which is involved in cancer cell proliferation, were altered significantly in CBP30+CPTH2 samples. Acta1, Acta2, Arrdc3, Hebp2, Hist2h2ab, Pmf1, Ppdpf, Rbm3, RGD1561694, Slc16a6, Slfn13, Tagln, Tgfb1i1, and Tuba1c in TH1834 samples were significantly altered. These genes were primarily related to regulation of cell proliferation, the cytoskeleton, and cell differentiation. Expression levels increased with the onset of cataracts and was suppressed in samples treated with HAT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4309822047,"Since the prohibition of antibiotics as animal growth promoters, demand for effective probiotic strains has steadily increased. The goal is to maintain productivity and mitigate environmental concerns in the livestock industry. There are many probiotic animal-diet supplements available, over 2,000 products in the Republic of Korea alone, with little explanation about the desirable properties of each probiotic strain. The purpose of this study was to describe the underlying logic and methods used to select two novel strains of probiotic candidates. To economically screen these candidates, the abundance of surfactin secreted was used as an in vitro marker. We used a modified oil-misting method to screen ~2,000 spore-forming bacteria for novel strains of Bacillus subtilis . Of these, 18 strains were initially selected based on the semiquantitative criterion that they secreted more surfactin than B . subtilis ATCC21322 on Luria-Berani (LB) agar plates. The whole genome sequence was determined for two of the 18 strains to verify their identity. A phylogeny of 1,162 orthologous genes, genome contents, and genome organization confirmed them as novel strains. The surfactin profiles produced by these two strains consisted of at least four isoforms similar to standard surfactin and enhanced cellulase activities up to 50%. Four fractionated individual isoforms of surfactin suppressed inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was about 20 μM for each isoform. Both selected strains were susceptible to seven important antibiotics. Our results implied that an abundant secretion of surfactin was a useful biomarker in vitro and could be utilized for mining probiotic candidates through high-throughput screening of environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W4309835392,"In this paper, we project Skills in Literacy Adjusted Mean Years of Schooling (SLAMYS) for the working age population in 45 countries and quinquennial time periods until 2050 according to various population scenarios. Moreover, we integrate the effect of school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic on these projections. Adult skills are projected using the cohort components method. They can help in assessing the potential consequences of the recent trends for the adult population, particularly the workforce, whose skills are essential for the jobs contributing to economic growth and development outlooks. Our projections are novel as they take into account both the amount of schooling and quality of education and also consider the changes in adult skills through lifetime. Projections show that the adult skills gap between countries in the Global North and countries in the Global South will likely continue to exist by 2050, even under very optimistic assumptions-but may widen or narrow depending on the demographic development trajectories specific to each country. Moreover, the loss of learning due to school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbates inequalities between countries. Particularly, in countries where schools have been closed for a prolonged period of time and the infrastructure for effective online schooling is lacking, the skills of cohorts who were in school during the pandemic have been severely affected. The fact that the duration of school closures has been longer in many low- and middle-income countries is a serious concern for achieving global human capital equality. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to erase decades-long gains in adult skills for affected cohorts unless policies to mitigate learning loss are implemented immediately."

We hypothesized that there is no association between NIH funding and the University Disability Inclusion Score.A novel tool, the University Disability Inclusion Score assessed disability inclusion and accessibility using 10 indicators spanning 4 categories: (1) accessibility of built and virtual environment, (2) public image of disability inclusion, (3) accommodations processes and procedures, and (4) grievance policy. Based upon the total points (out of a total score of 100), each university was assigned a letter grade (A-F).Of the top 50 NIH-funded institutions, 6% received an A grade on the Score, while 60% received D or F. The mean scores were 15.2 (SD = 5) for accessibility of built and virtual environment (20 points), 10 (SD = 3) for public image of disability inclusion (20 points), 30.6 (SD = 10) for accommodations processes and procedures (50 points), and 8.1 (SD = 3) for grievance policy (10 points).Our findings suggest room for improvement in disability inclusion and accessibility among top university recipients of NIH funding. To provide an equitable academic experience, universities must prioritize disability inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W4309865767,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common urological problem in children and its hereditary nature is well recognised. However, despite decades of research, the aetiological factors are poorly understood and the genetic background has been elucidated in only a minority of cases. To explore the molecular aetiology of primary hereditary VUR, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 13 large families with at least three affected cases. A large proportion of our study cohort had congenital renal hypodysplasia in addition to VUR. This high-throughput screening revealed 23 deleterious heterozygous variants in 19 candidate genes associated with VUR or nephrogenesis. Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis in the entire families confirmed the following findings in three genes in three families: frameshift LAMC1 variant and missense variants of KIF26B and LIFR genes. Rare variants were also found in SALL1 , ROBO2 and UPK3A . These gene variants were present in individual cases but did not segregate with disease in families. In all, we demonstrate a likely causal gene variant in 23% of the families. Whole-exome sequencing technology in combination with a segregation study of the whole family is a useful tool when it comes to understanding pathogenesis and improving molecular diagnostics of this highly heterogeneous malformation."

In this paper, we trained multi-organ deep learning models to classify adenocarcinoma in biopsy and radical lymph node dissection specimens whole slide images (WSIs). We evaluated the models on five independent test sets (stomach, colon, lung, breast, lymph nodes) to demonstrate the feasibility in multi-organ and lymph nodes specimens from different medical institutions, achieving receiver operating characteristic areas under the curves (ROC-AUCs) in the range of 0.91 -0.98."
https://openalex.org/W4309867324,"A major challenge in extracting high-quality DNA from bryophytes is the treatment of bryophyte material in the field. The existing and commonly used treatment methods in the field have several shortcomings. Natural drying methods can lead to DNA breaks. In addition, it is highly cumbersome to carry large quantities of silica gel in the field due to its weight and high risk of contamination among samples. In this study, we explored more convenient drying methods to treat bryophyte specimens and promote more efficient DNA recovery. The quantity and quality of genomic DNA extracted from every bryophyte species using different drying methods, including hot-air drying methods (150°C, 80°C, and 40°C), natural drying method, and silica gel drying method, were measured. Spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and PCR amplification were performed to assess the effects of different drying methods. The results of total DNA purity, total DNA concentration, PCR success, and OD 260/230 ratios suggested that the hot-air drying (40–80°C) was the best method. The morphological comparison revealed that hot-air drying at 40°C and 80°C exerted no significant adverse effects on plant morphology and taxonomic studies. Thus, this method prevents rapid DNA degradation and silica gel pollution and saves the workforce from carrying large amounts of silica gel to the field. Several inexpensive devices, such as portable hairdryers, fan heaters, and electric blankets, are available that can be easily carried to the field for drying molecular specimens."
https://openalex.org/W4309914454,"Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in children on the autism spectrum. However, no studies have elucidated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in autistic adults. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore the preliminary clinical utility of a group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program designed to address emotion regulation skills in autistic adults. We conducted a clinical trial based on a previously reported protocol; 31 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 29 to the waitlist control group. The intervention group underwent an 8-week program of cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions. Two participants from the intervention group withdrew from the study, leaving 29 participants (93.5%) in the group. Compared with the waitlist group, the cognitive-behavioral therapy group exhibited significantly greater pre-to-post (Week 0-8) intervention score improvements on the attitude scale of the autism spectrum disorder knowledge and attitude quiz (t = 2.21, p = 0.03, d = 0.59) and the difficulty describing feelings scale of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (t = -2.07, p = 0.04, d = -0.57) in addition to pre-to-follow-up (Week 0-16) score improvements on the emotion-oriented scale of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (t = -2.14, p = 0.04, d = -0.59). Our study thus provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program on emotion regulation in autistic adults, thereby supporting further evaluation of the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral therapy program in the context of a larger randomized clinical trial. However, the modest and inconsistent effects underscore the importance of continued efforts to improve the cognitive-behavioral therapy program beyond current standards."
https://openalex.org/W4309914713,"The main aim of the study was to determine the impact of diagnostic activity and life expectancy on the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. We used a state transition simulation model based on Swedish population-based data to simulate life trajectories for 2,000,000 men from age 40 to 100 in order to estimate the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Risk estimates were determined by the level of diagnostic activity and estimated life expectancy. Higher exposure to diagnostic activity resulted in more prostate cancer diagnoses. This was especially true for men diagnosed with low or intermediate grade disease. Men exposed to high diagnostic compared to low diagnostic activity had a five-fold increased lifetime risk (22% vs. 5%) of being diagnosed with a low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer and half the risk of being diagnosed with a high-risk prostate cancer (6% vs. 13%). Men with a long life expectancy had a higher lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis both overall (21% vs. 15%) and in all risk categories when compared to men with a short life expectancy. The lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis is strongly influenced by diagnostic activity and to a lesser degree by life expectancy."

https://openalex.org/W4309796670,"Geomorphic differences among Caribbean reefs have long been noted. These differences are considered to reflect the presence of reefs in different stages of development, following an incomplete recovery from rapid deglacial sea-level rise. But the possibility that these reflect real developmental differences caused by variation in wind, wave, and climate regime, has never been fully considered. Here, for the first time, we quantify the geomorphology and distribution of Greater Caribbean reefs using satellite images in Google Earth and public-domain bathymetry. To do this, we first standardise their classification based on shallow geomorphology, substrate depth, and physiographic setting, and then count and categorise the total number of reefs. These data show a total of 1023 linear breakwater reefs with a combined length of 2237 km. Of this total length, 80% are fringing reefs, 16% are barriers and 4% are faros and atolls. In terms of categories, there are 16 reef subtypes present, but only 9 are common. Their distribution, however, is not uniform. In particular, flat-subtypes form 60% of breakwater reefs in southern regions, but are less common in northern regions where crest-subtypes dominate (80%). To distinguish the geomorphology of these common reef subtypes, we collect size- and length-related morphometric data from their main reef zones. These data reveal that flat and crest subtypes also have morphometric differences: flat subtypes have well-constrained morphologies with statistically consistent unimodal morphometrics characterised by large back-reef zones, smaller and steeper reef fronts, and more sinuous and persistent crestlines. Crest subtypes, by contrast, have multimodal morphometrics suggesting less consistent morphologies (or unresolved subtypes), and are characterised by crestlines with lower sinuosity, more variable back-reef and reef-front areas, and slopes. These differences in geomorphology and distribution imply that flat- and crest-subtypes are neither successional stages of a single reef type, nor a genetically related sequence of types, but distinct reefal geoforms with different modes of development. In subsequent work we will explore what controls these differences."
https://openalex.org/W4309796923,"The here presented investigation was part of a cross-sectional study on dairy cattle health aiming to identify risk factors for animal health and welfare. Within this setting, we chose a social-science related approach to explore German dairy farmers' personality composition in a variable-centered and person-centered approach. We have assessed German dairy farmers' personalities based on the HEXACO model of personality in three representative regional samples. In total, 765 farm visits were conducted within two and half years (north n = 253; east n = 252; south n = 260). The proportions of returned questionnaires eligible for analysis (i.e., answered completely) were 71.54% (n = 181), 68.25% (n = 172) and 86.92% (n = 226) for the northern, eastern and southern samples, respectively. Variable-centered personality analyses revealed the farmers' structure of personality to be similar within all samples. Overall, we found the farmers to be averagely emotional and agreeable, whereas the results indicate tendencies for a pronounced display of extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Compared to the German general population, dairy farmers appear to be more extraverted and open to experience. We could not deduce a subcategorization of farmers in different latent personality profiles in person-centered analysis. Our findings provide a basis for further evaluation of the farmers´ personality as an influencing factor for farm outcomes (e.g., productivity, animal health and welfare). Furthermore, we provide a glance and encourage interdisciplinary research to link personality information with communication theory aiming to enhance effectiveness of veterinary consultancy."
https://openalex.org/W4309796935,"This study examines how unique audience segments within the Canadian population think and act toward climate change, and explores whether and how the level of audience engagement moderates the effect of various messages on support for climate policy. Drawing on a random probability sample of Canadian residents (N = 1207) conducted in October 2017, we first identify and describe five distinct audiences that vary in their attitudes, perceptions and behaviours with respect to climate change: the Alarmed (25%), Concerned (45%), Disengaged (5%), Doubtful (17%) and Dismissive (8%). We then explore how each segment responds to different messages about carbon pricing in Canada. We find that messages alluding to earmarking (i.e., “Invest in solutions”) or leveling the playing field for alternative energy sources (i.e., “Relative price”) increase support for a higher carbon price among the population as a whole. However, these messages decreased support for carbon pricing among more engaged audiences (e.g., Alarmed) when a low carbon price was specified to the respondent. Meanwhile, the “Relative price” is the only message that increased policy support among less engaged audiences–the Concerned and the Doubtful. In addition to highlighting the importance of tailoring and targeting messages for differently engaged segments, these results suggest that communicating around the specific consequences of carbon taxes for the prices of some goods may be a fruitful way to enhance support for carbon taxes among relatively less engaged audiences."

https://openalex.org/W4309822494,"Green infrastructure plays a vital role in urban ecosystems. This includes sustaining biodiversity and human health. Despite a large number of studies investigating greenspace disparities in suburban areas, no known studies have compared the green attributes (e.g., trees, greenness, and greenspaces) of urban centres. Consequently, there may be uncharacterised socioecological disparities between the cores of urban areas (e.g., city centres). This is important because people spend considerable time in urban centres due to employment, retail and leisure opportunities. Therefore, the availability of--and disparities in--green infrastructure in urban centres can affect many lives and potentially underscore a socio-ecological justice issue. To facilitate comparisons between urban centres in Great Britain, we analysed open data of urban centre boundaries with a central business district and population of ≥100,000 (n = 68). Given the various elements that contribute to 'greenness', we combine a range of different measurements (trees, greenness, and accessible greenspaces) into a single indicator. We applied the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate the mean greenness of urban centres and the wider urban area (using a 1 km buffer) and determined the proportion of publicly accessible greenspace within each urban centre with Ordnance Survey Open Greenspace data. Finally, we applied a land cover classification algorithm using i-Tree Canopy to estimate tree coverage. This is the first study to define and rank urban centres based on multiple green attributes. The results suggest important differences in the proportion of green attributes between urban centres. For instance, Exeter scored the highest with a mean NDVI of 0.15, a tree coverage of 11.67%, and an OS Greenspace coverage of 0.05%, and Glasgow the lowest with a mean NDVI of 0.02, a tree cover of 1.95% and an OS Greenspace coverage of 0.00%. We also demonstrated that population size negatively associated with greenness and tree coverage, but not greenspaces, and that green attributes negatively associated with deprivation. This is important because it suggests that health-promoting and biodiversity-supporting resources diminish as population and deprivation increase. Disparities in green infrastructure across the country, along with the population and deprivation-associated trends, are important in terms of socioecological and equity justice. This study provides a baseline and stimulus to help local authorities and urban planners create and monitor equitable greening interventions in urban/city centres."
https://openalex.org/W4309835397,"From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers advised policy makers to make informed decisions towards the adoption of mitigating interventions. Key easy-to-interpret metrics applied over time can measure the public health impact of epidemic outbreaks. We propose a novel method which quantifies the effect of hospitalizations or mortality when the number of COVID-19 cases doubles. Two analyses are used, a country-by-country analysis and a multi-country approach which considers all countries simultaneously. The new measure is applied to several European countries, where the presence of different variants, vaccination rates and intervention measures taken over time leads to a different risk. Based on our results, the vaccination campaign has a clear effect for all countries analyzed, reducing the risk over time. However, the constant emergence of new variants combined with distinct intervention measures impacts differently the risk per country."

Interviewers collected information from caregivers or guardians on child’s demographics, HIV testing, and treatment history. Blood specimens were collected for HIV serology and if HIV-positive, the samples were tested for viral load and antiretrovirals (ARV). For participants &lt;18 months TNA PCR is performed. We computed weighted proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), accounting for the complex survey design. We used bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess factors associated with HIV prevalence. Separate survey weights were developed for interview responses and for biomarker testing to account for the survey design and non-response. HIV burden was estimated by multiplying HIV prevalence by the national population projection by age for 2018. Of 9072 survey participants (&lt; 15 years), 87% (7865) had blood drawn with valid HIV test results. KENPHIA identified 57 HIV-positive children, translating to an HIV prevalence of 0.7%, (95% CI: 0.4%–1.0%) and an estimated 138,900 (95% CI: 84,000–193,800) of HIV among children in Kenya. Specifically, children who were orphaned had about 2 times higher odds of HIV-infection compared to those not orphaned, adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.2 (95% CI:1.0–4.8). Additionally, children whose caregivers had no knowledge of their HIV status also had 2 times higher odds of HIV-infection compared to whose caregivers had knowledge of their HIV status, aOR 2.4 (95% CI: 1.1–5.4)”. From the unconditional analysis; population level estimates, 78.9% of HIV-positive children had known HIV status (95% CI: 67.1%–90.2%), 73.6% (95% CI: 60.9%–86.2%) were receiving ART, and 49% (95% CI: 32.1%–66.7%) were virally suppressed. However, in the clinical cascade for HIV infected children, 92% (95% CI: 84.4%–100%) were receiving ART, and of these, 67.1% (95% CI: 45.1%–89.2%) were virally suppressed.

To investigate the immunoprognostic genes of ccRCC, we analyzed the data assimilated from a public database (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database) using bioinformatics. Then, an immunoprognosis model was constructed to identify four hub genes with moderate predictive values for the prognosis of ccRCC patients. These four genes were associated with the prognosis of ccRCC patients based on Oncomine and Gena Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. The correlation analysis between the immune infiltrate, immune checkpoints, and immunotherapy and this immunoprognosis model showed that immune infiltration could predict the immunotherapy effects. We also conducted a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and found that the expressions of three hub genes were associated with tumor progression (P<0.1). In conclusion, four genes that may serve as potential biomarkers in ccRCC were identified with respect to prognosis."

In Ethiopia, updated information is still needed at every healthcare level and in different risk groups to monitor the national program’s performance, which aims to attain the 2035 goal. Hence, this study aimed to generate additional evidence data on the magnitude of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the Gene Xpert assay among TB-suspected patients at Mizan-Tepi university teaching hospital, southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from June to September 30, 2021. The required socio-demographic and other risk factor data were collected from a total of 422 suspected TB patients using a structured questionnaire. Approximately 392 pulmonary and 30 extra-pulmonary samples were collected and examined using the Gene Xpert-MTB/RIF assay. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25 software was used to analyze the data. Results In this study, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in 12.5% (49/392) of pulmonary samples and 13.3% (4/30) of extra-pulmonary samples, giving an overall TB positivity of 12.6% (53/422). Rifampicin-resistant M . tuberculosis was detected in 3/53 (5.7%). Male sex (AOR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.210, 5.354), previous contact (AOR: 4.25; 95% CI: 1.790, 10.092), smoking cigarette (AOR: 4.708; 95% CI: 1.004, 22.081), being HIV-positive (AOR: 4.27; 95% CI: 1.606, 11.344), and malnutrition (AOR: 3.55; 95% CI: 1.175, 10.747) were all significantly associated with M . tuberculosis detection using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Conclusion The overall frequency of M . tuberculosis in this study was still significant in different risk groups, despite the proposed strategies, which aimed to reduce TB prevalence to as low as 10 per 100,000 populations by 2035. Early case detection with better diagnostic tools and public health measures are important prevention and control strategies to meet the proposed target and reduce the burden of TB in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4309865727,"False information detection can detect false information in social media and reduce its negative impact on society. With the development of multimedia, the multimodal content contained in false information is increasing, so it is important to use multimodal features to detect false information. This paper mainly uses information from two modalities, text and image. The features extracted by the backbone network are not further processed in the previous work, and the problems of noise and information loss in the process of fusing multimodal features are ignored. This paper proposes a false information detection method based on Text-CNN and SE modules. We use Text-CNN to process the text and image features extracted by BERT and Swin-transformer to enhance the quality of the features. In addition, we use the modified SE module to fuse text and image features and reduce the noise in the fusion process. Meanwhile, we draw on the idea of residual networks to reduce information loss in the fusion process by concatenating the original features with the fused features. Our model improves accuracy by 6.5% and 2.0% on the Weibo dataset and Twitter dataset compared to the attention based multimodal factorized bilinear pooling. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the accuracy of false information detection. The results of ablation experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in our model."

The aim of this study was to identify complications such as peritonitis and clinically relevant peritonitis (CRP) after transabdominal cecal trocarization in healthy horses using a cattle trocar and a cecal needle. Mixed breed horses were assigned to three groups (n = 6): horses that underwent trocarization with a cecal needle (G1) or a cattle trocar (G2), and a control group (CG) without cecal trocarization. The same horses were used in each group, respecting a three-month washout period between studies. A physical examination, serial blood, and peritoneal fluid sampling were performed, prior to cecal trocarization and 2, 6 and 12 hours after the first collection and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after the procedure. Acute-phase proteins in blood and peritoneal fluid were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Horses with a high cell count in the peritoneal fluid (i.e., 10,000 cells/μl) were considered to have peritonitis and CRP if they met at least two of the following clinical criteria: anorexia, lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, ileus, abnormal oral mucous membrane color, abnormal white blood cells count, or high blood fibrinogen concentration (> 5 g/L). All horses recovered from cecal trocarization and abdominocentesis with no major complications. Cecal trocarization caused cytologic evidence of peritonitis in G1 and G2 during the 14 days of evaluation. CRP was not observed, although a decrease in cecal motility was observed in G1 and G2 during the experimental period and three horses, one from G1 and two from G2, showed a single moment of fever. None of the groups showed leukopenia or leukocytosis, although blood neutrophil count decreased at D7 and D14 in G1 and at D14 in G2 (p ≤ 0.05). After cecal trocarization, an increase in the total nucleated cells count, total proteins, globulins, alkaline phosphatase and acute phase proteins were observed in the peritoneal fluid of G1 and G2 during the 14 days of evaluation (p ≤ 0.05), without causing clinically relevant peritonitis. Transcutaneous cecal trocarization promotes peritonitis, which is more intense with a cattle trocar than with a cecal needle. The cecal needle should be considered for cecal trocarization of horses with cecal tympany."
https://openalex.org/W4309865765,"Social science research is key for understanding and for predicting compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, and this research relies on survey data. While much focus is on the survey question stems, less is on the response alternatives presented that both constrain responses and convey information about the assumed expectations of the survey designers. The focus here is on the choice of response alternatives for the types of behavioral frequency questions used in many COVID-19 and other health surveys. We examine issues with two types of response alternatives. The first are vague quantifiers, like “rarely” and “frequently.” Using data from 30 countries from the Imperial COVID data hub, we show that the interpretation of these vague quantifiers (and their translations) depends on the norms in that country. If the mean amount of hand washing in a country is high, it is likely “frequently” corresponds to a higher numeric value for hand washing than if the mean in the country is low. The second type are sets of numeric alternatives and they can also be problematic. Using a US survey, respondents were randomly allocated to receive either response alternatives where most of the scale corresponds to low frequencies or where most of the scale corresponds to high frequencies. Those given the low frequency set provided lower estimates of the health behaviors. The choice of response alternatives for behavioral frequency questions can affect the estimates of health behaviors. How the response alternatives mold the responses should be taken into account for epidemiological modeling. We conclude with some recommendations for response alternatives for behavioral frequency questions in surveys."

Documented consequences include a reduction in perceived negativity and perceived severity of crime or diseases. The global COVID-19 pandemic has offered a unique opportunity to investigate this phenomenon in a real-life public health communication context. The aim of this study is to investigate how foreign language processing influences people's reaction towards freedom-restrictive messages. In our experimental study (N = 605), we presented participants with pandemic mitigation instructions in their native language versus a learned foreign language and assessed their perceived sense of control, cognitive evaluation of the instructions, and the intention to adhere to them. The results indicated that the use of a foreign language influenced people's perceived sense of control in a way that might intuitively be surprising: foreign language enhanced sense of control. This positively influenced the cognitive evaluation of the instructions' effectiveness and the intention to comply with them. The present research demonstrates that foreign language processing influences individuals' responses to specific, real-life instructions. Our results provide important contributions to the literature on foreign language effects and public communication and enable practitioners to more accurately predict recipient responses to global crisis communications."

Moreover, family screening and medical autopsy are not routinely performed due to perceived religious and cultural resistance. However, this has never been systematically examined. We sought to describe the prevalence and characteristics of family history of SUD and the attitude of family members toward medical autopsy and family screening.This was a cross-sectional study utilizing an online survey distributed though social media platforms from August 15 to September 15, 2021. Participants' characteristics, details about SUD cases, and the attitude toward medical autopsy and family screening were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of negative attitude toward medical autopsy.A total of 11374 were included in the final analysis after excluding children. The prevalence of FHx of at least one first degree relative (FDR) with SUD was found to be 9.4% [95% CI (8.9% - 10%)]. Among participants with any FHx of SUD, 1346/3489 (38.6%) had ≥ 2 family members affected. Only 183 participants with a FHx of SUD visited a physician for the purpose of family screening (183/3489, 5.3%). The total number of SUD cases reported was 5474. Of those, 22% were 35-year-old or younger. Only 22% of participants (2458/11374) had a negative attitude towards medical autopsy, and the most common reason was the perceived lack of benefit. Older age (> 35 years), family history of SUD, female gender, and lack of knowledge about the yield of medical autopsy were associated with negative attitude in the adjusted analysis.SUD occurred at young age and affected multiple family members in a significant proportion of families. Despite that, family screening was seldom performed. There is an urgent need to improve the care of SUD by incorporating medical autopsy and developing clinical pathways to screen family members."
https://openalex.org/W4309865836,"Immune composition is commonly heterogeneous and varies among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A comprehensive immune classification may act as important characteristics to predict CRC prognosis. Thus, we aimed to identify novel immune specific subtypes to guide future therapies. Unsupervised clustering was used to classify CRC samples into different immune subtypes based on abundances of immune cell populations, during which TCGA and GSE17536 datasets were used as training and validation sets, respectively. The associations between the immune subtypes and patient prognosis were investigated. Further, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between immune high and low subtypes, followed by functional enrichment analyses of DEGs. The expression levels of 74 immunomodulators (IMs) across immune subtypes were analyzed. As a result, we clustered CRC samples into three distinct immune subtypes (immune high, moderate, and low). Patients with immune-high subtype showed the best prognosis, and patients with immune-low subtype had the worst survival in both TCGA and GSE17536 cohorts. A group of 2735 up-regulated DEGs were identified across immune high and low subtypes. The main DEGs were the members of complement components, chemokines, immunoglobulins, and immunosuppressive genes that are involved in immune modulation-related pathways (e.g., cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) or GO terms (e.g., adaptive immune response and T cell activation). The expression levels of 63 IMs were significantly varied across immune subtypes. In conclusion, this study provides a conceptual framework and molecular characteristics of CRC immune subtypes, which may accurately predict prognosis and offer novel targets for personalized immunotherapy through modifying subtype-specific tumor immune microenvironment."

However, most Siamese-based trackers do not effectively exploit correlations of the spatial and channel-wise information to represent targets. Meanwhile, the cross-correlation is a linear matching method and neglects the structured and part-level information. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking algorithm for feature extraction of target templates and search region images. Based on convolutional neural networks and shuffle attention, the tracking algorithm computes the similarity between the template and a search region through a graph attention matching. The proposed tracking algorithm exploits the correlations between the spatial and channel-wise information to highlight the target region. Moreover, the graph matching can greatly alleviate the influences of appearance variations such as partial occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm achieves excellent tracking results on multiple challenging benchmarks. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed tracking algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance."

It was placed in a cooking pot, and deposited upside down within the boundaries of an Early Copper Age settlement. Similar hoards dating to the end of the 5 th millennium BCE are well-known from Central Europe, however, this hoard represents the only one so far with thoroughly documented finding circumstances. The hoard contained 681 pieces of copper, 264 pieces of stone and a single Spondylus bead, along with 19 pieces of small tubular spiral copper coils, three spiral copper bracelets, and two large, spectacle spiral copper pendants. Until now, information on the provenance of raw materials and how such copper artefacts were manufactured has not been available. The artefacts were studied under optical microscopes to reveal the manufacturing process. Trace elemental composition (HR-ICP-MS) and lead isotope ratios (MC-ICP-MS) were measured to explore the provenance of raw materials. The ornaments were rolled or folded and coiled from thin sheets of copper using fahlore copper probably originating from the Northwestern Carpathians. A complex archaeological approach was employed to reveal the provenance, distribution and the social roles the ornaments could have played in the life of a Copper Age community. Evidence for local metallurgy was lacking in contemporaneous Transdanubian sites, therefore it is likely that the items of the hoard were manufactured closer to the raw material source, prior to being transported to Transdanubia as finished products. The method of deposition implies that such items were associated with special social contexts, represented exceptional values, and the context of deposition was also highly prescribed. The Magyaregres hoard serves as the first firm piece of evidence for the existence of a typologically independent Central European metallurgical circle which exploited the raw material sources located within its distribution."

Understanding drug action on Ca V 1.2 channels may inform potential impact on cardiac function. However, literature shows large degrees of variability between Ca V 1.2 pharmacology generated by different laboratories, casting doubt regarding the utility of these data to predict or interpret clinical outcomes. This study examined experimental factors that may impact Ca V 1.2 pharmacology. Experimental approach Whole cell recordings were made on Ca V 1.2 overexpression cells. Current was evoked using a “step-step-ramp” waveform that elicited a step and a ramp current. Experimental factors examined were: 1) near physiological vs. room temperature for recording, 2) drug inhibition of the step vs. the ramp current, and 3) Ca 2+ vs. Ba 2+ as the charge carrier. Eight drugs were studied. Key results Ca V 1.2 current exhibited prominent rundown, exquisite temperature sensitivity, and required a high degree of series resistance compensation to optimize voltage control. Temperature-dependent effects were examined for verapamil and methadone. Verapamil’s block potency shifted by up to 4X between room to near physiological temperature. Methadone exhibited facilitatory and inhibitory effects at near physiological temperature, and only inhibitory effect at room temperature. Most drugs inhibited the ramp current more potently than the step current—a preference enhanced when Ba 2+ was the charge carrier. The slopes of the concentration-inhibition relationships for many drugs were shallow, temperature-dependent, and differed between the step and the ramp current. Conclusions and implications All experimental factors examined affected Ca V 1.2 pharmacology. In addition, whole cell Ca V 1.2 current characteristics—rundown, temperature sensitivity, and impact of series resistance—are also factors that can impact pharmacology. Drug effects on Ca V 1.2 channels appear more complex than simple pore block mechanism. Normalizing laboratory-specific approaches is key to improve inter-laboratory data reproducibility. Releasing original electrophysiology records is essential to promote transparency and enable the independent evaluation of data quality."
https://openalex.org/W4309928420,"Design concept evaluation is a huge challenge in the R&amp;D stage of new product development. The information in the assessments often depends on the decision-makers’ individual preferences. However, sometimes the decision-makers cannot give precise and complete information because it is very difficult for them to be familiar with all the criteria. In this situation, an incomplete information decision-making matrix is established. In this paper, decision-making methods based on incomplete information are compared in the literature review. Incomplete information determination method using trust mechanism is proved as a proper way to solve this problem, and the missing information are computed based on the alternatives However, in design concept evaluation, experts commonly provide their preferences using linguistic words according to the different attributes. Hence, we propose a three-step Multiple Attributes Group Decision-making (MAGDM) method where the missing value are determined by attributes. In step one, a data repairing method is proposed based on trust theory. After that, in step two, a comprehensive weight determination method combining AHP and entropy is proposed to obtain the weight of index attributes. Finally, the Rough-TOPSIS method is applied in the design scheme ranking step. In the case study, the proposed method is implemented in a tourism product design process to show its effectiveness."
