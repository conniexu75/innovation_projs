https://openalex.org/W4311887664,"Programming is a powerful and ubiquitous problem-solving tool. Developing systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs independently could make programming more productive and accessible, yet so far incorporating innovations in AI has proven challenging. Recent large-scale language models have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate code, and are now able to complete simple programming tasks. However, these models still perform poorly when evaluated on more complex, unseen problems that require problem-solving skills beyond simply translating instructions into code. For example, competitive programming problems which require an understanding of algorithms and complex natural language remain extremely challenging. To address this gap, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that can create novel solutions to these problems that require deeper reasoning. In simulated evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform, AlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3% in competitions with more than 5,000 participants. We found that three key components were critical to achieve good and reliable performance: (1) an extensive and clean competitive programming dataset for training and evaluation, (2) large and efficient-to-sample transformer-based architectures, and (3) large-scale model sampling to explore the search space, followed by filtering based on program behavior to a small set of submissions."
https://openalex.org/W4311883465,"Piezoelectric actuators are indispensable over a wide range of industries for their fast response and precise displacement. Most commercial piezoelectric actuators contain lead, posing environmental challenges. We show that a giant strain (1.05%) and a large-signal piezoelectric strain coefficient (2100 picometer/volt) are achieved in strontium (Sr)-doped (K,Na)NbO3 lead-free piezoceramics, being synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction method without any post treatment. The underlying mechanism responsible for the ultrahigh electrostrain is the interaction between defect dipoles and domain switching. The fatigue resistance, thermal stability, and strain value (0.25%) at 20 kilovolt/centimeter are comparable with or better than those of commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3-based ceramics, showing great potential for practical applications. This material may provide a lead-free alternative with a simple composition for piezoelectric actuators and a paradigm for the design of high-performance piezoelectrics."
https://openalex.org/W4310941140,"Learning to predict rewards based on environmental cues is essential for survival. It is believed that animals learn to predict rewards by updating predictions whenever the outcome deviates from expectations, and that such reward prediction errors (RPEs) are signaled by the mesolimbic dopamine system-a key controller of learning. However, instead of learning prospective predictions from RPEs, animals can infer predictions by learning the retrospective cause of rewards. Hence, whether mesolimbic dopamine instead conveys a causal associative signal that sometimes resembles RPE remains unknown. We developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys causal associations but not RPE, thereby challenging the dominant theory of reward learning. Our results reshape the conceptual and biological framework for associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W4311883472,"Protein concentrations are set by a complex interplay between gene-specific regulatory processes and systemic factors, including cell volume and shared gene expression machineries. Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli across many conditions. The results revealed two design principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation from omics data."
https://openalex.org/W4311501860,"Abstract Wearable devices can capture unexplored movement patterns such as brief bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) that is embedded into everyday life, rather than being done as leisure time exercise. Here, we examined the association of VILPA with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in 25,241 nonexercisers (mean age 61.8 years, 14,178 women/11,063 men) in the UK Biobank. Over an average follow-up of 6.9 years, during which 852 deaths occurred, VILPA was inversely associated with all three of these outcomes in a near-linear fashion. Compared with participants who engaged in no VILPA, participants who engaged in VILPA at the sample median VILPA frequency of 3 length-standardized bouts per day (lasting 1 or 2 min each) showed a 38%–40% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48%–49% reduction in CVD mortality risk. Moreover, the sample median VILPA duration of 4.4 min per day was associated with a 26%–30% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 32%–34% reduction in CVD mortality risk. We obtained similar results when repeating the above analyses for vigorous physical activity (VPA) in 62,344 UK Biobank participants who exercised (1,552 deaths, 35,290 women/27,054 men). These results indicate that small amounts of vigorous nonexercise physical activity are associated with substantially lower mortality. VILPA in nonexercisers appears to elicit similar effects to VPA in exercisers, suggesting that VILPA may be a suitable physical activity target, especially in people not able or willing to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4312019851,"In nature, snowflake ice crystals arrange themselves into diverse symmetrical six-sided structures. We show an analogy of this when zinc (Zn) dissolves and crystallizes in liquid gallium (Ga). The low-melting-temperature Ga is used as a “metallic solvent” to synthesize a range of flake-like Zn crystals. We extract these metallic crystals from the liquid metal solvent by reducing its surface tension using a combination of electrocapillary modulation and vacuum filtration. The liquid metal–grown crystals feature high morphological diversity and persistent symmetry. The concept is expanded to other single and binary metal solutes and Ga-based solvents, with the growth mechanisms elucidated through ab initio simulation of interfacial stability. This strategy offers general routes for creating highly crystalline, shape-controlled metallic or multimetallic fine structures from liquid metal solvents."
https://openalex.org/W4311883460,"The uplift of the Tibet Plateau (TP) during the Miocene is crucial to understanding the evolution of Asian monsoon regimes and alpine biodiversity. However, the northern Tibet Plateau (NTP) remains poorly investigated. We use pollen records of montane conifers (Tsuga, Podocarpus, Abies, and Picea) as a new paleoaltimetry to construct two parallel midrange paleoelevation sequences in the NTP at 1332 ± 189 m and 433 ± 189 m, respectively, during the Middle Miocene [~15 million years ago (Ma)]. Both midranges increased rapidly to 3685 ± 87 m in the Late Miocene (~11 Ma) in the east, and to 3589 ± 62 m at ~7 Ma in the west. Our estimated rises in the east and west parts of the NTP during 15 to 7 Ma, together with data from other TP regions, indicate that during the Late Miocene the entire plateau may have reached a high elevation close to that of today, with consequent impacts on atmospheric precipitation and alpine biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4311887602,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) costimulatory domains derived from native immune receptors steer the phenotypic output of therapeutic T cells. We constructed a library of CARs containing ~2300 synthetic costimulatory domains, built from combinations of 13 signaling motifs. These CARs promoted diverse human T cell fates, which were sensitive to motif combinations and configurations. Neural networks trained to decode the combinatorial grammar of CAR signaling motifs allowed extraction of key design rules. For example, non-native combinations of motifs that bind tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1) enhanced cytotoxicity and stemness associated with effective tumor killing. Thus, libraries built from minimal building blocks of signaling, combined with machine learning, can efficiently guide engineering of receptors with desired phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W4310965676,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy against metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) but only for PD-L1positive disease. The randomized, placebo-controlled ALICE trial ( NCT03164993 , 24 May 2017) evaluated the addition of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) to immune-stimulating chemotherapy in mTNBC. Patients received pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with atezolizumab (atezo-chemo; n = 40) or placebo (placebo-chemo; n = 28). Primary endpoints were descriptive assessment of progression-free survival in the per-protocol population (>3 atezolizumab and >2 PLD doses; n = 59) and safety in the full analysis set (FAS; all patients starting therapy; n = 68). Adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 18% of patients in the atezo-chemo arm (7/40) and in 7% of patients in the placebo-chemo arm (2/28). Improvement in progression-free survival was indicated in the atezo-chemo arm in the per-protocol population (median 4.3 months versus 3.5 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.99; log-rank P = 0.047) and in the FAS (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.95; P = 0.033). A numerical advantage was observed for both the PD-L1positive (n = 27; HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.27-1.54) and PD-L1negative subgroups (n = 31; HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.27-1.21). The progression-free proportion after 15 months was 14.7% (5/34; 95% CI 6.4-30.1%) in the atezo-chemo arm versus 0% in the placebo-chemo arm. The addition of atezolizumab to PLD/cyclophosphamide was tolerable with an indication of clinical benefit, and the findings warrant further investigation of PD1/PD-L1 blockers in combination with immunomodulatory chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4311887675,"The widespread use of antibiotics has placed bacterial pathogens under intense pressure to evolve new survival mechanisms. Genomic analysis of 51,229 Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) clinical isolates has identified an essential transcriptional regulator, Rv1830 , herein called resR for resilience regulator, as a frequent target of positive (adaptive) selection. resR mutants do not show canonical drug resistance or drug tolerance but instead shorten the post-antibiotic effect, meaning that they enable Mtb to resume growth after drug exposure substantially faster than wild-type strains. We refer to this phenotype as antibiotic resilience. ResR acts in a regulatory cascade with other transcription factors controlling cell growth and division, which are also under positive selection in clinical isolates of Mtb . Mutations of these genes are associated with treatment failure and the acquisition of canonical drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4310945735,"Abstract Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are debilitating, clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. A transcriptome-wide investigation was performed in 165 acutely infected hospitalized individuals who were followed clinically into the post-acute period. Distinct gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during acute infection, with innate and adaptive immune cells implicated in different symptoms. Two clusters of sequelae exhibited divergent plasma-cell-associated gene expression patterns. In one cluster, sequelae associated with higher expression of immunoglobulin-related genes in an anti-spike antibody titer-dependent manner. In the other, sequelae associated independently of these titers with lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes, indicating lower non-specific antibody production in individuals with these sequelae. This relationship between lower total immunoglobulins and sequelae was validated in an external cohort. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were already detectable during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking these sequelae with the acute host response to the virus and providing early insights into their development."
https://openalex.org/W4311887677,"North America has experienced a massive increase in cropland use since 1800, accompanied more recently by the intensification of agricultural practices. Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across the native range of the common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), a now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the success of this weed in the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W4310938206,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, sizeable groups of unvaccinated people persist even in countries with high vaccine access1. As a consequence, vaccination became a controversial subject of debate and even protest2. Here we assess whether people express discriminatory attitudes in the form of negative affectivity, stereotypes and exclusionary attitudes in family and political settings across groups defined by COVID-19 vaccination status. We quantify discriminatory attitudes between vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens in 21 countries, covering a diverse set of cultures across the world. Across three conjoined experimental studies (n = 15,233), we demonstrate that vaccinated people express discriminatory attitudes towards unvaccinated individuals at a level as high as discriminatory attitudes that are commonly aimed at immigrant and minority populations3—5. By contrast, there is an absence of evidence that unvaccinated individuals display discriminatory attitudes towards vaccinated people, except for the presence of negative affectivity in Germany and the USA. We find evidence in support of discriminatory attitudes against unvaccinated individuals in all countries except for Hungary and Romania, and find that discriminatory attitudes are more strongly expressed in cultures with stronger cooperative norms. Previous research on the psychology of cooperation has shown that individuals react negatively against perceived ‘free-riders’6,7, including in the domain of vaccinations8,9. Consistent with this, we find that contributors to the public good of epidemic control (that is, vaccinated individuals) react with discriminatory attitudes towards perceived free-riders (that is, unvaccinated individuals). National leaders and vaccinated members of the public appealed to moral obligations to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake10,11, but our findings suggest that discriminatory attitudes—including support for the removal of fundamental rights—simultaneously emerged. Vaccinated people express discriminatory attitudes towards unvaccinated individuals across cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4310946293,"Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) synthesize proteins encoded within the mitochondrial genome that are assembled into oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Thus, mitoribosome biogenesis is essential for ATP production and cellular metabolism1. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine nine structures of native yeast and human mitoribosomal small subunit assembly intermediates, illuminating the mechanistic basis for how GTPases are used to control early steps of decoding centre formation, how initial rRNA folding and processing events are mediated, and how mitoribosomal proteins have active roles during assembly. Furthermore, this series of intermediates from two species with divergent mitoribosomal architecture uncovers both conserved principles and species-specific adaptations that govern the maturation of mitoribosomal small subunits in eukaryotes. By revealing the dynamic interplay between assembly factors, mitoribosomal proteins and rRNA that are required to generate functional subunits, our structural analysis provides a vignette for how molecular complexity and diversity can evolve in large ribonucleoprotein assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W4311883476,"The search for cell-permeable drugs has conventionally focused on low-molecular weight (MW), nonpolar, rigid chemical structures. However, emerging therapeutic strategies break traditional drug design rules by employing flexibly linked chemical entities composed of more than one ligand. Using complementary genome-scale chemical-genetic approaches we identified an endogenous chemical uptake pathway involving interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) that modulates the cell permeability of a prototypical biopic inhibitor of MTOR (RapaLink-1, MW: 1784 g/mol). We devised additional linked inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL1 (DasatiLink-1, MW: 1518 g/mol) and EIF4A1 (BisRoc-1, MW: 1466 g/mol), uptake of which was facilitated by IFITMs. We also found that IFITMs moderately assisted some proteolysis-targeting chimeras and examined the physicochemical requirements for involvement of this uptake pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4311887673,"From the preparation of pharmaceuticals to enzymatic construction of natural products, carbocations are central to molecular synthesis. Although these reactive intermediates are engaged in stereoselective processes in nature, exerting enantiocontrol over carbocations with synthetic catalysts remains challenging. Many resonance-stabilized tricoordinated carbocations, such as iminium and oxocarbenium ions, have been applied in catalytic enantioselective reactions. However, their dicoordinated counterparts (aryl and vinyl carbocations) have not, despite their emerging utility in chemical synthesis. We report the discovery of a highly enantioselective vinyl carbocation carbon–hydrogen (C–H) insertion reaction enabled by imidodiphosphorimidate organocatalysts. Active site confinement featured in this catalyst class not only enables effective enantiocontrol but also expands the scope of vinyl cation C–H insertion chemistry, which broadens the utility of this transition metal–free C(sp 3 )–H functionalization platform."

https://openalex.org/W4310963914,"The large diversity of cell types in nervous systems presents a challenge in identifying the genetic mechanisms that encode it. Here, we report that nearly 200 distinct neurons in the Drosophila visual system can each be defined by unique combinations of on average 10 continuously expressed transcription factors. We show that targeted modifications of this terminal selector code induce predictable conversions of neuronal fates that appear morphologically and transcriptionally complete. Cis-regulatory analysis of open chromatin links one of these genes to an upstream patterning factor that specifies neuronal fates in stem cells. Experimentally validated network models describe the synergistic regulation of downstream effectors by terminal selectors and ecdysone signaling during brain wiring. Our results provide a generalizable framework of how specific fates are implemented in postmitotic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W4311664796,"Considering the relevant role played by women in agriculture in Africa, this study sets out to examine how women’s engagement in agriculture contributes to human capital development in selected African countries. The study engagedpanel data of selected 33 African countries spanning the period of 2000 to 2019. The study applied the Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (POLS) and the fixed effects based on the Hausman specification. Findings show that engagement of women in agriculture, though significant, but negatively related to human capital development in Africa. The implication of this is that an increase in women’s engagement in agriculture without the required level of education and training and access to agricultural resources may have a negative impact on human capital development. Therefore, the study recommended that it is necessary to train women in terms of agricultural skills needed to improve human capital development in Africa."

https://openalex.org/W4310861913,"Hexanucleotide expansion mutations in C9ORF72 are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We previously reported that long arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs), mimicking abnormal proteins expressed from the hexanucleotide expansion, caused translation stalling when expressed in cell culture models. Whether this stalling provides a mechanism of pathogenicity remains to be determined. Here, we explored the molecular features of DPR-induced stalling and examined whether known mechanisms such as ribosome quality control (RQC) regulate translation elongation on sequences that encode arginine-rich DPRs. We demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs lead to stalling in a length-dependent manner, with lengths longer than 40 repeats invoking severe translation arrest. Mutational screening of 40×Gly-Xxx DPRs shows that stalling is most pronounced when Xxx is a charged amino acid (Arg, Lys, Glu, or Asp). Through a genome-wide knockout screen, we find that genes regulating stalling on polyadenosine mRNA coding for poly-Lys, a canonical RQC substrate, act differently in the case of arginine-rich DPRs. Indeed, these findings point to a limited scope for natural regulatory responses to resolve the arginine-rich DPR stalls, even though the stalls may be sensed, as evidenced by an upregulation of RQC gene expression. These findings therefore implicate arginine-rich DPR-mediated stalled ribosomes as a source of stress and toxicity and may be a crucial component in pathomechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4311661976,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an ongoing challenge in the Torres Strait Islands (TSI) / Papua New Guinea (PNG) border region. Treatment success rates have historically been poor for patients diagnosed with DR-TB, leading to increased transmission. This study aimed to identify variables associated with unfavourable outcome in patients diagnosed with DR-TB to inform programmatic improvements. A retrospective study of all DR-TB cases who presented to Australian health facilities in the Torres Strait between 1 March 2000 and 31 March 2020 was performed. This time period covers four distinct TB programmatic approaches which reflect Australian and Queensland Government decisions on TB management in this remote region. Univariate and multivariate predictors of unfavourable outcome were analysed. Unfavourable outcome was defined as lost to follow up, treatment failure and death. Successful outcome was defined as cure and treatment completion. In total, 133 patients with resistance to at least one TB drug were identified. The vast majority (123/133; 92%) of DR-TB patients had pulmonary involvement; and of these, 41% (50/123) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Unfavourable outcomes were observed in 29% (39/133) of patients. Patients living with human immunodeficiency virus, renal disease or diabetes (4/133; 4/133; 3/133) had an increased frequency of unfavourable outcome ( p &lt;0.05), but the numbers were small. Among all 133 DR-TB patients, 41% had a low lymphocyte count, which was significantly associated with unfavourable outcome ( p &lt;0.05). We noted a 50% increase in successful outcomes achieved in the 2016–2020 programmatic period, compared to earlier periods (OR 5.3, 95% Confidence Interval [1.3, 20.4]). Being a close contact of a known TB case was associated with improved outcome. While DR-TB treatment outcomes have improved over time, enhanced surveillance for DR-TB, better cross border collaboration and consistent diagnosis and management of comorbidities and other risk factors should further improve patient care and outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W4311572622,"Background Individuals with cystic fibrosis have an elevated lifetime risk of colonization, infection, and disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria. A prior study involving non-cystic fibrosis individuals reported a gene expression signature associated with susceptibility to nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). In this study, we determined whether people living with cystic fibrosis who progress to NTM-PD have a gene expression pattern similar to the one seen in the non-cystic fibrosis population. Methods We evaluated whole blood transcriptomics using bulk RNA-seq in a cohort of cystic fibrosis patients with samples collected closest in timing to the first isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria. The study population included patients who did (n = 12) and did not (n = 30) develop NTM-PD following the first mycobacterial growth. Progression to NTM-PD was defined by a consensus of two expert clinicians based on reviewing clinical, microbiological, and radiological information. Differential gene expression was determined by DESeq2. Results No differences in demographics or composition of white blood cell populations between groups were identified at baseline. Out of 213 genes associated with NTM-PD in the non-CF population, only two were significantly different in our cystic fibrosis NTM-PD cohort. Gene set enrichment analysis of the differential expression results showed that CF individuals who developed NTM-PD had higher expression levels of genes involved in the interferon (α and γ), tumor necrosis factor, and IL6-STAT3-JAK pathways. Conclusion In contrast to the non-cystic fibrosis population, the gene expression signature of patients with cystic fibrosis who develop NTM-PD is characterized by increased innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W4311577072,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification technique that can be used to amplify target genes at a constant temperature, and it has several advantages, including convenience, specificity and sensitivity. However, due to the special interpretation methods of this technology for reaction results, all the previously reported LAMP detection methods have been restricted to identifying a single target, which limits the application of this technology. In this study, we modified conventional LAMP to include a quencher-fluorophore composite probe complementary to the F1c segment of the inner primer FIP; upon strand separation, a gain in the visible fluorescent signal was observed. The probes could be labeled with different fluorophores, showing different colors at the corresponding wavelengths. Therefore, this multiplex LAMP (mLAMP) assay can simultaneously detect 1-3 target sequences in a single LAMP reaction tube, and the results are more accurate and intuitive. In this study, we comprehensively demonstrated a single-reaction mLAMP assay for the robust detection of three cattle viruses without nonspecific amplification of other related pathogenic cattle viruses. The detection limit of this mLAMP assay was as low as 526-2477 copies/reaction for the recombinant plasmids. It is expected that this mLAMP assay can be widely used in clinical diagnosis."

However in daily clinical practice, some cancer patients show insufficient control of OIC even while receiving naldemedine.To identify factors associated with non-response to naldemedine in cancer patients.This study retrospectively analyzed 127 cancer patients prescribed naldemedine at Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital in Japan between November 2016 and June 2021. For the regression analysis of factors associated with OIC, variables were extracted manually from electronic medical records. Naldemedine had been prescribed by the attending physician after the presence of OIC had been defined with reference to Rome IV diagnostic criteria. Naldemedine was evaluated as ""effective"" in cases where the number of defecations increased at least once in the first 3 days after starting naldemedine. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with non-response to naldemedine. The data used were from the group of patients who received naldemedine in our previous study.Factors significantly associated with non-response to naldemedine included chemotherapy with taxanes within 1 month of evaluation of naldemedine effect (odds ratio [OR] = 0.063; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.007-0.568), and addition of or switching to naldemedine due to insufficient efficacy of prior laxatives (OR = 0.352, 95% CI = 0.129-0.966).The identification of factors associated with non-response to naldemedine prescribed for OIC may help improve QOL among cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311668483,"Introduction Football matches show higher hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) than football training. The occurrence of HSIs increases in the last fifteen minutes of both halves of football matches and shows an incremental trend towards the end of the ninety minutes. Objectives This study aimed to examine football-specific fatigue-induced alterations in risk factors of the HSIs, including biceps femoris long head fascicle length via ultrasonography (BFlh FL), single-leg hop distance, hamstrings’ maximal eccentric strength, and single-leg hamstring bridge test (SLHB) performance. Methodology During ninety minutes of the TSAFT 90 football simulation, the BFlh FL and single-leg hop distance were measured three times (before, at half-time and after 90 minutes of simulated match-play), and maximal hamstrings eccentric strength and SLHB test scores were recorded twice (before and after simulated match-play) for both legs in physically active participants (n = 15). Results Maximal eccentric hamstrings’ strength (dominant leg (D): p &lt; 0.001, Hedges’ (adjusted) g effect size = -0.969; non-dominant leg (ND): p &lt; 0.001, g = -0.929) and the SLHB performance (D: p &lt; 0.001, g = -1.249; ND: p &lt; 0.001, g = -1.108) showed large decrements immediately after the TSAFT 90 intervention. There were no significant alterations in the BFlh FL, and the single-leg hop distance. Conclusions Maximal eccentric strength and the SLHB performance of hamstrings are reduced after 90 minutes of simulated football match-play. Practitioners may consider focusing on improving eccentric strength and the SLHB performance. Future studies should examine alterations in the BFlh fascicles’ dynamic lengthening and shortening ability during a football match."

https://openalex.org/W4311670564,"A lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic focus along the River Galana/ Sabaki in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya, provided a platform to conduct an integrated survey for three helminthic neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), namely soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), schistosomiasis (SCH) and LF. Additionally, the study compared the performance of two mosquito trapping methods for LF molecular xenomonitoring (MX). Cross-sectional surveys measuring STH, SCH and LF prevalence were conducted in four villages. Mosquitoes were trapped using the CDC light trap (CDC-LT) and the Ifakara A tent trap (Ifakara-TT) methods and stored in pools which were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti DNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. A total of 907 people (436 adults; 471 children) participated in the parasitological testing. Among the STH infections, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms were most prevalent among the children and adult populations, respectively. The schistosome worm eggs detected belonged to the species Schistosoma haematobium and the prevalence of the infection was generally higher among the children compared with the adult population. The prevalence of LF infection among the adult population ranged from 1.8% to 7.6% across all 4 villages (P < 0.05). A total of 3,652 mosquitoes, including Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia, and Aedes species were collected. One mosquito pool consisting of Anopheles mosquitoes tested positive for filarial DNA out of 1,055 pools that were tested. The CDC-LT caught significantly more mosquitoes compared with the Ifakara-TT (P < 0.001). This study demonstrated that integrated epidemiological surveys using standard parasitological and entomological methods can provide useful information on co-endemic parasitic diseases which could help direct interventions and surveillance activities."

https://openalex.org/W4310813650,"With the passing away of Philippe Ascher, a giant of neuroscience and an unanimously respected guide of the French neuroscience community has disappeared. Philippe Ascher was born in a Jewish family originating in Hungary and in France. Philippe Ascher’s father, a left-leaning medical doctor, took pride in the fact that his first child was born on the year (1936) when the socialist Léon Blum led the Popular Front coalition to electoral victory. But he did not have a blind faith in his country’s future. Shortly before the outburst of war, he relocated his practice and his family from Metz, in northeastern France, to the Lot region in the southwest. This prescient decision certainly contributed to safeguarding the family during the war. Philippe Ascher was tempted by medical studies but eventually opted for scientific research. Trained at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris, he started his scientific career doing electrophysiological recordings in cats. He soon shifted to intracellular recordings in the simpler nervous system of the marine mollusk Aplysia, with the aim of deciphering basic cellular mechanisms underlying complex neuronal functions. Alongside the parallel studies by Eric Kandel, Philippe Ascher’s work in the 1970s and 1980s (together with his wife, JacSue Kehoe) established some of the current notions on the action of neurotransmitters in this system. In 1970, in a rather unexpected consequence of the 1968 upheaval of the French universities, Philippe Ascher was given the opportunity to create a neurobiology laboratory at the ENS. This laboratory functioned as a collective enterprise involving Ascher’s wife, JacSue Kehoe, Hersch (“Coco”) Gerschenfeld, and a few young colleagues. The rigor, originality, and cooperation in this laboratory, combined with Philippe Ascher’s benevolence, humor, and profound lack of interest in frantic speed and competition, created an environment that distinguished it from many other laboratories. This laboratory quickly attracted worldwide recognition, and it served as a cradle for many young neuroscientists from all origins. In the early 1980s at the ENS laboratory, Philippe Ascher shifted back to mammalian synapses. Based on his previous work in Aplysia, he demonstrated that several blockers of acetylcholine-sensitive channels of the autonomous nervous system act by plugging the open channel; furthermore, he showed that when the blocker was electrically charged, the block was influenced by the membrane potential—and the more so if the blocker was doubly charged. These studies had a profound impact on our understanding of the mode of action of pharmacologically important drugs, and they also paved the way to the first great “hit” of Philippe Ascher’s career, the discovery of the block of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) by extracellular Mg2+ ions.1Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurones.Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465https://doi.org/10.1038/307462a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar By showing that NMDARs were specifically sensitive to blockage by Mg2+ ions at negative, but not positive, membrane potential, the work of the Ascher group (together with the parallel work of the Mayer and Westbrook laboratory in the United States) set entirely new standards for studies of mammalian synaptic transmission. Their discovery pinpointed the entrance of the channel associated with the NMDAR as a crucial locus of interaction between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. A hallmark of Hebbian synaptic plasticity is that a synaptic change requires simultaneous activation of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian synaptic plasticity had been proposed in the 1940s, the underlying mechanism had long remained a mystery. The discovery of the block of NMDAR channels by Mg2+ provided an elegant solution to this conundrum. Activation of postsynaptic NMDARs requires not only the activation of the presynaptic neuron, resulting in the release of glutamate, but also the activation of the postsynaptic neuron, resulting in membrane depolarization and relief of Mg2+ block. This mechanism is now recognized as the reason why NMDAR-dependent long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP), the most thoroughly studied form of long-term synaptic plasticity, obeys Hebb’s principle. In following years, Philippe Ascher’s group pursued groundbreaking studies on the NMDA receptor. Importantly, the group pointed out that NMDAR channels are highly permeant for Ca2+ ions. This finding threw light on the role of NMDAR channels in excitotoxicity, and it paved the way to subsequent studies on the key role of the postsynaptic surge in Ca2+ in inducing LTP. But, the second jewel of this period is the discovery of the dual agonist action of glutamate and glycine in NMDARs.2Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Glycine potentiates the NMDA response in cultured mouse brain neurons.Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531https://doi.org/10.1038/325529a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar The finding that glycine is a mandatory co-agonist of NMDARs came as a surprise, since glycine was previously thought to be inhibitory and it was not expected to act at glutamatergic synapses. It opened new avenues in the study of the regulation of NMDARs and their therapeutic potential that are still actively pursued in the present. The Nowak et al. paper and the Johnson and Ascher paper both appear among the three most-referenced neuroscience papers in recent decades.3Yeung A.W.K. Goto T.K. Leung W.K. At the Leading Front of Neuroscience: A Bibliometric Study of the 100 Most-Cited Articles.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2017; 11: 363https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar Philippe Ascher stayed at ENS until he resigned from all administrative duties in 2001. As an emeritus professor, he then moved to the nearby Parisian School of Medicine at Saints Pères. In this new environment, he moved away from biophysical studies of ion channels to return to the study of synaptic function. He dedicated himself to experimental work in collaboration with more junior scientists. Together with ENS colleague Mariano Casado and others, he unveiled the role of presynaptic NMDARs in cerebellar long-term depression (LTD). More recently, in collaboration with Boris Lamotte d'Incamps, he studied the properties of synapses made by axon collaterals of spinal cord motoneurons onto Renshaw cells. These are mixed cholinergic/glutamatergic synapses, thus combining the lifelong interests of Philippe Ascher for cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors. Apart from his personal scientific work, Philippe Ascher exerted an immense influence as a professor and mentor of young scientists as well as a renovator of the French scientific system. During the 1970s and 1980s, JacSue Kehoe and Philippe Ascher spent their summer months teaching a hands-on introductory course of neurobiology at Cold Spring Harbor. This course served as a bootstrap to a number of prominent neuroscientists in the United States. At ENS, Philippe Ascher stubbornly fought, and eventually abolished, an archaic research-teaching system that had reigned unchallenged for many decades. He replaced this antiquated system with a modern biology department open to promising young scientists, and he acted as director of this department for years. He also contributed to renovating and modernizing the teaching at ENS, where he exerted a profound influence on generation after generation of students. He was also the organizer of an association called “Qualité de la Science” that lobbied for many years to improve the conditions of development and funding of scientific research in France. In recent years, he developed two systems of MD-PhD careers for French medical students, where there was nothing of the kind before, and he lobbied successfully to raise the money necessary to run these programs. As an emeritus professor at Saints Pères, he would occasionally interrupt his daily experiments to run crash neuroscience courses for the benefit of elated MD students. Philippe Ascher’s personal style was made of simplicity, generosity, and openness. He was passionate about his research and intensely curious about all aspects of science, but also easygoing and full of joie de vivre. He had an uncanny ability to establish an easy communication with students and young scientists, to listen to their questions, and to provide suggestions that sometimes proved as prescient as his father’s decision to move to the Lot region. His view of scientific research was not favoring large organizations or heavy technical investments, but rather very small teams and small budgets. As indicated by the name of the “Qualité de la Science” association, he valued quality much more than quantity in science. He was also a firm believer in the necessity of direct control of any research that came out of his group. He personally performed experiments up to the week preceding his death. He brilliantly showed with his studies on NMDARs that even a team of two people with modest equipment but sharp minds could make landmark discoveries. Philippe Ascher was an accomplished scholar and humanist. His example will serve as an inspiration for many remaining friends and colleagues."
https://openalex.org/W4311579364,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is considered one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In recent years, this research area has attracted researchers’ attention to investigate heart sounds to diagnose the disease. To effectively distinguish heart valve defects from normal heart sounds, adaptive empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and feature fusion techniques were used to analyze the classification of heart sounds. Based on the correlation coefficient and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) method, adaptive EMD was proposed under the condition of screening the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. Adaptive thresholds based on Hausdorff Distance were used to choose the IMF components used for reconstruction. The multidimensional features extracted from the reconstructed signal were ranked and selected. The features of waveform transformation, energy and heart sound signal can indicate the state of heart activity corresponding to various heart sounds. Here, a set of ordinary features were extracted from the time, frequency and nonlinear domains. To extract more compelling features and achieve better classification results, another four cardiac reserve time features were fused. The fusion features were sorted using six different feature selection algorithms. Three classifiers, random forest, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor, were trained on open source and our databases. Compared to the previous work, our extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can achieve the best results and have the highest accuracy of 99.3% (1.9% improvement in classification accuracy). The excellent results verified the robustness and effectiveness of the fusion features and proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W4311589184,"Employees, as the most valuable assets and critical sources of competitive advantage in enterprises, are among the important stakeholders in enterprises. Employee social responsibility (ESR) has been a continually important research interest in the field of enterprise social responsibility. However, in the literature, few studies explore how personal features affect employee social responsibility. Thus, sampling China's listed companies from 2006 to 2019, we investigate how the home bias of senior executives influences enterprises' employee social responsibility. We identify home bias based on whether a chairperson's or CEO's hometown matches the firm's registration place. Three main results are obtained. First, the home bias of both CEOs and chairpersons can improve the corporate fulfillment of employee social responsibility. Second, further cost-benefit analysis shows that this result is due to not only identification but also benefit exchange. Although senior executives' home bias significantly decreases employee turnover rate, enterprises absorb more employment, which significantly increases their redundant personnel costs. Therefore, firms should balance the potential benefits and costs incurred by home bias via trade-off. Third, in firms facing less market competition, firms with more governmental subsidies or state-owned firms, senior executives' home bias has a more significant promoting effect on the fulfillment of ESR, supporting the view of benefit exchange. Accordingly, by extending theories on the effects of senior executives' home bias and enriching the ESR literature, this paper has important practical value, our findings can guide and promote firms to perform ESR while actively complying with a national policy for stabilizing employment and ensuring people's well-being."

We find that changing the social insurance collection institution from the social security department to the local tax department significantly deters corporate tax evasion. A series of robustness tests also support this conclusion. The reason is changing the social insurance collection institution to the local tax department increases its’ social insurance information of the enterprise, and reduces the information asymmetry between the enterprise and the collection institution. Furthermore, we find that the impact of changing the social insurance collection institution on corporate tax evasion is more evident in the samples of labor-intensive enterprises, low labor cost enterprises, and enterprises under the jurisdiction of the local tax department. These results indicate that government institutional reform is a valid way to reduce the information asymmetry between the government and enterprises, which will finally deter corporate tax evasion."

Hygienic complementary food preparation is crucial to prevent childhood communicable diseases like diarrhea and associated malnutrition among children aged 6–24 months. However, in Ethiopia, there is a paucity of evidence on the practice of hygiene during complementary food preparation. Thus, this study is aimed to assess the hygienic practice of complementary food preparation and associated factors among women having children aged 6–24 months in Debark town, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 mothers with 6–24 months of age children from December 1 to January 30, 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Epi-data version 4.6 and SPSS version 23 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary logistic regressions (Bivariable and multivariable) were performed to identify statistically significant variables. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p-value &lt; 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. Results The study revealed that 44.9% (95% CI (40.2, 49.4%)) of the mothers having children aged 6–24 months had good practice of complementary food preparation. Maternal age of 25–29 years[AOR:3.23, 95% CI: (1.555–9.031)], husband’s attained secondary school and above (AOR:2.65, 95% CI (1.211–5.783)], using modern stove for cooking [AOR:3.33,95% CI (1.404–7.874)], having a separate kitchen[AOR: 8.59, 95%Cl: (2.084–35.376], and having a three bowl dishwashing system(AOR: 8.45, 95% CL: (4.444–16.053)) were significantly associated with good hygiene practice of complementary food preparation. Conclusions The findings have indicated that the majority of the mothers had poor hygienic practices of complementary food preparation. Mother’s age, husband’s educational status, type of stove used for cooking, having a separate kitchen, having a three bowl dishwashing system were factors that significantly influenced the hygiene practice of mothers during complementary food preparation. Therefore, training and counseling mothers and caregivers on complementary food processing and preparation is important and such endeavors which inform the development and implementation of complementary food hygiene interventions in urban communities are recommended."

https://openalex.org/W4311672564,"Mosquitoes are known to harbor a large number of insect specific viruses (ISV) in addition to viruses of public health importance. These ISVs are highly species specific and are non-pathogenic to humans or domestic animals. However, there is a potential threat of these ISVs evolving into human pathogens by genome alterations. Some ISVs are known to modulate replication of pathogenic viruses by altering the susceptibility of vector mosquitoes to pathogenic viruses, thereby either inhibiting or enhancing transmission of the latter. In the present study, we report predominance of Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV, Family: Phenuviridae) contributing to >60% of the total reads in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected from Pune district of Maharashtra state using next generation sequencing based metagenomic analysis of viromes. Similar results were also obtained with mosquitoes from Assam, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka states of India. Comparison of Pune mosquito sequences with PCLV Rio (Brazil) isolate showed 98.90%, 99.027% and 98.88% homologies in the S, M and L segments respectively indicating less genetic heterogeneity of PCLV. The study also demonstrated occurrence of transovarial transmission as seen by detection of PCLV in eggs, larvae, pupae and male mosquitoes. Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected from Pune also showed a large number of reads for viruses belonging to Baculoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Genomoviridae and Bunyaviridae families. The role of PCLV in the replication of dengue and chikungunya virus is yet not clear. It warrants further studies to know the significance of PCLV and other ISVs on the replication and transmission of Ae. aegypti borne pathogenic viruses, especially in the absence of prophylactics or therapeutics."

Data were drawn from a cross-sectional online survey among 2SGBQ+ men in Manitoba. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between sociodemographics, loss of income due to COVID-19 (independent variable) and worsening of mental health (analytic outcome). Among all respondents in the sample ( N = 366), 55% indicated worsening of their mental health. In logistic regression, compared to participants who did not experience any loss of income, those who experienced loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to report worsening mental health ( Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 8.32, 95% Confidence Interval[CI] = 3.54–19.54). Compared to participants who self-identified as gay, bisexual-identifying participants were less likely to report worsening mental health ( AOR = .35, 95%CI = 0.13–0.96). Finally, as compared to participants who were married or partnered, participants who were dating ( AOR = 3.14, 95%CI = 1.60–6.17), single ( AOR = 4.08, 95%CI = 1.75–9.52), and separated/divorced/widowed ( AOR = 15.08, 95%CI = 2.22–102.51) were all significantly more likely to report experiencing a worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the need to develop robust public strategies for sub-populations of 2SGBQ+ men (non-gay identified sexual minorities and 2SGBQ+ men who may be more socially isolated). Specific targeted and tailored public health interventions designed with the unique needs of 2SGBQ+ men in Manitoba may be required to increase their access to socio-economic and mental health supports."

Our study identified the association between two distinct phases, VDR polymorphisms and HBV inactive carrier (IC) and chronic hepatitis (CH). Chronic HBV patients were enrolled from February to August 2020. An HBV viral load (VL) &lt; 2,000 IU/ml twice for 6 months apart, with no prior history of HBV treatment, defined the IC phase. Six common polymorphisms in the VDR gene, including CdX-2 , GATA , Fok I, Bsm l, Apa I, and Taq I, were studied using real-time PCR. The different outcomes in allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies in between groups and linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping were analyzed. Among 324 enrolled patients, there were 163 patients in IC and 161 patients in CH phases. The mean vitamin D levels were not statistically different between groups. The proportion of allele frequencies of CdX-2 in IC and CH was 53.7% and 62.7% for G allele, and 46.3% and 37.3% for A allele (p 0.019). The proportion of GG genotype of CdX-2 was less frequently found in patients with IC compared to that in patients with CH (27% vs 41%, p 0.028). By multivariate analysis, CdX-2 G/A genotypes were independently associated with IC, with adjusted odd ratio (OR) 1.83 (1.10–3.04), p 0.019. The LD mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) revealed high LD scores in Bsm l/ Apa I/ Taq I (BAT) haplotype in both groups while, CdX-2/GATA and GATA/Fok I demonstrated high LD score only in CH group. CdX-2 G/A genotypes were independently associated with IC status in Thai patients with chronic HBV infection.

https://openalex.org/W4311676897,"Development of attention systems is essential for both cognitive and social behavior maturation. Visual behavior has been used to assess development of these attention systems. Yet, given its importance, there is a notable lack of literature detailing successful methods and procedures for using eye-tracking in early infancy to assess oculomotor and attention dynamics. Here we show that eye-tracking technology can be used to automatically record and assess visual behavior in infants as young as 2.5 months, and present normative data describing fixation and saccade behavior at this age. Features of oculomotor dynamics were analyzed from 2.5-month old infants who viewed videos depicting live action, cartoons, geometric shapes, social and non-social scenes. Of the 54 infants enrolled, 50 infants successfully completed the eye-tracking task and high-quality data was collected for 32 of those infants. We demonstrate that modifications specifically tailored for the infant population allowed for consistent tracking of pupil and corneal reflection and minimal data loss. Additionally, we found consistent fixation and saccade behaviors across the entire six-minute duration of the videos, indicating that this is a feasible task for 2.5-month old infants. Moreover, normative oculomotor metrics for a free-viewing task in 2.5-month old infants are documented for the first time as a result of this high-quality data collection."
