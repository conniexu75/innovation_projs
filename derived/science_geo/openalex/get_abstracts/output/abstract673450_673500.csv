https://openalex.org/W3158889093,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, governments took unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus. Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30,000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about people’s preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to “unity” and not to “division”. 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces."
https://openalex.org/W3159662430,"Demographic, health, and socioeconomic factors significantly inform COVID-19 outcomes. This article analyzes the association of these factors and outcomes in Chile during the first five months of the pandemic. Using the municipalities Metropolitan Region's municipalities as the unit of analysis, the study looks at the role of time dynamics, space, and place in cases and deaths over a 100-day period between March and July 2020. As a result, common and idiosyncratic elements explain the prevalence and dynamics of infections and mortality. Social determinants of health, particularly multidimensional poverty index and use of public transportation play an important role in explaining differences in outcomes. The article contributes to the understanding of the determinants of COVID-19 highlighting the need to consider time-space dynamics and social determinants as key in the analysis. Structural factors are important to identify at-risk populations and to select policy strategies to prevent and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. The results are especially relevant for similar research in unequal settings."

However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects’ overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40–49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20–29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease. A geographical difference was also observed: a higher prevalence in Surabaya (13.1%) than in Jombang (9.9%). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak among asymptomatic populations was characterized by a high prevalence of infection in East Java, Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W3157537629,"The decision of whether to pursue a tenure-track faculty position has become increasingly difficult for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees considering a career in research. Trainees express concerns over job availability, financial insecurity, and other perceived challenges associated with pursuing an academic position.To help further elucidate the benefits, challenges, and strategies for pursuing an academic career, a diverse sample of postdoctoral scholars (""postdocs"") from across the United States were asked to provide advice on pursuing a research career in academia in response to an open-ended survey question. 994 responses were qualitatively analyzed using both content and thematic analyses. 177 unique codes, 20 categories, and 10 subthemes emerged from the data and were generalized into two thematic areas: Life in Academia and Strategies for Success.On life in academia, postdoc respondents overwhelmingly agree that academia is most rewarding when you are truly passionate about scientific research and discovery. 'Passion' emerged as the most frequently cited code, referenced 189 times. Financial insecurity, work-life balance, securing grant funding, academic politics, and a competitive job market emerged as challenges of academic research. The survey respondents note that while passion and hard work are necessary, they are not always sufficient to overcome these challenges. The postdocs encourage trainees to be realistic about career expectations and to prepare broadly for career paths that align with their interests, skills, and values. Strategies recommended for perseverance include periodic self-reflection, mental health support, and carefully selecting mentors.For early-career scientists along the training continuum, this advice deserves critical reflection before committing to an academic research career. For advisors and institutions, this work provides a unique perspective from postdoctoral scholars on elements of the academic training path that can be improved to increase retention, career satisfaction, and preparation for the scientific workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3158841437,"Clinical and laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity are now well described and combined to propose mortality or severity scores. However, they all necessitate saturable equipment such as scanners, or procedures difficult to implement such as blood gas measures. To provide an easy and fast COVID-19 severity risk score upon hospital admission, and keeping in mind the above limits, we sought for a scoring system needing limited invasive data such as a simple blood test and co-morbidity assessment by anamnesis. A retrospective study of 303 patients (203 from Bordeaux University hospital and an external independent cohort of 100 patients from Paris Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital) collected clinical and biochemical parameters at admission. Using stepwise model selection by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we built the severity score Covichem. Among 26 tested variables, 7: obesity, cardiovascular conditions, plasma sodium, albumin, ferritin, LDH and CK were the independent predictors of severity used in Covichem (accuracy 0.87, AUROC 0.91). Accuracy was 0.92 in the external validation cohort (89% sensitivity and 95% specificity). Covichem score could be useful as a rapid, costless and easy to implement severity assessment tool during acute COVID-19 pandemic waves."
https://openalex.org/W3157490027,"Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic may cause significant morbidity and mortality in adults, yet severe cases are rare among children. The indirect impact of the pandemic on health care delivery in general and pediatric emergency department (PED) visits in particular has been widely reported. Aims To assess the impact of the pandemic and the social restrictions imposed in its wake on PED visits and hospitalization rates in our Israeli medical center. We also sought to track these data in relation to the variation in pandemic severity and social restrictions over time. A comparison of this data with that of the adult emergency department was also performed. Methods Data for this study were drawn from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC), Jerusalem, Israel computerized databank. The daily number of PED and adult ER visits as well as hospitalizations resulting from these visits during the months January-July during the years 2018, 2019, 2020 were recorded. We compared the risk ratio for hospitalization in 2019 and 2020, as well as the incidence rate ratio. Results During March and April there was a decrease in PED visits from 4,588 visits in 2019 to 2,527 visits in 2020 (ratio = .551, 95%CI [.52,.58]. Despite the drop in PED visits, the rate of hospitalizations rose with respect to 2019 (Risk Ratio = 1.31, p &lt; .001, 95%CI [1.17,1.47]). Similar but more moderate trends were seen in the adult ED. From May-July 2020, after the lockdown was lifted, PED visits remained 30% below the same time period from 2018 and 2019, while the hospitalization rate returned to its pre-pandemic level. Conclusions A significant drop in PED visits is seen to extend well beyond the peak of the pandemic and the lockdown period. This highlights the potential risk of children with serious emergencies becoming casualties of the pandemic by their not being brought to medical attention. Efforts should be made to raise public awareness among parents and other caretakers of children regarding this matter."
https://openalex.org/W3158550433,"The demands of high-performance sport are exacerbated during the lead up to the Major Games (i.e., Paralympics). The purpose of this study was to better understand the challenges experienced and strategies utilized by Australian athletes (n = 7) and coaches (n = 5) preparing for the Tokyo Paralympic Games using semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis highlighted challenges specific to participants’ sport (e.g., budgetary constraints, decentralized experiences, athletes with various impairments), personal life (e.g., moving cities to access coaching, postponing vocational/educational developments, isolation from social circles), and associated uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19, qualifications, accreditations). Participants managed these challenges by utilizing strategies to ‘anticipate and prepare’ (e.g., detailed planning, effective communication, contingency plans) and ‘manage expectations’ (e.g., understanding specific roles and boundaries, focusing on the process [i.e., effort over results]). Trust and communication between athletes and coaches was key in coaches’ better understanding of how athletes’ impairments interact with their training and competition environments and tailor support to each athlete’s unique needs. Last, participants reflected on the ‘pressure’ of the Games due to their performance having an impact on their career trajectory ‘post-Tokyo’ with some athletes contemplating retirement and others realizing the consequences of their performance on sport-related vocation and sponsorship. Coaches also accepted the success of their programs and job security will depend on outcomes at the Games. The findings from this study shed light on factors to consider to reduce challenges for teams preparing for major competitions but also highlight key practical implications to support athletes and coaches leading up, during, and post-major Games."

We performed serial measures of body composition using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) in ALS patients to explore its utility as a biomarker of disease progression. Methods DEXA data were obtained from participants with ALS (enrollment, at 6- and 12- months follow ups) and Parkinson’s disease (enrollment and at 4-month follow up) as a comparator group. Body mass index, total lean mass index, appendicular lean mass index, total fat mass index, and percentage body fat at enrollment were compared between the ALS and PD cohorts and age-matched normative data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. Estimated monthly changes of body composition measures in the ALS cohort were compared to those of the PD cohort and were correlated with disease progression measured by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). Results The ALS cohort (N = 20) had lower baseline total and appendicular lean mass indices compared to the PD cohort (N = 20) and general population. Loss in total and appendicular lean masses were found to be significantly associated with follow-up time. Low baseline percentage body fat (r = 0.72, p = 0.04), loss of percentage body fat (r = 0.81, p = 0.01), and total fat mass index (r = 0.73, p = 0.04) during follow up correlated significantly with monthly decline of ALSFRS-R scores in ALS cohort who had 2 or more follow-ups (N = 8). Conclusion Measurement of body composition with DEXA might serve as a biomarker for rapid disease progression in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3157716300,"Robotic total stations have been widely used in continuous automatic monitoring of dam deformations. In this regard, monitoring accuracy is an important factor affecting deformation analysis. First the displacements calculation methods for dam deformation monitoring with total stations are presented, and the corresponding mean square error formulas are derived. Then for errors caused by atmospheric refraction, two correction methods are described. Simulations were conducted to compare the displacement accuracy calculated through different methods. It indicated that the difference between polar coordinate method and forward intersection is less than 0.5mm within around 400m' monitoring range, and in such cases, the polar coordinate method is preferred, as only one total station is required. Refraction correction tests with observations from two dams demonstrated that both correction methods could effectively enhance the monitoring accuracy. For observation correction, correction through the closest reference point achieves better correction results."
https://openalex.org/W3158019111,"Study hypothesis Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training can increase the likelihood of patient survival and better neurological outcomes. However, conventional learning (CL) has cost, time, and space constraints. This study aimed to evaluate whether laypersons who completed instructor-led distance learning (DL) acquired a level of CPR skill comparable to that achieved via CL training. Methods This randomized controlled study recruited students from 28 Korean high schools who were randomized to complete instructor-led DL or CL training. The CL training involved classroom-based face-to-face training, whereas the instructor-led DL training was provided online using a videoconferencing system. Results The study enrolled 62 students who were randomized to the CL group (31 participants) or the DL group (31 participants). Relative to the CL group, the DL group achieved remarkably similar results in terms of most CPR variables. In addition, the DL group had a significant improvement in the mean compression depth (before: 46 mm [interquartile range: 37–52 mm] vs. after: 49 mm [interquartile range: 46–54 mm], p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Instructor-led DL can be a suitable alternative to CL for providing CPR training to laypersons. In settings like the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face CL is not practical, DL may be a useful tool for delivering CPR training."
https://openalex.org/W3158239754,"Elucidating the mechanisms underlying human pain sensation requires the establishment of an in vitro model of pain reception comprising human cells expressing pain-sensing receptors and function properly as neurons. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are mesenchymal stem cells and a promising candidate for producing human neuronal cells, however, the functional properties of differentiated hDPSCs have not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrated neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs via both their expression of neuronal marker proteins and their neuronal function examined using Ca2+ imaging. Moreover, to confirm the ability of nociception, Ca2+ responses in differentiated hDPSCs were compared to those of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Those cells showed similar responses to glutamate, ATP and agonists of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Since TRP channels are implicated in nociception, differentiated hDPSCs provide a useful in vitro model of human peripheral neuron response to stimuli interpreted as pain."
https://openalex.org/W3157617914,"To optimize HIV testing resources, programs are moving away from universal testing strategies toward a risk-based screening approach to testing children/adolescents, but there is little consensus around what defines an optimal risk screening tool. This study aimed to validate a 12-item risk screening tool among children and adolescents and provide suggested fewer-item tool options for screening both facility out-patient and community populations by age strata (<10 and ≥10 years). Children/adolescents (2-19 years) with unknown HIV status were recruited from a community-based vulnerable children program and health facilities in 5 regions of Tanzania in 2019. Lay workers administered the screening questions to caregivers/adolescents; nurses enrolled those eligible for the study and tested all participants for HIV. For each screening item, we estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). We generated a score based on the count of items with a positive risk response and fit a receiver operating characteristic curve to determine a cut-off score. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV; yield) and number needed to test to detect an HIV-positive child (NNT) were estimated for various tool options by age group. We enrolled 21,008 children and adolescents. The proportion of undiagnosed HIV-positive children was low (n = 76; 0.36%; CI:0.29,0.45%). A screening algorithm based on reporting at least one or more items on the 10 to 12-item tool had sensitivity 89.2% (CI:79.1,95.6), specificity 37.5% (CI:36.8,38.2), positive predictive value 0.5% (CI:0.4,0.6) and NNT = 211. An algorithm based on at least two or more items resulted in lower sensitivity (64.6%), improved specificity (69.1%), PPV (0.7%) and NNT = 145. A shorter tool derived from the 10 to 12-item screening tool with a score of ""1"" or more on the following items: relative died, ever hospitalized, cough, family member with HIV, and sexually active if 10-19 years performed optimally with 85.3% (CI:74.6,92.7) sensitivity, 44.2% (CI:43.5,44.9) specificity, 0.5% (CI:0.4,0.7) PPV and NNT = 193. We propose that different short-tool options (3-5 items) can achieve an optimal balance between reduced HIV testing costs (lower NNT) with acceptable sensitivity. In low prevalence settings, changes in yield may be negligible and NNT may remain high even for an effective tool."
https://openalex.org/W3158476063,"The health and condition of the world's reefs are in steep decline. This has triggered the development of fledgling micro-scale coral reef restoration projects along many reef coastlines. However, it is increasingly recognised that the scale and productivity of micro-scale coral gardening projects will be insufficient to meet the growing global threats to reefs. More recently, efforts to develop and implement restoration techniques for application at regional scales have been pursued by research organisations. Coral reefs are mostly located in the unindustrialised world. Yet, most of the funding, and scientific and engineering method development for larger-scale methods will likely be sourced and created in the industrialised world. Therefore, the development of the emerging at-scale global reef restoration sector will inevitably involve the transfer of methods, approaches, finances, labour and skills from the industrialised world to the unindustrialised world. This opens the door to the industrialised world negatively impacting the unindustrialised world and, in some cases, First Nations peoples. In Western scientific parlance, ecological imperialism occurs when people from industrialised nations seek to recreate environments and ecosystems in unindustrialised nations that are familiar and comfortable to them. How a coral reef 'should' look depends on one's background and perspective. While predominately Western scientific approaches provide guidance on the ecological principles for reef restoration, these methods might not be applicable in every scenario in unindustrialised nations. Imposing such views on Indigenous coastal communities without the local technical and leadership resources to scale-up restoration of their reefs can lead to unwanted consequences. The objective of this paper is to introduce this real and emerging risk into the broader reef restoration discussion."
https://openalex.org/W3158207512,"Objective Pilot testing of real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) and real time functional near infrared spectroscopy (rt-fNIRS) as brain computer interface (BCI) neural feedback systems combined with motor learning for motor recovery in chronic severely impaired stroke survivors. Approach We enrolled a four-case series and administered three sequential rt-fMRI and ten rt-fNIRS neural feedback sessions interleaved with motor learning sessions. Measures were: Arm Motor Assessment Tool, functional domain (AMAT-F; 13 complex functional tasks), Fugl-Meyer arm coordination scale (FM); active wrist extension range of motion (ROM); volume of activation (fMRI); and fNIRS HbO concentration. Performance during neural feedback was assessed, in part, using percent successful brain modulations during rt-fNIRS. Main results Pre-/post-treatment mean clinically significant improvement in AMAT-F (.49 ± 0.22) and FM (10.0 ± 3.3); active wrist ROM improvement ranged from 20° to 50°. Baseline to follow-up change in brain signal was as follows: fMRI volume of activation was reduced in almost all ROIs for three subjects, and for one subject there was an increase or no change; fNIRS HbO was within normal range, except for one subject who increased beyond normal at post-treatment. During rt-fNIRS neural feedback training, there was successful brain signal modulation (42%–78%). Significance Severely impaired stroke survivors successfully engaged in spatially focused BCI systems, rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS, to clinically significantly improve motor function. At the least, equivalency in motor recovery was demonstrated with prior long-duration motor learning studies (without neural feedback), indicating that no loss of motor improvement resulted from substituting neural feedback sessions for motor learning sessions. Given that the current neural feedback protocol did not prevent the motor improvements observed in other long duration studies, even in the presence of fewer sessions of motor learning in the current work, the results support further study of neural feedback and its potential for recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In future work, expanding the sophistication of either or both rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS could hold the potential for further reducing the number of hours of training needed and/or the degree of recovery.

https://openalex.org/W3158520355,"A relatively large body of literature has documented the welfare effects of smallholder farmers' participation in single-commodity output markets. However, limited empirical evidence is available when smallholder farmers participate in multiple-commodities output markets. We tried to fill this gap in the literature by estimating the impacts of smallholder farmers' contemporaneous participation in both maize and legume markets vis-à-vis in only maize or legume markets using household-level data from Tanzania. Applying a multinomial endogenous switching regression model that allows controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity associated with market participation in single-commodity and multiple-commodity markets, results showed that smallholder farmers' participation in both single-and multiple-commodity markets was positively and significantly associated with household income and food security. Moreover, the greatest benefits were obtained when farmers participated in multiple-commodity markets, suggesting the importance of policies promoting diversification in crop income sources to increase welfare and food security. Our findings also signal the complementary-rather than substitute-nature of accessing multiple-commodity markets for enhancing household livelihoods under a specialization strategy. Finally, important policy implications are suggested, from promoting and supporting public infrastructure investments to expanding road networks to reduce transportation costs, especially in remote communities, to enhance smallholder farmer access to profitable maize and legume markets in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3158689380,"Caring for children with a disability can cause a range of psychological and socioeconomic challenges for parents and caregivers, such as anxiety, depression, inability to find affordable and appropriate childcare, loss of income and expenses related to disability specific treatment. As part of a study exploring the impacts of childhood disability on mothers or female caregivers and families, and the copy strategies they used, this paper describes strategies employed by mothers or female caregivers to cope with challenges associated with childhood disability within their family in Belu district, Indonesia. A qualitative approach using one-on-one in-depth interviews was used to collect data from participants (n = 22) who were recruited using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and imported to NVivo 12 for analysis. A qualitative framework analysis was used to guide data analysis. The conceptual framework of coping strategies guided the conceptualisation and discussion of the findings. The findings showed that active psychological coping strategies, including cognitive or acceptance strategies, knowledge of both health condition and socio-academic related development of children with a disability, and family relationship and support, were used by the participants to cope with psychological challenges facing them. Self-reliance and religious/spiritual coping strategies were also utilised. Sociocultural strategies, such as social withdrawal or disengagement, professional support and culture-based support, were used by the participants to cope with social impacts, stigma, and discrimination associated with childhood disability. Participants also reported using financial strategies such as selling of family assets to cope with the economic challenges. The findings indicate the need for programs and interventions that address the needs of mothers and female caregivers and their families, to assist with effectively managing the significant challenges they face when caring for a child with a disability. Further studies are needed, with a larger number of participants and the inclusion of fathers or male caregivers, in order to better understand the broader coping experience of childhood disability impacts within families."
https://openalex.org/W3158950171,"The supply of drinking water is a vital challenge for the people who live on the African continent, as this continent is experiencing strong demographic growth and therefore increasing water demands. To meet these needs, surface water resources are becoming increasingly mobilized because underground resources are not always available or have already been overexploited. This situation is the case in the region of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, where the drinking water deficit is a growing problem and it is therefore necessary to mobilize new water resources to ensure the supply of drinking water. Among the potential resources, local managers have identified a freshwater lagoon, Lagoon Aghien, That is in close proximity to the city of Abidjan. With the aim of enhancing knowledge on the ecological functioning of the lagoon and contributing to the assessment of its ability to provide drinking water, several physical and chemical parameters of the water and the phytoplankton community of the lagoon were monitored for 17 months (December 2016-April 2018) at six sampling stations. Our findings show that the lagoon is eutrophic, as evidenced by the high concentrations of total phosphorus (>140 μg L-1), nitrogen (1.36 mg L-1) and average chlorophyll-a (26 to 167 μg L-1) concentrations. The phytoplankton community in the lagoon is dominated by genera typical of eutrophic environments including mixotrophic genera such as Peridinium and by cyanobacteria such as Cylindrospermopsis/Raphidiopsis, Microcystis and Dolichospermum that can potentially produce cyanotoxins. The two rainfall peaks that occur in June and October appeared to be major events in terms of nutrient flows entering the lagoon, and the dynamics of these flows are complex. Significant differences were also found in the nutrient concentrations and to a lesser extent in the phytoplankton communities among the different stations, especially during the rainfall peaks. Overall, these results reveal that the quality of the lagoon's water is already severely degraded, and this degradation could increase in future years due to increasing urbanization in the watershed. These results therefore raise questions about the potential use of the lagoon as a source of drinking water if measures are not taken very quickly to protect this lagoon from increasing eutrophication and other pollution sources."
https://openalex.org/W3159289454,"The sustainable development of collection and delivery points and urban street network is an important consideration of logistic planners. Urban street networks have a significant impact on collection and delivery points’ location, but the spatial relationship between the centrality of urban street network and collection and delivery points has not been studied using spatial design network analysis. In a multiple centrality assessment model, we used point of interest and street network data to evaluate the location of two types of collection and delivery points and the centrality of streets in Nanjing city, based on four indicators: closeness, betweenness, severance, and efficiency. Then, kernel density estimation and spatial autocorrelation are used to study spatial patterns of distribution and centrality coupling effects of urban street network and collection and delivery points. The results show that the centrality of Nanjing streets has a big influence on the location of the collection and delivery points, and the directions of different types of centrality also vary. The location of the Cainiao Stations are largely related to closeness, followed by betweenness, severance, and efficiency. China Post Stations and street centrality have a weak correlation between efficiency and severance, but no correlation between closeness and betweenness. Our results can help logistics enterprises and urban planners to develop collection and delivery points’ network based on the urban street network."
https://openalex.org/W3159379416,"Polar bears are of international conservation concern due to climate change but are difficult to study because of low densities and an expansive, circumpolar distribution. In a collaborative U.S.-Russian effort in spring of 2016, we used aerial surveys to detect and estimate the abundance of polar bears on sea ice in the Chukchi Sea. Our surveys used a combination of thermal imagery, digital photography, and human observations. Using spatio-temporal statistical models that related bear and track densities to physiographic and biological covariates (e.g., sea ice extent, resource selection functions derived from satellite tags), we predicted abundance and spatial distribution throughout our study area. Estimates of 2016 abundance ([Formula: see text]) ranged from 3,435 (95% CI: 2,300-5,131) to 5,444 (95% CI: 3,636-8,152) depending on the proportion of bears assumed to be missed on the transect line during Russian surveys (g(0)). Our point estimates are larger than, but of similar magnitude to, a recent estimate for the period 2008-2016 ([Formula: see text]; 95% CI 1,522-5,944) derived from an integrated population model applied to a slightly smaller area. Although a number of factors (e.g., equipment issues, differing platforms, low sample sizes, size of the study area relative to sampling effort) required us to make a number of assumptions to generate estimates, it establishes a useful lower bound for abundance, and suggests high spring polar bear densities on sea ice in Russian waters south of Wrangell Island. With future improvements, we suggest that springtime aerial surveys may represent a plausible avenue for studying abundance and distribution of polar bears and their prey over large, remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W3159693833,"In 2018, Malaria accounted for 38% of the overall morbidity and 36% of the overall mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study aimed to identify malaria socioeconomic predictors among children aged 6-59 months in DRC and to describe a socioeconomic profile of the most-at-risk children aged 6-59 months for malaria infection.This study used data from the 2013 DRC Demographic and Health Survey. The sample included 8,547 children aged 6-59 months who were tested for malaria by microscopy. Malaria infection status, the dependent variable, is a dummy variable characterized as a positive or negative test. The independent variables were child's sex, age, and living arrangement; mother's education; household's socioeconomic variables; province of residence; and type of place of residence. Statistical analyses used the chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) model and logistic regression.Of the 8,547 children included in the sample, 25% had malaria infection. Four variables-child's age, mother's education, province, and wealth index-were statistically associated with the prevalence of malaria infection in bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis (CHAID and logistic regression). The prevalence of malaria infection increases with child's age and decreases significantly with mother's education and the household wealth index. These findings suggest that the prevalence of malaria infection is driven by interactions among environmental factors, socioeconomic characteristics, and probably differences in the implementation of malaria programs across the country. The effect of mother's education on malaria infection was only significant among under-five children living in Ituri, Kasaï-Central, Haut-Uele, Lomami, Nord-Ubangi, and Maniema provinces, and the effect of wealth index was significant in Mai-Ndombe, Tshopo, and Haut-Katanga provinces.Findings from this study could be used for targeting malaria interventions in DRC. Although malaria infection is common across the country, the prevalence of children at high risk for malaria infection varies by province and other background characteristics, including age, mother's education, wealth index, and place of residence. In light of these findings, designing provincial and multisectoral interventions could be an effective strategy to achieve zero malaria infection in DRC."

The human-specific CHRFAM7A gene and its 2bp deletion polymorphism (Δ2bp variant) encodes a structurally-deficient α7nAChRs that may impact the anti-inflammatory function. We studied 45 spinal cord injury (SCI) patients for up to six weeks post SCI to investigate the role of the Δ2bp variant on multiple circulating inflammatory mediators and two outcome measures (neuropathic pain and risk of pressure ulcers). The patient's SCI were classified as either severe or mild. Missing values were imputed. Overall genetic effect was conducted with independent sample t-test and corrected with false discovery rate (FDR). Univariate analysis and regression analysis were applied to evaluate the Δ2bp effects on temporal variation of inflammatory mediators post SCI and their interaction with outcome measures. In severe SCI, the Δ2bp carriers showed higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators than the Δ2bp non-carriers in TNF-α (FDR = 9.6x10-4), IFN-γ (FDR = 1.3x10-3), IL-13 (FDR = 1.6x10-3), CCL11 (FDR = 2.1x10-3), IL-12p70 (FDR = 2.2x10-3), IL-8 (FDR = 2.2x10-3), CXCL10 (FDR = 3.1x10-3), CCL4 (FDR = 5.7x10-3), IL-12p40 (FDR = 7.1x10-3), IL-1b (FDR = 0.014), IL-15 (FDR = 0.024), and IL-2 (FDR = 0.037). IL-8 and CCL2 were negatively associated with days post injury (DPI) for the Δ2bp carriers (P = 2x10-7 and P = 2x10-8, respectively) and IL-5 was positively associated with DPI for the Δ2bp non-carriers (P = 0.015). Neuropathic pain was marginally positively associated with IL-13 for the Δ2bp carriers (P = 0.056). In mild SCI, the Δ2bp carriers had lower circulating levels of IL-15 (FDR = 0.04) than the Δ2bp non-carriers. Temporal variation of inflammatory mediators post SCI was not associated with the Δ2bp variant. For the mild SCI Δ2bp carriers, risk of pressure ulcers was positively associated with circulating levels of IFN-γ, CXCL10, and CCL4 and negatively associated with circulating levels of IL-12p70. These findings support an important role for the human-specific CHRFAM7A Δ2bp gene variant in modifying anti-inflammatory function of α7nAChRs following SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3157031520,"The level of serum uric acid (SUA) has been reported to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). However, this association remains unclear in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).A total of 1025 patients with pre-dialysis CKD with preserved left ventricular systolic function were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The LVH and LVDD were assessed using two-dimensional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging. The associations of LVH/LVDD with clinical and laboratory variables were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.In a multivariable analysis, the SUA level was an independent predictor of LVH (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-1.50, P < 0.001). In addition, patient age, systolic blood pressure, intact parathyroid hormone levels, and left atrial volume index levels were independent predictors of LVH. The SUA level was also an independent predictor of LVDD (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.53-2.43, P < 0.001). Furthermore, systolic blood pressure and left atrial volume index levels were an independent predictor of LVDD. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the best cutoff values of SUA levels for identifying LVH and LVDD were ≥ 7.5 mg/dL and ≥ 6.3 mg/dL, respectively.The SUA level was an independent predictor of LVD and LVDD in patients with CKD, suggesting that SUA could be a biomarker for LVH and LVDD."
https://openalex.org/W3157258563,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of internal cueing systems, affecting rhythmic motor tasks such as walking and speech production. Music and dance encourage spontaneous rhythmic coupling between sensory and motor systems; this has inspired the development of dance programs for PD. Here we assessed the therapeutic outcome and some underlying cognitive mechanisms of dance classes for PD, as measured by neuropsychological assessments of disease severity as well as quantitative assessments of rhythmic ability and sensorimotor experience. We assessed prior music and dance experience, beat perception (Beat Alignment Test), sensorimotor coupling (tapping to high- and low-groove songs), and disease severity (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale in PD individuals) before and after four months of weekly dance classes. PD individuals performed better on UPDRS after four months of weekly dance classes, suggesting efficacy of dance intervention. Greater post-intervention improvements in UPDRS were associated with the presence of prior dance experience and with more accurate sensorimotor coupling. Prior dance experience was additionally associated with enhanced sensorimotor coupling during tapping to both high-groove and low-groove songs. These results show that dance classes for PD improve both qualitative and quantitative assessments of disease symptoms. The association between these improvements and dance experience suggests that rhythmic motor training, a mechanism underlying dance training, impacts improvements in parkinsonian symptoms following a dance intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3156035552,"Individuals living with low income are more likely to smoke, have a higher risk of lung cancer, and are less likely to participate in preventative healthcare (i.e., low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening), leading to equity concerns. To inform the delivery of an organized pilot lung cancer screening program in Ontario, we sought to contextualize the lived experiences of poverty and the choice to participate in lung cancer screening.At three Toronto academic primary-care clinics, high-risk screen-eligible patients who chose or declined LDCT screening were consented; sociodemographic data was collected. Qualitative interviews were conducted. Theoretical thematic analysis was used to organize, describe and interpret the data using the morphogenetic approach as a guiding theoretical lens.Eight participants chose to undergo screening; ten did not. From interviews, we identified three themes: Pathways of disadvantage (social trajectories of events that influence lung-cancer risk and health-seeking behaviour), lung-cancer risk and early detection (upstream factors that shape smoking behaviour and lung-cancer screening choices), and safe spaces of care (care that is free of bias, conflict, criticism, or potentially threatening actions, ideas or conversations). We illuminate how 'choice' is contextual to the availability of material resources such as income and housing, and how 'choice' is influenced by having access to spaces of care that are free of judgement and personal bias.Underserved populations will require multiprong interventions that work at the individual, system and structural level to reduce inequities in lung-cancer risk and access to healthcare services such as cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3157810461,"Political optimizer (PO) is a relatively state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization technique for global optimization problems, as well as real-world engineering optimization, which mimics the multi-staged process of politics in human society. However, due to a greedy strategy during the election phase, and an inappropriate balance of global exploration and local exploitation during the party switching stage, it suffers from stagnation in local optima with a low convergence accuracy. To overcome such drawbacks, a sequence of novel PO variants were proposed by integrating PO with Quadratic Interpolation, Advance Quadratic Interpolation, Cubic Interpolation, Lagrange Interpolation, Newton Interpolation, and Refraction Learning (RL). The main contributions of this work are listed as follows. (1) The interpolation strategy was adopted to help the current global optima jump out of local optima. (2) Specifically, RL was integrated into PO to improve the diversity of the population. (3) To improve the ability of balancing exploration and exploitation during the party switching stage, a logistic model was proposed to maintain a good balance. To the best of our knowledge, PO combined with the interpolation strategy and RL was proposed here for the first time. The performance of the best PO variant was evaluated by 19 widely used benchmark functions and 30 test functions from the IEEE CEC 2014. Experimental results revealed the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of exploration capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3157820446,"Most lung cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting their treatment options with very low response rate. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Therapies that target driver gene mutations (e.g. EGFR , ALK , ROS1 ) and checkpoint inhibitors such anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 immunotherapies are being used to treat lung cancer patients. Identification of correlations between driver mutations and PD-L1 expression will allow for the best management of patient treatment. 851 cases of non-small cell lung cancer cases were profiled for the presence of biomarkers EGFR , KRAS , BRAF , and PIK3CA mutations by SNaPshot/sizing genotyping. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the protein expression of ALK and PD-L1. Total PD-L1 mRNA expression (from unsorted tumor samples) was quantified by RT-qPCR in a sub-group of the cohort to assess its correlation with PD-L1 protein level in tumor cells. Statistical analysis revealed correlations between the presence of the mutations, PD-L1 expression, and the pathological data. Specifically, increased PD-L1 expression was associated with wildtype EGFR and vascular invasion, and total PD-L1 mRNA levels correlated weakly with protein expression on tumor cells. These data provide insights into driver gene mutations and immune checkpoint status in relation to lung cancer subtypes and suggest that RT-qPCR is useful for assessing PD-L1 levels."
https://openalex.org/W3158521803,"In adults with cardiovascular risk factors undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was associated with postoperative cardiovascular complications. There is a need for an easy and accessible home device in predicting sleep apnea. The objective of the study is to determine the predictive performance of the overnight pulse oximetry in predicting OSA in at-risk surgical patients.This was a planned post-hoc analysis of multicenter prospective cohort study involving 1,218 at-risk surgical patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea. All patients underwent home sleep apnea testing (ApneaLink Plus, ResMed) simultaneously with pulse oximetry (PULSOX-300i, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc). The predictive performance of the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) versus apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were determined.Of 1,218 patients, the mean age was 67.2 ± 9.2 years and body mass index (BMI) was 27.0 ± 5.3 kg/m2. The optimal cut-off for predicting moderate-to-severe and severe OSA was ODI ≥15 events/hour. For predicting moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥15), the sensitivity and specificity of ODI ≥ 15 events per hour were 88.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7-90.6) and 95.4% (95% CI, 94.2-96.4). For severe OSA (AHI ≥30), the sensitivity and specificity were 97.2% (95% CI, 92.7-99.1) and 78.8% (95% CI, 78.2-79.0). The area under the curve (AUC) for moderate-to-severe and severe OSA was 0.983 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988) and 0.979 (95% CI, 0.97-0.909) respectively.ODI from oximetry is sensitive and specific in predicting moderate-to-severe or severe OSA in at-risk surgical population. It provides an easy, accurate, and accessible tool for at-risk surgical patients with suspected OSA."
https://openalex.org/W3158540714,"This study compared the results of data collected from a longitudinal query analysis of the MEDLINE database hosted on multiple platforms that include PubMed, EBSCOHost, Ovid, ProQuest, and Web of Science. The goal was to identify variations among the search results on the platforms after controlling for search query syntax. We devised twenty-nine cases of search queries comprised of five semantically equivalent queries per case to search against the five MEDLINE database platforms. We ran our queries monthly for a year and collected search result count data to observe changes. We found that search results varied considerably depending on MEDLINE platform. Reasons for variations were due to trends in scholarly publication such as publishing individual papers online first versus complete issues. Some other reasons were metadata differences in bibliographic records; differences in the levels of specificity of search fields provided by the platforms and large fluctuations in monthly search results based on the same query. Database integrity and currency issues were observed as each platform updated its MEDLINE data throughout the year. Specific biomedical bibliographic databases are used to inform clinical decision-making, create systematic reviews, and construct knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems. They serve as essential information retrieval and discovery tools to help identify and collect research data and are used in a broad range of fields and as the basis of multiple research designs. This study should help clinicians, researchers, librarians, informationists, and others understand how these platforms differ and inform future work in their standardization."
https://openalex.org/W3159180679,"Few longitudinal studies have investigated the association between foods/dietary pattern and mortality risk in the Asian population. We investigated the prospective association between foods/dietary pattern and risk of death among ethnic Chinese adults in Taiwan.The study population included 2475 young and middle-aged adults (aged 18-65 years at baseline) who completed the questionnaires and physical examinations in the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan from 1993 to 1996. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to assess food consumption habits in a face-to-face interview. With survey data linked to the Taiwanese Death Registry, Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the foods associated with all-cause mortality(followed until 2012), which were then tallied to calculate a dietary pattern score called Taiwanese Eating Approach(TEA) score. The TEA scores were then associated with various kinds of mortality outcomes. In addition, data from 431 elders (aged≥65 yrs) with 288 death endpoints were used to conduct a sensitivity analysis.A total of 385(15.6%) participants died (111 cardiovascular related deaths and 122 cancer related deaths) during the 17.8-year follow-up period(41274 person-years). Twelve foods (9 inverse [vegetables/fish/milk/tea](+1) and 3 positive[fatty meats/fermented vegetables/sweet drinks](-1)) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk. All adults were grouped by their cumulative food score into three diet groups: poor diet(29.3% of all subjects), average diet(44.0%), and healthy diet(26.70%). The better the diet, the lower the total, cardiovascular, and other cause mortality outcomes (trend-p < .001). The hazard ratio for the healthy diet was 0.64 (95% confidence interval:0.47-0.87) for total mortality, and 0.52(0.28-0.95) for cardiovascular death, compared with the poor diet in the multivariable models. This phenomenon was also seen in older adults for all-cause, cancer, and other cause mortalities.Consuming a healthy Taiwanese Eating Approach (TEA) diet is negatively associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and other-cause mortalities in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3158293193,"High-level dressage horses regularly perform advanced movements, requiring coordination and force transmission between front and hind limbs across the thoracolumbosacral region. This study aimed at quantifying kinematic differences in dressage horses when ridden in sitting trot-i.e. with additional load applied in the thoracolumbar region-compared with trotting in-hand. Inertial sensors were glued on to the midline of the thoracic (T) and lumbar (L) spine at T5, T13, T18, L3 and middle of the left and right tubera sacrale of ten elite dressage horses (Mean±SD), age 11±1 years, height 1.70±0.10m and body mass 600±24kg; first trotted in-hand, then ridden in sitting trot on an arena surface by four Grand Prix dressage riders. Straight-line motion cycles were analysed using a general linear model (random factor: horse; fixed factor: exercise condition; covariate: stride time, Bonferroni post hoc correction: P<0.05). Differential roll, pitch and yaw angles between adjacent sensors were calculated. In sitting trot, compared to trotting in-hand, there was increased pitch (mean±S.D), (in-hand, 3.9 (0.5°, sitting trot 6.3 (0.3°, P = <0.0001), roll (in-hand, 7.7 (1.1°, sitting trot 11.6 (0.9°, P = 0.003) and heading values (in-hand, 4.2 (0.8), sitting trot 9.5 (0.6°, P = <0.0001) in the caudal thoracic and lumbar region (T18-L3) and a decrease in heading values (in-hand, 7.1 (0.5°, sitting trot 5.2 (0.3°, P = 0.01) in the cranial thoracic region (T5-T13). Kinematics of the caudal thoracic and lumbar spine are influenced by the rider when in sitting trot, whilst lateral bending is reduced in the cranial thoracic region. This biomechanical difference with the addition of a rider, emphasises the importance of observing horses during ridden exercise, when assessing them as part of a loss of performance assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3158537471,"Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased rates of mortality and increased risk for developing dementia. Changes in brain structure and cognitive functioning have been reported within the literature. However, research examining cognitive performance in individuals with MetS is limited, inconclusive, and focuses primarily on older cohorts. As such, the effect of MetS on cognitive functioning earlier in the lifespan is unclear. This study aimed to investigate cognitive performance in young, middle-aged, and older adults with multiple metabolic and vascular risk factors in a sample of community dwelling participants (N = 128). Participants were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and self-report measures. As expected, older adults performed more poorly than young and middle-aged adults across most assessments. Relative to controls, individuals with MetS reported greater hunger and disinhibited eating. MetS participants performed more poorly on Color-Word Interference: Inhibition. Additionally, when weight was accounted for, there was a significant relationship between MetS and select executive functioning tasks in middle-aged adults. These findings suggest that aspects of executive functioning may be impaired in MetS and could be further impacted by excess weight in middle-age. Future studies aimed at investigating potential causal relationships between metabolic and vascular risk factors, disinhibited eating, and executive dysfunction may provide insight into effective intervention targets to prevent MetS."
https://openalex.org/W3158850297,"Background There are limited published data on factors related to risky sexual practices (RSP) affecting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in Ecuador. Methods Cross-sectional study of FSWs presenting for a consultation in a primary health care centre during 2017. A questionnaire was administered to collect information on RSP and potential risk factors including age, membership of an FSW association, self-report of previous STI diagnosis, previous treatment for suspected STI and temporary migration for sex work. Associations between RSP and potential risk factors were estimated by logistic regression. The proportion of STI was estimated from vaginal swabs by real-time PCR for four sexually transmitted pathogens ( Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Trichomonas vaginalis , Chlamydia trachomatis , and Mycoplasma genitalium) . Results Of 249 FSWs recruited, 22.5% had reported RSPs at least once during sex work. Among FSWs reporting unprotected vaginal sex in the previous three months, 25.5% had at least one other RSP type. 17.6% (95%CI 13.3–22.8) had at least one active STI. Prevalence of co-infections was 2.4% (95%CI 1.1–5.2). In multivariable analysis, RSP was associated with age (adjusted OR 1.06; 95%CI 1.02–1.10), membership of an FSWs association (aOR 3.51; 95%CI 1.60–7.72) and self-reported previous STI (aOR 3.43; 95%CI 1.28–9.17). Conclusions Among a population of female sex workers with high proportion of STIs, increasing age and belonging to an FSWs association was associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in RSP with clients. Engaging with FSWs organisations may reduce the burden of STI among sex workers."

All the subjects underwent confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), SS-OCT and SS-OCTA examinations.SS-OCT analysis revealed a lower macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with NF1 compared with those with suspected NF1 (95.0±15.9 vs 109.7±11.3 μm; P = 0.001) and control subjects (106.8±14.4 μm, P = 0.003). Retinal thickness was significantly lower in NF1 patients compared to those with suspected NF1 (280.7±23.0 vs 304.2±15.3 μm; P < 0.001) and control subjects (298.7±23.8 μm, P = 0.003). The mean vascular flow area of the SCP was significantly higher in patients with NF1 (42.6±2.2%) and suspected NF1 (43.1±2.5%) compared to control subjects (41.0±2.0%; respectively, P = 0.017 and P = 0.002). In the second choroidal layer, the flow area was significantly lower in patients with NF1 compared to control subjects (45.4±4.8 vs 49.0±4.0%,; P = 0.011).Retinal thicknesses alterations and choroidal nodules are described as ocular manifestations in patients with NF1. In addition, OCTA could represent an important novel advanced imaging technique, capable of detecting early altered retinal and choroidal vascular flow area in patients with NF1."
https://openalex.org/W3137639199,"Grafting experiments have shown that photoperiod-dependent induction of tuberisation in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is controlled by multiple overlapping signals, including mobile proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs and phytohormones. The effect of vegetative organs and tubers at metabolite level and vice versa, however, has not been studied in detail in potato. To unravel the influence of vegetative organs on the primary polar metabolite content of potato tubers and the effect of tuberisation on the metabolite content of leaves grafting experiments were carried out. Two potato cultivars, Hópehely (HP) and White Lady (WL), were homo- and hetero-grafted, and the effects of grafting were investigated in comparison to non-grafted controls. Non-targeted metabolite analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the major difference between HP and WL tubers is in sucrose concentration. The sucrose level was higher in HP than in WL tubers and was not changed by grafting, suggesting that the sucrose concentration of tubers is genetically determined. The galactinol level was 8-fold higher in the WL leaves than in the HP leaves and, unlike the sucrose concentration of tubers, was altered by grafting. A positive correlation between the growth rate of the leaves and the time of tuber initiation was detected. The time of tuber initiation was delayed in the WL rootstocks by HP scions and shortened in the HP rootstocks by WL scions, supporting the previous finding that tuberisation is triggered by source-derived mobile signals."
https://openalex.org/W3157275741,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest progressive neurodegenerative condition in humans, and is currently incurable. A wide spectrum of comorbidities, including other neurodegenerative diseases, are frequently associated with AD. How AD interacts with those comorbidities can be examined by analysing gene expression patterns in affected tissues using bioinformatics tools. We surveyed public data repositories for available gene expression data on tissue from AD subjects and from people affected by neurodegenerative diseases that are often found as comorbidities with AD. We then utilized large set of gene expression data, cell-related data and other public resources through an analytical process to identify functional disease links. This process incorporated gene set enrichment analysis and utilized semantic similarity to give proximity measures. We identified genes with abnormal expressions that were common to AD and its comorbidities, as well as shared gene ontology terms and molecular pathways. Our methodological pipeline was implemented in the R platform as an open-source package and available at the following link: https://github.com/unchowdhury/AD_comorbidity. The pipeline was thus able to identify factors and pathways that may constitute functional links between AD and these common comorbidities by which they affect each others development and progression. This pipeline can also be useful to identify key pathological factors and therapeutic targets for other diseases and disease interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3159654577,"Insect outbreaks usually involve important ecological and economic consequences for agriculture and forestry. The short-winged bush-cricket Barbitistes vicetinus Galvagni &amp; Fontana, 1993 is a recently described species that was considered rare until ten years ago, when unexpected population outbreaks causing severe defoliations across forests and crops were observed in north-eastern Italy. A genetic approach was used to analyse the origin of outbreak populations. The analysis of two mitochondrial regions (Cytochrome Oxidase I and II and 12S rRNA-Control Region) of 130 samples from the two disjunct ranges (Euganean and Berici Hills) showed high values of haplotype diversity and revealed a high geographical structure among populations of the two ranges. The high genetic variability observed supports the native origin of this species. In addition, results suggest that unexpected outbreaks are not a consequence of a single or few pestiferous haplotypes but rather the source of outbreaks are local populations which have experienced an increase in each area. The recent outbreaks have probably appeared independently of the genetic haplotypes whereas environmental conditions could have affected the outbreak populations. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of the status and evolutionary history of the pest that would be useful for developing and implementing biological control strategies for example by maximizing efforts to locate native natural enemies."
https://openalex.org/W3157709696,"Remnants of native tallgrass prairie experience elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in urban areas, with potential effects on species traits that are important for N cycling and species composition. We quantified bulk (primarily wet) inorganic N (NH4+-N + NO3--N) deposition at six sites along an urban development gradient (6-64% urban) in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area from April 2014 to October 2015. In addition, we conducted a phytometer experiment with two common native prairie bunchgrass species--one well studied (Schizachyrium scoparium) and one little studied (Nasella leucotricha)--to investigate ambient N deposition effects on plant biomass and tissue quality. Bulk inorganic N deposition ranged from 6.1-9.9 kg ha-1 yr-1, peaked in spring, and did not vary consistently with proportion of urban land within 10 km of the sites. Total (wet + dry) inorganic N deposition estimated using bulk deposition measured in this study and modeled dry deposition was 12.9-18.2 kg ha-1 yr-1. Although the two plant species studied differ in photosynthetic pathway, biomass, and tissue N, they exhibited a maximum 2-3-fold and 2-4-fold increase in total biomass and total plant N, respectively, with 1.6-fold higher bulk N deposition. In addition, our findings indicate that while native prairie grasses may exhibit a positive biomass response to increased N deposition up to ~18 kg ha-1 yr-1, total inorganic N deposition is well above the estimated critical load for herbaceous plant species richness in the tallgrass prairie of the Great Plains ecoregion and thus may negatively affect these plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W3157852880,"We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the rates at which population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence in the predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3158146629,"The ESCRT pathway is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and plays key roles in a variety of membrane remodeling processes. A new Drosophila mutant recovered in our forward genetic screens for synaptic transmission mutants mapped to the vps24 gene encoding a subunit of the ESCRT-III complex. Molecular characterization indicated a loss of VPS24 function, however the mutant is viable and thus loss of VPS24 may be studied in a developed multicellular organism. The mutant exhibits deficits in locomotion and lifespan and, notably, these phenotypes are rescued by neuronal expression of wild-type VPS24. At the cellular level, neuronal and muscle cells exhibit marked expansion of a ubiquitin-positive lysosomal compartment, as well as accumulation of autophagic intermediates, and these phenotypes are rescued cell-autonomously. Moreover, VPS24 expression in glia suppressed the mutant phenotype in muscle, indicating a cell-nonautonomous function for VPS24 in protective intercellular signaling. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons and muscle indicated marked accumulation of the lysosomal compartment in the vps24 mutant. In the neuronal cell body, this included characteristic lysosomal structures associated with an expansive membrane compartment with a striking tubular network morphology. These findings further define the in vivo roles of VPS24 and the ESCRT pathway in lysosome homeostasis and their potential contributions to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by defective ESCRT or lysosome function."
https://openalex.org/W3158269693,"The mixture level of gum samples consisting of two colours can be assessed visually, using the electronic colorimetric method, employing digital image processing techniques and specially designed software. The study investigates the possibility of an alternative method called ""digital texture image analysis"" (DTIA) to assess improvement of masticatory efficiency in denture wearers. The objectives were i) to evaluate whether DTIA discriminates changes in the colour mixing ability within a group over time; ii) to determine whether DTIA can be used to detect improvement in chewing ability; iii) to select the most appropriate DTIA feature that sufficiently describes masticatory efficiency in CDs wearers. The study was designed as an intra-individual evaluation of masticatory efficiency, which was assessed in participants with new dentures in three follow-up times. A set of four texture features was used in the current study. Uniformity, Contrast, Homogeneity and Entropy of the obtained chewing-gum samples were correlated to the degree of gum comminution. A statistically significant difference in masticatory efficiency was observed based on the values of the analysed DTIA variables of gum samples-Uniformity, Contrast, Homogeneity, and Entropy-have changed in the participants during the observation period. The improvement of the masticatory function in relation to the mixing ability of two-coloured chewing gum could be traced by monitoring changes in the values of DTIA variables. The most increasement of masticatory efficiency was observed by monitoring DTIA parameters such as contrast, and homogeneity."

Oncology clinics lack practical, objective tools for simultaneous evaluation of cancer and major depression. Fludeoxyglucose F-18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) is universally applied in modern medicine.We used a retrospective analysis of whole-body FDG PET/CT images to identify brain regional metabolic patterns of major depression in multiple myeloma patients. The study included 134 multiple myeloma (MM) patients, 38 with major depression (group 1) and 96 without major depression (group 2).In the current study, Statistic Parameter Mapping (SPM) demonstrated that the major depression patient group (n = 38) had significant regional metabolic differences (clusters of continuous voxels) as compared to the non-major depression group (n = 96) with the criteria of height threshold T = 4.38 and extent threshold > 100 voxels. The five significant hypo- and three hyper-metabolic clusters from the computed T contrast maps were localized on the glass-brain view, consistent with published brain metabolic changes in major depression patients. Subsequently, using these clusters as features for classification learner, the fine tree and medium tree algorithms from 25 classification algorithms best fitted our data (accuracy 0.85%; AUC 0.88; sensitivity 79%; and specificity 88%).This study demonstrated that whole-body FDG PET/CT scans could provide added value for screening for major depression in cancer patients in addition to staging and evaluating response to chemoradiation therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3157905788,"Natural regeneration is less expensive than tree planting, but determining what species will arrive and establish to serve as templates for tropical forest restoration remains poorly investigated in eastern Africa. This study summarises seedling recruitment under 29 isolated legacy trees (14 trees comprised of three exotic species and 15 trees comprised of seven native species) in tea plantations in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Among the findings were that pioneer recruits were very abundant whereas non-pioneers were disproportionately fewer. Importantly, 98% of all recruits were animal-dispersed. The size of legacy trees, driven mostly by the exotic Grevillea robusta, and to some extent, the native Milicia excelsa, explained abundance of recruits. The distribution of bird-dispersed recruits suggested that some bird species use all types of legacy trees equally in this fragmented landscape. In contrast, the distribution of bat-dispersed recruits provided strong evidence that seedling composition differed under native versus exotic legacy trees likely due to fruit bats showing more preference for native legacy trees. Native, as compared to exotic legacy trees, had almost two times more non-pioneer recruits, with Ficus and Milicia excelsa driving this trend. Implications of our findings regarding restoration in the tropics are numerous for the movement of native animal-dispersed tree species in fragmented and disturbed tropical forests surrounded by farmland. Isolated native trees that bear fleshy fruits can attract more frugivores, resulting not only in high recruitment under them, but depending on the dispersal mode of the legacy trees, also different suites of recruited species. When selecting tree species for plantings, to maximize visitation by different dispersal agents and to enhance seedling recruit diversity, bat-dispersed Milicia excelsa and Ficus species are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3158025126,"Evidence points to past bee-mediated crop pollination deficits in Chanthaburi province, Eastern Thailand. Conversely, no such evidence has yet been reported for Chiang Mai province (Northern Thailand), suggesting that wild pollination is delivered there above the requirements of local orchards. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) were conducted to elicit the preferences of pollinator-dependent orchard farmers with regard to three pollinator conservation measures and their possible effects on of native bee populations in each region. We fitted random parameter logit (RPL) models on the resulting data to capture preference heterogeneity and to obtain willingness to pay (WTP) point estimates. To test our results' robustness, we also inspected for scale heterogeneity by fitting generalized mixed logit (GMXL) models on the pooled and individual datasets. This yielded WTP space estimates (i.e., directly from WTP distributions) and made possible the comparison of farmers' preferences for a native bee conservation policy in both regions. The results hint at significant WTP differences for some of the conservation policy attributes between both provinces. Furthermore, unobserved contributions to choice seem to have been more random in Chiang Mai. Our analyses also suggest that farmers who engage in bee-related activities are WTP more for a conservation policy that includes bee husbandry."
https://openalex.org/W3158414619,"As the Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, multiple therapies are rapidly being evaluated for efficacy in clinical trials. Clinical trials should be racially and ethnically representative of the population that will eventually benefit from these medications. There are multiple potential barriers to racial and ethnic minority enrollment in clinical trials, one of which could be that inclusion and exclusion criteria select for certain racial or ethnic groups disproportionately. In this observational cohort study at a single health care system, we examined if there were differences in eligibility for treatment with remdesivir based on clinical trial criteria for racial and ethnic minorities compared to non-Hispanic Whites. 201 electronic medical record charts were reviewed manually. Self-identified Whites were older than other racial or ethnic groups. At the time of presentation, Black, Latinx, and White participants met inclusion criteria for remdesivir at similar rates (72%, 80%, and 73% respectively), and exclusion criteria at similar rates (43%, 38% and 49% for Black, Latinx and White participants respectively). In this study, there was no difference in eligibility for remdesivir based on race or ethnicity alone."
https://openalex.org/W3158862899,"The structure of barley varieties were studied, using structured and semi-structured queries, at Legambo, Tenta and Worailu districts of South Wollo, Ethiopia. Eight local barley varieties (Belg, Ginbot, Sene/Nech, Tikur, Holker, Traveler Tegadime and Temezhi) were identified, and got their names found on seed color and planting season. According to farmers, Tegadime is the production leader among all, but the source of seeds and the market chain are the limiting factors for its popularity and this is why it's not famous is because of the low price of the seed. Thus, Sene/Nech found to be popular and shared 46.91% at Tenta, 48.47% at Legambo and 51.55% at Wereilu followed by Tikur and Ginbote. High barley diversity was noted at Tenta (E = 0.773) followed by Wereilu (E = 0.678) and Legambo (E = 0.606). Sene/Nech (0.67), Belg (0.62), Tegadime (0.59), Tikur (0.55) and Ginbote (0.54) were found to be shared, but Traveler, Holker and Temezhi were rarely found. At farm, most farmers were plowing twice before sowing using horse. Biological fertilizer usages were well practice at Tenta, Legambo and Were'ilu, respectively. While, inorganic fertilizer usage was better at Wereilu, but none at Legambo. Pest management was better at Wereilu and hand weeding is a common system, but low at Legambo, and mowing by sickle, threshing by horse and store in Gotera were a shared practice. Farmers use outdated tools for agricultural practice and the yield is losing due to unavailable of update machinery. So, different managing approaches and new harvesting technologies should address."
https://openalex.org/W3159013677,"No studies have been found that analyzed the probabilities of high-level athletes according to gender for accessing programs that promote the professionalization of sports, and participation and success in the OG in Spain. This could explain the gender differences in these parameters and the trend towards more egalitarian data in recent years. The objective of this study was to analyze the probabilities of Spanish high-level athletes for participating and achieving sporting success in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games (OG). Data relating to a sample of 3757 high-level Spanish athletes (2398 men and 1359 women) between 2005 and 2016 were examined. The variables of gender, having obtained a scholarship from the Association of Olympic Athletes (ADO) program, training in a High Performance Center (CAR), participation and performance in the OG were analyzed. It was found that high-level female athletes were more likely than male athletes to belong to the ADO program (χ2 = 26,151; r* = 0.083; p = 0,000) and CAR (χ2 = 13,847; r* = 0.061; p = 0,000), and to qualify for an OG (χ2 = 22,838; r* = 0,078; p = 0,000), the same trend was found in the three Olympic cycles analyzed. With respect to the results in the OG, in general, no differences were found according to gender, although women were more likely to be finalists (χ2 = 4,406; r* = 0.071; p = 0,036), and more prominently in the 2016 OG (16.118; r* = 0.228; p = 0.000). The same applies to winning a medal (χ2 = 5.939; r* = 0.145; p = 0.015), more specifically bronze at the 2012 OG (χ2 = 6.215; r* = 0.149; p = 0.013). In conclusion, high-level female athletes in Spain have a higher percentage of access to high-level athlete support programs such as ADO and CAR, as well as participation in OG."
https://openalex.org/W3159238954,"Standardized instruments are often used to monitor one's progress in tinnitus relief although they were developed to screen and diagnose tinnitus. The need for the development for a tinnitus outcome assessment tool is high in the field of audiology and otolaryngology. The purpose of this study was to develop a tinnitus outcome questionnaire for sound management (listening to sound stimuli for tinnitus relief) and assess its content validity. A total of 32 questions with six domains (Tinnitus characteristics, the impact of tinnitus, tinnitus and hearing issues, handedness, tinnitus management, and sound management outcome) were generated after closely investigating major tinnitus questionnaires used worldwide (i.e. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire) as well as literature. Ten healthcare professionals evaluated the appropriateness of the questionnaire items on a five-point Likert scale, where 1 is strongly inappropriate and 5 is strongly appropriate. Content relevance was assessed by computing the content validity index with the cut-off value of 0.75. Each response was first weighted as follows: 1 = 0; 2 = 0.25; 3 = 0.5; 4 = 0.75; and 5 = 1.0. The weighted average was then calculated. Items with a content validity index less than 0.75 were discarded and some items were revised according to the experts' feedback. As a result, 31 out of the 32 items had the content validity index higher than 0.75, indicating that the items are appropriate to obtain information about the six domains. Reflecting the experts' feedback, some questions were revised to be more specific. The study provides a baseline structure regarding potential questions to be included in a tinnitus outcome questionnaire for sound management. Development and standardization of such questionnaire would be a pathway to validating tinnitus relief via sound therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3150640697,"Background This is the first study, of which we are aware, to evaluate the feasibility and accessibility of simultaneous use of Global Positioning System (GPS) and saliva collection for biomarker assessment as an objective measure of stress physiology among sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other non-heterosexual identities) individuals. The principal motivation for pairing GPS and saliva collection was to investigate how characteristics of the built and social environments along with participants’ daily activity paths affect stress. This can contribute to a better understanding of health and health behaviors in the sexual minority community. Methods A convenience sample of enrolled participants (N = 124) from Houston, Texas was asked to complete questionnaires, carry with them a GPS unit daily, and collect and store 6 samples of saliva at specific times across the span of a day prior to a second visit around one week later. Results Of 124 participants, 16 participants (12.90%) provided no useable GPS data and 98 (79.03%) provided at least 4 days of data. More than three-fourths (n = 98, 79.03%) also provided complete saliva samples. Conclusions Our results show that the simultaneous use of GPS and saliva collection to assess sexual minority individuals’ activity paths and stress level is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W3158043366,"The African oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis Jacq) is a crop that is widely distributed in tropical regions around the world; however, this crop is subject to limitations such as rapid trunk growth and susceptibility to bud rot and red ring diseases particularly in South America. To overcome these limitations, national breeding and conservation programs have been established, and there is a need to identify parental palms from natural populations of the American oil palm ( E . oleifera H.B.K. Cortes) with desirable yield and morphological traits (i.e., yield production and bunch number) and with high genetic diversity. However, in Peru the morphological and genetic data related to this important crop is limited. In this study, we characterized the morphological and yield and estimated the genetic diversity using 12 neutral microsatellite markers (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) across 72 oil palm individuals belonging to the E . oleifera germplasm collection located in the tropical region of Ucayali, Peru. Our results showed that morphological and yield traits explained approximately 40.39% of the variability within the Peruvian germplasm. Furthermore, Yield Production was highly correlated with two yield traits: Bunch Number (0.67) and Average weight per bunch (0.78). Based on the yield and morphological traits, a clustering analysis was performed and three phenotypic groups were identified (1, 2 and 3) in which groups 1 and 3 showed high scores associated primarily with yield traits. Microsatellite markers revealed 143 alleles, 11.92 ± 4.72 alleles per locus (A) and an expected heterozygosity (He) of 0.69 ± 0.045. A structural analysis identified three populations ( k = 3), that were not related to the phenotypic groups. Interestingly, a multiple allele background was identified within the groups using multilocus and phylogenetic relationship analyses. This is the first Peruvian report regarding E . oleifera that shows preliminary data of the morphological and yield traits and genetic data, and highlight the importance of this information to set up future steps to national breeding strategies and improve the conservation of genetic material of E . oleifera . Overall, these novel findings could contribute to the development of the local oil palm industry in Peru."
https://openalex.org/W3159198821,"DNA transposons are defined as repeated DNA sequences that can move within the host genome through the action of transposases. The transposon superfamily Merlin was originally found mainly in animal genomes. Here, we describe a global distribution of the Merlin in animals, fungi, plants and protists, reporting for the first time their presence in Rhodophyceae, Metamonada, Discoba and Alveolata. We identified a great variety of potentially active Merlin families, some containing highly imperfect terminal inverted repeats and internal tandem repeats. Merlin -related sequences with no evidence of mobilization capacity were also observed and may be products of domestication. The evolutionary trees support that Merlin is likely an ancient superfamily, with early events of diversification and secondary losses, although repeated re-invasions probably occurred in some groups, which would explain its diversity and discontinuous distribution. We cannot rule out the possibility that the Merlin superfamily is the product of multiple horizontal transfers of related prokaryotic insertion sequences. Moreover, this is the first account of a DNA transposon in kinetoplastid flagellates, with conserved Merlin transposase identified in Bodo saltans and Perkinsela sp., whereas it is absent in trypanosomatids. Based on the level of conservation of the transposase and overlaps of putative open reading frames with Merlin , we propose that in protists it may serve as a raw material for gene emergence."
